    10.1109/JIOT.2018.2844296 Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has found its application in several areas, such
    as connected industry, smart-city [1], [2], smart-home [3] smart-energy, connected
    car [4], smart-agriculture [5], connected building and campus [6], health care
    [7], logistics [8], among other domains. IoT aims to integrate the physical world
    with the virtual world by using the Internet as the medium to communicate and
    exchange information [9]. IoT has been defined as a system of interrelated computing
    devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people that are
    provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network
    without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. A key area
    of interest in this paper is the application of IoT in agriculture. The world
    population is estimated to be about 9.7 billion in 2050, as such there will be
    great demand for food. This coupled with the diminishing natural resources, arable
    land, unpredictable weather conditions make food security a major concern for
    most countries. The world is turning to the use of IoT combined with data analytics
    (DA) to meet the world’s food demands in the coming years [10]. It is predicted
    that IoT device installations in the agriculture sector will increase from 30
    million in 2015 to 75 million by 2020. The use of IoT and DA will enable smart
    agriculture which is expected to deliver high operational efficiency and high
    yield [11], [12]. Over the years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has been deployed
    for smart agriculture and food production with a focus on environmental monitoring,
    precision agriculture, machine and process control automation and traceability
    [13]–[18]. The capability of WSN to self-organize, self-configure, self-diagnosis,
    and self-heal has made it a good choice for smart agriculture and the food industry.
    The WSN is a system that comprise of radio frequency (RF) transceivers, sensors,
    microcontrollers and power sources [13]. However, with the emergency of IoT there
    has been a paradigm shift from the use of WSN for smart agriculture to IoT as
    the major driver of smart agriculture. The IoT integrates several technologies
    that already exist, such as WSN, RF identification, cloud computing, middleware
    systems and end-user applications [19]. The application of IoT in agriculture
    is about empowering farmers with the decision tools and automation technologies
    that seamlessly integrate products, knowledge and services for better productivity,
    quality, and profit. Recent surveys on the IoT in agriculture have focused on
    the challenges and constraints for large-scale pilots in entire supply chain in
    the agrifood sector [5], [20]. Some of the key issues addressed are the need for
    new business models, security and privacy, and data governance and ownership solution.
    Other related survey on smart agriculture have largely focused on the use of WSNs
    [21]. While these survey papers deal with the application of sensor technology
    and challenges in the application of IoT to the food supply chain, the communication
    technology were limited to conventional methods which employs low range communication
    technologies. In this paper, an extensive review of IoT in agriculture is carried
    out. The review includes a survey of published articles, white paper and existing
    solutions. The IoT ecosystem for agriculture is discussed in detail based on four
    major components which are IoT devices, communication technology, Internet, data
    storage, and processing. The application of IoT and DA and how it is enabling
    smart agriculture is presented. Furthermore, the benefits, challenges, open issues,
    future trends and opportunities are discussed. The organization of this paper
    is presented as follows. In Section II, the IoT ecosystem for agriculture, which
    consist of four major components: a) IoT devices; b) communication technology;
    c) Internet; and d) data are presented. Section III covers the classification
    of IoT application in agriculture. Key areas are considered: a) monitoring; b)
    tracking and tracing; c) agricultural machinery; d) precision agriculture; and
    e) greenhouse production. Section IV discusses the importance of IoT and DA. Six
    key areas are considered which are: a) prediction; b) storage management; c) decision
    making; d) farm management; e) precision farming; and f) insurance. In Section
    V, the benefits are highlighted. These include the use of IoT to promote community
    farming, safety and fraud prevention, competitive advantages, wealth creation,
    cost reduction, operational efficiency, awareness, and asset management. Section
    VI discusses several open issues and key challenges in the adoption of IoT in
    agriculture. The issues are identified and discussed under three main categories:
    a) business; b) technical; and c) sectoral. Section VII takes a look at the future
    trends and opportunities. Section VIII finally concludes this paper. SECTION II.
    IoT Ecosystem In this section, an overview of the IoT ecosystem for agriculture
    is presented. It consists of four major components which are: 1) IoT devices;
    2) communication technology; 3) Internet; and 4) data storage and processing.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the IoT ecosystem. The four major components are essential
    for any IoT application. The description of the IoT components as it relates to
    agriculture is provided as follows. Fig. 1. Illustration of IoT ecosystem for
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Devices The IoT devices consist of embedded systems
    which interacts with sensors and actuators and requires wireless connectivity.
    These IoT devices are sometimes referred to as IoT sensors. Throughout this paper
    it is referred to as IoT device. The architecture of a typical IoT device for
    agriculture is shown in Fig. 2. The embedded system consists of field programmable
    gate arrays or microprocessor, communication modules, memory and input/output
    interfaces. Fig. 2. Architecture of IoT device. Show All The sensors are used
    to monitor and to measure different farm variables (example soil nutrients, weather
    data) and factors that affect production. The sensors can be classified into location
    sensors, optical sensors, mechanical sensors, electrochemical sensors, and airflow
    sensors [22]. These sensors are used to gather information, such as air temperature,
    soil temperature at various depths, rainfall, leaf wetness, chlorophyll, wind
    speed, dew point temperature, wind direction, relative humidity, solar radiation,
    and atmospheric pressure. Table I provides a summary of some of the sensors and
    their applications. There are key characteristics of IoT device that makes them
    suitable for agriculture purposes. They are: 1) power efficiency; 2) memory; 3)
    computational efficiency; 4) portability; 5) durability; 6) coverage; 7) reliability;
    and 8) cost. TABLE I Summary of Agriculture Sensors B. Communication Technology
    The communication technology plays a key role in the successful deployment of
    IoT systems. The existing communication technology can be classified based on
    standards, spectrum, and application scenarios. The communication standard can
    be grouped into short-range communication standard and long-range communication
    standard. The communication spectrum can be grouped into licensed and unlicensed
    spectrum. The IoT devices application scenarios can be based on sensors or backhaul
    network, and deployment scenarios [23]. 1) Spectrum: The unlicensed spectrum makes
    use of industrial scientific and medical RF band known as ISM band. The drawback
    to the use of the unlicensed spectrum are security issues, cost of infrastructure,
    and interference. Electromagnetic interference is generated by ISM IoT devices
    that interrupts radio communications that use the same frequency. On the other
    hand, the licensed spectrum which are allocated to the cellular network offers
    more efficient traffic management, less interference, better reliability, increased
    quality of service (QoS), high level of security, wider coverage and lesser cost
    of infrastructure to the users. The drawback to the use of licensed spectrum is
    cost of subscription for data transmission and transmit power consumption on the
    IoT devices. 2) Standard: There are so many existing standards for wireless communications,
    some of which have been listed in Table II. They can be classified into short-range
    and long-range communication standards. Examples of the short-range standards
    are near field communications-enabled devices, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, passive
    and active radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. The short-range standards
    can cover distances within 100 m. The long-range communication standards can cover
    distances up to 10 s of kilometers. The long-range communication standards are
    classified as the low power wide area (LPWA) (examples are LoRa, Sigfox, NB-IoT).
    The LPWA makes use of low power and can cover wide area [24], [25]. TABLE II Communication
    Technology 3) Application Scenario: The choice of communication technology also
    depends on applications of the IoT device. The communication technology can either
    be used for IoT devices that acts as nodes or as backhaul networks. The nodes
    transmit low data and cover very short distances with low power consumption. The
    backhaul network supports high data rates and can be used for very long distances.
    Some of the communication technologies support bi-directional link. The bi-directional
    link allows for forward error correction, handshaking for data reliability, encryption
    of data, over-the-air firmware updates, and communication between devices. In
    [26], the comparison of LoRa and NB-IoT shows that each technology has its advantages
    and disadvantages hence the most appropriate technology depends on the application.
    Furthermore, the choice of communication technology for the IoT device also depends
    on the type of topology to be deployed. There are different types of topology,
    such as peer-to-peer (P2P) or line, star, mesh, ring, tree, and bus topology.
    In each of these topologies, an IoT device plays different roles and different
    functions.1 The role can either be a personal area coordinator (PAN) or as an
    end device. The functions can be full function device (FFD) or a reduced function
    device (RFD). Fig. 3 illustrates two types of topologies and roles played. In
    the P2P topology, the PAN functions as FFD and starts the communication while
    the end devices can either function as an FFD or RFD. The end device which acts
    as FFD can have multiple connections while the end device that acts as RFD can
    only connect to one FFD and cannot connect to another RFD. The star topology consists
    of PAN that initiates the communication and accepts connection from other devices.
    The end devices can only establish connections with the PAN coordinator. Fig.
    3. Topology. (a) Peer-to-peer. (b) Star. Show All C. Internet The advancement
    in the field of wireless communication systems, mobile devices, and ubiquitous
    services has paved way for massive connectivity to the Internet. According to
    Machina research report, the number of connected agricultural devices is expected
    to grow from 13 million at the end of 2014 to 225 million by 2024 [27]. The Internet
    forms the core network layer, where paths are provided to carry and exchange data
    and network information between multiple subnetworks. The connection of IoT devices
    to the Internet enables data to be available anywhere and anytime. However, the
    transfer of data via the Internet requires adequate security, support of real
    time data and ease of accessibility. The Internet has paved way for cloud computing,
    where large data are gathered for storage and processing. Cloud computing involves
    the management of user interface, services, organizing and coordinating of network
    nodes, computing, and processing data [28]. To achieve the connectivity of heterogeneous
    systems and devices over the Internet, IoT middleware and connectivity protocols
    are being developed. Examples of the IoT middleware is the service-oriented architecture
    (SOA), cloud-based IoT middleware and actor-based IoT middleware which have been
    applied to support IoT [29], [30]. The SOA for IoT consist of multilayer architecture.
    Some of the proposed IoT architecture consist of the following layers: sensing,
    accessing, networking, middleware, and application layers. We refer readers to
    [29], [31], and [32] and the references therein for more details on the IoT architecture
    and technology. D. Data Storage and Processing Units Data driven agriculture involves
    the collection of enormous, dynamic, complex, and spatial data, which requires
    storage and processing [33]. The complexity of the data can range from structured
    to nonstructured data [11], [34] which can be in the form of text, images, audio,
    and video. The data can range from historical data, sensor data, live streamed
    data, business, and market related data. The use of cloud IoT platforms allow
    for big data collected from sensors to be stored in the cloud. This includes hosting
    of application that are critical in providing services and to manage end-to-end
    IoT architecture. Recently, edge or fog computing is advocated, where IoT devices
    and gateways carry out computation and analysis in order to reduce latency for
    critical applications, reduce cost and promote QoS [35], [36]. There are several
    agriculture management information systems that have been developed to manage
    the various forms of data [33]. Examples of some of the commercially available
    platforms are Onfarm systems, Farmobile, the silent herdsman platform, Cropx [37],
    Farmx [38], Easyfarm [39], KAA [40], and Farmlogs [41]. This platforms provide
    data storage, data management, and DA. Table III provides a summary of IoT solutions
    for agriculture. TABLE III Examples of IoT Solutions for Agriculture E. Summary
    In the deployment of IoT device, there are key technical parameters that needs
    to be considered. For wireless connectivity, the following parameters should be
    considered: the range of communication distance, data rate, battery life, mobility,
    latency, security and resilience, and cost of gateway modems. Among the communication
    technology, the LPWA is attracting so much interest [47] especially with the emergence
    of NB-IoT. The NB-IoT promises interesting features which include low device power
    consumption, ultralow device cost, simpler to implement, support of a massive
    number of low-throughput devices, long distance coverage and can support upload
    and download of data [48], [49]. There are several use cases of IoT in agriculture
    which have adopted the use of the IoT ecosystems discussed in this section. Some
    of these applications are discussed in Section III. SECTION III. Application of
    IoT in Agriculture There are several examples of application of IoT in agriculture.
    Examples of such use case are crop and livestock [50], [51], machinery [52], irrigation
    and water quality monitoring [53]–[60], weather monitoring [61], soil monitoring
    [61], [62], disease and pest control [63], [64], automation and precision [65].
    The application of IoT is discussed based on the following functions: monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, precision agriculture, and greenhouse
    production. A. Monitoring In agriculture several factors can be monitored, these
    factors depend on the sector of agriculture under considerations. The key factors
    to be monitored are highlighted and discussed as follows. 1) Crop Farming: In
    crop farming, there are several environmental factors that affect farm produce.
    Acquiring such data help to understand the patterns and process of the farm. Such
    data includes, the amount of rainfall, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, salinity, climate, dry circle, solar radiation, pest movement, human
    activities, etc. [66]. The acquisition of such detailed record enables optimal
    decision making to improve the quality of the farm produce, minimize risk, and
    maximize profits. For instance, the solar radiation data gives information about
    the plants exposure to sunlight from, where the farmer can identify if the plants
    are properly exposed or over exposed. The soil moisture content gives information
    on the dampness of the soil which can help in controlling soil conditions and
    reduce the risk of plant diseases. Furthermore, timely and accurate weather forecasting
    data, such as, climatic changes and rainfall, can improve the productivity level.
    In addition, such data can help farmers in the planning stage and reduce the cost
    of labor. The farmers can also take corrective and preventive measures in advance
    based on the data provided. The pest movement data can be collected and remotely
    fed live to the farmers for pest control or used to provide advice to the farmers
    based on record tracking of pest attacks [67]. 2) Aquaponics: Aquaponics is the
    combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, where fish wastes are fed into plant
    farms to provide the essential nutrients required by the plants. In such farms,
    it is important to constantly monitor the water quality, water level, temperature
    levels, health of the fishes, salinity, pH level, humidity, and sunlight [68].
    The accurate data can improve the fish and plants yield as it allows nutrients
    transfer between the plants and fish. The data can also be used for automation
    purposes with less human intervention. 3) Forestry: Forestry plays an important
    role in the carbon cycle, and also harbor over two-thirds of world known species.
    The factors to be monitored in a forest includes; soil and air temperatures and
    humidity, and the different levels of gases, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
    toluene, oxygen, hydrogen, methane, isobutane, ammonia, ethanol, hydrogen sulphide,
    and nitrogen dioxide [69]. These parameters can provide early warning and alert
    systems against veld fire in the forest and also help to monitor against diseases.
    4) Livestock Farming: The factors to be monitored in livestock depends on the
    types of animals under consideration [70]. For example, the conductivity of milk
    from buffaloes and cows can give information about the health state of the animals.
    Other factors are temperature, humidity, yield, pest attack, and water quality.
    The deployment and implementation solution also allow farmers to track and query
    the location of their livestock by tagging individual animal with RFID device,
    thereby preventing animal theft. Other areas, such as storage monitoring which
    includes water, fuel, and animals feeds can also be monitored, and the data can
    help the farmers to plan ahead and save cost. While several solutions have been
    provided in the area of monitoring, the adoption in small and medium scale farms
    are very much limited especially in developing countries due to lack of awareness
    and deployment cost. The potential to develop cost effective agricultural base
    IoT solutions is still a very open area. B. Tracking and Tracing IoT can also
    be applied in asset tracking to improve companies supply chain and logistics.
    IoT can provide data to enable agricultural companies to make better decisions,
    planning, intelligently connect with business partners, and save time and money.
    Information, such as location, asset identification can be tracked using RFID
    and cloud-based global positioning system (GPS) [8]. Tracking and tracing of agricultural
    product chain allows the consumer to know the complete history of the product,
    thereby improving the consumer’s trust on the product safety and health related
    issues. While tracking is the ability to capture, collect, and store data related
    to the supply chain from upstream to downstream, tracing allows the product to
    be distinguished from downstream to upstream. Tracking and tracing allows several
    data to be collected along the supply chain such that the consumer and other stakeholders
    are guaranteed on the origin, location, and life history of a product [71], [72].
    There are several factors that can be tracked which include the growing environment,
    production conditions, pest factors, management factors, storage conditions, transportation,
    and time to market. These factors can also pose direct or potential health risk
    to consumers. The significant factors which affects the growing environment are
    the soil, air, and water. The production conditions are influenced by the application
    of herbicides, fertilizers, pesticides. In addition, the type of feeds and vaccines
    administered to livestock can be tracked since they could directly cause health
    safety issues. Agricultural products can generally be affected by pest along the
    entire process, which could affect the quantity and quality of the product, tracking
    the products can help the farmers to improve the production and supply chain.
    A tracking and tracing systems should basically include: information input, storage,
    transfer, process, and output. The input information includes the data of the
    entire life cycle of the product, the geographical origin, the current position,
    destination, and the stakeholders involved in the entire supply chain [73]. The
    systems should also include memory to store the information over a period of time
    for research and development purposes. The information transfer refers to the
    process of unifying and standardizing the entire information. The tracking and
    tracing system should also be able to process the data collected and finally output
    it to everyone involved along the supply chain. The use of RFID in tracking from
    the production stage, processing, transportation, storage, distribution, sales
    and after sales services is highlighted in [74]. It provides the ability to collect,
    store, and analyze data over a long distance at a quick speed. C. Agricultural
    Machinery IoT-based agricultural machinery can help improve crop productivity
    and reduce grain losses. By proper mapping, use of GPS and global navigation satellite
    systems (GNSSs) the machinery can be operated in autopilot mode [52], [75]. The
    machines which include vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and robots can
    be remotely controlled based on the available information collected via the IoT
    system for precise and efficient application of resources to required farm areas
    [76]. The machinery can also collect data and such data can help farmers in mapping
    their field for planning programs, such as fertilizing, irrigation, nutrition
    [77]. For example, CLAAS, an agricultural machinery manufacturer has implemented
    IoT on their equipment, enabling their machinery to be operated in auto pilot
    mode [78]. Another solution is the Precisionhawk’s UAV sensors, which can provide
    farmers information, such as wind speed, air pressure, among other parameters
    [79]. The solution can also be used for imagery and mapping of agricultural plots.
    D. Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture can simply be defined as the collection
    of real-time data from farm variables2 and use of predictive analytics for smart
    decisions in order to maximize yields, minimize environmental impact, and reduce
    cost [80]. Precision agriculture relies on various technology, which include sensor
    nodes [81], [82], GPS and big DA to achieve improved crop yield. The smart decision
    achieved from the DA also results in less waste of resources, such as water in
    irrigation systems, fertilizer, pesticides, etc. Precision agriculture presents
    new challenges for researchers in the area of robotics, image processing, meteorological
    data sensing, etc. With the GPS and GNSS, farmers are able to locate precise location
    and map sites with several data variables, which are then used by variable rate
    technology to optimally distribute farm resources, such as seeding, spraying,
    and other services. Although precision agriculture technology can improve yield,
    it is essential to provide solutions that are easy to use by the farmers and also
    provide training to enable small and medium scale farmers benefit from the systems.
    E. Greenhouse Production Greenhouse also known as glasshouse technology is a technique,
    where plants are grown under controlled environment. It offers the benefit of
    growing any plant in any place at any time by providing suitable environmental
    conditions. Several studies have been carried out on the application of WSNs in
    greenhouse to monitor environmental conditions [83]–[85]. Recent works have shown
    how IoT can be applied to greenhouse in order to reduce human resource, save energy,
    increase efficiency in greenhouse-site monitoring, and direct connection of greenhouse
    farmers to customers [61], [66], [86]. SECTION IV. IoT and Data Analytics in Agriculture
    Accurate data analysis in farming plays a major role in improving the operational
    efficiency and increasing productivity. DA has been categorized into types based
    on requirement of IoT applications [87]. This includes real-time analytics, off-line
    analytics, memory-level analytics, business intelligence level analytics, and
    massive analytics [87]–[89]. The data consist of sensor data, audio, images, and
    video. Image processing has been extensively used in agriculture for various purposes
    ranging from detection of disease in leaf, stem, and fruit [90], quality of fruits
    [91], and weed detection and irrigation [76], [90], [92]–[94]. Recently, the combination
    of image processing and IoT in agriculture is being carried out to achieve higher
    quality produce and reduce crop failure. This involves the use of drones to capture
    aerial images at regular interval as well as monitoring of environmental factors
    using the IoT devices [76], [92], [94]. There are several DA methods which has
    been discussed in detail in [95]. The methods are categorized into classification,
    clustering, prediction, and association rule. The discussion of these methods
    is outside the scope of this paper. We discuss the importance of DA in agriculture
    and how DA can help in insurance, prediction, storage management, decision making,
    farm management, and precision farming. A. Prediction IoT provides big data that
    can be studied over time to estimate the present environmental conditions. The
    data collected across different types of networks sensors can be studied using
    DA and smart algorithm can be developed to predict the environmental changes and
    provide data driven solutions. Although IoT data can help in controlling various
    aspects of a farm, such as the irrigation systems, the data can also be used to
    predict and warn farmers against disease or extreme weather conditions, such as
    flood or drought [64]. For instance, in forestry, the sensors can be used to monitor
    fire outbreak or predict the region in a forest that provides high risk of fire
    outbreak. This information can help the firefighters to take preventive measures
    on the exact location. Other area of prediction includes early warning against
    natural disasters to improve emergency response [96]. B. Storage Management A
    large number of agricultural products are usually lost due to poor storage management
    system. While temperature, moisture and other environmental factors greatly affect
    the contamination of food products, insects, microorganism, rodent, etc. can affect
    the quality and quantity of the food products [97]. The use of IoT and DA in storage
    management systems can help to improve agricultural product storage [98]. Sensors
    can be deployed to monitor the storage facilities and environmental conditions.
    The data are sent to the cloud and analyzed. A self-automated decision system,
    which relies on the analyzed data can be deployed to adjust the environmental
    conditions. Moreover, a warning alert can be initiated to farmers when extreme
    conditions are reached or if pest are reported in the storage facility. In India,
    it is reported that about 35% to 40% of the fresh product are lost after harvesting
    due to several factors which includes spoilage or pest [97]. In [99], a cold storage
    management system is designed based on IoT technology, where the storage facility
    is operated at a controlled temperature. Although IoT can improve the agricultural
    storage facility, security should be embedded into such system to avoid product
    theft in case of power outages. C. Decision Decision making requires reliable
    information which can be obtained from sensors data. The large data obtained from
    sensor offers learning opportunities to improve decision making in constantly
    changing environmental conditions, such decision making can be over a short, medium,
    or long term. Automated decisions can be made from the IoT system when certain
    conditions are reached, therefore requiring less or no human interventions. Such
    automated decision could range from regulating the temperatures to the control
    of water supply from an irrigation system. For instance, in greenhouses the use
    of machine learning can help determine optimal conditions under which to grow
    a certain crop by observing the data acquired from sensors relating to nutrients,
    yield, growth, transpiration, color, taste, and retransplantation, light temperature
    pest levels and air quality. Policy making decision by government and all the
    stakeholders can also be enhanced by the amount of information obtained from DA,
    therefore it is important that the data is accurate, concise, complete, and in
    time. Several agricultural decision-making systems have been developed to enable
    farmers to make informed decision regarding their farms and livestock [100]. The
    DA provides decision on technical guidance to farmers, pests and diseases control
    and recommendation from remote expert guidance systems. D. Farm Management Integrated
    farm management system allows an entire farm to be monitored. Data are collected
    through a network of sensors including the on-body sensors in animals with a sole
    purpose of driving productivity. Three key factors which include risk management,
    cost, and productivity yield need to be managed with real time information and
    properly optimized to maximize productivity [13]. DA plays a major role to present
    the farmers and stake holders with large data that can be carefully studied to
    avoid unnecessary risk or implement preventive measures to improve productivity.
    DA also allow various farms to be connected and managed on a single platform,
    where information on scientific advances, production, marketing, farm management,
    recommendations and other related topics are disseminated to maximize productivity,
    yield, and revenue. E. Precise Application DA using measured data from sensors
    can enable precise application of chemicals and fertilizers to specific areas
    of the farm, this can improve the productivity while reducing the farming cost.
    Although precision farming systems have been deployed in farms in advanced countries,
    developing countries are beginning to adopt the technology especially in research
    farms [14]. However, the deployment cost, technology and awareness still limits
    the deployments of IoT-based precision farming systems in developing countries.
    In addition, most of the farms in developing countries are small scaled farms
    as such, most farmers do not see the need to apply such technology. Developing
    appropriate precision farming solutions for small farms still remains an open
    area for researcher and designers. Another advantage of DA in precision farming
    is its application in steering machinery using GPS and location data to precise
    locations in the farm thereby improving the farming efficiency when compared with
    human driven machines. This can save time, fuel and operational cost. F. Insurance
    Farmers are usually exposed to extreme weather conditions which could lead to
    poor harvest. However, with the implementation of IoT technology farmers can be
    insured with their crops and livestock. A network of sensors can be deployed,
    and monitoring can be achieved by remote unmanned stations. The data can be sent
    to the cloud and analyzed. The insurance policy can be embedded with a warning
    systems, where extreme weather conditions are predicted and the insured farmers
    are alerted by text messages. This can enable the farmers take precautionary approach
    to protect their farms. An added advantage of DA in insurance is the fact that
    the insurance companies have access to the data from the remote farms and can
    initiate an automated payout thought the IoT mobile payments systems when extreme
    conditions are observed. This can eliminate the need for lengthy claim process,
    where the insurance company needs to ascertain the extent of damage by visiting
    the farms. SECTION V. Benefits There are several benefits that can be derived
    from the use of IoT in agriculture. Some of the benefits have been mentioned in
    the discussion of application of IoT in Sections III and IV. However, we reiterate
    and summarize some of the benefits as follows. Community Farming: The use of IoT
    can help promote community farming especially in the rural areas. The IoT can
    be leveraged to promote services that allows the community to have a common data
    storage, share data and information, increase interaction between the farmers
    and agriculture experts [101]. Also, through the use of mobile apps and IoT facilities
    equipment can be shared within the community via free or paid services. Safety
    Control and Fraud Prevention: The challenge in the agriculture sector is not just
    limited to sufficient production but also the ability to ensure safe and nutritious
    food supply. There have been several reports in food fraud which includes adulteration,
    counterfeit, artificial enhancement [102]. This fraud poses health challenge and
    can have negative economic impact [103], [104]. Some of the components of food
    fraud discussed in [104] are product integrity, process integrity, people integrity,
    and data integrity can be addressed using IoT technology. IoT can be used to provide
    logistics traceability and qualitative traceability of food [105]. Competitive
    Advantages: The increase in demand for food and the use of innovative technology
    is expected to make the agriculture sector very competitive. Also, the enabling
    of data driven agriculture using IoT will open new direction in trading, monitoring,
    and marketing. The ability to lower costs, reduce wastage in application of farm
    inputs, such as fertilizer and pesticides increase productivity. The use of real-time
    data for decision making will provide the competitive advantage needed for farmers
    who adopt the IoT ecosystem. Wealth Creation and Distributions: The deployment
    of IoT will provide new business models, where the single farmers can avoid the
    exploitation of “middle men” and can be in direct relationship with the consumers
    [10] leading to higher profit. Cost Reduction and Wastage: One of the perceived
    advantages of IoT is the ability to monitor remotely devices and equipment [106].
    The application of IoT in agriculture will help to save time and money in inspecting
    large fields compared to personnel physically inspecting the field either via
    use of vehicles or walking. The ability to know when and where to apply pesticides
    or insecticides using IoT will reduce cost and wastage. Operational Efficiency:
    The operational efficiency not only relates to farmers but to decision makers
    related to agriculture sector, such as government and nongovernmental agencies.
    Data gathered from agriculture surveillance schemes via IoT can serve as a guide
    in agriculture interventions. Such interventions can be prevention of spread of
    diseases, veld fire outbreaks, compensation schemes and resource allocations.
    In addition, farmers can take advantage of IoT and DA to take accurate and timely
    decisions in terms of farm management and farm processes. The ability to automatically
    document health status of livestock or crop will provide efficient and effective
    diagnosis and prescription of medicine by veterinary or agriculture officer to
    farmers. This will help reduce loss. Also, with the use of IoT, supply chain of
    agri-food can be optimized. The use of the IoT in the supply chain will help to
    provide real time balancing between the demand and supply. Awareness: IoT is expected
    to drive low cost applications and access to wireless network services in the
    agriculture sector. To this end, information on markets, prices, services can
    be accessed via mobile apps. Also, government services and regulatory standard
    regarding different farm produce can be made readily available. In addition, consumers
    who are interested in organic products and fresh products can easily locate farmers
    or be alerted when fresh products are available. Asset Management: IoT will enable
    real time monitoring of farm assets and machinery against theft, replacement of
    parts, and for timely routine maintenance. SECTION VI. Open Issues and Key Challenges
    There are several challenges that are associated with deployment and application
    of IoT. Some of the challenges identified in the literature are security and privacy,
    data convergence and ownership, lack of interoperability, heterogeneity of IoT
    devices, uncertainty in business models [5], [107]. We discuss issues under three
    main headings which are business, technical, and sectoral issues. A. Business
    Issues The profit margin in the agriculture sector is very thin and as such there
    is the need to balance the tradeoff between the deployment of IoT enabling technology
    versus the potential profits. Hence, we discuss business issues related to the
    IoT deployment by considering cost and business models. 1) Cost: There are several
    cost associated with the deployment of IoT in agriculture which can be categorized
    into setup cost and running cost. The setup cost includes purchase of hardware
    (IoT devices, gateways, base station infrastructure). The running cost involves
    continuous subscription for use of centralized services or IoT platforms which
    provides data collection, management of IoT devices, sharing of information among
    other services. Other additional running cost are cost incurred from exchange
    of data between IoT devices, gateway and cloud server, energy, and maintenance.
    According to Turgut and Boloni [108] the success of IoT has to satisfy two conditions
    which are: 1) the customers are persuaded that the IoT devices provide a value
    that exceeds their physical and privacy costs and 2) the businesses involved in
    IoT will successfully make money. The first condition can be expressed as ( V
    s − C pri − C user h − C pay )>0 (1) View Source where V s is the perceived value
    of the user, C pri is the cost of loss of privacy, C user h cost of hardware and
    associated services and C pay is the payment for service charge and the second
    condition can be expressed as ( V info + R pay − C business h )>0 (2) View Source
    where V info is the value of information received, R pay is the direct payment
    received, and C business h is the business’s share of hardware and maintenance
    costs. From (2) while the value of information received is meant for provision
    of the services needed by the user, this can be commercially exploited by the
    service provider in the course of service provision. Although some of the IoT
    platform providers provide free subscription services with limited functionality,
    limited number of IoT devices that can be connected and limited amount of data
    that can saved. More functionality and services attract higher subscription fees.
    2) Business Models: Farmers would be interested in business models that supports
    revenue generation from the data accumulated from their farm using IoT technologies.
    Most of the existing IoT platforms service providers, provide free limited services
    and full services with different level of subscriptions. The data provided are
    exploited by the IoT service providers and this remains an area of contention
    by farmers for control and ownership of their data. 3) Lack of Adequate Knowledge:
    The lack of adequate knowledge of IoT and its application especially among farmers
    located in rural areas is a major factor slowing the adoption of IoT in agriculture.
    This is common in the developing countries where majority of the farmers are often
    found in the rural areas and are mostly uneducated. The farmer’s inability to
    use information could be a major barrier if human interventions are not available
    [12]. B. Technical Issues 1) Interference: The deployment of massive IoT devices
    for agricultural and other purposes will cause interference problems especially
    with the IoT devices using the unlicensed spectrum, such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox,
    and LoRa (see Table II). The interference caused can lead to loss of data and
    reduce the reliability of the IoT ecosystem. The technology to make IoT devices
    using the unlicensed spectrum interference proof will add to cost of the device.
    On the other hand, the use of IoT devices operating with licensed spectrum is
    expected to eliminate unnecessary interference. However, due to limited pilot
    assignment in the cellular band, the reuse of nonorthogonal multiple access scheme
    or frequency reuse can still cause interference amongst IoT devices using cellular
    licensed spectrum. 2) Security and Privacy: There are several security issues
    that needs to be addressed at different level of the IoT ecosystem. The lack of
    adequate security may lead to loss of data, bridge of privacy, and access to raw
    information about on-field parameters and other sensitive intellectual properties.
    This can compromise the competitive advantages of private farm owners. The IoT
    security and privacy issues have been discussed extensively in [106], [109], and
    [110]. According to the interview-based studies carried out by Asplund and Nadjm-Tehrani
    [106] on the attitudes and perception of IoT, security was considered a major
    obstacle in the deployment of IoT. There are several security issues that needs
    to be addressed at different level of the IoT ecosystem. In agriculture, the IoT
    devices are vulnerable to physical tampering, such as theft or attacks by predators
    and animals, change of physical address or link [110], [111]. In addition, for
    the IoT devices, it is difficult to implement complex and sophisticated algorithms
    due to limited memory, communication capabilities, and low energy consumption.
    The gateway can be prone to congestion attack, denial of service (DoS), and forwarding
    attacks. The security and position of location information and IoT enabled location-based
    service which are used for precision farming are exposed to attacks, such as device
    capture attack [109], [110], [112]. In the device capture attack, an attacker
    captures the IoT device and extracts cryptographic implementations and enjoy unrestricted
    access to the information stored in the device’s storage. Other higher communication
    layers can be vulnerable to DoS attacks, wireless signal jamming, and man in the
    middle attack [110]. In addition, the cloud servers can be prone to data tampering,
    unauthorized services which can affect automated processes in the farms. Other
    security treats that can affect the cloud infrastructure are session hijacking,
    cloud access control and database issues, hijacking attacks, logon abuse, and
    DoS [110]. 3) Choice of Technology: There are several IoT technologies that have
    been developed recently, some of which are still going through pilot test. The
    right choice of IoT technology is a big challenge because a lot of investment
    is required for deploying new technologies. Currently, it is difficult to tell
    which of the new IoT technologies will dominate the market. Many factors need
    to be considered, such as support for roaming, suitability of technology to small-scale,
    medium-scale and large-scale, suitability to different geographical location,
    soil types and climatic conditions. 4) Reliability: The IoT devices are expected
    to be deployed in out-door environment. This will expose the devices to harsh
    environmental conditions which may lead to degradation of deployed sensors with
    time as well as communication failures. The physical safety of the deployed IoT
    sensors and systems must be ensured in order to protect the costly equipment from
    severe weather conditions, such as flood and hurricanes. 5) Scalability: Billions
    of IoT devices are expected to be deployed in the agriculture sector. Existing
    gateways and protocols will need to support large number of IoT devices/nodes.
    For example, the Sigfox gateway can support up to 106, Ingenu 104, and LoRa 104
    nodes, respectively. This will require intelligent IoT management system for each
    node and identification numbers. 6) Localization: There are several factors that
    needs to be considered for deployment of IoT devices. Such factors include the
    ability for the IoT device to support place and play functionality, i.e., be placed
    anywhere and connected to the rest of the world with no (or minimal configuration
    or deploying additional devices, such as gateways) [113]. Other factors are the
    best position to place the IoT device that will provide adequate information and
    reliability without causing interference (or minimal interference). In addition,
    the ability to support IoT device roaming for nomadic IoT devices and deployment
    of static IoT devices in location without prior knowledge of the mobile IoT technology/infrastructure
    needs to be considered. 7) Optimization of Resources: Farmers need resources optimization
    mechanism to determine how many gateways, IoT devices, amount of transmitted data,
    size of cloud storage are needed in order to have a breakthrough in profit margins.
    This is particularly challenging due to different farm sizes and different type
    of sensors needed to monitor farm variables for specific crops or livestock. This
    will require development of complex algorithm and mathematical models to be able
    to determine optimal resource allocation while minimizing cost and maximizing
    agriculture produce and profits. C. Sectoral Issues 1) Regulatory Challenges:
    Regulation and legal frameworks regarding the control and ownership of farm data
    between farmers and data companies needs to be sorted out. The regulations may
    differ from countries to countries in terms of resource allocation (i.e., spectrum
    for cellular IoT), technical challenges, competition, data privacy, and security.
    Different regulations across regions or countries may affect the application of
    IoT in use cases, such as tracking and agri-food supply. 2) Interoperability:
    There are ongoing works on protocols and standards needed for billions of IoT
    devices to interoperate. This involves technical, syntactic, semantic, and organization
    interoperability [5], [9], [114]. The technical interoperability involves the
    development of protocols and infrastructure that enables the IoT devices to communicate
    [115]. It is usually associated with the hardware/software components of the IoT
    ecosystem. The syntactical interoperability is associated with data formats, such
    as extensible markup language (XML), java script object notation (JSON), comma
    separated variables, electronic data interchange as standard syntax for data sharing
    [5]. The semantic interoperability deals with the interpretation of contents exchanged
    between human. The organizational interoperability is the ability to effectively
    communicate and transfer data successfully across different infrastructure, geographic
    region and cultures. Thus, a key requirement here is that all systems provide
    export facilities or API access that return standard formats, typically XML or
    JSON, and where possible legacy systems are provided with appropriate interchange
    gateways. According to [116], interoperability can be achieved using three methods
    which are: 1) partnerships among product and service developers; 2) open and close
    standards, and 3) adaptors and mediator services. In order to achieve interoperability,
    groups, such as openconnectivity [117] are promoting interoperability in IoT.
    In addition, the use of adapter services, such as if this then that [118] that
    allows users to create powerful connections and chains of simple conditional statements
    are currently being used. It is important to note that some of these methods may
    not provide widely enabled interoperability among IoT devices due to scalability.
    More work is expected in promotion of open standards to achieve greater operability
    among billions of IoT devices and services. D. Summary The open issues and challenges
    discussed in this section can serve as a factor for the slow adoption of IoT in
    the agriculture sector if not well addressed. More reports are needed on the monetary
    benefits of adopting IoT in agriculture. The issues of privacy and security will
    continue to remain a top priority for farmers, although this is expected to change
    over time as people become use to IoT and its services. Also, as the cost of IoT
    devices and cost of data storage, processing, and transfer reduces with time small
    and medium scale farmers will be able to deploy the IoT systems. SECTION VII.
    Future Trends and Opportunities From our studies and review of current trends
    in the application of IoT in agriculture, we present the future trends based on
    the following areas: 1) technological innovations; 2) application scenarios; and
    3) business and marketability. A. Technological Innovation More and more IoT solutions
    will continue to emerge and this will introduce new and disruptive technologies
    especially in the agriculture sector. Some of the areas identified are discussed
    as follows. 1) Deployment of LPWA Technologies: The LPWA is expected to dominate
    the agriculture sector as this offers so many advantages, such as low power and
    long-range communication. The release of the 3GPP NB-IoT standard and adoption
    by many telco operators will attract many research interests in investigating
    the use of NB-IoT communication technologies. This will enable large-scale pilot
    test of IoT in agriculture [5]. 2) Universal Platform: The development of IoT
    platform for agriculture purpose will shift from just specific crops or livestock
    to a universal platform (also known as generic platform) that can support any
    kind of crop and livestock. This will allow a system that can be easily modified
    to support a variety of applications ranging from managing and monitoring of crops
    and livestock to selling of products to local stores and consumers. Such system
    will be free of any geographical and regional limitations and can serve as the
    enabler for many IoT in agriculture. 3) Security: The security of IoT device and
    end-to-end data security will continue to attract more research interest. More
    research work is needed in the development of IoT device that can support new
    security schemes, such as advanced signcryption algorithm [119]. The signcryption
    combines digital signature and data encryption to prevent eavesdropping and unauthorized
    modification on sensitive information. Security measures to prevent physical attackers
    and intruders from the IoT devices need to be investigated and new schemes developed.
    4) Spectral and Energy Efficiency: Different technologies, such as ultranarrowband
    channels (Sigfox and Telensa) and spread spectrum (LoRa and Ingenu) are adopted
    in order to achieve the LPWA requirements [120]. As more LPWA complaint solutions
    are being rolled out, new technologies that can support higher data, long distance
    coverage, high path-loss link budget, and extended battery life are required.
    Majority of the cellular NB-IoT systems currently support frequency bands which
    operates frequency division duplex modes. More work is expected in bands that
    operate the time division duplex modes. This will open up other research challenges,
    such as pilot contamination [121]. Although LPWA aims to achieve ten years battery
    life, energy efficient mechanism are still needed for IoT devices as the efficiency
    is highly dependent on the node usage [122]. There exist several algorithms that
    have been developed for energy efficiency in WSN, such as clustering and in-network
    processing algorithms [122]–[124]. Other energy efficient schemes for IoT, such
    as ability to predict the sleep interval of IoT devices-based upon their remaining
    battery level, their previous usage history, and quality of information required
    for a particular application as proposed in [125] can be further studied. The
    application of optimal wireless power transfer enabled IoT transceiver architectures,
    simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in IoT, energy harvesting
    IoT devices is expected to attract research interest. 5) Quality of Service: Existing
    study on the QoS of IoT shows that QoS is required in every layer of the IoT architecture
    [126], [127]. The ability to ensure that a device that needs to send critical
    data will be able to do so using IoT with any of the communication technology
    is still an open research area. The use of NB-IoT communication technology promises
    high QoS compared to LoRa [26]. More work needs to be done in providing mechanism
    that guarantees QoS throughout the different IoT network layers. 6) Artificial
    Intelligence and DA: More work is expected in the use of artificial intelligence
    to model crop growth and disease management based on farm data and climatic information.
    Example is the use of machine learning for recognition of disease from images
    uploaded via smartphones [128]. DA algorithms that can process large amount of
    data at a much faster rate compared to the IoT communication time are expected
    to be developed. 7) Privacy-Preservation: End-to-end privacy-preservation methods
    that allow the extraction of knowledge from data while preserving the privacy
    of individuals have been proposed to solve the issues relating to IoT data privacy
    violations [129]–[131]. Examples of the proposed methods designed to guarantee
    a certain level of privacy while maximizing the utility of the data have been
    classified based on data life-cycle phase at which the privacy-preservation is
    ensured [132]. The application of the proposed privacy-preservation methods and
    how it can further enhance the IoT penetration in the agriculture sector can be
    further researched. 8) Data Compression: As massive IoT devices are connected
    there will be need to develop advanced compressing and multiplexing techniques
    for exchange of data from hundred to thousands of sensors to a central location.
    This will be particularly needed for transmission of images and video data when
    NB-IoT cellular communication are employed. Multiplexing will also help in merging
    data from different farms to a single location providing backup, security and
    management from a single-point. 9) Real Time Monitoring: As hundreds of different
    types of sensors are to be deployed in the field for real time monitoring, a simple
    network management protocol must be devised to support communication between objects
    and server with less overhead possible. Current protocols are specially designed
    for network appliances and may cause heavy data traffic and overhead on the network
    as well as increase the power requirements for the IoT devices. B. Application
    Scenarios Currently, software platforms, IoT devices are being developed and research
    is ongoing on communication technologies that can deliver low cost IoT deployments.
    Most of the current work are on prototyping and testing based on small scale.
    Large-scale pilots are needed to evaluate the usability and usefulness of IoT
    technologies in agriculture [5]. Future work will see more of large-scale pilot
    in the entire supply chain and agri-food applications not only in the developed
    country but as well as developing countries in Asia and Africa. C. Business and
    Marketability 1) Cost Reduction: The optimized power consumption of the IoT devices,
    reduction in physical size, and massive production is expected to drop the cost
    of IoT solutions for agriculture. Future work will see development of cheaper
    sensors, research on combination of different deployment scenarios, exploring
    the use of combined licensed and unlicensed communication technology in order
    to minimize setup and operating cost. 2) Policies and Regulations: More work on
    policy enforcement and standardization in the use of IoT in agriculture are expected
    to be carried out. Involvement of government level or agriculture department must
    be ensured when working on policies and regulation regarding IoT in agriculture
    which may differ from region to region as discussed in Section VI-C. This will
    facilitate early adoption of IoT in agriculture. SECTION VIII. Conclusion An overview
    of IoT and DA in agriculture has been presented in this paper. Several areas related
    to the deployment of IoT in agriculture have been discussed in detail. The survey
    of literature shows that there are lots of work ongoing in development of IoT
    technology that can be used to increase operational efficiency and productivity
    of plant and livestock. The benefits of IoT and DA, and open challenges have been
    identified and discussed in this paper. IoT is expected to offer several benefits
    to the agriculture sector. However, there are still a number of issues to be addressed
    to make it affordable for small and medium-scale farmers. The key issues are security
    and cost. It is expected that as competition increases in the agriculture sector
    and favorable polices are being implemented the adoption rate of IoT in agriculture
    will increase accordingly. One major area that is likely to draw lot of research
    attention is the deployment of LPWA communication technology for agriculture purposes.
    The NB-IoT is expected to stand out among the LPWA technologies. This is because
    of the 3GPP open standard and adoption by the telco companies. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\
    \ 1781\n7 of 45\n \ninfrastructures are still in progress. Ali et al. further\
    \ discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].  \nFrom the above discussion\
    \ and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 and as \nwill be\
    \ shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been identified\
    \ as the most \nsuitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications because\
    \ of their low power consumption, \ncommunication range (acceptable for ZigBee\
    \ and long for LoRa), small size, easy network \nimplementation, simplicity, low\
    \ latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size. \n \nFigure 1. Different\
    \ wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and communication \ndistance.\
    \ \nFigure 1. Different wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and\
    \ communication distance.\nPA using sensors, actuator, processor, wireless transceiver,\
    \ and other information technologies,\npotentially permits manufacturers to computerize\
    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ may operate at different energy states. Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor\
    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n12 of 45\nTable 2. Sleep/wake schemes\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\
    \ research in agricultural applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n17 of 45\nTable\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ the power saving or battery lifetime,\ncommunication distance, and limitations\
    \ of WSNs in different agricultural applications in the work of\nseveral scholars\
    \ (Tables 2–6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol\nfor different agricultural applications. The use of ZigBee supports\
    \ our assumption that this wireless\nprotocol is suitable for agricultural monitoring\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\
    \ \nagricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces of\
    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\

    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

    Get rights and content Highlights • A review of state-of-the-art Internet of Things
    applications for smart grid and home. • Definition of smart home holistic framework
    with key features from literature review. • General description of a smart home
    management model based on the holistic framework. • Discussion of current and
    future challenges for Internet of Things based solutions. Abstract Although Internet
    of Things (IoT) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies
    for smart grid and smart home applications, these implementations are still very
    rare. Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute
    towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications
    and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose
    a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks
    proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects
    in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model
    for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each
    level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data
    processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability.
    We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as
    a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home
    solutions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet of
    ThingsSmart homeHolistic frameworkSmart grid 1. Introduction With the expected
    growth in world population, the demand for energy will continuously increase.
    Current power grids were built decades ago, and despite the fact that they are
    regularly upgraded, their capability to fulfill future demands is uncertain. Existing
    reserves of fossil fuels are limited and impose harmful emissions, making social
    and environmental implications and impact inevitable. The result of this current
    state is the transition of the traditional centralized grid towards a distributed
    hybrid energy generation system that heavily relies on renewable energy sources,
    such as wind and solar systems (Lund et al., 2015), biomass, fuel cells, and tidal
    power. Smart grid is a concept that integrates information and communication technologies
    (ICT) with grid power systems, in order to achieve efficient and intelligent energy
    generation and consumption (Iyer and Agrawal, 2010). It is characterized by a
    two-way flow of both electricity and information. Approaches in smart grid include
    novel solutions that would effectively exploit the existing power grid in order
    to reduce or eliminate blackouts, voltage sags and overloads. Utilities could
    benefit, as the load demand in critical situations would decrease. If demand is
    greater than the total generation, these systems could prevent the grid failure
    or major blackouts, and increase the reliability, quality, security and safety
    of the power grid. Smart grid solutions can be applied in every part of the grid:
    production, transmission and distribution. Recently, a fourth part of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home has become a major (mainstream) research and application
    interest in smart grid. Smart home refers to the use of ICT in home control, ranging
    from controlling appliances to automation of home features (windows, lighting,
    etc.). A key element of the smart home is the usage of intelligent power scheduling
    algorithms, which will provide residents with the ability to make optimal, a priori
    choices about how to spent electricity in order to decrease energy consumption.
    Another term commonly used is smart house or home automation. The combination
    of information technologies and advanced communication and sensing systems, creates
    a variety of new potential applications. New advanced concepts, such as pervasive
    or ubiquitous computing (Greenfield, 2006), where computing is made to appear
    everywhere and anywhere, hold a huge potential for application in smart grid (Parikh
    et al., 2010). Smart devices or objects, capable of communication and computation,
    ranging from simple sensor nodes to home appliances and sophisticated smart phones
    are present everywhere around us. The heterogeneous network composing of such
    objects comes under the umbrella of a concept with a fast growing popularity,
    referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT represents a worldwide network of
    uniquely addressable interconnected objects. According to Gubbi et al. (2013),
    IoT is an “interconnection of sensing and actuating devices providing the ability
    to share information across platforms through a unified framework, developing
    a common operating picture for enabling innovative applications. This is achieved
    by seamless ubiquitous sensing, data analytics and information representation
    with Cloud computing as the unifying framework.” Therefore, the Internet of Things
    aims to improve one''s comfort and efficiency, by enabling cooperation among smart
    objects. The standard IoT usually consists of many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
    and Radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices. Wireless Sensor Network is
    a paradigm that was tremendously explored by the research community in the last
    two decades (Oppermann et al., 2014). A WSN consists of smart sensing devices
    that can communicate through direct radio communication. RFID devices are not
    as sophisticated. They mainly consist of two parts: an integrated circuit with
    some computational capabilities and an antenna for communication. The concept
    of IoT, combined with smart metering, has the potential to transform residential
    houses, homes and offices into energy-aware environments. There is an increasing
    interest in the research community to incorporate the IoT paradigm in the smart
    grid concept, particularly in smart home solutions. The trends of web search popularity
    for the terms: Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart Home since 2004 are shown
    in Fig. 1. According to these statistics by Google, the trends will further increase
    for the terms Internet of Things and Smart Home. Download : Download high-res

    to Google trends since 2004 for terms Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart
    Home. In this paper, we present a holistic approach to the integration of state-of-the-art
    IoT (or near IoT) solutions into the smart home, taking into account both home
    energy management considerations and architectural challenges and solutions with
    emphasis on data processing issues, networking and interoperability features of
    smart home protocols. For this purpose, we surveyed the IoT frameworks present
    in the literature, analyzed these state-of-the-art solutions and defined challenges
    for future research. Section two presents the methodology used in this paper in
    order to select the most appropriate recent developments as published in the literature
    covering the topics of Internet of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The in-depth
    analysis of the results, as identified by our methodology, is given in Section
    3. Our analysis is conducted in a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing
    IoT and near IoT applications are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart
    grid where such solutions are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home.
    Afterwards, a generalization is given of the existing solutions in a new generic
    holistic framework that incorporates key features from the literature review as
    identified by our methodology. The analysis is concluded by overviewing a general
    smart home management model for the IoT based holistic framework by defining its
    integral levels and their main tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art
    solutions. The fourth section discusses challenges associated with IoT constrained
    resources (energy, memory capacity and processing capabilities), along with networking,
    interoperability issues, big data analyses, security and privacy. An overview
    of useful guidelines and solutions needed to face these challenges is given. Finally,
    this paper is concluded in the fifth section. 2. Review methodology This section
    presents the methodology used in the paper in order to select the most appropriate
    recent developments as published in the literature covering the topics of Internet
    of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The literature was searched using the online
    service Google Scholar (GS) (https://scholar.google.com/). The main advantages
    of using GS as opposed to other similar resources like Scopus and Web of Science
    are freedom, ease of use, and a broader universe of cited and citing items (Franceschet,
    2010). Google Scholar has a high coverage for high quality studies, is highly
    sensitive and could be the first, and even more so a standalone choice for systematic
    reviews or meta-analysis (Gehanno et al., 2013). Only publications, excluding
    patents and citations were searched. All results provided by GS were sorted according
    to their relevance. Google Scholar''s ranking algorithm relies heavily on an article''s
    citation count, but also puts a high weighting on words in the title (Beel and
    Gipp, 2009). Currently GS does not search for synonyms of queried keywords; hence,
    all synonyms have to be rewritten and queried separately. Only publications between
    years 2010 and 2016 were considered. Papers prior to 2010 were not considered
    since most of the advances in this area have happened within the last few years
    (GS retrieves 130 publications with keyword “Internet of Things” in the title
    published before 2010, and 7650 publication published after 2010), which is in
    line with the Google trends as shown in Fig. 1. The following terms were allowed:
    “Wireless Sensor Network”, “Internet of Things”, “IoT”, “Smart Grid”, “Smart Home”
    and “Home Automation” to appear anywhere in the text of the publications. We consider
    the terms “Home Automation” and “Smart Home” to be synonyms, as well as the terms
    “IoT”, “Internet of Things” and “Wireless Sensor Networks” (since Wireless Sensor
    Networks together with RFID are the two main technologies which enable the development
    of IoT). Most of the research challenges in IoT have its origin in WSN; hence,
    some of the IoT solutions are simply borrowed from WSN (Mainetti et al., 2011).
    The general query form we use is “term1” AND “term2” AND “term3”, where term1
    = (“Wireless Sensor Networks” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT”), term2 = (“Smart
    Home” OR “Home Automation”), and term3 = “Smart Grid”, and thus perform six searches.
    The queries and the total number of publications retrieved by GS are given in
    Table 1. Table 1. Number of publications found by GS engine for different queries.
    Query# Term1 Term2 Term3 Total number of results Query 1 “Wireless Sensor Network”

    Home” “Smart Grid” 1050 Query 6 “IoT” “Home Automation” “Smart Grid” 747 Only
    the first 100 results per query were considered for further analysis in this paper.
    There are overlaps between the result sets of the different queries so the final
    set of unique publications is around 150. For example, if we consider only the
    top 20 results there are a total of 74 unique publications, with multiple publications
    appearing in the results of more than one query. Fig. 2 shows the number of these
    overlaps, and additionally the average GS ranking for each group are given (e.g.
    papers that appear in the results of a single query have an average ranking of
    12.54). Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Total number of publications appearing in the top 20 results for
    the six queries. The number associated with each bar refers to the average ranking
    of the publications in the group. The unique set of publications was further filtered
    content-wise i.e. whether the publication has pertinent material regarding wireless
    sensor networks or Internet of Things solution/s for smart home and/or smart grid.
    First a number of papers were excluded based on the content of their abstract.
    Next, we considered the whole text of the remaining papers and retained only those
    in line with our review. The final remaining papers were analyzed in-depth. The
    finding is that the papers can be semantically divided in two main categories:
    WSN solutions and IoT concepts. The first category includes papers that provide
    real-life working implementations of WSN in different domains like habitat monitoring,
    home monitoring, etc. They can be considered the seeds of future IoT applications.
    The papers in the second category revolve around the IoT paradigm and provide
    concepts, frameworks, visions, and challenges of future “to be implemented” IoT
    solutions. Hence, this work separately elaborates the papers in the two categories
    in the forthcoming Section (3). We firstly expatiate on papers in context of WSN
    implementations (3.1), then we survey papers in line with IoT solutions (3.2 and
    3.3). 3. In-depth analysis of literature This section presents the in-depth analysis
    of the results as identified by our methodology. The analysis is conducted in
    a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing IoT and near IoT applications
    are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart grid where such solutions
    are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home. Afterwards, a generalization
    is given of the existing solutions in a new generic holistic framework that incorporates
    key features from the literature review as identified by our methodology. The
    analysis is concluded by overviewing a general smart home management model for
    the IoT based holistic framework by defining its integral levels and their main
    tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art solutions. 3.1. State-of-the-art
    (near) Internet of Things solutions in smart grid and smart home The integration
    of IoT within the smart grid will bring a new perspective to electricity management,
    with benefit for all parties involved. Table 2 differentiates the potential IoT
    applications regarding different aspects (parts) of the smart grid (Cardenas et
    al., 2014, Gungor et al., 2010, Parikh et al., 2010). Much of the pioneering research
    is hindered with a lot of challenges, especially when dealing with the first three
    aspects (generation, transmission and distribution) of the smart grid. The problems
    are mostly due to the harsh conditions in which sensor devices are deployed. Experimental
    results using IEEE 802.15.4-compliant sensor networks show that wireless links
    (including both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios) in the smart
    grid have high packet error rates and variable link capacity due to electromagnetic
    interference, equipment noise, obstruction, etc. (Gungor and Korkmaz, 2012). Wireless
    nodes impose additional constraints, i.e. the memory and processing limitations
    of the sensor nodes and their limited power resources. Table 2. Potential IoT
    applications for smart grid. Energy providers Energy generation Transmission Distribution
    Consumers Real-time generation monitoring Transmission lines controlling Underground

    plants controlling Power monitoring Transformers stations controlling Home (Residential)
    energy management Alternative energy sources controlling Solar panels management
    Residential (distributed) production monitoring Predicting future solar panels
    and wind turbine production (using sensor data like temperature or humidity) Fortunately,
    most of these challenges are not present in the fourth, consumer side of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home. For example, sensors are usually connected to home
    appliances and the battery life problem becomes superfluous as the devices have
    a steady power supply. Furthermore, strong electromagnetic fields are not associated
    with home grid infrastructure. Still, IoT for smart home is subject to challenges
    like reliability, privacy, and security (Iyer, 2011). Modern homes equipped with
    smart meters, smart appliances, smart power outlets and sensing devices enable
    the development of energy-aware smart homes (Fig. 3). Although the smart home
    has been a dream for both utilities and consumers for a long time, such implementations
    are still very rare (Monacchi et al., 2013). On the other side, there are plenty
    of existing commercial solutions and advanced Demand Side Management (DSM) systems
    focused on large industrial consumers (Finn and Fitzpatrick, 2014, Palensky and
    Dietrich, 2011). Almost all of them fail to integrate small residential consumers.

    Fig. 3. Smart home. IoT carries the potential to overcome this gap and to provide
    services that will foster the development of intelligent solutions for the common
    people. The main goal of IoT is to advance a better and safe society, where “Everything
    is a service” (public safety, environment, health care, production, etc.). In
    this subsection we present relevant attempts from the literature as identified
    by our methodology. The papers discussed here semantically fall in a category
    regarding near IoT solutions for smart home, mainly from the neighboring fields
    of wireless sensor networks, home automation, and smart grid. Novel architectures
    in terms of state-of-the-art software technologies with focus on domestic environments
    and habitat monitoring are proposed in Monacchi et al. (2013) and Stojkoska and
    Davcev (2009). In Monacchi et al. (2013) the authors promote design guidelines
    for collecting and integrating household data, thus enabling data interoperability.
    In Stojkoska and Davcev (2009), a web interface is developed in order to increase
    the interaction between the deployed WSN and its end users. Authors of Kamilaris
    et al. (2011) propose a solution for a Web-based energy-aware smart home framework
    that enables smart appliances to the Web. They have developed a graphical user
    interface to ease the interaction. The evaluation of their solution is done using
    a WSN organized in a star topology and also a multihop topology (up to three hops)
    for larger apartments (smart homes of around 100 m2). VillaSmart (Caracaş et al.,
    2013) is associated with the ECOGRID EU (EcoGrid EU, 2015) project. The authors
    have installed a modular and extensible WSN in a test and reference household
    called VILLASMART. These authors are modeling the energy behavior of the building.
    These thermal models are improved using indoor and outdoor WSN readings (air and
    water temperature, solar radiation sensor, weather conditions and power consumption
    information), thus achieving more precise predictions of indoor temperature. Using
    the standard resistance-capacitance (RC) model, the maximum prediction error achieved
    is 1.790C. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard in the 2.4 GHz is used for indoor communication.
    The model parameter determination is done with the grey-box estimation method.
    In Srbinovska et al. (2015) a WSN is installed for vegetable greenhouse monitoring
    and a control system for agriculture is developed. This system helps farmers increase
    the crop production and quality by remotely controlling different parts of the
    greenhouse, like drip irrigation and fan facilities. In Risteska Stojkoska et
    al. (2014), the authors present a framework for temperature regulation inside
    commercial and administrative buildings, with focus on design and implementation
    of specific network topologies and node localization within the system. 3.2. Holistic
    IoT-based framework for smart home It is expected that smart objects will be dominant
    on the market in the next few years and will become omnipresent in households,
    which will impose the need for new and improved services for smart homes (Karnouskos,
    2011). For these reasons, the need for IoT based solutions will be incontestable.
    Most recent publications focus on developing a general IoT framework that is suitable
    for broader range of application domains. In Lee and Lee (2015), the authors identity
    five IoT technologies as essential for building successful IoT solutions: radio
    frequency identification, wireless sensor networks, middleware, cloud computing
    and software for application development. They also identify three IoT categories
    for enterprise applications: monitoring and control, big data and business analytics,
    and information sharing and collaboration. In(Da Xu et al., 2014), the list of
    enabling technologies is enhanced with Near Field Communication, location based
    services and social networks. They suggest a four-layer architecture made up of:
    sensing, networking, service and interface. The role of the cloud is missing;
    therefore, it is not clear how services would be enabled. Liu et al. (2014) presents
    a middleware that supports naming, addressing, storage and look-up services. The
    idea is to develop a middleware at the top of the existing systems, thus to achieve
    easier integration of existing applications into IoT environments. Once again,
    the cloud is omitted as an enabling technology that should support all these services.
    The monitoring of production processes in industry using IoT is investigated in
    Shrouf and Miragliotta (2015). The authors propose a detailed framework that is
    focused on energy management, with possibilities for in-house or cloud-based data
    mining and decision making. The role of the third-party solution designers is
    not specified in the framework. Readers can also refer to (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    He et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2014) for interesting work regarding IoT architectures.
    With respect to these publications, the framework presented in this paper can
    be considered a modified version of the most general model we found in literature
    (Da Xu et al., 2014), augmented with the cloud in the middle, and adapted to a
    particular application domain, i.e. smart home. This multi-level hierarchical
    holistic framework based on Internet of Things is used as a wrapper or generalization
    of all the key features of IoT solutions for smart homes identified in the literature.
    The graphical representation of the framework is given in Fig. 4. Within the framework
    data is sent wirelessly and is shown using dashed lines. The yellow lines correspond
    to a bidirectional electricity flow. The following paragraphs summarize each level
    of the framework. Download : Download high-res image (641KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Multi level IoT framework for smart home. 3.2.1. Smart
    home All household devices equipped with interfaces for wireless communication,
    make up the home WSN. Each home has a WSN, and the sensed data from each device
    is forwarded to a central station, which we refer to as home sink or home hub.
    Each node in the home WSN is considered a smart device and has moderate computation
    and communication capabilities. The home hub can be any one device (smart meter,
    PC, tablet or smartphone) that has some data storage capacity, can perform local
    processing and can communicate with devices outside the home WSN. In the case
    of smart residential complexes or smart buildings, the counterpart of the home
    hub is identified as residential sink or residential hub. The residential hub
    needs to have an additional feature, as compared to the home hub, which is that
    it is responsible for managing data from/to shared distributed production sources.
    This is rather important, as renewable sources are usually shared among consumers,
    one example being a residential building with a PV system on the roof, where the
    PV system is used by all households in the building. Within the framework, each
    distributed renewable energy source is considered a smart device. 3.2.2. Cloud
    All data from different sources is accumulated in the cloud (households'' data,
    sensor measurements from the transmission/distribution lines or from the production
    sites, etc.). The cloud should provide massive data storage and processing infrastructure.
    It is the most advanced level of the framework (Da Xu et al., 2014, Lee and Lee,
    2015). As stated in Gubbi et al. (2013), the cloud “promises high reliability,
    scalability and autonomy” for the next generation of IoT applications. The cloud
    is the central part of this system, hence our framework can be considered as “cloud
    centric” or “cloud based”. 3.2.3. Utility This level corresponds to the remaining
    parts of the smart grid, apart from the smart home: production, transmission and
    distribution. Each part independently sends data directly to the cloud. The typical
    information that can be exchanged with the utility is: price of electricity, weather
    forecast, distribution/transmission line status, current and future consumption
    of a microgrid, current and future production of the distributed production sources
    associated with a microgrid, etc (Sajjad et al., 2014). 3.2.4. Third party Third
    party applications are developed using the cloud data (Gubbi et al., 2013). Other
    terms that are interchangeably used are business applications, industry oriented
    applications or user-specific IoT application. Namely, third party application
    developers get data from the cloud (private or public) and use this data to deliver
    solutions in the form of web based or mobile applications (Fan et al., 2010).
    3.2.5. User interfaces This level represents user interfaces that deliver data
    to the end users (notifications, recommendations, smart device controls, etc)
    (Da Xu et al., 2014). Raw tabular data referring to monthly (or even daily) household
    consumption is hard to be interpreted by the users. A more sophisticated visualization
    tool is needed to present not only the overall household consumption, but also
    the consumption at device/appliance level (Liu et al., 2014). This is particularly
    useful, since consumers will be able to learn more about different appliances
    in their home, especially ones that cannot be controlled automatically, like non-flexible
    devices, hence enabling the users to control them intuitively taking into account
    their consuming nature. Third party applications should put an effort toward developing
    intuitive visual user interfaces for the consumers and frequently evaluate those
    using Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics. 3.3. Smart home management systems
    An energy management system is defined as an interface between a utility company
    and smart devices that consume power. It aims to provide benefits for both parties
    (utilities and consumers), somewhat biased towards the consumers. Another term
    commonly used is Demand Side Management (DSM). It represents a set of technologies
    that enable monitoring and controlling the consumption/production at consumer
    level in order to perform power balancing in future energy systems (Atzeni et
    al., 2013, Rezvani et al., 2015, Siano, 2014). In the context of IoT solutions
    for smart home, the traditional DSM model is shifted toward the cloud centric
    model. The cloud based approach offers centralized optimization that considers
    a huge set of parameters; hence it is expected to outperform the energy management
    as compared to a traditional approach. Fig. 5 shows the general Smart home management
    model adopted for our holistic framework. The main tasks that should be performed
    at each level are presented as follows. Download : Download high-res image (391KB)

    3.3.1. Smart objects/smart devices Home appliances, lights, or sensors attached
    to production or transmission lines in a smart grid system can be considered smart
    objects. They can sense, actuate, process data and communicate. In order to sense
    and actuate, they need to perform A/D and D/A conversions (Byun et al., 2012).
    These devices periodically perform sensing and send (wirelessly of wired) sensed
    data to the hub. Moreover, if protocols allow it, sensed data can be sent directly
    to the cloud. If possible, smart devices should perform basic data processing
    before they send the sensed data (Stojkoska et al., 2012, Viani et al., 2013).
    Actuating can be also controlled remotely. In the context of DSM, home appliances
    can be divided in three categories: non flexible, flexible and dual nature appliances
    (Erol-Kantarci and Mouftah, 2010). The non-flexible appliances are those that
    are associated with baseline loads or non-preemptive tasks (like light, TV, PC,
    hair drier) and cannot be controlled by the system (Ullah et al., 2013). The flexible
    appliances are associated with regular loads or preemptive tasks (like heating
    or air-conditioning) and can be automatically operated by the system. The dual
    nature appliances sometimes can act as flexible, but sometimes as non-flexible
    (like washing machine, dish washer or laundry). For example, sometimes the consumer
    does not care about the exact time the dish washer will operate, as long as it
    is within a predefined time frame. These appliances usually present burst loads
    (Khan et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2013). The smart appliances (both flexible and
    dual nature) are equipped with smart power outlets that are able to measure their
    power consumption and to control their operation in real-time. 3.3.2. Hubs The
    hub is a device that is responsible for collecting raw and/or processed data from
    the smart devices and forwarding them to the cloud (Zhu et al., 2010). Whenever
    possible, the hub has to perform local data processing (Viani et al., 2013), in
    order to reduce the data flow towards the cloud. Furthermore, in a smart home
    scenario, the hub can send commands to the smart devices acting as a local scheduler,
    regulator, or load balancer (Byun et al., 2012). In the case of a residential
    hub, it can send commands to the devices that regulate the electricity flow to/from
    the nanogrid, i.e. to manage the operations of buying/selling electricity from/to
    the grid. The hub understands the communication protocols used by the smart devices.
    Hubs are needed to enable the interoperability between the smart objects, since
    the devices generally cannot communicate with each other (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    Heile, 2010). Hence, sometimes a household needs more than one hub. In the future,
    when full interoperability among smart devices is achieved, it is expected that
    hubs will be superfluous in the model. 3.3.3. Cloud The cloud is the most complex
    part of the home management. The main task of the cloud is to store the data (Zhou
    et al., 2013). Because of the high data volume, traditional approaches should
    be modified to meet the new requirements. New methods and algorithms based on
    machine learning techniques, time series processing and advanced analytics are
    to be employed (Da Xu et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013). Third-party applications
    typically assume that the data being used is unchanging i.e. the data is usable
    by applications on a non-real-time basis. In the cloud the event-based data is
    converted to query-based processing. This is a crucial step towards bridging the
    differences of real-time IoT networking and the third-party application world.
    The data should be stored persistently and abstracted at multiple levels so that
    they could be easily combined, recomputed and/or aggregated with previously stored
    data, with the possibility of some data coming from non-IoT sources (Da Xu et
    al., 2014). Even more importantly the different levels of abstraction will simplify
    the application access and usage since data will be presented in a manner required
    by applications. 3.3.4. Third party Third party should develop applications for
    the end users in the form of schedulers, regulators, and load balancers (Fan et
    al., 2010). A scheduler is a tool responsible for defining time slots in which
    the dual nature appliances will be active. A regulator is a tool responsible for
    the management of flexible devices, i.e. it will regulate the operation of air
    conditioners, heaters, dehumidifiers, etc. Load balancing should optimize energy
    consumption, considering current electricity price on the market and availability
    of electricity produced by the local renewable sources, if available. All these
    tools need advanced algorithms that use much more parameters than those obtained
    by the home devices. They should perform the complex tasks of mining and knowledge
    extraction from the available data in the cloud in order to create consumer and
    household profiles, or in simpler words the available smart home data should lead
    to the creation of personalized recommendations for all users (Liu et al., 2014).
    4. Challenges and solutions In this section, some guidelines for future developers
    of IoT solutions on how to make good choices when dealing with different challenges
    associated with practical issues are presented. 4.1. Edge (fog) computing Edge
    computing or fog computing is the process of data processing at the edge of the
    network. In this paradigm it is expected that the knowledge extraction process
    starts as early as the time the data is sensed i.e. at the sensor side. There
    are many reasons to employ this approach, but some of the more prominent ones
    are the energy saving, data volume reduction and latency reduction. Each object/entity
    in the IoT can consume a huge amount of energy if its communication is not optimized.
    For smart objects, in terms of energy consumption, local computation is an operation
    cheaper than communication. Hence, the effort should be shifted toward developing
    lightweight algorithms for local data processing. This approach will decrease
    the data volume and will avoid sending huge portions of raw data. Instead, only
    metadata will be transmitted (data about the data). Reducing the number of transmissions
    among IoT devices is also very important in order to avoid latency issues and
    saturation of the wireless channels. For these reasons, different data reduction
    techniques should be employed to minimize the communication overhead. There are
    three main techniques used for data reduction: data compression, data prediction
    and in-network processing (Stojkoska et al., 2012). For example, if data is not
    needed in real time, data compression (like delta compression) can be used. Otherwise,
    different filters can be used for real-time sensor data prediction, most of them
    based on adaptive filtering techniques, like moving average (MA), autoregressive
    (AR) model, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), least mean square (LMS), and
    LMS with variable step size (LMS-VSS) (Risteska Stojkoska et al., 2014, Stojkoska
    et al., 2012). Prediction is performed at each device and at the hub, i.e. predictions
    are made simultaneously on both sides. If the sensed value differs significantly
    from the predicted value (the difference is above a predefined threshold emax),
    the smart device should send the measurement/data to the hub. Otherwise, the predicted
    value is considered to be “reliable” and is used to feed the filter for future
    predictions. This paradigm is known as “dual prediction scheme” (Santini and Romer,
    2006). In-network processing is the process of consecutive data processing on
    their way to the destination. As data travel through intermediate nodes, some
    aggregating operations are performed. 4.2. Big data The IoT-generated data come
    in big amounts, are variable in terms of structure, often arrive at real-time,
    and might be of uncertain provenance. This volume, velocity and variety (not to
    mention variable veracity) make the storing and analytics solution, which will
    generate useful insights, a very complex one (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). Traditional
    SQL-queried relational database management systems (RDBMSs) are unsuitable for
    the task, which is why big data solutions are needed. The IoT Cloud (Alamri et
    al., 2013, Botta et al., 2016) will enable the long-time storage and complex analysis
    of this data. The challenge of handling big data is a critical one, since the
    overall performance is directly proportional to the properties of the data management
    service (Dobre and Xhafa, 2014). A constellation of tools has evolved to service
    the market, most notably Apache''s open-source Hadoop distributed data processing
    system, plus various NoSQL databases and a range of business intelligence platforms.
    There are multiple vendors that operate in different parts of the analytics pipeline
    (data integration, data storage, core analytics and data presentation), as well
    as ''full-stack'' vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and Software AG. Both
    proprietary and open source solutions adopt alternative database technologies
    for big data (Copie et al., 2013): time-series, key-value, document store, wide
    column stores, and graph databases. However, to date there is no simple answer
    to the big data management question in the Cloud (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). The
    problem becomes even more cumbersome when the factor of data integrity is taken
    into account, not only because of its impact on the quality of service, but also
    for its security and privacy related aspects especially on outsourced data (Liu
    et al., 2015). 4.3. Networking Networking protocols for Internet of Things solutions
    can be divided in smart device networks and traditional networks that are designed
    primarily for high data rates. Smart home networking protocols are expected to
    adopt the protocols already established in Wireless Sensor Networks and Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M) communications, with no clear winner so far (Chen et al., 2012). Adding
    many advanced features to the protocol increases the cost, and reduces the ease-of-use.
    Designing an appealing protocol is not a trivial task, and is usually a tradeoff
    between the cost and the performances. In perspective of the topology to be used,
    mesh is the most suitable choice of network topology for wireless communication
    due to the presence of obstacles in the home, like walls, furniture, etc. Dual-mesh,
    which means that the network operates as both wired and wireless, is an appropriate
    solution for households that have a previously installed wired home automation
    system. There are many protocols designed for smart home solutions. Some of them
    dated back from the period when smart home was reserved for the wealthy households,
    and many new that try to combine the old design principles with the newly developed
    technologies. X10 is the oldest protocol that was initially wired, but new modifications
    make it dual-mesh. Insteon is another example of a dual-mesh protocol, which was
    recently integrated into Google owned Nest, Apple''s HomeKit platform and Apple
    Watch (Darbee, 2013). The more recent protocols work only wirelessly (ZigBee,
    Z-Wave, 6lowpan, EnOcean, etc.). There are different ways to classify protocols,
    and none of them is exhaustive enough. Using Google Scholar, we queried for publications
    that cover each of these protocols and the summary statistics for the number of
    publications is given in Table 3. This data is of November 2015. Table 3. Number
    of publications according to Google Scholar. Empty Cell Zigbee 6lowpan Z-Wave
    Bacnet X10 EnOcean Insteon Without patents 228000 9790 5770 6700 1840 1520 720
    With patents 264000 9010 7650 7550 1890 2440 1080 Table 3 shows that ZigBee is
    the most popular protocol, but this is true only for the scientific research and
    academia (ZigBee, 2015). In practice, the Z-Wave is the one that has the most
    manufacturers, mainly due to their interoperability. According to Z-Wave Alliance,
    over 35 million Z-Wave products have been sold since they began selling in 2005
    (Z-Wave Alliance, 2015). The basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave and Insteon are
    shown in Table 4. Theoretically, a Z-Wave network is limited to a maximum of 232
    Z-Wave devices, but most vendors recommend using about 30–50 (Darbee, 2013). For
    example, MiOS LTD with their Vera products recommends 50 devices for Vera Lite,
    and 100 devices for Vera 3 (MiOS, 2015). Table 4. Basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave

    2.4 GHz Gaussian, frequency-shift keying (GFSK) manchester channel encoding Frequency-shift
    keying (FSK) The price is another aspect that can be considered when choosing
    the right protocol. A ZigBee Licence costs $3500 per year, while Z-Wave charges
    $750 per device model for the logo (Darbee, 2013). A more detailed comparison
    of the smart home protocols can be found in Withanage et al. (2014). Each level
    of the IoT framework should have particular features. We identify and summarize
    the required capabilities of IoT devices at each level in Table 5. Table 5. Capabilities
    of IoT parts for smart home management system. Empty Cell Network topology Communication

    LTE/optical fiber/Wi-Fi very high very high Third party not applicable LTE/optical
    fiber/Wi-Fi high application dependent, from intermediate to high 4.4. Interoperability
    Currently, the main issue for the development of a generic smart home solution
    is the cost associated with integrating smart home devices (Ko et al., 2011).
    Interoperability is the key to open markets to competitive solutions in IoT (Lu
    et al., 2011, Misra et al., 2015). Leading companies in the world that are producing
    smart devices are working toward achieving full interoperability that will ensure
    easy integration with the existing Internet. Z-Wave products are already interoperable
    with their previous versions, while ZigBee Allience with its Zigbee 3.0 has announced
    this feature to be implemented by the end of 2015. ZigBee has formed many committees
    that aim to define product properties required for different vendors to build
    interoperable devices for different public application profiles, like Home Automation,
    Health Care, Remote Control, etc. Still, products are not necessarily interoperable
    across these profiles and across revisions within a profile. On the other side,
    X10 and Insteon are fully interoperable with each other (Darbee, 2013). Table
    6 summarizes the interoperability features of these protocols. Table 6. Interoperability
    features of Insteon, X10, Z-Wave and ZigBee. Empty Cell Insteon X10 Z-Wave ZigBee
    ZigBee invisible to each other No No No Z-Wave invisible to each other No Yes
    X10 Yes Yes Insteon Yes 4.5. Security and privacy One of the most important issues
    of the emergent requirements facing the smart grid development is related to cyber
    security, both for the wireless and the wired parts of the systems (Ning et al.,
    2013, Schneps-Schneppe et al., 2012). The smart grid can be a target for cyber
    terrorists, which emerges as a critical concern for system designers. Because
    of the way in which data is transmitted, IoT is inherently vulnerable to most
    of the common attacks of wireless networks. Hence, IoT requires a security policy,
    but the cost for providing it needs to be as low as possible. Different approaches
    that provide security lightweight crypto-primitives should be investigated (Altolini
    et al., 2013), in order to provide authenticity (the device is not a malicious
    object), integrity (transmitted data is identical with the received data) and
    confidentiality (make data unreadable to others) (Dimitrievski et al., 2006).
    5. Conclusions This paper addresses the vision that the residential buildings
    would shift themselves toward modern households that would be an evolution of
    the passive household. They would have their own solar panels and small wind turbines
    to produce their own energy, thus they would be able to buy/sell energy from/to
    the smart power grid. As it is expected for smart objects to become omnipresent
    on the market and respectively in consumers'' households within the next few years,
    the need for IoT-based services for smart home will be inevitable. In this paper,
    a methodology is developed using different search queries to select the most relevant
    papers from the literature that address this topic. Selected papers were semantically
    divided into two main categories: WSN solutions and IoT concepts. This was rather
    expected considering that WSN is the pivotal technology which enabled the development
    of IoT. Although the WSN solutions are real life implementations that integrate
    devices inside a smart home, two disadvantages are identified, as they: • work
    separately and the data is used only for local optimization; • make an assumption
    of a fully (or near fully) automated home, which is a costly solution for most
    of the households. The second category of papers concerning IoT mainly presents
    concepts, theoretical frameworks and visions for possible smart home/grid solutions.
    There is a lack of a unifying platform that would transform these separate individual
    applications into a single infrastructure, a platform that can be further used
    for advanced data mining and knowledge extraction. The desired solution should
    aggregate all available smart home data within a self-learning engine in order
    to create personalized recommendations for all users, regardless of the level
    of automation present at their homes. The solution should not entail any additional
    cost for the consumers, as it should not require any particular hardware. The
    main contribution of this paper is the IoT based holistic framework, which incorporates
    different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature.
    This integral IoT framework is specific to the smart home application domain,
    with the cloud being the central element in the system that serves not only to
    collect and store data, but also as a gateway to third-parties interested in developing
    applications. In this context, we additionally survey the smart home management
    system, and we identify a model with a set of specific tasks that should be performed
    at each level in order to meet the system requirements. As a second contribution,
    this paper discusses challenges for IoT based smart home solutions, with emphasis
    on practical issues like data processing, networking and interoperability of smart
    home protocols. Fog and edge computing are promising approaches for improving
    the energy saving inside the IoT network by reducing the number of transmissions
    between the IoT devices. Although there are some publications that investigate
    this potential, a lot of research and work still needs to be done. New big data
    solutions and algorithms are needed to deal with the potentially vast amount of
    data generated within the IoT. A constellation of tools has already appeared in
    the last few years, as there are multiple vendors that operate in different parts
    of the analytics pipeline. Another big issue is the interoperability, which is
    a prerequirement for opening the markets to competitive solutions in IoT. The
    current situation is that devices with different protocols cannot communicate,
    and, more important, the products with the same protocols are not necessarily
    interoperable across different profiles and across revisions within the same profile.

    twin can be defined as a virtual representation of a physical asset enabled through
    data and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring, controlling,
    and improved decision making. Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics
    solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management
    tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to
    reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications.
    Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system,
    avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital
    twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical
    intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary
    systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary
    modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies
    and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling
    perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges
    and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various
    stakeholders. A working digital twin of an offshore oil platform. Screenshot from

    With the recent wave of digitalization, the latest trend in every industry is
    to build systems and approaches that will help it not only during the conceptualization,
    prototyping, testing and design optimization phase but also during the operation
    phase with the ultimate aim to use them throughout the whole product life cycle
    and perhaps much beyond. While in the first phase, the importance of numerical
    simulation tools and lab-scale experiments is not deniable, in the operational
    phase, the potential of real-time availability of data is opening up new avenues
    for monitoring and improving operations throughout the life cycle of a product.
    Grieves [1] in his whitepaper named the presence of this virtual representation
    as “Digital Twin”. Since its presence among the most promising technology trends
    in Gartner’s recent report [2], the Digital Twin concept has become more popular
    in both academia and industry (e.g., see [3] for a non-exhaustive glimpse at the
    major patented developments), apparently with many different attributes to include
    or exclude in its definition. For example, Hicks [4] differentiates a digital
    twin from a virtual prototype and redefines the concept as an appropriately synchronized
    body of useful information (structure, function, and behaviour) of a physical
    entity in virtual space, with flows of information that enable convergence between
    the physical and virtual states. According to the authors in [5], digital twins
    represent real objects or subjects with their data, functions, and communication
    capabilities in the digital world. Although the first mention of the word digital
    twin can be traced back to only the year 2000 when Grieves mentioned it in the
    context of manufacturing, without a formal mention, several industries and organizations
    had been exploiting the idea at varying levels of sophistication. Some examples
    of these are the log of patients health information and history tracking, online
    operation monitoring of process plants, traffic and logistics management, dynamic
    data assimilation enabled weather forecasting, real-time monitoring systems to
    detect leakages in oil and water pipelines, and remote control and maintenance
    of satellites or space-stations. More recently, the necessity to formalize and
    utilize the full potential of digital twin concepts arises from a combination
    of technology push and market pull. While the need for online monitoring, flexibility
    in operation, better inventory management and personalization of services are
    the most obvious market pull, availability of cheap sensors and communication
    technologies, phenomenal success of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI), in particular, Deep Learning (DL), new developments in the computational
    hardware (Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)), cloud
    and edge computing are certainly the major technology push. In this regard, it
    will not be an overstatement to say that the digital twin concept is going to
    bring revolution across several industry sectors. The topic of digital twin is
    so diverse and complicated such that it is almost impossible to cover all its
    aspects in a single article. The current paper, therefore, is an effort to present
    a reasonably comprehensive overview of the concept from a purely modeling perspective.
    In doing so we plan to answer the following questions: What is a digital twin?
    Is digital twin a new concept or has it existed with different names in the past?
    What values are expected out of the digital twin concepts? What are the major
    challenges in building digital twins? What are the existing and emerging enabling
    technologies to facilitate its adoption? What will be the social implications
    of this technology? What is expected from relevant stakeholders to extract maximum
    benefits from the digital twin technology? In Fig. 1, we give a taste of what
    a state-of-the art digital twin of an offshore oil platform looks like. The digital
    twin is continuously updated with sensor data in near real-time. The sensor data
    can be augmented with synthetic data generated from simulators which bring physical
    realism at high spatio-temporal resolutions. The digital twin does not only give
    real-time information for more informed decision making but can also make predictions
    about how the asset will evolve or behave in the future. In an ideal setting,
    a digital twin will be indistinguishable from the physical asset both in terms
    of appearance and behaviour with the added advantage of making future predictions.
    In fact the digital twin shown in Fig. 1 also gives the possibility for humans
    to interact physically with the asset using an avatar. Based on our literature
    survey we also came across the term digital siblings. Digital siblings can be
    considered as copies of the physical asset which need not necessarily run in real-time
    but can be used to test out hypothetical scenarios for “what if ?” analysis and
    risk assessment. FIGURE 1. A working digital twin of an offshore oil platform.
    Screenshot from Kongsberg Digital’s Dynamical Digital Twin for oil and gas, demonstrating
    interlinked 2D process diagrams and 3D visualizations of an oil and gas production
    facility enriched with real-time data from the asset. The color on the pipes shown
    in the 3D rendering can be used to show data such as flow rates, water / gas /
    oil fractions etc. The Dynamical Digital Twin can also run and explore what-if
    scenarios generated by process simulators in which case it will be more appropriately
    called a Digital Sibling. Copyright Kongsberg Digital 2019. Show All We now start
    this paper with a brief description of eight values (Section II) that any digital
    twin is capable of generating followed by a presentation of the state-of-the-art
    technology in five diverse application areas (Section III). Common challenges
    across these application areas are identified in Section IV. To address these
    challenges, certain enabling technologies are required. Some of these technologies
    already exist but most of them are at different stages of development. A comprehensive
    overview of the enabling technologies is presented in Section V followed by a
    section on the socio-economic impacts of the technology (Section VI). Finally,
    the paper concludes with reflection and recommendations targeted towards five
    distinct stakeholders. SECTION II. Value of Digital Twin Building up on a report
    from Oracle [6], the following eight value additions of digital twin are identified:
    Real-time remote monitoring and control: Generally, it is almost impossible to
    gain an in-depth view of a very large system physically in real-time. A digital
    twin owing to its very nature can be accessible anywhere. The performance of the
    system can not only be monitored but also controlled remotely using feedback mechanisms.
    Greater efficiency and safety: It is envisioned that digital twinning will enable
    greater autonomy with humans in the loop as and when required. This will ensure
    that the dangerous, dull and dirty jobs are allocated to robots with humans controlling
    them remotely. This way humans will be able to focus on more creative and innovative
    jobs. Predictive maintenance and scheduling: A comprehensive digital twinning
    will ensure that multiple sensors monitoring the physical assets will be generating
    big data in real-time. Through a smart analysis of data, faults in the system
    can be detected much in advance. This will enable better scheduling of maintenance.
    Scenario and risk assessment: A digital twin or to be more precise a digital sibling
    of the system will enable what-if analyses resulting in better risk assessment.
    It will be possible to perturb the system to synthesize unexpected scenarios and
    study the response of the system as well as the corresponding mitigation strategies.
    This kind of analysis without jeopardizing the real asset is only possible via
    a digital twin. Better intra- and inter-team synergy and collaborations: With
    greater autonomy and all the information at a finger tip, teams can better utilize
    their time in improving synergies and collaborations leading to greater productivity.
    More efficient and informed decision support system: Availability of quantitative
    data and advanced analytics in real-time will assist in more informed and faster
    decision makings. Personalization of products and services: With detailed historical
    requirements, preferences of various stakeholders and evolving market trends and
    competitions, the demand of customized products and services are bound to increase.
    A digital twin in the context of factories of the future will enable faster and
    smoother gear shifts to account for changing needs. Better documentation and communication:
    Readily available information in real-time combined with automated reporting will
    help keep stakeholders well informed thereby improving transparency. SECTION III.
    Diverse Applications of Digital Twin Five diverse applications of a digital twin
    are selected to get an in-depth understanding of the state-of-the-art, common
    challenges, corresponding solutions and future needs to bring more physical realism
    into it. A. Health Health care is one of the sectors which is going to benefit
    the most from the concept of digital twin. The emergence of smart wearable devices,
    organized storage of health data of individuals and societies, need for personalized
    and targeted medication and inter-weaving of engineering and medical disciplines
    are the major driving forces for the realm of smart and connected health. Psychologists
    have begun to use physical activity levels using actigraphs to predict the onset
    of different episodes of bipolar disorder [7]. Fernández-Ruiz [8] suggests combining
    computational simulations with tissue engineering for more reliable, successful
    and predictable clinical outcomes. In [9], the authors give insight into how a
    digital twin framework for remote surgery might look like. Bruynseels et al. [10]
    projects digital twin as an emerging technology building silico representations
    of an individual that dynamically reflects molecular status, physiological status
    and life style over time. Zhang et al. [11] gives an overview of the latest developments
    in organ-on-a-chip (OOC) engineering. OOC synthesized from the tissues of a patient
    offers an alternative to conventional preclinical models for drug screening. The
    chip can replicate key aspects of human physiology crucial for the understanding
    of drug effects. By combining several such OOC one can generate a full body-on-a-chip
    (BOC). Skardal et al. [12] gives the progress made in this direction. Although
    both OOC and BOC are seen as disruptive technologies in the context of digital
    twin (or digital sibling to be more precise), in the more near future a digital
    twin of human body can be worked out using most of the technologies and data already
    available. To begin with, the health care system in developed countries already
    has recorded health history of its inhabitants. However, one issue is that this
    monitoring is not regular and a big chunk of the young population is left out
    because they visit physicians only when sick. To this end, the data collected
    by smart wearables might hold huge value since it can help balance the database
    enabling longitudinal studies. Furthermore, in the presence of a digital twin
    of the human body of a patient, a surgeon can already train himself even before
    physically conducting the surgery. However, for the digital twin to be a reality
    there are many technical, ethical and privacy issues that should be resolved.
    Physical models for biochemistry, fluid and nutrient transport, and other mechanistic
    models are required to better simulate the internal working of a human body (organs,
    blood flow, signal transmission etc). The authors in [13] explained a “computational
    man” vision, which is a dynamic fast-running computational model of major physiological
    systems, such as the circulatory, respiratory or excretory system in a human body.
    In the prototype for remote surgery [9], the authors highlighted the importance
    of low latency, high level of security and reliability hinting at how important
    roles communication technologies (like 5G) and cybersecurity (encryption technologies)
    are going to play. Efficient Computer Aided Modeling (CAM) and Virtual Reality
    (VR) will also be instrumental in this context. Jimenez et al. [14] also advocated
    building digital twin technologies in medicine (see, for example, [15], [16] for
    a detailed description of medical cyber-physical systems). Kocabas et al. [17]
    detailed such medical cyber-physical system considering the layers of data acquisition,
    data preprocessing, cloud system and action module. The secure integration of
    wireless body area networks (WBAN) with cloud computing platforms and Internet
    of Things (IoT) networks has been considered as another major challenge in healtcare
    applications [18]. B. Meteorology The meteorological institutes all over the world
    have been using the concepts of digital twin extensively. They utilize solid models
    of a region (terrain, buildings), high fidelity physics simulators and big data
    coming from multiple sources to provide both long and short term weather prediction
    which are ultimately communicated using stunning rendering of the numerical results
    via web browser, television or mobile applications (see, for example, [19]–[21]).
    The big data (terrain data, satellites, masts, radar, radiosonde, sea buoy, drones,
    LIDAR) handled in meteorology is characterized by the high 4Vs (volume, velocity,
    variety and veracity). In this application area, one can find some of the most
    advanced methods for big data assimilation in massively parallelized numerical
    simulators capable of operating in real-time, and excellent long-term and well
    documented data archival and retrieval mechanisms. One of the reasons for the
    immense success of the digital twin concept within the field of meteorology is
    a relatively much lower bar regarding privacy and confidentiality of the data.
    There is a lot to be learned from this field. While it will not be an exaggeration
    to term weather forecasting as the most matured digital twin concept, there is
    still enough scope for improvements with relative ease. The meteorological services
    have poor quality in those locations throughout the world where there are not
    enough weather stations or observation data. The precision meteorology aims to
    improve weather forecasting by updating predictions through numerical modeling,
    data collection, data analytics, and technology adoption enhancement. A greater
    than ever penetration of smartphones in almost all societies has remained an underutilized
    technology. By 2020 there will be more than 6 billion smartphones in the world.
    Compared to the paltry 10,000 official weather stations this number is huge. Each
    smartphone is equipped to measure raw data such as atmospheric pressure, temperature
    and humidity to access atmospheric conditions. While the analysis of data from
    only a few phones might not yield much, analysis of data from billions of phones
    will certainly be game changer. In fact Price et al. [22] has already demonstrated
    the use of smartphones for monitoring atmospheric tides. Nipen et al. [23] has
    recently shown the value of crowd sourced data in improving operational weather
    forecasts. In weather and climate centers, large volume and large variety observational
    data streams have been used to improve our knowledge of the current state of the
    atmosphere and ocean, that provide an initial condition for forecasts of future
    states. As an integrated approach, observing system simulation experiment (OSSE)
    systems mimic the procedures used to analyze such satellite, balloon, or surface
    tower observations for specifying states of the atmosphere [24]–[28]. An OSSE
    can be considered as a digital twin to use computational models to test new systems
    before their physical prototype is actually built or deployed. It is anticipated
    that in the future such OSSE techniques will be applied to diverse domains with
    the use of increasingly advanced and sophisticated simulations of nature and observations
    [29]. A near real-time weather forecast is a must for environmental situational
    awareness for improved decision-making scenarios [27]. Examples include, but are
    not limited to, air traffic management, severe-weather watch, wind-turbines adaptation,
    and so on. To achieve so, an increasing number of observations should be assimilated
    instantaneously since the lifespan of many weather phenomena can be less than
    a few minutes. Solving a purely physics based model with the required resolution
    while being compatible with the time-scales of natural phenomena might be prohibitive.
    Therefore, a parallel accelerated digital twin, capable of duplicating the physical
    system with acceptable accuracy, could offer a realistic solution to assimilate
    these short-time observations. The role of this twin is to give quick guidelines
    whether or not a decision needs to be taken. This is specifically important with
    the intrinsic stochastic characteristics of weather systems, and hence the model
    should be able to monitor those seemingly-random sequential observations [30]–[32].
    Data-driven tools do an excellent job in terms of online time-cost, however relying
    only on data and disregarding the known and well-established physics is not a
    wise step. Hybridization techniques have been demonstrated to give superior performance
    to either of the individual components alone. Therefore, a digital assimilation
    twin can be built to provide nature-informed indicators for near-time events.
    Besides, to test new models and assimilation tools before adopting them into current
    operational platforms, they need to be tested with some synthetic observations
    simulated from realistic nature runs (NR) [29]. To maintain a realistic benchmark,
    these NR should mimic the natural phenomena with their respective time-scales
    and provide timely observations. ML and AI tools have shown extraordinary performance
    learning from available data. Supplying a digital twin with sufficient amount
    of real (noisy) data and posing the well-established physical constraints can
    provide a trained and informed nature replica with realistic stochastic behavior.
    In particular, this stochasticity is important for testing the predictability
    of extreme events that usually occur without previous long-term indicators [33]–[35].
    C. Manufacturing and Process Technology Manufacturing and process technology industries
    have a history of exploiting the digital twin concepts without explicitly mentioning
    it. However, with the current trend of digitalization and demand for customized,
    high quality products in highly variable batches with short delivery times, the
    industries are forced to adapt their production and manufacturing style. In this
    regard, even these industries are reevaluating the digital twin concepts and are
    trying to include latest enabling technologies (discussed later in Section V)
    in their workflow. According to a report by BCG [36], Industry 4.0 is seen as
    the convergence of nine digital technologies: big data and analytics, cybersecurity,
    industrial IoT, simulation, augmented reality, additive manufacturing, advanced
    robotics, cloud services, horizontal and vertical system integration. Borangiu
    et al. [37] stresses the importance of cloud services in the context of resource
    virtualization as an enabler for Factory of the Future (FoF) known by different
    initiatives Industry 4.0 (Germany), Advanced Manufacturing (USA), e-factory (Japan)
    and Intelligent Manufacturing (China) but similar goals. Mukherjee and DebRoy
    [38] and Knapp et al. [39] proposed a conceptual framework of a digital twin for
    3D printing. In their models, the computationally demanding mechanistic models
    (for heat transfer, fluid flow and material deposition and transformation) are
    certainly the bottleneck. By providing an overview of the historical perspective
    on the data lifecycle in manufacturing, in [40] and [41] the authors highlighted
    the role of big data in supporting smart manufacturing. The state-of-the-art of
    digital twin applications in industrial settings has been studied systematically
    in [42], where the authors concluded that the most popular digital twin application
    area is developing the advanced prognostics and health management (PHM) systems.
    A five-level cyber-physical system structure has been proposed specifically for
    PHM in manufacturing applications [43]. In determining the major concepts and
    key methodologies, the authors in [44] reviewed intelligent manufacturing systems.
    A functional mock-up interface has been offered as a tool independent standard
    to improve model-based design between the manufacturers and suppliers [45]. Such
    a platform independent co-simulation framework can be found in [46]. In [47],
    the authors detailed the use of functional mock-up units for the digital twin
    applications. A digital twin approach has been also highlighted in [48] as a real-time
    control and optimization tool towards individualized production systems. D. Education
    Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which make university courses available for
    free or at a very nominal cost is a disruptive technology challenging traditional
    classroom teaching. In this paradigm change in pedagogy, we are undergoing a plethora
    of opportunities in personalizing education for a more effective teaching. Different
    students based on their natural talent, interest and backgrounds have different
    needs. Although universities and schools are recording more and more data about
    the students, the feedback loop is not complete. A digital twin for students will
    help counter this shortfall. With the emergence of artificial intelligence driving
    bots, personalized education and counseling will be more and more available at
    no additional cost. In fact, a brief discussion on the power of artificial intelligence-powered
    personalization in MOOC learning can be found in [49]. A personalized adaptive
    learning frameworks has been also constructed in [50] using a smart learning environment.
    In [51], the authors developed a smart education concept incorporating data mining
    tools. The role of IoT in constructing a smart educational process can be found
    in [52]. The authors in [53] explained the gradual progress from e-learning to
    m-learning (mobile learning), u-learning (ubiquitous learning), and s-learning
    (smart learning). In [54], the authors demonstrated a digital data management
    framework for accreditation purposes in order to help assessment process considering
    data collection, characterization, analysis and implementation. This might also
    help to map program’s educational objectives to student outcomes [55]. The authors
    in [56] discussed a set of demanding skills that are critically important for
    the emerging digital twin paradigm and highlighted relevant business model changes
    to accommodate with the Industry 4.0 digital revolution. The growing gap between
    industry and academia has been highlighted in [57], where the authors drew attention
    to tremendous opportunities from a data science perspective. Combining the digital
    twin of the education sector with that of other industrial sectors, it would be
    more efficient in grooming targeted talents. E. Cities, Transportation and Energy
    Sector The digital twin relevant technologies become more mature to offer smart
    solutions in construction, transportation and energy sectors. In [58], the authors
    studied a digital twin concept to engage citizens with city planning with an idea
    of pairing physical objects with their digital counterparts. The authors in [59]
    discussed the requirements of the scalable cloud model that can be used for smart
    cities. A collection of essays about Singapore, arguably considered the smartest
    city in the world, can be found in [60]. In his editorial note, Batty [61] discussed
    the progress towards digital twins concerning urban planning and city science.
    A smart city paradigm that can enable increased visibility into cities’ human-infrastructure-technology
    interactions has been explained in [62], in which spatio-temporal city dynamics
    was integrated into a data analytics platform at the real-time intersection of
    reality and virtuality. Smart grids use sensors and digital communications technologies
    to detect and react to local changes in power usage. A cyber-physical system perspective
    to the smart grid technologies can be found in [63]. The adaptation of the digital
    twin technology for applications in power system control centers has been recently
    studied in [64]. In [65], the authors used a faster than real-time digital twin
    in predicting dynamic behaviour of smart grid systems. In [66], the authors outlined
    a cyber-physical system approach to control large scale road freight transportation
    problems including minimized fuel consumption with integrated routing and transport
    planning. An integration approach between vehicles and mobile cloud computing
    has been discussed in [67]. A vision for the integration of cyberspace and physical
    space has been discussed in [68] to tackle some challenges in aviation industry.
    In [69], the authors provided a hybrid artifact solution for air traffic control,
    in which paper and digital media are identical and have equal importance, by suggesting
    tangible interaction and augmented reality. A discussion on digital artifacts
    related to simple examples of structural engineering can be found in [70]. The
    recent technologies related to the Industry 4.0 have been recently reviewed for
    oil and gas sector [71]. Highlighting the digital shift, the authors in [72] discussed
    the integration of such technologies for improving energy efficiency in smart
    factories with the aim of reducing both production costs and greenhouse gas emissions.
    Fault detection and diagnostics issues in built environment can be found in [73]
    towards improved Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems. As discussed in
    [74], BIMs constructed from a CAD model do not often capture details of a facility
    as it was actually built. In [75], the authors introduced BIM digital twins for
    better assessment and development of the design, construction and performance
    of residential buildings. A full scale digital twin of a district heating and
    cooling network aligned with the visions of Industry 4.0 can be found in [76].
    SECTION IV. Common Challenges As seen in the previous section, the concept of
    digital twin is already in use in several application areas, however, in order
    to make digital twins completely indistinguishable from their physical counterparts,
    many challenges have to be addressed. Digital twins should consider application-specific
    issues in terms of time critical, safety critical and mission critical services
    [77]–[81]. The feasibility and challenges of using a digital twin to perform functionality
    and cyber-security analysis is discussed in [82]. In a similar context, the authors
    in [83] provided a compound table that touches on the importance of major cyber-physical
    system challenges for various application domains. Their discussion includes detailed
    definition for interoperability (composability, scalability, heterogeneity), security
    (integrity, confidentiality, availability), dependability (reliability, maintainability,
    availability, safety), sustainability (adaptability, resilience, reconfigurability,
    efficiency), reliability (robustness, predictability, maintainability), and predictability
    (accuracy, compositionality). In [84], the authors discussed various signal processing
    related challenges in digital twin technologies. Strict requirements for explainability
    and the resulting data protection laws now require that the decisions that are
    made for human should be explainable to humans [85]. For example, human factor
    perspectives on auto driving systems can be found in a recent study [86]. With
    the rapid development of the AI technologies in mind, the moral machine experiment
    [87] provides many insights how machines might make moral decisions. In the context
    of the current paper we stress on challenges belonging to four categories that
    the modelling community should focus on. Firstly, the success of digital twin
    technology depends on a real-time two way connection between the physical asset
    and its digital twin to bring in physical realism without any compromises. Major
    challenges in ensuring this relates to spatio-temporal resolution of sensor data,
    latency in communication, large data volume, large data generation rate, large
    variety of data, large veracity of data and fast archival retrieval and online
    processing of data. Secondly, as the physical asset evolves in time it requires
    a corresponding evolution of the models while still maintaining backward compatibility.
    Thirdly, as most of the physical assets for which one can envision digital twins
    will require high level of safety and security, there will be a need for greater
    transparency and interpretability of the decisions taken based on digital twins.
    This will require models which are interpretable and physically consistent. Finally,
    the digital twin needs to be presented to the end user in a way that it appears
    indistinguishable from the physical asset and easier and intuitive to operate.
    All these challenges which require the immediate attention of the modellers are
    summarized in Table 1. In the next section we focus on enabling technologies that
    can have maximum impact on addressing these challenges irrespective of the application
    areas. TABLE 1 Mapping Between Common Challenges and Enabling Technologies SECTION
    V. Enabling Technologies It is quiet evident from the preceding section on common
    challenges that we need to develop technologies that will address those challenges.
    In this section we attempt to cover the enabling technologies under five major
    categories: physics-based modeling, data-driven modeling, big data cybernetics,
    infrastructure and platforms, and human-machine interface. The section is structured
    in way to address the challenges using various enabling technologies (see Table
    1 for an overview). A. Physics-Based Modeling So far, the engineering community
    has been driven mostly by a physics-based modeling approach (e.g., see Fig. 2
    for broader hierarchical stages). This approach consists of observing a physical
    phenomenon of interest, developing a partial understanding of it, putting the
    understanding in the form of mathematical equations and ultimately solving them.
    Due to partial understanding and numerous assumptions along the line from observation
    of a phenomenon to solution of the equations, one ends up ignoring a big chunk
    of the physics. The physics based approach can be subdivided broadly into experimental
    and numerical modeling. FIGURE 2. Physics based modeling: Based on first principles
    but can only model part of known physics due to assumptions at different stages.
    Show All 1) Experimental Modeling This approach consists of doing a lab or full
    scale experiment or surveys to understand a process or a phenomenon, developing
    correlations or models of quantities that can not be directly measured (or is
    expensive to measure) that can later be used in the the context of a digital twin.
    Hunt experiment [88] to collect health data, Bubble experiment [89] to collect
    urban boundary layer measurements, wind tunnel experiments to understand the physics
    of fluid flows are some of the examples that have been used to develop simplified
    parameterizations which are now widely used in the respective fields. Laboratory
    scale experiments are conducted on reduced scale of the problem under investigation.
    While it is possible to work with a reduced scale model, the scaling laws based
    on physics are almost always impossible to satisfy and hence limit their utility.
    Furthermore, both lab scale as well as field experiments can be extremely expensive,
    and they are therefore conducted for very coarse spatio-temporal resolutions.
    2) Three-Dimensional (3D) Modeling The first step towards numerical modeling is
    3D modeling. It is the process of developing a mathematical representation of
    any surface of an object. In most of the digital twins, 3D models are the starting
    point. The 3D models can either be constructed by a 3D scan of the object or through
    specialized software using equations and finally represented in terms of curves
    and surfaces. Almost all 3D models can be categorized into solid or shell models.
    In the context of digital twin, the 3D model goes as input to the physical simulators
    and hence its quality is of utmost importance. In this regard the representation
    of 3D finite element models using splines [90] (denoted isogeometric analysis)
    is interesting since it enables streamlining the whole workflow from 3D modeling
    to simulation and visualization of results, see [91]. During the last decade great
    progress towards adaptive refinement of isogeometric 3D models has been achieved.
    One popular method for local refinement is the Locally Refined B-splines (LR B-Splines),
    see [92] and [93]. In [94] and [95] LR B-Splines have been proposed for achieving
    more compact representation of the object geometry. In fact LR B-Splines approach
    appears to be very efficient in achieving high data compression ratios, which
    is very advantageous in a digital twin context. These new developments facilitate
    real-time geometry modifications (e.g., in simulating surgeries, deformation of
    structures) and associated simulations (e.g., fluid-structure simulations). 3)
    High Fidelity Numerical Simulators In order to add physical realism to any digital
    twin, the governing equations derived through physical modeling need to be solved.
    For simplified equations, sometimes analytical solutions are possible to derive
    but most of the time due to complexities, the equations need to be solved numerically
    on computers. Various discretization techniques over time have been developed
    for this. Some of the commonly used methods belong to one of the following categories:
    Finite Difference Method (FDM), Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Volume Method
    (FVM) and Discrete Element Method (DEM). A detailed history of these methods can
    be found in [96]. They have been extensively used in many open-source and commercial
    multi-physics simulation packages (e.g., OpenFOAM, FEniCS, Elmer, ANSYS, Comsol,
    STAR-CCM+ etc). A great advantage of any physics based modeling approaches is
    that they are generally less biased than data-driven models since they are governed
    by the laws of nature. However, the choices of which governing equation (e.g.
    turbulence model in fluid flows) should be applied for a given physical system
    might be biased in the sense that different scientists/engineers have different
    preferences (e.g. due to different educational background), but this kind of bias
    is transparent as long as the governing equations are stated. Furthermore, physics
    based models are highly interpretable along with their generalizability to seemingly
    very different problems governed by the same physics. At the same time, however,
    these models can be prone to numerical instability, can be too computationally
    demanding, can have huge errors owing to uncertainty in modeling and inputs, and
    lack of robust mechanisms to assimilate long term historical data. Another problem
    associated with numerical modeling of man made objects is the incompatibility
    between the way 3D geometries are modeled in CAD-systems and the way the equations
    are solved in numerical simulators. It is estimated that 80% of the total time
    goes into cleaning the geometries and pre-processing, if not more, and only the
    remaining 20% for actual simulation and analysis. To alleviate this problem Hughes
    et al. [90] in 2005 came up with a novel method for analysis known as the Isogemetric
    Analysis. The approach offers the possibility of integrating finite element analysis
    with any conventional NURBS-based CAD design tools. Since 2005, there has been
    an explosion of publication in this field. The method has been utilized to solve
    a large array of problems ranging from fluid mechanics [97], [98], to solid mechanics
    to fluid-structure interaction [99], [100] as well as adaptive computational mechanics
    based on a posteriori error estimates [101] and [102]. Today advanced numerical
    simulators are e.g. used to improve surgical procedures and develop patient-specific
    models that enable predictive treatment of cardiovascular diseases. High-performing
    simulators capable of handling a billion degrees of freedom are opening new vistas
    in simulation-based science and engineering and combined with multiscale modeling
    techniques have improved significantly the predictive capabilities. Thus, the
    dream of establishing numerical laboratories (e.g. numerical wind tunnels) can
    now be realized for many interesting real world systems. Despite their immense
    success, the use of high-fidelity simulator has so far been limited to the design
    phase of man made engineering objects/systems. Unless their computational efficiency
    is improved by several orders of magnitude their full potential will remain under-utilized
    in a digital twin context. However, the great advances of the high-performance
    simulators during the last two decades qualify (many of) them to be denoted “high-fidelity”
    models that can serve to develop “Reduced Order Models” (ROM), see below, which
    may be used to establish predictive digital twins. B. Data-Driven Modeling While
    physics based models are the workhorse at the design phase, with the abundant
    supply of data in a digital twin context, opensource cutting edge and easy-to-use
    libraries (tensorflow, torch, openAI), cheap computational infrastructure (CPU,
    GPU and TPU) and high quality, readily available training resources, data-driven
    modeling is becoming very popular. Compared to the physics based modeling approach,
    as illustrated in Fig. 3, this approach is based on the assumption that since
    data is a manifestation of both known and unknown physics, by developing a data-driven
    model, one can account for the full physics. In this section we present the state-of-the-art
    starting from data generation and safety to advanced data driven modeling techniques.
    FIGURE 3. Data-driven modeling: Data is seen as a manifestation of both known
    and unknown physics. Show All 1) Data Generation One of the main reasons for the
    recent popularity of digital twins is the availability of cheap and miniaturized
    sensors which are capable of recording all possible kinds of imaginable data:
    text, audio, RGB images, hyperspectral images and videos. These miniaturized sensors
    can be installed on moving vehicles, drones, small satellites and underwater vehicles
    to quickly span all the four dimensions (three in space and one in time). Crowd
    sourcing of data because of the popularity of smart phones is also contributing
    massively towards data generation. It has been used to build up comprehensive
    databases of urban landcover World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT
    [103]) database and local weather using NETATMO stations [104]. Online surveys
    and activities on social networking sites have created huge databases which are
    being used for training advanced ML models that are now being widely used for
    analyzing data. 2) Data Preprocessing, Management and Ownership With huge amount
    of data comes the problem of quality, management and ownership resolution of the
    data. For a correct working of digital twin there will be a need to improve the
    quality of data and compress them on the fly. Algorithms are required for automatic
    outlier detection and filling of missing data. At the moment very simplistic models
    like Principal Component and multidimensional interpolation techniques are utilized
    to fix these issues. However, more advanced methods like Restricted Boltzman Machine
    and Generative Adversarial Networks can be employed. Martens [105] has developed
    IDLE (Intensity observed = Displacement model of (Local intensity model) + Error)
    methods for on the fly learning from big data stream. As mentioned earlier LRB-S
    representations can be used for achieving massive compression ratios. The problem
    of ownership will be a tough nut to crack. The issue of data ownership can be
    complicated due to the involvement of different stakeholders who participated
    in the generation, processing, value addition or analysis of data. This can jeopardize
    the smooth working of any digital twin concept. 3) Data Privacy and Ethical Issues
    For successful implementation of digital twins, trust in information system is
    extremely critical especially when stringent privacy laws are getting shaped,
    digital twin will be used more and more in safety critical applications. In this
    context, Nakamoto [106] presented two game changing concepts. The first one is
    bitcoins and the other is blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed, secured and
    verifiable record of information (e.g., data, transactions) linked together in
    a single chain. The information is stored inside cryprographic blocks connected
    in a sequential order in a chain. The validity of each new block is verified by
    a peer-to-peer network before it is linked to the blockchain using a crytographic
    hash generated from the contents of the previous block. This ensures that the
    chain is never broken and each block is permanently recorded. This provides maximum
    security, traceability and transparency in applications where blockchains can
    be employed. In the context of digital twin where traceability and security of
    information is of utmost importance, blockchain is foreseen to play an important
    role.It will ensure secured archival and retrieval of data facilitated through
    advanced cryptography. It will be practically impossible to loose data since due
    to its inherent decentralized nature the data is always retrievalable. It will
    remove the risk of malicious attacks. All of this will come with greater transparency
    and hence greater accountability. The businesses will also be able to put pre-set
    condition on the blockchain to control automation. Mandolla et al. [107] gives
    a nice insight into the exploitation of blockchain technology in building a digital
    twin for additive manufacturing with focus on aircraft industry, and Li et al.
    [108] introduces an extended socio-technical framework for the implementation
    of blockchain into the construction industry. The authors in [109] propose a blockchain
    based searchable encryption for electronic health record sharing. Reyna et al.
    [110] gives a detailed overview of integration of the blockchain technology with
    IoT, its challenges (related to scalability, privacy, security and a total dearth
    of censorship) and latest research work to alleviate the associated shortcomings.
    4) Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Smart data analysis using ML and
    AI is expected to play a major role in the context of digital twin. ML is the
    scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use
    in order to perform tasks effectively without being explicitly programmed to do
    so and instead relies on learning from data alone. Although the term was coined
    in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming
    and artificial intelligence, its real potential is being realized only recently
    when computers have begun to outperform humans in even creative tasks like art
    generation, script writing, text summarization, language translation and language
    interpretation and cross modal retreival [111]. Any ML can be broadly categorized
    into supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning
    is aimed at learning a mapping from independent variables to dependent variables.
    The mapping tasks can be either regression or classification. Most of the commonly
    used supervised algorithms are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support
    Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks.
    The recent success of ML in outperforming humans in image classification [112],
    [113], [114]) and games like GO is attributed to Deep Learning (DL) [115] or Deep
    Neural Network (DNN). Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) [116] can be seen as
    stochastic neural networks that learn the input probability distribution in supervised
    as well as unsupervised manner and hence can be a powerful tools in detecting
    anomalies. In the context of digital twin, temporal RBM can be used to model multivariate
    timeseries, convolutional RBM is used to understand structure in timeseries, mean
    co-variance RBM to understand the covariance structure of the data and for dimensionality
    reduction [117]. Shallow Autoencoders which are neural networks whose input and
    output layers are exactly the same and sandwich a layer with comparatively much
    reduced number of nodes have been in use for efficient linear data compression
    (similar to Principal Component Analysis (PCA)). However, just by stacking many
    more layers result in Deep Autoencoder. These have been used for very diverse
    applications like diabetes detection [118], action detection for surveillance
    [119], feature learning for process pattern recognition [120], denoising for speech
    enhancement [121] [122], fault diagnosis [123], social image understanding [124],
    low light image enhancement [125]. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is another
    DL method which although has achieved unprecedented success mainly in image classification
    (ImageNet, AlexNet, VGG, YOLO, ResNet, DenseNet etc.) exceeding human level accuracy,
    have also been extensively used in textual analysis. More recently Generative
    Adversarial Networks (GANs) [126] where two networks called generators and discriminators
    are trained to outperform each other resulting in generators which can create
    data which are indistinguishable from real ones has achieved huge success. The
    method has huge potential in improving the data quality like upscaling image resolution
    [127], denoising [128], filling missing data [129] all of which are relevant in
    the context of digital twins. As a powerful Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long
    Short Term Memory (LSTM) network has demonstrated phenomenal success in modeling
    data involving time. Karim et al. [130] demonstrated the use of LSTM in timeseries
    classification. In [131] LSTM was used to forecast petroleum production. By combining
    CNN and LSTM, Kim et al. in [132] demonstrated its value in making predictions
    of the energy consumption in residential areas. The predictive capability of LSTM
    in particular will be instrumental in creating future scenarios in the context
    of digital siblings when direct observation data will be unavailable. The supervised
    algorithm in a digital twin context will be used for making predictions / projections
    or for conducting sensitivity / what-if analysis. One of the shortfalls of supervised
    algorithms is the need of dependent variables (labeled data) which might not always
    be available as in the case of anomaly. Unbalanced or skewed data rarely results
    in reliable prediction models. Anomaly detection which is extremely important
    for online health monitoring of any system, the labeled data is rarely available
    in abundance to train a supervised algorithms. In such a situation unsupervised
    algorithms like self organized maps (SOM) [133] and clustering analysis [134]
    (k-mean, t-SNE [135]) have better utility. Another important application of unsupervised
    algorithms like PCA and Deep Autoencoder can be for on-the-fly data compression
    for real-time processing, communication and control of the system under operation.
    While supervised and unsupervised learning ML algorithms have been the most commonly
    employed algorithms in real applications, they are not of much use in the absence
    of enough data. Reinforcement Learning [136], though in its infancy has the potential
    to aid in such a data-deprived situation. Reinforcement learning is an area of
    ML in which instead of learning directly from the data, an agent figures out an
    optimal policy to maximize its long term cumulative gain. It can be a key enabler
    for smart decision making systems in the technologies related to the Industry
    4.0 (see also [137] for a nice discussion of the anatomy of a decision). For example,
    in [138], the authors illustrated how a reinforcement learning framework might
    support operation and maintenance of power grid applications. The algorithms [139]
    without any prior knowledge and starting to play random gains, in 24 hours, achieved
    super-human level performance in chess, shogi as well as Go and convincingly defeated
    a work-champion program in each case. Since then the algorithm has been applied
    to solve more engineering problems like advanced planning of autonomous vehicles
    [140], lung cancer detection in medical treatment [141], smart agriculture [142],
    UAV cluster task scheduling [143], chatbots [144], autonomous building energy
    assessment [145]. Some advantages of the data-driven models is that they keep
    on improving as more and more data (experiences) are fed into them. The training
    part of the data-driven modeling might experience issues associated with instabilities.
    However, once trained the models are stable for making predictions. At the same
    time the data-driven models have some downsides too. Most complicated models of
    this class specially the ones based on DNN are uninterpretable. In safety critical
    applications like automatic drug injection in humans, guidance and navigation
    of autonomous vehicles or oil well drilling, a black-box approach will be unacceptable.
    In fact the vulnerability of DNN have been been exposed beyond doubt in several
    recent works [146], [147], [148]. These models can also be extremely biased depending
    upon the data they were trained on. C. Big Data Cybernetics: The Art of Steering
    Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics in 1948 as “the scientific study of control
    and communication in the animal and the machine,” which can be easily linked to
    digital twins. The objective of cybernetics is to steer a system towards a reference
    point. To achieve this, the output of the system is continuously monitored and
    compared against a reference point. The difference, called the error signal is
    then applied as feedback to the controller which in turn generates a system input
    that can direct the system towards the reference point. At times the quantity
    of interest that is required to compare against the reference can not be measured
    directly and hence has to be inferred from other quantities that are easier and
    cheaper to measure. With an increase in computational power and availability of
    big data, there are two major improvement possible within the cybernetics framework.
    Firstly, the controllers can be improved by increasing its complexity to incorporate
    more physics. Secondly, the big data can be utilized for a better estimation of
    the quantity of interest. In order to address these two issues a new field of
    big data cybernetics [149] shown in Fig. 4 is proposed. It is an adaptation of
    the concept first conceived in [150] at the Norwegian Univeristy of Science and
    Technology. In the figure, the first step is partial interpretation of big data
    using well understood physics-based models. The uninterpretable observation at
    this stage is termed interpretable residual and in a second step is modeled using
    an explainable data-driven approach. After the second step, again an uninterpretable
    residual remains which is modeled using more complex and black-box models preferably
    with some inbuilt sanity check mechanism. The remaining residual is generally
    noise which can be discarded. The three steps result in a better understanding
    of the data and hence improved models, provided, new approach can be developed
    to combine physics based modeling and data-driven modeling with big data. The
    steps are continuously looped with the availability of new streams of data (i.e.,
    see Fig. 4). The new approach should be intended towards removing the shortfalls
    of pure physics-based or pure data driven modeling approach (see Table 2 for a
    summary). We call this new approach Hybrid Analysis and Modeling (HAM) and define
    it as a modeling approach that combines the interpretability, robust foundation
    and understanding of a physics based modeling approach with the accuracy, efficiency,
    and automatic pattern-identification capabilities of advanced data-driven ML and
    AI algorithms. It is possible to place HAM approaches at the intersections of
    big data, physics based modeling and data driven modeling as shown in Fig. 5.
    TABLE 2 Physics Based Modeling vs Data-Driven Modeling FIGURE 4. Big Data Cybernetics:
    The model starts as a physics based model that is based on first principles but
    as time progresses the model is continuously updated using knowledge generated
    from data. Show All FIGURE 5. Hybrid analysis and modeling: Hybridization happens
    at the intersection of the three cricles. Show All 1) Data Assimilation Data assimilation
    (represented by the intersection of big data and physics-based high fidelity simulations
    in Fig. 5) is a well-established mathematical discipline that combines computational
    models with observations. It is a geoscience terminology and refers to the estimation
    of the state of a physical system given a model and measurements. In other words,
    it is the process of fitting models to data. In engineering fields the terms filtering,
    estimation, smoothing, prediction are often used [151]–[154]. Filtering and smoothing
    are very closely related concepts and differ by causality of the estimation problem.
    However, both terms refer to inference based on some data, and often used interchangeably.
    The term smoothing is generally used to correct predictive model before the current
    time by incorporating observations from its past and future. However, the term
    filtering is used to incorporate available observations to update the model at
    the current time. In practice, many techniques in data assimilation can be derived
    both from a deterministic and stochastic point of view. There are many presentations
    of the topic in books, review and tutorial articles (e.g., we refer to [155]–[165]
    for detailed mathematical descriptions). Although data assimilation approaches
    initially gained popularity in numerical weather forecasting [166]–[173], they
    are now routinely used in fields as diverse as finance, medical physics, signal
    processing, computer vision, robotics and navigation [174]–[191], and these techniques
    offer a great promise in many digital twin applications. In an operational atmospheric
    forecast, data assimilation deals with very large-scale state space systems and
    typically enables initialization of models by statistically combining information
    from short-range model forecasts and observations, based on the estimated uncertainty
    of each [192]. Data assimilation methods differ primarily in their treatment of
    the model background error and the methods for solving the analysis equations
    [193]. Both variational (adjoint methods) and sequential methods (Kalman filters)
    have been successfully used in operational weather centers to minimize the error
    between forecasting trajectory and noisy observation data. Dedicated comparisons
    of four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-VAR) and ensemble Kalman
    filter (EnKF) approaches can be found in [194]–[196]. Their variants as well as
    hybridized approaches have been also introduced in atmospheric science and numerical
    weather predictions [197], [198]. We refer to recent studies on the use of the
    Kalman filter [199] and particle filter [200] in the digital twin applications.
    2) Reduced Order Modeling There are a great number of high-dimensional problems
    in the field of science (like atmospheric flows) that can be efficiently modeled
    based on embedded low-dimensional structures or reduced order models (ROMs). This
    family of model can be best described at the intersection of physics-based high
    fidelity simulations and data-drive models as shown in the Fig. 5. These ROMs
    often trade a level of accuracy for much greater computational speed. This ROM
    concept (also called surrogate modeling or metamodeling) allows one to emulate
    complex full-order models or processes, and lies at the interface of data and
    domain specific sciences. It has been systematically explored for decades in many
    different areas including computational mechanics [201]–[204], combustion [205]–[207],
    cosmology [208]–[210], electrodynamics [211]–[214], meteorology [215]–[218], fluid
    mechanics [219]–[225], heat transfer [226]–[228] and various other multiphysics
    processes [229]–[235], as well as systems and control theories [236]–[241] in
    order to provide computational feasible surrogate models. Although the concept
    can be traced back to the works done by Fourier (1768-1830), there exist many
    recent monographs [242]–[249] and review articles [250]–[263]. In practice, ROMs
    (i.e., emulators) have great promise for applications especially when multiple
    forward full-order numerical simulations are required (e.g., data assimilation
    [264]–[269], parameter identification [270]–[273], uncertainty quantification
    [274]–[280], optimization and control [281]–[288]). These models can quickly capture
    the essential features of the phenomena taking place, and we often might not need
    to calculate all full order modeling details to meet real-time constraints. Another
    advantage can be realized for developing surrogate models stationary parameterized
    systems, where full order models typically require many pseudo-iterations to converge
    to a steady-state at each control parameter [289]–[291]. Therefore, reduced order
    modeling has been considered as a key enabler to compress high fidelity models
    into much lower dimensions to alleviate heavy computational demand in digital
    twin technologies [292]. ROM enables reusing simulation models from the early
    phases of product development in later product lifetime phases, especially during
    the product operation phase [293]. Most of the conventional ROMs require the exact
    form of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) involved to explain
    the physics phenomena (hence called intrusive). This is sometimes impractical
    due to Intellectual Property Rights or issues related to an incomplete understanding
    of the underlying processes. Alternatively, nonintrusive data-driven models (lying
    at the intersection of big data and data-driven models in Fig. 5) have emerged
    recently with the democratization of computational power, explosion of archival
    data, and advances in ML algorithms [294]–[304]. These approaches mostly involve
    matrix operations, which can be very efficiently parallelized on affordable GPU
    and TPU giving several orders of magnitude speedup as required in real-time applications.
    One of the main advantages of a nonintrusive approach is its portability, which
    results from the fact that it does not necessarily require the exact form of the
    equations and the operators or methods used to solve them. This makes the approach
    applicable to experimental data where the equations are often not well established
    or have huge uncertainties involved in their parameters. Together with their modularity
    and simplicity, nonintrusive models offer a unique advantage in multidisciplinary
    collaborative environments. It is often necessary to share the data or the model
    without revealing the proprietary or sensitive information. Different departments
    or subcontractors can easily exchange data (with standardized I/O) or executables,
    securing their intangible assets and intellectual property rights. Furthermore,
    nonintrusive approaches are particularly useful when the detailed governing equations
    of the problem are unknown. This modeling approach can benefit from the enormous
    amount of data collected from experiments, sensor measurements, and large-scale
    simulations to build a robust and accurate ROM technology. Once ROMs are constructed
    its operational execution cost is usually negligible in PDE constrained optimization
    problems. Besides, another advantage can be viewed in such a way that the optimization
    task may be separated from the generation of data for a ROM via a design of experiments
    (DOE) approach or other interpolation approaches [305], [306]. The statistical
    approach proposed by Krige [307] has become highly popular in such multidimensional
    interpolation problems (known as Kriging or Gaussian Process Regression [308]).
    Of course, we have to take into account the cost of creating an initial database
    requiring large-scale high-fidelity simulations within complex domains discretized
    by finite volumes or finite elements. The authors, in their recent studies [309]–[311],
    make ROM inter-operatable between different discretization techniques. In addition,
    the use of radial basis functions (RBF) in finite elements can be found in [312]
    for nonlinear structural analysis. A description of radial basis approximation
    in PDE systems can be found in [313]. A hybrid reduced basis and finite element
    method has been proposed as a component-to-system model order reduction approach,
    which is considered as one of the key enablers in digital twin technologies [314].
    An application of RBF to construct a noninstrusive ROM for data assimilation applications
    can be found in [315]. 3) Hardware and Software in the Loop Hardware-in-the-loop
    (HIL) simulation approach, a well-established concept of using a physical object
    during system development phase in control engineering [316]–[318], can be also
    considered as a promising approach towards near real-time predictions within digital
    twin platforms (e.g., see also software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulation studies for
    early design processes [319]–[321]). For example, a real-time co-simulation concept
    for HIL simulations has been presented in [322] considering the virtual commissioning
    of production systems. 4) Other Hybridization Techniques As the constructive criticism
    of Albert Einstein and many others had helped to develop a better understanding
    of quantum mechanics [323]–[325], we believe the valuable criticisms coming from
    domain scientists might help to develop more interpretable ML methodologies for
    scientific applications. For example, we refer to recent surveys of ML in domain-specific
    areas of molecular and material science [326] and fluid mechanics [327]. Complete
    replacement of equations with ML algorithms for gaining computational efficiency
    when generalization is not a necessity (e.g., we refer to [328]–[335] and references
    cited therein for speeding up numerical solvers for real-time applications), and
    can be used in the context of digital twin when the same process is to be monitored
    time and again. However, this approach will fail in unexpected situation because
    the model only learns to interpolate and not extrapolate. A better approach on
    the integration of ML to physical processes has been demonstrated intuitively
    in [336] where the known physics is modeled using the established governing equations
    while the unknown physics is modeled using black-box DNN or LSTM networks. When
    combined, the black-box part improves the overall accuracy of the combined model
    and the equation based part puts an inbuilt sanity check mechanism to detect unexpected
    behavior of the black-box part. In their perspective [337], the authors, considering
    an Earth system model, charted a comprehensive integration scheme that can be
    done through (i) improving parameterization, (ii) replacing physical submodel
    with machine learning, (iii) analysis of model-observation mismatch, (iv) constraining
    submodels, and (v) developing surrogates. It has been concluded that a joint modeling
    approach offers viable solutions to tackle challenges such as interpretability,
    physical consistency, noise, limited data, and computational demand, when these
    theory-driven physical process models combined with the versatility of data-driven
    ML. Another approach to improving the interpretability of any ML algorithm is
    to reduce the complexity of the algorithm. One way of doing this is to engineer
    new features based on domain knowledge and informing the ML about it. Since, the
    algorithm is relieved of the additional task of rediscovering these features,
    one can work with simpler algorithms with far better accuracy. This approach was
    demonstrated in the context of material discovery in [338], [339]. More work on
    hybrid analytics or hybrid physics-AI modeling can be found in [340]–[344]. For
    example, we refer to the works done in [345], [346] using such hybrid approaches
    combining deterministic and ML components in general circulation models (GCMs)
    for applications to climate modeling and weather predictions. The processes in
    GCMs can be split into two parts referring to model dynamics (i.e., set of 3D
    equations of motion governed by PDEs for mass, momentum, energy etc) and model
    physics (i.e., source terms for parameterizing atmospheric radiation, turbulence,
    precipitation, clouds, chemistry, etc). The hybrid approach has a good motivation
    for emulating model physics, since this part often dominates the total model computation
    time. Similar gray-box approaches have been gaining popularity in various other
    fields too (e.g., hydrology [347], material forming [348], bioprocess [349], built
    environment [350], petroleum [351], reactor design [352] and quantum chemistry
    [353]). Another interesting way of combining physics based modeling and big data
    is the approach advocated by Soize and Farhat [354] and [355]. They exploit available
    data to adapt the subspace in which the solution of the problem formulated using
    the computational model is searched. The method is innovative as it discover some
    form of the information or knowledge encapsulated in data, instead of the common
    approach to adapt model parameters. The resulting nonparametric probalistic reduced
    order method enables a sound mathematical/statistical based combination of physics
    based model and data highly relevant in a digital twin context. 5) Physics-Informed
    ML When it comes to utilizing ML algorithms in cases where the underlying physical
    process of high dimension, some of the challenges include incorporating physical
    laws within the learning framework, producing solutions that are interpretable,
    addressing nonlinearities, conservation properties, and dealing with the massive
    amount of data needed for training. For example, in mathematical models governed
    by PDEs, the authors in [356] demonstrated a different approach of programming
    physics directly into the DL algorithm. They did so by using the residual of the
    governing equations to regularize the cost function that can be optimized in any
    ML algorithm. In [357], the PDEs are reformulated as backward stochastic differential
    equations and the gradient of unknown solution is approximated using neural networks.
    This is inspired from the deep reinforcement learning with gradient acting as
    the policy function. Physics-informed ML ideas have also been utilized in various
    areas including inorganic scintillator discovery [358], fluid dynamics [359]–[361],
    projection-based model reduction [362], cardiovascular system modeling [363],
    and wind farm applications [364]. In [365], the authors have presented a comprehensive
    review on the taxonomy of explicit integration of knowledge into ML. As generously
    highlighted by Martens in his perspective paper [105], most domain-specific software
    tools can be improved by fresh impulses from the developments in computer and
    cognitive sciences, and in return, many specific disciplines have a lot to give
    to these sciences as well as to other fields. Therefore, the concept of Physics/Knowledge/Science-informed
    ML might offer a powerful transformation to combine practice and theory (e.g.,
    please see [366]–[370] for promoting theory-guided ML in various disciplines).
    For example, a symmetry enforcing approach to learn salient features from a sparse
    data set has been introduced using a knowledge injection concept [371], that might
    be a key enabler in developing digital twin technologies. 6) Compressed Sensing
    and Symbolic Regression Compressed sensing (CS) has been applied to signal processing
    in seeking the sparsest solution [372]–[374]. Sparsity-promoting optimization
    techniques (e.g., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and
    its generalizations) often perform feature selection through L1 penalty added
    to recover sparse solutions [375]–[377]. Ridge regression is another regularized
    variant where L2 penalty is added to objective function [378]–[380]. Elastic nets
    combine the strengths of the LASSO and ridge approaches [381]–[383]. Sequentially
    thresholded ridge regression (STRidge) can be also used in more complex systems
    with correlated basis functions [384]. In recent years, the use of ML methods
    has complemented the need for formulating mathematical models, and allowed accurate
    estimation of observed dynamics by learning automatically from the given observations
    and building models. For example, sparse regression has been applied for recovering
    several nonlinear canonical PDEs [384]. These sparse optimization techniques have
    been used to recover the underlying basis from many candidate featuring terms.
    The computational time of these approaches are small and in general they can handle
    large datasets. One of the key concern with these techniques are that they perform
    poorly on data corrupted with noise. In addition, evolutionary approaches are
    proposed at another end of spectrum to leverage randomness as virtue in recovering
    models. Symbolic regression (SR) methods explore a function space, which is generally
    bounded by a preselected set of mathematical operators and operands, using a population
    of randomly generated candidate solutions. A seminal work by Schmidt and Lipson
    [385] has demonstrated that the SR approach can be used to determine the underlying
    structure of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. This approach is crucial
    where data is abundant (e.g., geophysical flows, finance, neuroscience) but the
    accurate physical law/model is not available. When it comes to large-scale datasets,
    gene expression programming (GEP), for example, has been applied to recover turbulence
    closures [386]. The authors tailored original GEP algorithm [387] to handle tensor
    regression and recover complex functional forms. Recently, a mixed approach was
    proposed by Both et al. [388] where the feed forward neural networks and sparse
    regression techniques were combined to handle noisy data. These tools can be exploited
    as a potential data-driven tool for recovering hidden physical structures or parameterizations
    representing high-dimensional systems from data in digital twin applications.
    D. Infrastructure and Platforms 1) Big Data Technologies The infrastructure for
    storing and processing high volume data has been advanced considerably over the
    last decades. Many available platforms are available to handle big data projects
    in terms of blending, integration, storage, centralized management, interactive
    analysis, visualization, accessibility and security. Many IT vendors benefit from
    Hadoop technology [389]–[392], which allows us to execute tasks directly from
    its hosting place without copying to local memory. Indeed, there are many survey
    articles to discuss various aspects of big data including not only state-of-the-art
    technology and platforms, but also algorithms, applications and challenges [393]–[407].
    More recently, Kaufmann [408] introduced a big data management concept to address
    the critical needs of digital twin applications. 2) IoT Technologies The IoT is
    becoming increasingly popular to develop smart technologies in several sectors
    ranging from healthcare to agriculture, from transportation to energy. The availability
    of high-speed Wi-Fi internet connection, digital machines, low-cost sensors along
    with the development of ML algorithms to perform real-time analysis has contributed
    to enabling IoT [409], [410]. The leading IoT vendors provide reliable and innovative
    platforms to set up IoT devices for various applications [411]. Amazon Web Services
    (AWS) offers various IoT solutions [412]. For example, AWS IoT finds its application
    in biomedical research to identify biological insights which were not known before
    [413]. The high volume of complex biomedical data is being generated using the
    state-of-the-art high-throughput machines and this data can be processed and stored
    efficiently using cloud computing. In their work [413], the cloud computing framework
    was applied to genome mapping which uses a large amount of next-generation sequencing
    (NGS) data. This task can be easily distributed over a computer cluster and cloud
    computing is an ideal platform for this, as it does not have limitations of high-performance
    computing (HPC) systems such as job queues and unsupported software. Another application
    of IoT is in sensor network technologies which are used extensively in environmental
    monitoring and industrial automation. Cloud computing often provides a flexible
    computational model that is perfectly suitable for unpredictable demands generated
    by environmental sensor networks. For example, in [414], Amazon’s elastic compute
    cloud (EC2) was applied for processing dynamic data collected by sensor networks
    in environmental applications. IoT has also been used in developing smart home
    technologies in which the operating conditions such as humidity, temperature,
    luminosity, etc are controlled with minimum user’s intervention. In [415], IoT
    concepts and cloud computing were integrated to facilitate smart home implementations.
    Their architecture uses microcontroller-enabled sensors to monitor home conditions,
    actuators for performing required actions, and Google App Engine platform for
    creating and setting up their web application. In [416], the authors used Twitter
    application to collect data, and presented Google App Engine as a possible solution
    for mining and analyzing the large amount of data. Microsoft launched Azure IoT
    Suite, a platform that enables end-users to communicate with their IoT services
    and devices, exchange data, and process it in a convenient way [417]. Many other
    specified platforms have been built on top of Azure for different applications.
    Forsström and Jennehag [418] investigated a system built by combining Azure IoT
    hub and the open plant communication universal architecture (OPCUA) for a realistic
    industrial situation tracking an industrial component with 1500 sensors. For agricultural
    purposes, Vasisht et al. [419] presented FarmBeats, an end-to-end IoT platform
    for data-driven agriculture which uses Microsoft Azure IoT Suite for cloud services
    and passing data summaries to storage. FarmBeats is capable of handling data from
    various sensor types with different bandwidths. Also, it is sufficiently reliable
    even in cases of power and internet outages from bad weather. For healthcare applications,
    Manashty et al. [420] proposed a healthcare event aggregation lab (HEAL) model
    in order to detect health anomalies as accurately and fast as possible. A prototype
    of HEAL was implemented and tested on Azure. Das et al. [421] proposed a cloud
    based approach to make users aware of probable health risks of the flickering
    of surrounding artificial light. A small-length video is recorded using phone’s
    camera. It is then uploaded to Azure cloud storage, where it can be further processed
    and analyzed to give informed instructions. SAP cloud platform helps to implement
    IoT applications. Koduru et al. [422] proposed a framework based on SAP cloud
    for implementing a smart irrigation system taking water supply from borewells
    and weather conditions into account. Tsokov and Petrova-Antonova [423] proposed
    EcoLogic, a solution for real-time monitoring of running vehicles and their respective
    emissions’ levels, in order to keep the carbon emissions within acceptable limits
    through smart notifications and management of vehicle’s power. The system combines
    hardware module that collects data related to vehicles’ emissions with cloud-based
    applications for data processing, and analysis using SAP cloud platform. Salesforce
    IoT which is based on software delivery paradigm where users access the software
    through personal web browsers and vendors host the business software. This software
    delivery paradigm is categorized under software-as-a-service (SaaS) built on cloud
    computing [424]. This paradigm helps in scalability, efficient maintenance, efficient
    management and lower resource costs. Salesforce IoT platform is designed to take
    in the massive amount of data generated by devices, sensors, websites and applications
    and initiate actions for real-time responses. Some real-time applications might
    include wind turbines that automatically adjusts its parameters based on live
    weather data, passengers whose connecting flights are delayed could be rebooked
    before they have landed [425]–[427]. Salesforce customer relationship management
    (CRM) software package was used by organizations to anticipate customer needs
    based on their past requirements and choices [428]. Such platforms have been also
    deployed in governmental organizations [429]. Oracle IoT is a cloud-based service
    for business implementations and uses software delivery paradigm called platform-as-a-service
    (PaaS) [430], [431]. Among many applications, Oracle IoT has been used for analyzing
    data regarding user’s venue recommendations such as user’s current geographical
    location, weather and traffic conditions, cost, service or distance of the venues,
    as well as social network user reviews of venues [432]. Cisco is one of the early
    business groups to realize the birth and potential of IoT based platforms [433]–[435].
    Okafor et al. [436] used Cisco Nexus platform to develop a scalable IoT datacenter
    management (cost-effective processing, storing, and analysis of large volumes
    of data) for fog computing. In [437], the authors summarize the opportunities
    and challenges of fog computing in the networking context of IoT. A fog assisted
    IoT system has been considered as a health monitoring system in smart homes [438].
    In their recent work, Bakhshi et al. [439] discussed industrial security threats
    and concerns for both Cisco and Microsoft Azure IoT architectural models (for
    data accumulation and abstraction layers of those model architectures) and then
    suggested some security considerations. In fact, the security and privacy concerns
    are the major challenges of implementing any IoT devices [440]. Bosch IoT suite
    provides not only services through cloud connections but also the on-premise services
    with no third party access to the local data [441], [442]. In [443], the authors
    introduced an architectural model to successfully establish such IoT ecosystem
    through platform interoperability. An example of integrating IoT devices provided
    by Bosch IoT suite into a business process has been discussed in details in [444].
    Using the IBM BlueMix cloud computing platform, an IoT technology has been applied
    to build a smart car system that monitors and the car’s activity and informs the
    owner or technician about the routine maintenance to ensure safe and efficient
    driving [445]. In [446], real-time air quality parameters such as humidity, temperature,
    and particulate matter were measured using different sensors. Data storage, data
    management, and data analysis were performed using the IBM Bluemix cloud to inform
    about the necessary decisions promptly. 3) Communication Technologies A reliable
    working of any digital twin will require information arising from different components
    to reach its intended target on time. For example, during a robotic surgery, the
    action of a surgeon in a digital operation theater should manifest into action
    in reality without any latency. With so many sensors comes the problem of fast
    data communication. The state-of-the-art communication technology like 4G will
    run into problems as more and more devices will start sharing the limited radio-frequency
    spectrum. 5G technology with a wider frequency range might accommodate many more
    devices but that requires communication at much higher frequencies (30–300GHz)
    compared to the currently used frequencies by our mobile network. Such high frequencies
    waves called Millimeter Waves [447] can not penetrate obstacles readily and hence
    more and more miniaturized base stations called Small Cells operating on low power
    will be placed spanning the whole relevant area. These base stations can also
    support hundreds of ports for many more antennas. The technology is called Massive
    MIMO. The large number of antennas mean more signal interference which will be
    corrected using the Beamforming technology [447] which is a traffic-signaling
    system for the cellular base station which optimizes the data-delivery route to
    a particular user. Finally, for multiple communication at the frequency full duplexing
    is being looked into. The 5G technology will form the backbone of any digital
    twin owing to their ultralow latency and unprecedented speed and is already being
    used in the world’s first 5G cinema in Oslo. Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN)
    technology has been gaining a great attention for IoT applications, while keeping
    network structures and management simple [448]–[450]. Unmanned Aerial Systems
    (UAS) cooperations have also recently attracted considerable attention to assist
    ground base stations in the case of crowded public events, natural disasters,
    or other temporal emergencies that require additional needs for network resources
    [451]–[453]. For example, UAS based sensing systems have demonstrated value for
    flexible in-situ atmospheric boundary layer observations to improve weather forecasting
    [454]–[456]. 4) Computational Infrastructures According to Moore’s Law, the performance
    and functionality of computers/processors can be expected to double every two
    years due to the advances in digital electronics. Therefore, in scientific computing
    applications, the speeds of both computation and communication have substantially
    increased over the years. However, the communication becomes more challenging
    as the number of processing elements increases and/or the number of grid points
    decreases within a processing elements, which constitutes a major bottleneck at
    upcoming exascale computing systems [457]–[459]. Unless we face up to a new transistor
    technology (e.g., see [460]) to replace current metal-oxide semiconductor transistor
    technologies, this doubling trend saturates as chip manufacturing sector reaches
    the limits of the atomic scale. This leads to more effective use of transistors
    through more efficient architectures (e.g., see [461] for a recent discussion
    in extreme heterogeneity). The HPC community has started to move forward to incorporate
    GPU based accelerators and beyond (e.g., TPUs [462]) for not only graphics rendering
    but also scientific computing applications. This heterogeneity shift becomes even
    more crucial in future since there is a rapid increase in the usage of high-productivity
    programming languages (e.g., Matlab, R, Python, Julia) among engineers and scientists.
    In a recent article [463], the authors reviewed synergistic activities among major
    software development organizations considering challenges such as productivity,
    quality, reproducibility, and sustainability. As an enabling technology for digital
    twins, cloud computing utilizes computing power at remote servers hosted on the
    Internet to store, manage, and process information/data, rather than a local server
    or a personal computer [464]–[466]. Edge computing utilizes computing power at
    the edge/nodes of the networks, to completely or partly to store, manage, and
    process information/data locally [467]–[470]. Fog computing is a blend of cloud
    and edge computing where it is unknown to the user where in the network the data
    is stored, managed and processed, and the load is distributed automatically between
    remote servers and local resources [471], [471]. In [472], the authors developed
    a simulator to model IoT using fog environments and measured the impact of resource
    management techniques in latency, network congestion, energy consumption, and
    cost. We refer to [473] for the energy management and scalability of IoT systems
    using fog computing. In [474], the authors reviewed offloading in fog computing
    in IoT applications. The use of time sensitive networking (TSN) protocol service
    as a deterministic transport for the network layer of fog computing in industrial
    automation has been discussed in [475], especially considering their use in real-time
    control applications. Furthermore, granular computing paradigm [476] offers a
    general framework based on granular elements such as classes, clusters, and intervals
    and might be quite useful in big data applications [477]–[479]. It is also anticipated
    that emerging quantum computing systems will offer phenomenal capabilities for
    solving data-intensive complex problems (e.g., computational sciences, communication
    networks, artificial intelligence [480]). 5) Digital Twin Platforms Kongsberg
    Digital is a company delivering PaaS and SaaS services for energy, oil and gas,
    and maritime industries. Kongsberg is partner with some key cloud vendors, including
    Microsoft Azure, to provide enabling information technology services [481]. In
    2017, Kongsberg launched its open digital ecosystem platform, called KognifAI
    [482]. It combines a group of applications on the cloud focusing on optimal data
    accessibility and processing. KognifAI is built on cybersecurity, identity, encryption,
    and data integrity [483]. Moreover, its main infrastructure can be utilized to
    easily scale applications and services [484]. KognifAI offers digital twin solutions
    in maritime, drilling and wells, renewable energies, etc [485]. Kongsberg dynamic
    digital twin combines safety with fast prototyping and implementation, and connects
    offshore and onshore users in oil and gas industry [486]. It can provide a model
    not only to represent an existing physical system, but also a planned installation
    (e.g., greenfield digital twin [487]) or maintenance and repair (e.g, brownfield
    [488]). In 2018, MapleSim, a product of MapleSoft, added new features for developing
    digital twins [489]. MapleSim is powerful in creating an accurate dynamic model
    of the machine based on CAD data, with all forces and torques included. The major
    focus of MapleSim digital twin module is to implement virtual plant models that
    do not necessarily require expert knowledge. To test motor sizing in a new screwing
    machine at Stoppil Industrie, a digital twin of the machine was created using
    MapleSim [490]. The initial motor size was found to be undersized by a factor
    of 10, which would have caused machine failure and excessive losses. MapleSim
    was integrated into B&R automation studio to facilitate the use of digital twin
    for machine development [491]. MapleSim in conjunction with B&R software were
    used to build model-based feedback during motor sizing for an injection molding
    machine [492]. Cognite provides the full-scale digital transformation services
    to heavy industries such as oil and gas, power [493], original equipment manufacturers
    (OEMs), and shipping companies. Cognite has built a software package named Cognite
    Data Fusion that extracts useful information from the data. One of the main features
    of Cognite Data Fusion is its APIs, SDKs, and libraries that are open-source to
    its customers. Developers and analysts can build applications and ML models that
    best suit the operation needs. These applications can include large CAD models,
    complex asset plans, and can be run on phones and tablets. Cognite Data Fusion
    also offers to customize permissions hierarchies for sharing data with partners
    and suppliers. For example, the Cognite Digital Platform has helped Framo (an
    OEM for pumping systems) and their customer Aker BP to communicate and share the
    live operational data of equipment more efficiently [494]. This enabled Framo
    to create their applications and monitor the status of equipment to plan the maintenance.
    Using the operational data of their equipment, OEMs can inform their customers
    about how to improve the performance of the equipment. The integration of the
    Siemens information management system (IMS) and Cognite data platform has benefited
    Aker BP in optimizing the offshore maintenance and reduce costs [495]. With the
    availability of live data and using artificial intelligence, ML algorithms, Siemens
    presented a powerful analysis of each equipment with advanced visualizations.
    Siemens digital twin leads the industry by offering diverse computational tools
    in CAE, CAD, manufacturing and electronic design and connect information from
    all of these domains using a seamless digital thread to give companies tremendous
    insight into products and designs [496], [497]. Siemens plant simulation (PS)
    digital tool was successfully interfaced (digital copy) with production line involving
    manufacturing of pneumatic cylinders within automotive industry to promote the
    concept of Industry 4.0. The production line simulation model was optimized by
    genetic algorithm provided by Siemens PS tool which adjusted the simulation model
    and then simulated the digital twin [498]. Smart factories are designed with machines
    that can operate based on manufacturing environments, control production processes
    and share information with each other in the form of knowledge graphs. Generally,
    knowledge graphs are incomplete and missing data has to be inferred. Siemens digital
    twin powered by machine learning tools (e.g., recurrent neural networks) was demonstrated
    to complete the knowledge graph and synchronize the digital and the physical representations
    of a smart factory [499]. ANSYS introduced digital twin builder in its ANSYS 19.1
    version. ANSYS twin builder provides the developer with several features such
    as creating a multi-domain system, multiple fidelity and multiphysics solver,
    efficient ROM construction capabilities, third-party tool integration, embedded
    software integration, as well as system optimization [500]. ANSYS along with other
    companies built the digital twin for a pump that can use the real-time sensor
    data to improve its performance and to predict failures [501]. General Electric
    also used a customized version of ANSYS digital twin to design megawatt-sized
    electric circuit breakers [502]. Akselos, founded in 2012, offers instantaneous
    physics based simulations and analyses of critical infrastructures calibrated
    with sensor data in an asset-heavy industry. The key benefits of Akselos digital
    twin are the asset performance optimization and life extension, failure prediction
    and prevention, as well as contingency planning. Akselos owns a structural analysis
    tool that’s fast enough to integrate, re-calibrate, and re-analyze the sensor
    data. Their framework uses a reduced basis finite element analysis (RB-FEA) technology,
    a state-of-the-art reduced order modeling approach which is quite faster than
    conventional FEA and higher accuracy is ensured by using a posteriori accuracy
    indicators and automated model enrichment. Akselos provides a cloud based platform
    to develop the digital twin framework for any number of users from any geographic
    locations or organizations. The structural models developed by Akselos have the
    capacity to incorporate the localized nonlinearities as well. Among the existing
    case studies, Akselos digital twin is used for offshore asset life extension,
    optimizing floating production storage and offloading, inspection, return on investment,
    and ship loader life extension. Akselos unlocked 20 years of structural capacity
    for the assets operated by Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea. Details about the
    Akselos and their work agenda can be found in [503] and [504]. General Electric
    (GE) has been developing a digital twin environment integrated with different
    components of the power plant that takes into account customer defined Key Performance
    Indicator (KPIs) and business objectives by measuring asset health, wear and performance.
    Their Digital Twin runs on the Predix platform, designed to operate large volumes
    of sensor data at an industrial scale. Their platform offers advanced distribution
    management solutions, geospatial network modeling solutions, grid analytics, and
    asset performance management for power and utility services such as next generation
    sensing technologies, digital threading, artificial intelligence, advanced control
    and edge computing. Many world renowned companies have been applied these technologies
    for diverse industrial fields like automotive, food and beverage, chemicals, digital
    energy, steel manufacturing, equipment manufacturing, pulp/paper manufacturing,
    and semiconductors. Details on GE digital can be found in [505] and [506]. Oracle
    IoT Cloud offer Digital Twin through three pillars, (i) virtual twin where the
    physical asset or device is represented virtually in the cloud, (ii) predictive
    twin using either physics based models (FEM/CFD) or statistic/ML models having
    support from Oracle’s products such as Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop
    (ORAAH) and Oracle Stream Explorer, and (iii) twin projections where the insights
    generated by digital twin is projected to the backend application and supported
    by Oracle ERP (supply chain, manufacturing, maintenance applications) and CX (service)
    [6]. E. Human-Machine Interface As the demarcation between humans and machine
    starts to fade in the context of Digital Twin, there will be a need for more effective
    and fast communication and interaction. While augmented/virtual reality, without
    doubt will be required to create a detailed visualization of the assets, natural
    language processing and gesture control will be a very common mode of interaction.
    We detailed the current state-of-the-art in human machine interface and their
    potential usage in a DT context. 1) Augmented and Virtual Reality Augmented Reality
    (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) can be considered among the key technologies that
    promise to add new perspectives in many sectors [507]. We refer to several review
    articles on the state-of-the-arts in engineeing and design [508]–[512], medicine
    [513]–[517] and education [518]–[521]. In [3], Escorsa highlighted numerous patented
    developments within the digital twin context in arrangements for interaction with
    the human body such as, for example, “haptics” touch feedback technologies as
    computer generated output to the user developed by Immersion Inc. 2) Natural Language
    Processing Voice has been perhaps the most effective and quickest mode of communication
    among humans. For a seamless integration of the humans and machine in the context
    of the digital twin, there is an obvious need for elevating this mode of communication
    to a level that humans and machines can interact seamlessly. With the recent advancements
    in DL [115] and LSTM algorithms [522], language translations and interpretation
    has reached at least human level accuracy and efficiency if not more. A nice discussion
    on the major recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) focusing on
    neural network-based methods can be found in [523]. The blog condenses 18 years
    (2001–2018) worth of work into eight milestones that are the most relevant today.
    Further insights about the recent trends in NLP can be found in [524]. 3) Gesture
    Control Recent advancement in remote sensing technologies allows highly accurate
    gesture recognition capabilities through RF and mmWave radar [525]–[528], ambient
    light [529]–[531], cameras and image processing [532]–[535], sound [536]–[539]
    and wearable devices [540]–[542]. Along with the faster communication in the IoT,
    such technological developments in gesture training and control will be crucial
    in developing more robust digital twin systems. SECTION VI. Socio-Economic Impacts
    Digital Twinning will bring about unprecedented automation in the management of
    any physical asset. One of the first concern that can be a stumbling block for
    the adaptation of digital twins just like any other automation technologies will
    be its acceptability by the work force. The fear of losing jobs seemed very logical
    a few decades earlier [543], however even at that time contrary opinions were
    prevalent based on systematic studies [544]. In fact, Sheridan showed that automation
    just results in redistribution of workplace without much impact on employment
    [545]. Such studies highlights the vulnerability of the workforce with lower qualification
    involved in repeatative jobs. There are also positive aspects with automation
    and that is with a careful task allocation between humans and machines, it can
    enable greater safety and creativity at work place by deallocating dirty, dumb
    and dangerous (3D) jobs to machines and artificial intelligence. Such task allocation
    has been extensively studied in [546]–[548]. Humans should be in the loop not
    only for coordinating AI developments but also checking AI results. At this point
    it is worth remembering the reflection “ironies of automation” by Lisanne Bainbridge.
    It simply states that the as automation takes over the simpler works, the role
    of humans to manage more complicated unpredictable tasks will become even more
    critical. How to groom humans to deal with unexpected events after prolonged phases
    of inactivity will be a major challenge. Moreover, for economic reasons, there
    will be a lesser motivation for recruiting professional users of the relevant
    technologies, a base of non-professional users might be a natural outcome. This
    will require strategies to handle security and hacking [549]. As the world gears
    towards greater autonomy resulting from digital twinning, efforts will have to
    be made to create opportunities for all and nor for a selected few. Nevertheless,
    with good guiding intentions, the technology will improve the quality of work
    at work places and with good training and career couselling will enable workers
    to focus on more creative work. SECTION VII. Conclusions and Recommendations Based
    on our literature survey we present the following definition of digital twin:
    A digital twin is defined as a virtual representation of a physical asset enabled
    through data and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring,
    controlling, and improved decision making. We find the breakdown of digital twin
    into three pillars as proposed by Oracle [6] to be useful both in communicating
    the concept as well as identify the role we think the different stakeholders should
    take in order to fully exploit its potential: Virtual Twin: Creation of a virtual
    representation of a physical asset or a device in the cloud. Predictive Twin:
    Physics based, data driven or hybrid models operating on the virtual twin to predict
    the behaviour of the physical asset. Twin Projection: Integration of insights
    generated by the predictive twin into the business operation and processes. Despite
    the challenges, applying digital twin technologies to various sectors is gaining
    in popularity. Based on our technology watch, we would like to conclude our analysis
    providing recommendations for each stakeholders group (Fig. 6) and their most
    important contributions: Industry: The greatest pull for the technology is going
    to come from the industry sector. There are three most important ways in which
    this sector can make positive contributions (a) by making asset dataset available
    for research and validated model building (b) by actively participating in research
    through practical knowledge sharing (c) by being proactive in ‘projecting’ the
    insights obtained from predictive twins into their business applications to validate
    the usefulness of digital twins. Academia and research institutes: It is foreseen
    that along with close cooperation with the industry sectors most of the enabling
    technologies for both ‘virtual twins’ and ‘predictive twins’ will be developed
    by the academia and research institutes. We strongly recommend that these developments
    are made exploitable for the society at large by means of open source software.
    Along with providing the technological know-how, the academia will also have to
    take the lead in grooming an altogether new generation of workforce to serve the
    reformed environment. We advocate the MAC-model, i.e. to educate and train a new
    generation of researchers in forming interdisciplinary teams that combine application
    knowledge (A) with expertise and advanced methodologies from mathematics (M) and
    computer science (C). Government and policy makers: To ensure that the benefits
    of the new technology reach every layer of the society, that humans are still
    relevant and there is no compromise with ethics, privacy and security, new inclusive
    policies and regulations will have to be framed. There should be a major effort
    toward the democratization of the technology. Data protection and privacy laws
    (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), agreed upon by the European
    Parliament and Council in April 2016) is definitely and encouraging step in the
    right direction. The different governmental bodies should initiate feasibility
    studies for utilizing digital twins within their sectors. In particular, investigate
    different scenarios on how they can profit from ‘projecting’ insights obtained
    from relevant predictive twins into their governmental responsibilities. Furthermore,
    data generated by means of public funding (e.g. weather forecast, anonymous health
    care data) should be openly available and made easily exploitable for the academia
    and the industry. Funding agencies: Especially those with a strong mission focusing
    on industrial innovation impact, the digital twinning offers a challenging theme
    for center projects (e.g., US NSF Engineering Research Centers and other international
    comparators [550]). As a platform for multidisciplinary research, digital twin
    concept consists of a wide spectrum from the fundamental research and enabling
    technology development to the system integration phase. However, funding of open
    source enabling technology platforms should be prioritized as the funding mechanisms
    of such infrastructure have been scarce up to now. Society: The onus to be well
    informed about the new technology is on the society itself. It is not a matter
    of if but when the new technology will bring about remarkable changes in our private
    and professional lives. Thus, we recommend that one start develop new skills during
    the K12 education which will facilitate embracement of the emerging technology.
    FIGURE 6. Stakeholders and their potential contributions. Show All While the definition
    of a digital twin is unambiguous, what is not a digital twin is a difficult question
    to answer. There is a need to quantify the degree to which a digital twin resembles
    its physical counterpart both in terms of appearance and behaviour. As we have
    discussed in this paper, the focus so far has mostly been on the former but only
    a little has been done to add physical realism. If we were to define a score of
    digital twinning on a scale of 1–10, a score of 10 will correspond to a situation
    when a digital twin becomes indistinguishable from its physical counterpart to
    an observer. Towards this goal, a hybrid analysis and modeling methodology can
    be developed by combining ML with physics based models to contribute a firm unified
    foundation for the computational modeling and simulation of complex problems that
    arise in numerous multidisciplinary applications. Finally, we would like to highlight
    the importance of standardization. It can be argued that in a fully connected
    and interactive world, different physical assets will be interacting with each
    other and the corresponding digital twins will also have to interact with each
    other. In order to facilitate these interactions there will be a need for standards
    cutting across different domain areas. These standards can range from the file
    format of the data storage, to the details of how the data can be compressed,
    to the data protection requirements addressing differences in the laws when spread
    over different geographical areas. To conclude, the digital twin concept offers
    many new perspectives to our rapidly digitalized society and its seamless interactions
    with many different fields. Combining complementary strengths in physics-based
    and data-driven modeling approaches, the hybrid analysis and modeling framework
    becomes particularly appealing for developing robust digital twin platforms, and
    enables us to make more informed decisions and ask even better questions to mitigate
    challenges relevant to big data cybernetics, security, digitalization, automatization
    and intelligentization. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Adil Rasheed and Trond Kvamsdal acknowledge

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    Explore all metrics Abstract Precision agriculture (PA) is the use of information
    and communication technology together with best agricultural practices for farm
    management. PA requires the acquisition, transmission and processing of large
    amounts of data from farm fields. A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a system
    for monitoring agriculture fields. Several researchers have used WSNs to collect
    the required data from the regions of interest for their intended usages in various
    applications. In a WSN, the energy consumption of the sensor nodes is the main
    issue, due to its direct impact on the lifetime of the network. Many approaches
    have been proposed to address this issue using different power sources and types
    of nodes. Specifically, in PA, because of the extended time period that is required
    to monitor fields, using an appropriate WSN approach is important. There is a
    need for a comprehensive review of WSN approaches for PA. The aim of this paper
    is to classify and describe the state-of-the-art of WSNs and analyze their energy
    consumption based on their power sources. WSN approaches in PA are categorized
    and discussed according to their features. Similar content being viewed by others

    Networks Incorporating Energy Forecast Techniques Article 17 April 2020 Introduction
    Precision agriculture (PA) is a concept that combines information technology with
    agricultural principles to manage spatial and temporal variability in the agricultural
    production process. This arrangement may boost agricultural yields whilst reducing
    harmful impact to the environment. One of the efficient technologies that is used
    to monitor and collect data in PA is a wireless sensor network (WSN). WSNs collect
    data of essential spatial and temporal variables that are necessary for decision
    making in agricultural farm management (Coates et al. 2013; Díaz et al. 2011;
    Dong et al. 2013; Yu et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2011). WSN is a recent novel technology
    that has prospects for improving many applications as well as creating novel systems
    in PA and several other applications, such as global-scale environmental monitoring,
    pest and disease control and animal tracing (Stankovic 2008; Vellidis et al. 2008;
    Vicaire et al. 2009; Wood et al. 2006). In PA, WSNs have been deployed to acquire
    micro-climatological data in farm fields, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture content and wind speed. For example, in the Luster project (Selavo et
    al. 2007), a WSN was used in an environmental science system for measuring the
    effect of sunlight on plant growth. Furthermore, WSNs have been used to measure
    crop growth, irrigation and several other applications (Baggio 2005; Garcia-Sanchez
    et al. 2011; Shaikh et al. 2010; Vellidis et al. 2008). In a WSN, the lifetime
    of the network is dependent on the power source requirement of the nodes. Thus,
    selecting a suitable power source for a PA application is essential. The main
    types of power sources are battery or solar power; however, each has its own issues.
    To the best of our knowledge, there are not yet surveys that categorize WSNs for
    PA based on the power source. Ruiz-Garcia et al. (2009) discussed the general
    application area of WSNs in agriculture. They explained different systems that
    are available based on radio frequency identification (RFID) and WSNs. Similarly,
    Wang et al. (2006) explained the available WSN technologies that are applicable
    to agriculture and the food industry. In this paper, first, WSNs and the available
    network topologies are described. Second, the sensor node power sources are categorized
    and discussed in terms of homogeneous and heterogeneous nodes, and their advantages
    and disadvantages are noted. Current approaches and their energy consumption are
    reviewed and described based on these classifications. Third, the approaches are
    summarized and discussed according to their features, applications and technical
    contributions. Wireless sensor networks A WSN is a distributed network of relatively
    small, lightweight wireless nodes that are equipped with sensors (Can and Demirbas
    2013; Owojaiye and Sun 2012; Rathnayaka and Potdar 2013; Van Hoesel et al. 2013).
    Sensor nodes are the basic building blocks of a WSN. A typical node is composed
    of a transceiver, sensor(s), external memory and power source. Figure 1 shows
    the basic architecture of the nodes. The node has the ability to sense, process
    and communicate spatial and temporal variables of interest. Such nodes are deployed
    in areas of interest to work together for environmental or system monitoring (Peng
    and Liu 2012; Stankovic 2008; Vicaire et al. 2009; Wood et al. 2006). Fig. 1 Basic
    architecture of a sensor node Full size image WSN topologies Notable topologies
    mentioned in the literature include the single-star topology (Srbinovska et al.
    2014), mesh topology (Watras et al. 2014), and cluster tree-based topology (Senturk
    and Akkaya 2014). Star single-hop topology In star single-hop topologies, each
    node (or ‘client’) must communicate to other nodes (‘clients’) through a central
    hub (or a ‘server’) or cluster head. The clients do not relay packets through
    other nodes. Instead, each node directly transmits its packet to the cluster head.
    Tongtong et al. (2011) proposed a method of sensing and monitoring the temperature
    and humidity in a greenhouse environment for various distances. It consists of
    one more sensor nodes, some repeat nodes, one main node, PC Terminal, MYSQL (an
    open source relational database management system), web service and one real time
    alarm system. Based on this system, the temperature and humidity parameters can
    be sensed and monitored. They then used the database and web service to record
    the parameters at specific times. Finally, a curve showing the measurement differences
    from the sensing module is drawn by the web server. If the curve depicts abnormal
    changes in the temperature and humidity measurements, an alarm system is triggered,
    which informs the monitor to take required action. In this system, although the
    wireless transceiver distance was limited by the battery power to just 1.26 m,
    the distance could be increased in steps of 1.26 m for each node. Thus, the total
    distance could be calculated as 1.26 m × [1 + N(repeat nodes)]. Shaikh et al.
    (2010) designed WSN nodes with a protocol that ensured low power consumption in
    their development of a cost-efficient crop irrigation control system. The nodes
    are categorized into sensor, actuator and sink nodes, to create a functional architecture.
    The system collects sensor data packets wirelessly via a ZigBee wireless technology
    (Baronti et al. 2007) configuration and transfers them to a connected PC through
    a serial interface. It then sends the request and actuator packet that was generated
    by the acquisition and control/decision support system through the WSN network.
    The network protocol described makes the protocol in this experiment a star single-hop
    topology. With the use of these components and topology, a broadcast based protocol
    called “ProtoSense” was then developed. In this protocol, data request is made
    one level at a time. If the target node is not at one level, it would be forwarded
    to the next level. Hence, this protocol can efficiently optimize power by reducing
    extra communication. It also introduces a request acknowledgement pattern to ensure
    reliability. Cluster tree-based multiple-hop topology In this type of topology,
    two or more star networks communicate through a central hub called a ‘root node’.
    Each sensor node transmits data within a limited radius to reach a nearby cluster
    head. The lower cluster heads then refine the data packets and act as relays to
    further transmit the refined data to a super cluster head or a root node. There
    can be communication among the lower cluster heads via peer-to-peer topologies.
    This type of network structure is implemented in a data aggregation method to
    reduce the energy consumption in the WSN deployment. For example, Nesa Sudha et
    al. (2011) organized sensor nodes into clusters, with one node acting as a cluster
    head and a base station (BS) acting as a super cluster head. This experiment combined
    six sensors per cluster, and there were three clusters in all. The data transmission
    between the BS and cluster heads and also communication between the clusters was
    by time division multiple access (TDMA). The data transmission was based on a
    single-hop from one node to a nearby node. Overall, the network structure of this
    deployment is a cluster tree-based multiple hop topology. Each node is assigned
    a unique identification address and is known to the BS. At any point in time,
    TDMA scheduled any one of the nodes as the cluster head and communicated this
    information to all of the nodes in the cluster. All of the nodes transmit their
    power source information to the BS, and the node with the highest energy level
    in the cluster is assigned to be head of that cluster. Peng and Liu (2012) described
    the implementation of an auto system scheme in which the sensor network nodes
    are combined with fuzzy controller nodes to schedule irrigation. In the design
    structure of the system, the WSN is composed of a sensor node cluster, a co-ordinator
    node and a controller node. Irrigation pipelines are laid across the irrigated
    areas, and electric control valves are installed on the pipelines. The sensor
    nodes collect humidity and temperature data and form sensor clusters based on
    the plant-water status. In the network structure, each sensor node gathers the
    real-time data of its surrounding areas and sends it to the cluster heads. The
    information is further sent to the co-ordinator nodes within a set time period.
    In the co-ordinator node is an embedded fuzzy controller. This controller controls
    the pump valves and decides when to activate the irrigation and for how long.
    The WSN deployment from the data collection to the decision-making point makes
    the network structure a cluster tree-based multiple hop topology. Mesh topology
    In mesh topology, each sensor node communicates to every other sensor node and
    acts as a relay to transmit data from the other nodes in the network. Gao et al.
    (2013) proposed an intelligent irrigation system based on a WSN and fuzzy control.
    The objective was to solve issues of soil fertility loss and water wastage in
    irrigation. The system was composed of sensor nodes and the controller node; additionally,
    soil moisture sensors, irrigation pipes, spray irrigation and irrigation control
    valves were deployed. The ZigBee network was adopted in the mesh network topology.
    While the sensor nodes acted as terminal nodes in the field, some sensors nodes
    were selected as routers. These router nodes collected data from the terminal
    nodes and transmitted them to a head node, called sink node, which gathers and
    controls data collected by other nodes. A control panel was introduced as the
    control node. Data were acquired at periodic intervals; the control valve opened
    and closed the irrigation process depending on the command received. Vellidis
    et al. (2013) reported on use of a mesh network-based soil moisture sensing WSN
    in combination with variable rate irrigation (VRI) at the 2013 European conference
    on precision agriculture. Majone et al. (2013) monitored soil moisture dynamics
    in the top soil to analyze the interplay between soil moisture dynamics and plant
    physiology. Their experiment used a multi-hop WSN that was connected across several
    soil and temperature nodes that were deployed across 27 locations. The sensor
    nodes were connected to an input/output interface through a node called TinyNode
    584 (Dubois-Ferrière et al. 2006) WSN platform, which was developed by SHOCKFISH
    company, Lausanne, Switzerland. Power sources WSNs have been proposed to detect
    and monitor spatial and temporal parameters (Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2011; Peres
    et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2012). The results are then used to control the levels
    of parameters to suit specific plant soil requirements and to provide event services.
    An example is the use of a WSN for intelligent diagnosis services and to schedule
    irrigation management. Power is required for WSN devices throughout their period
    of operation (Anastasi et al. 2009; Anisi et al. 2013b). There are two main types
    of power source: battery and solar. Battery sources Although batteries are relatively
    low cost and small size, continuous exposure to high temperature levels in fields
    have other undesirable effects, such as a shortened cycle life and an increased
    rate of self-discharge (Park et al. 2005). Short time battery life is a limitation
    on long-term monitoring. Rechargeable batteries can be used as a source of power
    to make up for the energy depletion in the sensor nodes. Homogeneous battery-based
    power approaches In homogenous WSNs, all of the sensor nodes possess the same
    network attributes in terms of their computational capability, battery power and
    transmission radius (Hou et al. 2005). All of the sensor nodes are identical,
    and all of the nodes might have the same lifetime. The advantage of using homogeneous
    nodes is that they are less complicated and uniform in their maintenance requirements.
    All of the sensor nodes could also be low-cost. In terms of cluster formation,
    any one of them can be selected as a cluster head. However, due to the continuous
    processing of data in terms of aggregation and protocol co-ordination and the
    long-range communication that are maintained with the remote BS, the co-ordinator
    nodes could become overloaded. As they have the same power resource as the other
    sensor nodes, their energy depletes faster resulting in premature failure (Mhatre
    and Rosenberg 2004). Vellidis et al. (2008) proposed a system in which multiple
    homogenous sensor nodes were used for monitoring soil moisture and temperature
    to schedule irrigation in a cotton farm. There was single-hop data transmission
    of data via RFID to a fixed central receiving unit. A laptop connected to the
    receiver was placed at one end of the field. The sensor nodes were composed of
    sensors, a sensor circuit board, and an RFID tag. At periodic intervals, the smart
    sensor board acquired sensor values and transmitted those values wirelessly to
    the receiver. The presence of plant biomass, terrain and objects imposed transmission
    difficulties during field testing of the prototype. This difficulty was solved
    when tags were removed from the electronic boards and mounted on hollow flexible
    fiberglass rods at approximately 1.2 m above ground level. A large number of sensor
    nodes were deployed to cover a large area. However, such a large number of nodes
    can cause interference problems which may result in more packet loss. A sensor
    circuit board which was called “smart sensor board” was supported by battery power.
    The micro-controller switched to sleep mode between sensor readings and data transmission.
    Sub-circuits also went ON and OFF as required. The microcontroller transmitted
    an alarm code when the voltage dropped below an acceptable threshold. This was
    meant to send an alarm and thereby avoid regular inspections. This method of power
    management increased the battery life through the growing season. Although some
    energy consumption reduction methods were implemented to conserve power, the approach
    was still not energy efficient. This is because the approach gathered data by
    using single-hop transmission of data from the multiple nodes in the field to
    the centrally fixed receiving unit. This method does not balance the energy expenditure
    to the multiple sensor nodes in the field. The energy levels of the nodes located
    farther away from the sink would deplete faster due to more transmission power
    required for long transmission ranges. Most of those sensor nodes would fail before
    their counterparts closer to the sink. Therefore, the energy of the network is
    unbalanced and thus, the network lifetime may be short. Baggio (2005) instrumented
    a potato field to monitor micro-climate: humidity, temperature and weather. This
    action was intended to reveal when the crop was at risk of developing a phytophtora
    disease. The experiment was also to collect statistics on the behavior of the
    WSN in a real-world experiment. Furthermore, the robustness of the energy-efficient
    T-MAC (Van Dam and Langendoen 2003) protocol was also tested. The sensor nodes
    used in the experiment were called TNOdes. These nodes were deployed across the
    field with some of them acting as relays. These relays were without sensors. These
    homogeneous sensor nodes measured the climatological conditions. A weather station
    was also installed on the field to register luminosity, precipitation, wind strength
    and direction. Soil moisture, which is a critical factor for micro-climate and
    development of diseases, was measured by a number of sensors. A sensor to measure
    the height of the groundwater table was installed. The nodes collected and transmitted
    infield data to a so-called field gateway, which also forwarded the data to a
    low frequency array (LOFAR) gateway by Wi-Fi. LOFAR is the low-frequency array
    for radio astronomy built by ASTRON organization in the Netherlands. The LOFAR
    gateway was connected to the internet through cable, and data were uploaded to
    a LOFAR server and further distributed to a couple of other servers using the
    extensible mark-up language (XML) format. The data on the behavior of the WSN,
    which was gathered during the experiment, served as a foundation for WSN algorithm
    simulations to check failed connections and dead nodes. A number of methods were
    adopted to ensure optimal utilization of the power source and to extend the lifetime
    of the sensor nodes. For example, the nodes reported data only every 10 min. The
    data sent over the wireless link was minimized by the delta encoding technique
    (Mogul et al. 1997) which is a data compression technique for efficient data storage.
    Data compression over radio communication lines was also considered. An energy-efficiency
    protocol called T-MAC was introduced, and it was implemented on the radio with
    a duty cycle of 7 %. Furthermore, some methods also ensured reliable data delivery
    to the LOFAR gateway, in such a way as to avert data loss. A multi-hop routing
    protocol (MintRoute) was proposed and used to maintain reliability of the WSN.
    This method reveals when the crop is at risk of developing disease and informs
    the farmer to appropriately treat the field or parts of it with fungicide. Their
    approach, with nodes reporting data every 10 min, was designed to save power.
    Furthermore, to balance energy, the multi-hop routing protocol of TinyOS (Levis
    et al. 2005), an application-specific operation system for WSN, was used to send
    data. Their approach was energy-efficient as it combined both energy balancing
    and energy consumption methods. Nesa Sudha et al. (2011) proposed an energy-efficient
    TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor communications in an automatic irrigation
    system. Their experiment involved a header node that collected data directly from
    all of the nodes in the field and passed them to the BS. Such a network arrangement
    made it a star single-hop topology. Direct communication is maintained between
    the sensor nodes and the BS in the data accumulation process, whereby the header
    node does not work on the collected data except to directly transmit it to the
    BS. The process starts by the BS assigning unique identification addresses to
    each of the nodes. The nodes went into a sleep state (or into a receiving mode)
    after acquiring the address. To obtain data at a specific location, the BS sent
    a broadcast request to all of the nodes, but only the addressed node responded
    with its present temperature and moisture values. The BS received values from
    all of the areas by repeating this process for all of the nodes in its address
    table. In this approach, the medium access control (MAC) (I.C.S.L.M.S. Committee
    1997) protocol was used to control energy consumption. Sensor nodes turned ON/OFF
    their radio according to a schedule to save energy. The approach verifies that
    data fusion (aggregation) in which nodes were grouped into clusters was more energy
    efficient than direct communication in which each node transmitted data directly
    to the sink. In energy conservation, a distributed TDMA-based scheme which leads
    to collision free transmission over the data channel was used. This reduced the
    energy consumption by each node thereby reducing the overall energy consumption.
    This approach could therefore extend the network lifetime. Heterogeneous battery-based
    power approaches In a heterogeneous WSN, nodes in the network have different network
    attributes (Hou et al. 2005). This type of network is usually associated with
    a hierarchical sensor network in which relatively low resource sensor nodes are
    deployed at the lower level. Additionally, higher resource sensor nodes are made
    into co-ordinator and sink nodes. In fact, in heterogeneous networks, only the
    co-ordinators and cluster heads might require higher resources. This arrangement
    is to enable the cluster head to receive data from sensor nodes and process it
    for the BS, to support data aggregation and protocol co-ordination. Providing
    more power source for cluster heads extends their lifetime under high loads. In
    addition, this arrangement could increase the cost and complexity. Zhang et al.
    (2012) proposed a WSN-based system to monitor the soil moisture and analyzed the
    temporal and spatial variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. According
    to Fig. 2, the system architecture included heterogeneous sensor nodes and sink
    nodes and a remote management platform. The sensor nodes in the field collected
    and sent soil moisture data periodically to the sink nodes. Sink nodes that acted
    as gateways to the general packet radio service (GPRS) sent the data to the remote
    management platform via the TCP-IP standard protocol. The platform that was based
    on the BS mode could collect, store and analyze data and output the report forms.
    The sensor node positions were measured with a global positioning system (GPS).
    Additionally, the distance between the nodes was established according to the
    real field situation, the signal transmission distance and the spatial variability
    in the soil moisture. The core module of the sensor node was a wireless microprocessor
    from Crossbow Company, California, USA. The frequency domain measurement method
    to determine the dielectric constant of soil was used to calculate soil moisture.
    Both the sensor nodes and the soil moisture sensors were waterproofed to withstand
    harsh conditions. The power source to sustain the network operation was from a
    battery. Additionally, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode and
    were activated only when data were to be collected. Multi-hop and self-organizing
    nodes were also used to guarantee network connectivity. The authors designed and
    developed a multi-channel interface, peripheral bus and solar power system. Fig.
    2 Architecture of the soil moisture real-time monitoring system (Zhang et al.
    2012) Full size image The data collected was processed and analyzed by classical
    statistical methods. With a combination of soil moisture monitoring sensors, WSN
    and spatial analysis software, their method gathers and transmits soil moisture
    data to remote management systems automatically. The method used in the research
    to develop the soil distribution system was simple, and the system offers valuable
    information as the basis to make irrigation decisions. Soil moisture sensor nodes
    sent data to the sink node every 30 min. This would reduce the energy consumption
    of the sensor nodes. Soil moisture sensors were activated to collect data only
    when the data was needed which would also reduce the energy consumption. The multi-hop
    method of transferring data enables the nodes to transmit data to neighbor nodes
    for onward forwarding to the sink, instead of the case in single-hop data transmission
    in which the power source of remotely located nodes would be exhausted quickly.
    Yu et al. (2013) proposed a hybrid architecture involving WSN and wireless underground
    sensor networks (WUSN). An implementation framework was then developed for real-time
    soil property monitoring. The impact of soil parameters, node depth, signal frequency
    and attenuation on transmission were studied. Reflection, scattering and diffraction
    may occur in the soil and at the soil–air interface during data transmission.
    The experiment revealed that the frequency of the electromagnetic signals and
    the water content of soil affect the path loss. As depicted in the Peplinski principle
    (Peplinski et al., 1995), γ = α + jβ, with $$ \alpha \, = \omega \sqrt {\frac{{\mu
    \varepsilon^{''} }}{2}\left[ {\sqrt {1 + \left( {\frac{{\varepsilon^{''''} }}{{\varepsilon^{''}
    }}} \right)^{2} } - 1} \right]} $$ (1) $$ \beta \, = \omega \sqrt {\frac{{\mu
    \varepsilon^{''} }}{2}\left[ {\sqrt {1 + \left( {\frac{{\varepsilon^{''''} }}{{\varepsilon^{''}
    }}} \right)^{2} } + 1} \right]} $$ (2) where ω = 2πf is the angular frequency,
    μ is the magnetic permeability, and ε′ and ε″ are the real and imaginary parts
    of the dielectric constant, respectively. The system architecture used CC2430,
    a wireless transceiver chip based on ZigBee by Texas Instruments, USA, which was
    developed to gather soil terrestrial information. The WUSN used NRF905 wireless
    chip manufactured by Nordic Semi-Conductor Company, Oslo, Norway, to collect and
    transmit information underground (UG). The hybrid system topology is a combination
    of terrestrial and WUSN structures and is illustrated in Fig. 3. The WSN was installed
    above 0.4 m depth while the WUSN was below 0.4 m. The sink node of the WUSN is
    placed on the ground. All WUSN nodes transmit data to the terrestrial sink node
    with their location based on the applications. The sink node is also said to be
    static or mobile provided it is within the communication range. WUSN is set up
    by placing underground sensors in the field, while deploying data sinks above
    the ground located around the field. Mobile data sinks are carried by people or
    machines in the field. The results of the experiment reveal that at low frequency
    signals and low volumetric water content, signal attenuation and bit error rate
    are minimal. The path loss is also influenced by depth of the WUSN. Fig. 3 Topology
    structure of WUSN Full size image In the authors’ test model, sensors are buried
    at depths of 0.8, 1, 1.6 and 2 m, which implies a large power source requirement.
    The UG nodes would have to expend a lot of energy in a single-hop to transmit
    data to the sink node located aboveground. Thus the nodes power sources could
    deplete quickly thereby shortening the network lifetime. Kim et al. (2011) designed
    and developed a sensor network architecture using autonomous robots with beacons
    to monitor and detect fires and air pollution in fields. The authors built a conceptual
    linear topology and implemented it in a tree-based network topology. Sensor modules
    were developed using a RF transceiver with model number CC2420, a single-chip
    2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 designed for low power and low voltage wireless applications
    by Texas Instruments, USA. Also, a micro controller with model number ATMega128L
    by Atmel corporation, California, USA was used. The application was to monitor
    the temperature, gas, smoke, humidity and illumination. The data collected was
    forwarded to a co-ordinator node every few seconds. Then, the co-ordinator sends
    the data to a specific processor called a knowledge information processor for
    agriculture-sensor data and fire-sensor data (KIP-AF) which shows the measured
    values in real time. For any data that arrives at the KIP-AF, the server transmits
    an alert message to the end user while using the ZigBee enabled SIM (ZSIM). Three
    types of nodes used in the scheme were the wireless co-ordinator (WC), the wireless
    router (WR), and the wireless end device (WED). The WC was the sink node and gateway,
    and it transmitted periodic beacon frames as well as collected data from the WRs
    and WEDs. The study used heterogeneous sensor nodes made up of one co-ordinator
    node, eight routers or parent nodes and 50 sensor nodes (WED) and a tree-based
    network topology with a maximum of three hops. A conceptual network topology that
    models the implementation architecture of the system is shown in Fig. 4. All of
    the sensor nodes transmitted packets in every transmission interval to process
    emergency data. At every interval, all of the sensor nodes transmit their sensing
    data to the WC, which then forwards it to the KIP-AF. This processor maintained
    the agricultural database for intelligent decisions and further analysis. When
    KIP-AF detects emergency conditions such as fire and dangerous air pollution,
    it immediately informs the remote user via a ZSIM terminal. To gather wide-area
    data from the farm, the study introduced mobile robots to cover areas that were
    inaccessible to the fixed nodes. Therefore, the sensor nodes in the field were
    heterogeneous, comprising mobile and static nodes. However, mobility leads to
    link failures due to network handover or loss of line of sight (LOS). The solution
    to this problem was for the mobile robots to scan for an alternative path to move
    to the WC. This action was performed by using the best link quality indicator
    (LQI) among the scanned WR candidates. Figure 5 shows the handover scenario of
    the mobile nodes. The second approach was to increase the RF power of the robot
    by adopting power amplifier and low noise amplifier (LNA) functions in such a
    way as to double the transmission range. Batteries were used as the power source.
    Fig. 4 System implementation architecture Full size image Fig. 5 Mobile handover
    scenario for router recovery (Kim et al. 2011) Full size image The packet loss
    rate from the WED to the WC was measured to be less than 4 %, and the numerical
    expression to calculate it is given as: $$ \frac{{{\text{N}}_{\text{Fail}} }}{{{\text{N}}_{{{\text{Fail}}}}+
    {\text{N}}_{{\text{Re} {\text{c}}}} }} \times 100 $$ (3) where \( {\text{N}}_{\text{Fail}}
    \) and \( {\text{N}}_{\text{Rec}} \) are the number of failed packets to transmit
    to the co-ordinator and the number of successfully received packets in the co-ordinator,
    respectively. Additionally, at any time that the mobile node executes a handover
    procedure, the average handover latency \( {\text{T}}_{\text{HO}} \) is calculated
    by using the expression: $$ {\text{T}}_{\text{HO }} = {\text{T}}_{{{\text{beacon}}\_{\text{loss}}}}
    + {\text{T}}_{{{\text{asc}}\_{\text{req}}}} + {\text{T}}_{\text{ack}} + {\text{T}}_{{{\text{data}}\_{\text{req}}}}
    + {\text{T}}_{\text{ack}} + {\text{T}}_{{{\text{asc}}\_{\text{res }}}} \, + \,{\text{T}}_{\text{ack}}
    $$ (4) where \( {\text{T}}_{{{\text{beacon}}\_{\text{loss}}}} \) is the interval
    of the beacon loss due to the handover, \( {\text{T}}_{{{\text{asc}}\_{\text{req}}}}
    \) is the transmission time of the association request frame, \( {\text{T}}_{{{\text{asc}}\_{\text{res
    }}}} \)is the transmission time of the association response frame, \( {\text{T}}_{{{\text{data}}\_{\text{req}}}}
    \) is the transmission time of the data request frame and \( {\text{T}}_{\text{ack}}
    \)is the transmission time of the acknowledgement frame. The most important concern
    is for reliable data transmission of real-time conditions without energy losses
    at the sensor nodes which could affect the network lifetime. Duty cycle is fixed
    at 100 %; this suggests that all sensor nodes transmit data to the WC at every
    transmission window in order to process data for onward forwarding to the sink.
    This may increase network traffic thereby causing packet collisions; retransmissions
    could lead to faster power source depletion. Solar power Batteries can limit the
    functionality of WSNs due to their low capacities but a solar energy harvesting
    module could fully meet the needs of practical applications in PA. Sensor network
    survival no longer depends on battery life. However, a solar harvesting system
    is more expensive to run than battery-based approaches and energy from the sun
    is not always available. Moreover, it has the disadvantage of being obtrusive.
    The solar panel must be mounted above the canopy and generally is an impediment
    to field operations. Homogeneous solar-based power approaches Hedley et al. (2012)
    developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring method to provide information
    for irrigation scheduling. Data were presented in digital format for incorporating
    into the VRI controlling software. The research was conducted in a 75 ha wheat
    field. The irrigation was by a center pivot (CP) irrigator with VRI modification.
    Each sprinkler was controlled individually by digital maps uploaded to a central
    controller. Sensors were combined with a real-time kinematic differential global
    positioning system (RTK-DGPS) to measure soil and land parameters. Data loggers
    were mounted on a vehicle to acquire high resolution vertical mode datasets in
    two separate surveys. The field was segmented into three classes, and homogeneous
    sensor nodes were deployed in each class. The nodes were organized in a mesh-structured
    topology and had a range of up to 1 km in LOS. For energy efficiency, the nodes
    switched into a sleep mode when they were in an idle state. Each node was attached
    with: (1) two Delta-T SM300 moisture sensors installed at 0.2 and 0.5 m depth
    to monitor the volumetric soil moisture content (v/v), (2) a Spectrum Technologies
    Watermark soil matric potential sensor that was installed at 0.2 m depth to monitor
    the soil moisture tension, and (3) a tensiometer equipped with an absolute pressure
    transducer, to assess the depth of the water table, was installed at 1 m depth.
    A rain gauge was also attached to one node, to monitor the irrigation and rainfall
    events. Data were relayed to a BS every 15 min; it was processed in real-time
    and converted to the necessary format and immediately made available through a
    3G cellular modem via the internet to a webpage. End users could access the web
    site. This WSN method provided a direct measure of the soil moisture status and
    the need for irrigation. It has the advantages of using site-specific real-time
    soil moisture data and site-specific climatic conditions to schedule the irrigation.
    Therefore, (1) there is no need to know the plant type, (2) there is no need to
    know the plant growth stage, (3) uncertainties (errors) when estimating the evaporation–transpiration
    (ET) are avoided, (4) there is no need to know any of the variables needed to
    estimate the ET, such as the air temperature, relative humidity (RH), radiation,
    soil temperature and wind conditions. In order to conserve power, the sensor nodes
    relayed data to the BS every 15 min. Mafuta et al. (2013) designed a WSN for PA
    in Malawi and called it the WiPAM. This system was intended to automate the irrigation
    process and implement an irrigation management system (IMS). The authors investigated
    variability in soil moisture. Information on the variability was then used by
    the irrigation controller to initiate irrigation events. For precise irrigation,
    an irrigation event was triggered occasionally. The sensor nodes were homogeneous,
    and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee co-ordinator (ZC).
    In the star topology, three sensors nodes were configured as ZED (in field-nodes)
    and one as a gateway node. One other node was also configured as ZC with the function
    to aggregate data and actuate the irrigation valves. The network topology is shown
    in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 The architecture of the irrigation system Full size image To
    operate the network, ZED collected soil moisture and temperature data at predefined
    time intervals. Sampled data were sent and stored in a co-ordinator node. The
    co-ordinator node then sent the data to a gateway node, which also transmitted
    the data to a remote monitoring station (RMS) through a cellular network. The
    power source to sustain the operation of the network was solar power. This approach
    was complemented by an energy-efficient management approach. In other words, sensor
    nodes went to sleep when idle and woke up to repeat the previous steps when required.
    The irrigation valves opened or closed depending on the values that were stored
    in the co-ordinator node. The WiPAM was composed of two sections: the irrigation
    station (IS) and the RMS. The sections were linked through a cellular network,
    as shown in Fig. 7. The RMS captured the performance parameters of the IS at the
    remote site. The parameters were the soil moisture level, the soil temperature,
    the battery voltage levels of the sensor nodes, the quality of the wireless links,
    and the valve status. The main contribution of this paper is the design, implementation
    and performance enhancement of a low-cost and efficient IMS that combines sensors
    and actuators in a wireless sensor/actuator network. Fig. 7 Irrigation management
    system architecture Full size image To attain low power consumption, the protocol,
    operating at low data rate (250 kbps at 2.4 GHz), was used to gather data. Other
    technologies such as Bluetooth (802.15.1) and Wi-Fi (802.11) consume more battery
    power although they offer higher data rates. Moreover, in PA, some sensor data
    do not require wide bandwidth since it is not necessary to continuously monitor
    soil moisture and temperature. Using ZC to aggregate data before actuating an
    irrigation valve could reduce energy consumption. The approach further conserved
    power by putting the ZEDs to sleep and only waking them up to make measurements.
    The sensor data were collected at intervals of 30 min when the system was idle
    and 2 min when irrigation was taking place. This arrangement could further reduce
    energy consumption. In general, this approach could be said to be energy sufficient
    as it incorporated a number of energy reduction methods. Majone et al. (2013)
    described the deployment of a WSN in an apple orchard. The goal was to monitor
    soil moisture dynamics in the top soil to analyze interaction with plant physiology.
    In the experiment, several homogeneous sensor nodes were deployed in a multi-hop
    wireless mesh topology. The sensor nodes were connected across several soil and
    temperature nodes and were deployed across 27 locations. The sensor nodes were
    connected through an input/output interface to a TinyNode 584 WSN platform. A
    solar power source supplied energy to the network. Some energy-efficient management
    approaches were adopted to minimize energy consumption. Real-time monitoring of
    the system began with measurement at each node of the battery and solar panel
    voltages and the internal voltage as well as the temperature of the micro-controller.
    On-board software routines were based on the TinyOS-2.x operating system. The
    process to acquire data started every 10 min, and between every two consecutive
    measurements, the sensor nodes went into sleep mode. Unnecessary modules [such
    as radio frequency (RF), module and sensor] were switched off. This action decreased
    the power consumption to a minimum of approximately 80 µA at 6 V. The energy consumption
    fluctuated from the start to end of data collection. Sensor nodes sent data to
    the sink node. The sink nodes then measured the received signal strength indicator
    (RSSI) value of every packet and forwarded the data packets to a PC gateway (GW)
    over the serial port. The packets were assigned a date and time, and the raw data
    were forwarded to a MySQL database for real time and historic management. These
    data were eventually converted and calibrated by specific equations and were displayed
    by dynamic PHP web pages. The experiment showed that sensors at shallow depths
    responded more quickly than those at larger depths. The nodes which were placed
    at lower depth measured high values of volumetric water content compared to the
    nodes at higher depths. Moreover, the nodes at higher depth had lower response
    time due to higher attenuation. It appears that this approach employed two contrasting
    methods in terms of energy efficiency. On the one hand, the approach may have
    conserved energy by putting the sensor nodes into low power mode (also called
    sleep mode) and switching off every unnecessary module (such as RF, module and
    sensor). However, a mesh network topology to enable multi-hop data transmissions
    was used and all the data were sent over a radio channel to a sink node. This
    means that all the nodes were awake and actively sending or providing pathways
    for one another to the sink node, thereby wasting power source in the process.
    The inference made is that the data were sent in raw form without any form of
    data compression or aggregation and this could have generated packet losses and
    retransmissions. Again since all nodes sent data to only one sink, the sink could
    over work thus depleting power source faster. This approach may not be energy
    efficient and, therefore, could have short network lifetime. Heterogeneous solar-based
    power approaches Peres et al. (2011) designed an intelligent autonomous gateway,
    which was called intelligent precision agriculture gateway (iPAGAT). The goal
    of iPAGAT was to function as an interface device that processes in-field data
    by performing data aggregation and integration. The processed information would
    then be transmitted to high-level decision support systems for farm managers to
    make decisions. iPAGAT used Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and GPRS to communicate with
    local and remote users. The power source for the system was solar power with a
    rechargeable battery, to increase the network lifetime. In the experiment, the
    communication was based on five layers. The layers were labeled as L1–5. L1 involves
    the function of using WSN to gather environmental data from the vineyard management
    zones. L2 devices function to co-ordinate the WSN and process the L1 data by means
    of data aggregation techniques. The L2 layer also acts as an access point to a
    site-specific management application and serves as a gateway to L3, which is the
    layer that has the function to manage the entire farm. Layers L4 and L5 are farmer
    associations and country policies, which are outside the scope of this paper.
    There are three methods of communication in the system set up: (1) the link between
    the WSN and gateway (i.e., the L1–L2 connections), (2) the link between the gateway
    and local user (with a smartphone), through Bluetooth and/or IEEE 802.11, and
    (3) the link between the gateway and farm management office through GSM/GPRS and/or
    IEEE 802.11. In the experiment, small stationary and heterogeneous data acquisition
    nodes were deployed across the field in a mesh network topology according to the
    ZigBee standard. The co-ordinator of this network is situated at the gateway of
    the infrastructure; it manages the WSN and also acts as a sink node for the collected
    data. It fed data into the gateway database which aggregated the collected data
    and made the compressed data available to local and remote users through web services.
    The solar panel uses Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 technologies to communicate with
    the system devices. The iPAGAT served multiple functions: an environmental repository
    for the collected data, a sink node for the WSN, an aggregation engine and a Real-time
    alert system (RTAS). The management levels of the system are shown in Fig. 8.
    Fig. 8 Management level scenario (Peres et al. 2011) Full size image The RTAS
    embedded in the IPAGAT for disease prediction was a large advantage of the system.
    However, iPAGAT was rather complex and not easy to understand. Data were collected
    through multi-hop mesh network with clusters. In this way, the load was distributed
    among the cluster heads without overloading some specific nodes. Moreover, the
    collected data was summarized by a data aggregation method before transmission
    to the next layer. In this way, only compressed data was transmitted and the system
    avoided frame collisions and packet losses. In the light of the above, this approach
    could be described as being energy efficient since it combined both energy balancing
    and energy reduction methods in the data collection process. Garcia-Sanchez et
    al. (2011) proposed a system to monitor crop fields. The system could detect and
    identify procedures of a WSN video surveillance system. It also monitored, detected,
    identified and transmitted data over long distances in distributed crops. The
    authors designed an integrated wireless sensor networks solution for PA (ISSPA)
    and added it to the basic PA mechanisms. The system integrated video transmission
    to networks which hitherto only monitored crops. The system was, therefore, able
    to reduce the cost, increase the cycle lifetime of the devices and networks, and
    avoid duplicate infrastructure. The ISSPA synchronized the duty and sleep phases
    for the heterogeneous sensor nodes in the system. This goal was accomplished by
    the use of message forwarding techniques and multi-interface routing devices.
    All of the communications issues conformed to IEEE802.15.4 technology and allowed
    co-operation between several communication nodes. Another contribution of the
    system was the design and implementation of IEEE 802.15.4 real-devices that avoided
    frame collisions in the message transmissions and performance of their specific
    functions (i.e., crop monitoring, video surveillance) within the agronomic cycle
    for the crop of interest. This system provided the necessary hardware and software
    for monitoring farm field parameters such as temperature, humidity and soil nutrient
    level. It also detected and identified the procedures of a WSN video-surveillance
    system. Devices used in the study were categorized into five groups based on their
    functionality. The categories were the monitoring group, detection group, identification
    group, crop-gateway and farmer Co-op-gateway. All of the components of these nodes
    and gateways were encased for protection against dust and rain. For each type
    of device, appropriate commercialized hardware was selected, and appropriate software
    was developed to achieve functionality. These assorted nodes incorporated appropriate
    sensors together with wireless communication modules. The resulting devices were
    able to acquire data from different sensors, such as salinity, PH, temperature
    and soil moisture. Furthermore, motion detectors and identification sensors existed
    for video surveillance and crop security and control. Sensors collected appropriate
    data and transmitted it to the Gateway through a communication module, which then
    delivered the information to the Farmers’ Co-operative. The Co-operative then
    provided each farmer with information on his crops in real time. The farmer received
    the information at home via the internet on a PDA or Mobile handset. The system
    architecture is shown in Fig. 9. Solar power supplied the required power for the
    devices. Fig. 9 System architecture (Garcia-Sanchez et al. 2011) Full size image
    The approach used cluster-tree network topology to collect the required data from
    the sensor nodes. Then the ISSPA co-ordinated the information transmission from
    the cluster nodes and so reduced power consumption and frame collision probability.
    To further conserve power, IEEE 802.15.4 real devices were implemented. This suggests
    there were no retransmissions, thereby conserving power. Video-surveillance, which
    was used over the crop areas to capture, process and send pictures to the BS,
    may imply high energy consumption. The video messages, along with the monitoring
    data transmission coming from many sensors placed in separated crops could also
    provoke frame collisions and, consequently, losses. The issue could be more critical
    when several cameras are considered. The retransmission of monitoring messages
    may also cause more energy consumption. To mitigate the shortcomings, an ISSPA
    mechanism was again used. The mechanism provides an appropriate synchronization
    of duty and sleep phases for all nodes in the system using message forwarding
    techniques and multi-interface routing devices. Even though the approach used
    power-hungry devices such as video cameras in its implementation, it co-ordinated
    the data transmission from the nodes of the cluster network. Additionally, it
    reduced frame collision probability which prevented packet retransmission; thereby,
    mitigating the power consumption. Dong et al. (2013) provide a proof-of-concept
    towards an autonomous PA system by integrating a CP irrigation system with a WUSN.
    The system provides autonomous irrigation management capabilities by monitoring
    the soil conditions in real time using WUSN. The results are used to evaluate
    empirical channel models for soil–air communications. Their experiment proved
    that the concept of WUSN-CP was feasible. They designed an UG antenna to improve
    the communication range. In the experiment, above-ground nodes (AG nodes) were
    installed on the arm of a CP irrigation system, while UG nodes were buried at
    depth of 0.35 m in the field in a circle. The CP rotated in both clockwise and
    anti-clockwise directions. At suitable range, the AG nodes established communication
    with the UG nodes. Two antenna schemes were used: firstly, a full-wave (FW) dipole
    antenna for the AG node and secondly, a single ended elliptical antenna (SEA)
    for the UG. While the former has a gain of 3 dB, the latter used a directional
    Yagi antenna (Pozar 2000) for the AG node and a circular planar antenna for the
    UG nodes. The Yagi antenna has a higher directivity with a maximum gain of 10
    dB. Both the SEA antenna and the circular planar antenna are customized according
    to the operation range. A TinyOS application was developed to analyze the experiment
    without the need to reprogram the sensors. An AG node located on the CP maintains
    unicast communication with a UG node buried UG within their communication window.
    This suggests that the power source was only spent in transmitting data directly
    from one node to the other. Since data was not broadcast, it implies that other
    sensor nodes would not participate in data transmissions thereby conserving power.
    Moreover, no intermediate nodes were required in the data transfer; the source
    and sink nodes were therefore peer-to-peer. From the system structure, there could
    be delays in the spinning of the CP to reach a particular node. However, this
    delay may be acceptable in the application area of PA, since such delay is insufficient
    to cause significant difference in the measured parameters. This approach could
    therefore, be said to be energy efficient in the light of the foregoing observations.
    Discussion Table 1 compares WSN approaches based on their applications, features
    and contributions as used in PA. The table shows that the proposed WSN applications
    solutions are in irrigation scheduling, although other areas such as pollution
    and fire detection are also exploited. The major contributions of the discussed
    approaches could be categorized into data transmission reliability, energy efficiency
    and efficient scheduling of the nodes specifically for irrigation control. Several
    approaches (Fernandes et al. 2013; Peres et al. 2011) have adopted data aggregation
    techniques to collect the required data which is a technique known for the reduction
    of communication overhead and energy expenditure of nodes in WSN (Anisi et al.
    2013a; Nesa Sudha et al. 2011; Theodoridis et al. 2012). Moreover, WSN approaches
    must consider the type of topology to use and whether the sensor nodes are homogeneous
    or heterogeneous. Finally, a critical consideration identified was the use of
    appropriate power source to extend the network lifetime. Table 1 Features of WSN
    approaches in PA Full size table In general, energy-efficient routing for extending
    the network lifetime is provided by two methods: (1) energy balancing, in which
    overloading and multi-functioning of certain specific nodes is prevented, and
    the residual energy of the sensor nodes is monitored; and (2) energy consumption
    reduction to mitigate the average energy consumption of the network using methods
    such as clustering, reducing the number of messages, reducing overhead and establishing
    co-operative communications. In Table 2, the approaches have been classified according
    to the energy efficient methods used. Table 2 Energy efficient methods Full size
    table Conclusions A WSN is an efficient monitoring technique for use in PA. In
    this paper, the state-of-the-art of WSNs has been discussed and reviewed. To achieve
    this goal, first, the various topologies of WSN approaches, including star single-hop,
    cluster tree-based multi-hop and mesh networks, were described. Due to the vital
    role of energy in a WSN, the sources of power in WSN approaches, including battery
    and solar power, were described. Second, the current WSN approaches that are used
    in PA based on the power source and the type of the node were categorized and
    reviewed. Third, the approaches based on the applications, features and technical
    contributions of the WSN were outlined. Abbreviations AG: Above ground BS: Base

    \ essential to increase the productivity of \nagricultural and farming processes\
    \ to improve yields and cost-\neffectiveness with new technology such as the Internet\
    \ of Things \n(IoT). In particular, IoT can make agricultural and farming \nindustry\
    \ \nprocesses \nmore \nefficient \nby \nreducing \nhuman \nintervention through\
    \ automation. In this study, the aim to \nanalyze recently developed IoT applications\
    \ in the agriculture \nand farming industries to provide an overview of sensor\
    \ data \ncollections, technologies, and sub-verticals such as water \nmanagement\
    \ and crop management. In this review, data is \nextracted from 60 peer-reviewed\
    \ scientific publications (2016-\n2018) with a focus on IoT sub-verticals and\
    \ sensor data collection \nfor measurements to make accurate decisions. Our results\
    \ from \nthe reported studies show water management is the highest sub-\nvertical\
    \ (28.08%) followed by crop management (14.60%) then \nsmart farming (10.11%).\
    \ From the data collection, livestock \nmanagement and irrigation management resulted\
    \ in the same \npercentage (5.61%). In regard to sensor data collection, the \n\
    highest result was for the measurement of environmental \ntemperature (24.87%)\
    \ and environmental humidity (19.79%). \nThere are also some other sensor data\
    \ regarding soil moisture \n(15.73%) and soil pH (7.61%). Research indicates that\
    \ of the \ntechnologies used in IoT application development, Wi-Fi is the \nmost\
    \ frequently used (30.27%) followed by mobile technology \n(21.10%). As per our\
    \ review of the research, we can conclude \nthat the agricultural sector (76.1%)\
    \ is researched considerably \nmore than compared to the farming sector (23.8%).\
    \ This study \nshould be used as a reference for members of the agricultural \n\
    industry to improve and develop the use of IoT to enhance \nagricultural production\

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n12 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\

    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

     \n \nV. CONCLUSION \nFrom our observations from the 60 peer-reviewed \npublications\
    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\
    \ make the automation process more \neffective and efficient, consequently, to\
    \ obtain the good \nbusinesses outcome. \nAUTHORS’ PROFILE \nR.M., S.W., and M.N.H.\

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Geospatial data volume exceeds hundreds of
    Petabytes and is increasing exponentially mainly driven by images/videos/data
    generated by mobile devices and high resolution imaging systems. Fast data discovery
    on historical archives and/or real time datasets is currently limited by various
    data formats that have different projections and spatial resolution, requiring
    extensive data processing before analytics can be carried out. A new platform
    called Physical Analytics Integrated Repository and Services (PAIRS) is presented
    that enables rapid data discovery by automatically updating, joining, and homogenizing
    data layers in space and time. Built on top of open source big data software,
    PAIRS manages automatic data download, data curation, and scalable storage while
    being simultaneously a computational platform for running physical and statistical
    models on the curated datasets. By addressing data curation before data being
    uploaded to the platform, multi-layer queries and filtering can be performed in
    real time. In addition, PAIRS offers a foundation for developing custom analytics.
    Towards that end we present two examples with models which are running operationally:
    (1) high resolution evapo-transpiration and vegetation monitoring for agriculture
    and (2) hyperlocal weather forecasting driven by machine learning for renewable
    energy forecasting. Published in: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Santa Clara, CA, USA SECTION I. Introduction
    Digitization of the “world” is changing many industries including the way in which
    geospatial data is analyzed. With daily imaging of earth surface by multiple satellites,
    spatial and temporal correlations can be established between locations and events
    in real time. In addition to satellite images, weather or climate models are updated
    multiple time per days generating insight into the atmosphere-earth interaction
    and its impact on environment, business activity, and human life. While static
    or reanalysis studies were carried out, in the past, for example to understand
    deforestation [1], land use [2], or urban area expansion [3], it is expected that,
    in the future, these models will run in real time. The exploding volume of geospatial
    data requires the development of a scalable platform that can fuse multiple data
    layers and combine them with local measurements from mobile devices or sensor
    networks. Such a platform should not be only a data repository but should also
    serve as modeling and analytics platform [4]. Combination of data and analytics
    can be used for running global models like crop production, water availability,
    soil moisture or urban expansion. These models can be updated in real time using
    the latest available datasets and provide insight into dynamic changes like flooding,
    wildfires, or landslides as they develop. The daily generation rate for selected
    satellite and weather/climate data sets is summarized in Fig. 1. More than 700
    Landsat 8 [5] tiles are acquired daily in addition to 400 Landsat 7 tiles; this
    generates in excess of 1 Terabyte of geospatial data per day. Similarly, Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) [6] instrument data generation rate
    approaches 1 Terabyte/day, acquiring data in 250 spectral bands. Based on this
    data, new data products are being derived to analyze earth''s land, ocean, and
    atmosphere generating even more data. By far the largest geospatial data volume
    is generated by numerical weather and climate forecasting such as Global Forecast
    System (GFS), Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), Climate Forecast System
    (CFS) in the US [7], and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
    (ECMWF) model. Weather and climate models generated by ECMWF are in excess of
    12 Terabyte/day [8]. If weather and satellite data are to be analyzed and integrated
    into models before the forecasted data becomes obsolete, then data processing
    should be accelerated through parallelization. One way to achieve this would be
    to have all data layers curated and homogenized before being uploaded to the platform,
    eliminating the time required for data preprocessing. The data curation require
    data validation, verification, and alignments spatially and temporarily, such
    that these layers are ready to be integrated into physical and statistical models
    without the need for data download, validation, and preprocessing. Figure 1: Geo-spatial
    data generation rate for weather and satellite data. except for the european centre
    for medium-range weather forecasts (ecmwf), data are published at rates of ~1
    terabyte per day - independent of the spatial resolution of the raster data. Show
    All Satellite and weather have well-defined data format and associated metadata,
    requiring less custom effort for processing. A more challenging task is unstructured
    data processing. In the unstructured data category falls data coming from mobile
    devices, social networks, edge devices, or sensor networks that are less likely
    to have similar format or accuracy than the structured data. There are more than
    300, 000 Tweets every minutes with an average Tweet carrying information of the
    order of 200 bytes. These datasets have an associated time stamp and can be (loosely)
    located geographically; however alignment with existing data layer require customization
    on top of automating data ingestion to correctly localize the information. These
    unstructured datasets can enhance existing structured data layers (satellite,
    weather, etc) by offering contextual information regarding extreme events like
    flooding, wildfire, or other calamities much faster than any traditional data
    sources. Seamless integration of such information with established geospatial
    data layers (topography, road network, population density, etc.) requires the
    development of tools that can integrate data on the fly, index it [9], [10], store
    it [4], and retrieve it on demand [12]–[13]. Using traditional database technologies
    to store geospatial data, have limited utility once the data volume exceeds a
    few Terabytes. Such data bases are also not well suited to handle geo-spatial
    data layers, as efficient indexing and joining, data layers have limited support.
    Here we present a new geospatial big data platform, Physical Analytics Integrated
    Repository and Services (PAIRS), to process Petabytes of data and address the
    spatial and temporal complexity associated with heterogeneous data integration
    (Fig. 2). Historical and real time geospatial data sets are automatically downloaded,
    curated and stored in HBase table, which are then available for real time modeling
    and analytics. Data curation encompasses; conversion to a common datum, and aligned
    on a well-defined spatial grid. The platform can be queried to retrieve data in
    multiple ways, like: (1) single point across large interval to create time series,
    (2) spatial query across an arbitrary sized area, and (3) filtered spatial and
    temporal query using a system of filters to retrieve subset of data from each
    layer. Figure 2: Pairs architecture as a cloud service where a query retrieves
    (1) metadata from a traditional relational database (postgresql) and (2) pulls
    geospatial data from hbase. Show All Figure 3: A detailed view of pairs''s data
    integration engine from fig. 2: geospatial data are automatically downloaded and
    processed. A multi-threaded process writes the data to hbase on top of hadoop''s
    hdfs. Data validation and verification for accuracy is automated to ensure that
    the best possible data layers are uploaded into pairs. Show All PAIRS offers access
    to a repository of consistent historical and real time datasets that are aligned
    and indexed. It is developed on top of the open source big data technologies Hadoop
    and HBase [14]. It leverages MapReduce [15] to accelerate data queries by parallelizing
    search and data retrieval. One key differentiator of PAIRS is the multi-layer
    query capability, ability to search multiple data layers and filter then based
    on multiple search criteria where filters allows discovering locations or time
    periods that share the same characteristics in space and time. This capability
    provides a quick way to visualize in real time changes for a certain location
    and detect similarities or differences. In addition to existing data layers, any
    custom modeling or analytics layer can be uploaded into PAIRS. SECTION II. Geospatial
    Data Management Due to the complexity to describe earth surface and preserve accuracy
    on local scale, almost all geospatial data layer are provided in different projections,
    which makes data joining and alignment the most time consuming task of any geospatial
    effort. PAIRS integrates open source tools (GDAL, PROJ.4, etc.) to convert data
    layer projection to WGS84 coordinate system and facilitate map re-projections
    and data managements on the fly. These tools can operate on large datasets and
    they scale with data volume if they are parallelized. The WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) coordinate
    system is used for all data layers. Independent of the original formats, the platform
    converts all data layers to WGS 84, that is, it interpolates and re-grids the
    data before it is integrated into HBase storage (Fig. 3). The main building block
    of PAIRS is the Data Integration Engine that handle data download, re-projection,
    and data indexing (Fig. 3). Any geospatial data format (raster, vector or geo-located
    images and text) can be integrated into the platform. If a data format is not
    raster, then it will be rasterized and handled as a large matrix. All data layers
    in PAIRS are aligned and snapped on a common grid, generated by continuously subdividing
    the global coordinate space [−180°, 180°] x [−90°, 90°] in terms of longitude
    and latitude (Fig. 4). The spatial resolution of PAIRS ranges from cm to hundreds
    of kilometers, with the smallest grid spacing of 0.000008° that corresponds to
    0.8 m on the longitude. There are 26 grid layers with increasing lateral resolution
    (see Table 1). Figure 4: Global indexing of data in PAIRS: recursive quad-tree
    scheme to partition two-dimensional data. Show All In order to adapt each datasets
    to PAIRS''s resolution, the original data layers are interpolated, followed by
    rasterizing the data layer to the closest PAIRS grid cell size. The interpolation
    is chosen to preserve, as best as possible, data accuracy and distinctive features
    like shorelines, water bodies, road alignments, etc. SECTION III. Data Indexing
    and Representation in Hbase Each data point for any data layer is indexed before
    is uploaded to the HBase table. The index includes a spatial location (longitude
    and latitude φ ) and a timestamp t. Fig. 4 provides details about the indexing
    scheme implemented in PAIRS. The generation of the grid follows the well-known
    recursive procedure of a quad-tree, where the global map gets subdivided into
    4 equally-sized cells labeled by the bits 00, 01, 10, 11. This process is repeated
    and the corresponding bits are appended to the right of their “mother” cell. The
    resulting bit sequence is interpreted as the binary representation of the z-index.
    Linking these indices with respect to increasing value on the two-dimensional
    map generates the Morton curve [9]. It targets at approximately preserving the
    “locality” property, i.e. nearby two-dimensional raster pixels stay close to each
    other when arranged on a line [10]. This property becomes important when designing
    HBase''s row key which is stored in alphabetical order. Using m as the number
    of recursions, the map can be divided into 4m grid cells which implicitly sets
    the spatial resolution in degrees to Δφ= 90 o / 2 m . In order to avoid rounding
    errors due to limited numerical precision, the resolution layer index n is introduced
    such that the resolution becomes Δφ= 2 n+2 ⋅ 10 −6 (see Table 1). Note that the
    resolution in km is consistent along the longitude, but does change along the
    latitude, with larger values expected near the equator and smaller values near
    the poles. The transformation from the pair (longitude, latitude) = (x, y) that
    matches the lower left corner of the grid cell to its z-index provides the first
    part of the row key k for the HBase table that stores all geo-spatial information.
    Since PAIRS stores datasets that have an associated time stamp, each index will
    have a temporal component defined as t in seconds, i.e. k=(z,t) . This scheme
    is similar to the approach of MD-HBase [16] which demonstrates a use case of geographically
    tracking moving objects in real time. In particular the focus is on efficiently
    scanning sparse data. However, the PAIRS system independently treats the time
    direction from the z-ordering - geographic raster layer pixels are static. Fox
    [17] presents another index structure to encode (geo-) spatial-temporal information
    into the key of the key-value store Accumulo [18], an Apache project. Due to HBase''s
    row key ordering [14] all timestamps t 0 ,tι, t 2 ,… of any geo-information data
    in PAIRS at fixed spatial position zo gets grouped together. HBase SCANs therefore
    quickly deliver time series of geo-information [14]. PAIRS performance is tuned
    to retrieve local information across large time interval. We note that in the
    conventional framework, time series retrieval from large geospatial data is constrained
    as large number of files need to be opened, scanned, localizing data points of
    interest for each data point. Table I. Global grid spatial resolution in degree
    for longitude (θ) and latitude ((φ) and the corresponding resolution in km at
    the equator and at 40 degrees latitude, respectively Each data pixel referenced
    by k is stored in the corresponding HBase cell that is uniquely identified by
    (k,c) , where c represents the information based on HBase''s column family and
    column qualifier [5], [6]. Aggregating geospatial pixels into a larger block to
    store them into a single HBase cell has two advantages: (1) balancing the query
    speed of fixed geo-spatial information for multiple timestamps and (2) balancing
    a geo-spatial region at a given time. In current implementation, 32×32 pixels
    are stored per HBase cell. To each block of geo-spatial pixels, a key is assigned,
    which is the same key of the contained pixels with the 10 least significant bits
    dropped. To each pixel, a unique key is assigned inside the 1024 array, calculated
    using only the 10 least significant bits, and stored into the HBase table as binary
    data. Each HBase table has multiple columns where each individual column stores
    a specific data parameter. For example, weather data like North American Mesoscale
    models (NAM), multiple columns are defined, where each column is assigned to a
    physical quantities like temperature, precipitation, ground pressure, etc. Since
    MapReduce can execute jobs directly on HBase tables, analytics run on PAIRS can
    be parallelized. In addition, the simple fact that any HBase cell is stored if
    and only if the corresponding row key is written (HBase command PUT), PAIRS handles
    very efficiently sparse geospatial information. SECTION IV. Data Processing The
    current datasets available in PAIRS are listed in Table 2 and could be grouped
    in four large categories: satellite, weather, survey, and analytics. Each category
    contains several datasets: Table 2. Current data layers in PAIRS that are updated
    continuously and two real time analytics, weather forecasting based on machine
    learning and irrigation forecasting for crops satellite images: Landsat [5], MODIS
    [6]. weather products: Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes
    Model (PRISM) [19], North American Mesoscale (NAM), California Irrigation Management
    Information System (CIMIS), Global Forecasting System (GFS) survey data: elevation
    (NEM) [20], land use (CROPSCAPE) [21], Soil (gSSurgo) layers that are part of
    the analytics services: blended weather forecast and evapo-transpiration/irrigation
    forecasting Data curation encompasses calculation of value, adding data layers
    such as elevation derived product, like slope and aspect ratio, as well as correcting
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for atmospheric effects. In addition,
    each data layer is periodically verified for accuracy and consistency. Due to
    the difference in data acquisition rate (cf. Fig. 3) as well as different repositories
    used for storing original data layers, PAIRS data agents are querying each repository
    to retrieve the specific data layers. Besides data download, PAIRS scans its HBase
    key-value store to identify missing timestamps. An automatic request is submitted
    to retrieve missing data layers. A special case are data layers that have partial
    spatial coverage and are acquired at different moment in time, e.g. Landsat with
    a 16 days visitation time where images are acquired as 185 km by 180 km tiles
    along a swath of the Earth''s surface. Data validation requires to verify if all
    the tiles at a given timestamp are present in the HBase table. The HBase table
    is scanned for a representative data point that defines the longitude and latitude
    of the center of that tile. In case a tile is missing, a data request is submitted
    to obtain the data. If the data is available on the host server, the data integration
    engine seamlessly connects the tile into the existing data fabric. Figure 5: Pairs
    multi-layer query that extracts farms in mississippi growing corn and having ndvi
    larger than 0.5, where average weekly rain in september 2015 was larger than 10
    mm. Show All SECTION V. Spatial-Temporal & Multi-Layers Queries The simplest query
    that can be submitted to PAIRS is a time series query for a single data point
    defined by longitude and latitude where all existing data points acquired can
    be retrieved. A query for a single point, from a data layer, acquired daily for
    a 10 year period, can be retrieved in less than 1 second. PAIRS supports range
    queries based on polygons for a given time interval. The PAIRS query API, implemented
    as a RESTful web service, automatically grabs the data acquired within the specified
    time interval and returns multiple georeferenced images tagged with the data acquisition
    timestamp. A third type of query implemented in PAIRS is multilayer queries where
    multiple layers can be queried and filtered based on specific parameters from
    one or multiple data layers. For example, one such complex query can be used to
    retrieve all farms that plant corn, whose mean precipitation across a week was
    larger than 10 mm, and where corn has NDVI values above 0.5. This query requires
    the platform to identify the geo-spatial locations where corn is planted, query
    the weather data layer and aggregate it for a week, filter all data layers based
    on the three conditions and return a data layer that fulfills all the above conditions.
    Fig. 5 illustrates an example of such a query. Note the visibility of the different
    resolutions of the Cropscape and NDVI layer that get joined for the result: While
    there exist isolated tiny spots of farms (cf. high resolution Cropscape layer),
    the interior of larger patches reveals the more coarse grained resolution of the
    NDVI layer. For this query, the recursive procedure that generates the z-ordered
    index from the HBase row key k=(z,t) comes in handy. Scanning the 30 m resolution
    dataset for a specific value (e.g. Cropscape data layer for corn) one can directly
    employ the matching keys to investigate a layer with less resolution, e.g. precipitation
    data from PRISM. The reason being that if Z a =< Z 1 Z 2 … z p > is the p bits
    of the index labeling a given grid cell, cells of a finer resolution within this
    cell get assigned a corresponding z-ordered index according to Zb=< Z 1 Z 2 …ZpZp+1Zp+2…Zp+q⋅>
    with p+q bits. So, knowing Zb from corn data directly provides Za for precipitation.
    PAIRS''s indexing and aligned data layers accelerate multi-layer queries. Figure
    6: Performance metrics for conventional data filtering on a single machine using
    gdal and python vs. querying data from pairs: a) data retrieval and b) data retrieval
    including filtering. Show All As pointed out in section III, PAIRS''s indexing
    scheme builds on geo-spatial coordinates of the raster as well as temporal information.
    Therefore PAIRS exploits the HBase key design to perform range-queries over multiple
    timestamps. In a conventional scenario the user needs to deal with a collection
    of individual files representing a certain geospatial area over a certain time
    period. Fig. 6 shows (solid dots) the corresponding processing speed on a set
    of files using conventional tools on a single machine. The query time scales proportionally
    to the amount of processed data, i.e. the data retrieval speed is constant. In
    detail, the data is loaded from hard disk into memory. Then each pixel gets filtered
    by the condition: “value of the pixel is equal to a constant”. For this task,
    the data need to be unzipped, re-projected and filtered - common steps that a
    geospatial data user will undertake if he processes the data. PAIRS''s querying
    speed (open & solid boxes) is faster in absolute value than conventional method,
    the benchmarking demonstrates increasing speed with increasing size of retrieved
    data - the hallmark of increased parallel processing due to the distribution of
    the data in the PAIRS cluster. Note, the major fraction of time in the conventional
    case is spent to unzip and re-project the data. PAIRS incorporates data compression
    and layer alignment by default. Besides MD-HBase and an Accumulo based system
    there are multiple approaches to use open source software technologies in order
    to handle scalable solutions for big (geo)-spatial raster and/or vector data.
    To name a few, e.g. Hadoop-GIS [22] implements operations such as SQL-type JOINs
    on vector data (OpenStreetMap [23]) employing Apache Hadoop. Building on Hadoop
    as well, SpatialHadoop [12] and its related implementations, SHAHED [24], TAREEG
    [25] & TAGHREED [25], query and visualize raster, vector and text data, respectively.
    An alternative geospatial big data platforms, ADAM [4] employs Apache Spark [32]
    to compete with traditional parallel image processing systems (cf. analytics on
    geo-spatial raster data) for astronomy. Yet another recent project, SpatialSpark
    [33] uses the Apache Spark technology to implement join operation on geo-spatial
    vector data. PAIRS particularly focuses on providing a whole, business-focused
    database and insight service to help to manage real-world geospatial data from
    multiple sources in a scalable manner on distributed compute resources. Figure
    7: Global horizontal solar irradiance (ghi) forecast error dependence on forecasted
    ground level pressure and solar zenith angle. Show All SECTION VI. Analytics A.
    Weather Modeling/machine Learning PAIRS curates historical weather forecasts and
    thus provides new opportunities to enhance forecasting accuracy through advanced
    statistical learning techniques. Current weather forecasting models that either
    use statistical correction or combine forecasts from different numerical weather
    models (Dynamic Integrated Forecast systems [29] or the Model Output Statistics
    systems [30]) have the limitation that only a restricted amount of forecast data
    is preserved and those will have either a short span of few days or are not updated
    with new forecasts. In general the forecast data are not saved for further analysis
    or model refinement. In contrast, PAIRS enables on-demand rapid retrieval of historical
    forecasts and associated measurements (from weather stations that provide real
    time data) going back historically for a few years. Such capability enables systematic
    characterization of forecast error of weather models and the dependence of the
    error on other forecasted weather parameters. This analysis can be carried out
    across global sites to understand the performance of various weather models used
    for forecasting. As an illustrative example, Fig. 6 demonstrates one case of how
    global horizontal solar irradiance (GHI) forecast error is dependent upon its
    forecast of ground level pressure and solar zenith angle. Figure 8: Global horizontal
    irradiance (color scale) forecast for 48 h in advance obtained via machine-learning
    based situation-dependent blending of the north american mesoscale model and the
    short range ensemble forecast model. Show All The GHI forecast is part of the
    of the widely-used North America Mesoscale (NAM) weather model that is frequently
    used in USA for business support including aviation safety etc. The result is
    obtained using Functional Analysis of Variance (FANOVA) for a Surface Radiation
    (Surfrad) Measurement station (BND station at Champaign, IL) averaged for period
    2014-1-1 to 2014-12-28 as are discussed in [31]. Such analysis identifies the
    different “weather situations” (unique to specific locations) in which the forecast
    error of the NAM model is dependent on different physical parameters that are
    specific to geographical locations. For instance, the two parameters (ground pressure
    and zenith angle) apparently create four different weather situations pertaining
    to the GHI forecast error as indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 7. In each
    of the dominant “weather situation”, the forecast can be corrected based on individual
    weather model or combining different weather models using statistical learning
    methods to improve overall forecasting accuracy [13]. As an example, Fig. 8 shows
    a 48 hour ahead forecast of global horizontal solar irradiance (GHI) of contiguous
    US (CONUS) obtained via situation-dependent blending of forecasts from two weather
    models-the NAM model and the short range ensemble forecast (SREF) model. This
    forecast is issued at 2015-06-11 00:00 UTC for 2015-06-13 00:00 UTC. The model
    blending is trained by historical forecasts and measurements at ~1640 remote automatic
    weather stations (RAWs) of the MesoWest network (yellow circles). The historical
    forecasts and measurements of GHI and other meteorological parameter such as ground
    pressure and solar zenith angle for 60 days immediately before the forecast issuance
    time at ~ 1640 remote automatic weather stations (RAWs) (yellow circle in Fig.
    8) are used as training data. For an arbitrary location in CONUS, its situation-dependent
    model blending is determined using training data from ~10 to 15 neighboring RAWs
    sites. The method enables 30% improvement of GHI forecast accuracy, measured in
    terms of mean absolute error, compared to the two individual input weather models
    (NAM and SREF). Figure 9: Spatial reference evapo-transpiration calculated from
    numerical weather model for current and day ahead on 09/01/2015. Show All B. Evapo-Transpiration/irrigation
    Forecasting Energy balance models can quantify the amount of water required by
    plants [32]. The evapo-transpiration is calculated as the difference between the
    input radiation from the sun and heat absorbed by soil and heat transfer from
    plant to air. These energy balance models can accurately calculate the right amount
    of irrigation that needs to be delivered to a plant in order to maintain the optimum
    amount of water in the crop [33]. The energy balance method developed at the spatial
    resolution of Landsat [34] combines (1) crop vegetation information from Landsat
    data and (2) satellite based soil temperature information, and (3) weather data
    integrated into reference evapo-transpiration using Penman-Monteith equation.
    The energy balance method was demonstrated to give a very accurate assessment
    of water amount required for irrigation based only on Landsat data and weather
    data modeling [34]. One application of high resolution irrigation scheduling is
    in variable rate irrigation that can be implemented with central pivots or drip
    irrigation system. It was demonstrated that variable rate irrigation can save
    water while at the same time increase yield while maintain crop quality [35].
    The advantage of satellite based evapotranspiration calculation is that it can
    be scaled and translated to other geographies to provide consistent irrigation
    recommendations for all crop. The irrigation forecasting is based on weather forecast
    for 10 days in advance. For evapo-transpiration, temperature, wind speed, solar
    radiation and relative humidity from NAM and GFS models are integrated with the
    Penman-Monteith [35] equation. In Fig. 9 the current and day ahead evapotranspiration
    based on the NAM models is shown for the state of Mississippi calculated at a
    spatial resolution of 4 km. The irrigation schedule can leverage additional data
    layers like precipitation that would enable to correct irrigation schedules by
    subtracting the from the irrigation recommendation. These corrections in irrigation
    schedule are very beneficial during extreme weather events or rainy seasons for
    better water management and optimum water allocations. SECTION VII. Conclusions
    Real time geospatial analytics requires large volume of geospatial data to be
    analyzed and processed. This requires a scalable platforms where data layers can
    be seamlessly incorporated into models. In this paper we presented the PAIRS platform,
    which is designed to accelerate analytics and provide access to curated datasets.
    PAIRS minimizes the “time to value” by providing curated data sets and eliminating
    data processing steps that normally should be run on data layers. Two analytics
    models are running on top of curated data sets: (1) improved and hyper localized
    weather forecast model based on machine learning, and (2) evapo-transpiration/irrigation
    forecasting. As more data layers are integrated in PAIRS, they will enrich existing
    data layers, and will enable more complex analytics to be run on top of the data.

    tendencies, how to process the enormous amount of data, big data, and how to deal
    with the green issues related to sustainability and environmental concerns. An
    interesting question is whether there are inherent correlations between the two
    tendencies in general. To answer this question, this paper firstly makes a comprehensive
    literature survey on how to green big data systems in terms of the whole life
    cycle of big data processing, and then this paper studies the relevance between
    big data and green metrics and proposes two new metrics, effective energy efficiency
    and effective resource efficiency in order to bring new views and potentials of
    green metrics for the future times of big data. Published in: IEEE Systems Journal

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The past 20 years, data have been rapidly
    growing elements of our lives, especially due to the increasing popularity of
    Internet and relevant applications. More and more data are being produced and
    analyzed, leading to a new big data era. The characteristics of big data have
    been discussed for over 15 years since 2011. The first characterization of big
    data, proposed by D. Laney, META Group, in 2001 [1], includes volume, velocity,
    and variety, which have been mostly acceptable. The characterization of big data
    with 5 Vs, i.e., volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value, was discussed
    in 2011 [2]. The characterization of big data with 6 Vs, i.e., volume, variety,
    velocity, veracity, visualization, and value, was introduced in 2012 [3]. Recently
    even more 8 Vs, i.e., volume, variety, velocity, value, veracity, variability,
    viscosity, and virality, have been further proposed in 2014 [4]. However, whatever
    the aforementioned characterizations are, not all types of big data are with all
    the features for anyone of aforementioned characterizations. Nowadays, there are
    tremendous demands on the green issues and environmental concerns to information
    and communication technologies (ICT) [5] . This paper would like to explore the
    correlation between the trend of big data era and that of green revolution via
    investigating how to green big data systems. In this paper, our main contributions
    are listed as follows. In Section II, we summarize basic features of big data
    and relevant systems with extensive discussions. In Section III, we clarify the
    green issues through historical reviews, and show our definition of green concept,
    and start some initial discussions on the relation between big data and green
    issues. Section IV presents an introduction of greening big data as the prediscussions
    to the extensive survey on how to green big data in terms of the whole life cycle
    of big data processing in Section V–VII . In Section VIII, we study the relevance
    between big data and green metrics and propose two new metrics, effective energy
    efficiency (EEE) and effective resource efficiency (ERE), which may bring new
    viewpoints and potentials of green metrics for the future investigations of big
    data. Section IX outlines several future promising research challenges to promote
    the greenness of big data, from data acquisition, storage and processing, respectively.
    SECTION II. Big Data Big data refer to not only the realization of information
    explosion but also technologies, which ensure values generated from the massive
    of data. Big data have been defined as a broad term for huge or complex datasets
    that conventional data processing applications are insufficient [6]. In [7], big
    data were defined in volume as the science in the petabyte era. Further, big data
    were also defined based on not only high volumes, but also wide varieties and
    the requirements of high velocity capture, discovery, and analysis [8]. The markets
    for big data involve three layers: the infrastructure layer (hardware components),
    the data organization, analytics, and management layer (software components),
    and the services layer (big data applications). The infrastructure layer, mainly
    including external storage systems, servers, datacenter networking infrastructure
    and cloud infrastructure, is the foundation of the big data technologies. The
    data organization, analytics, and management layer, typically implemented as software,
    is in charge of storing, processing, and analyzing various structured and unstructured
    data, which could be in offline, real time, or both. The services layer stands
    for the big data relevant external interfaces and applications, such as business
    consulting, project services, integration services, data storage services, security
    supports, and technical trainings. An overview of the three layers for big data
    is illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Three-layer big data. Show All SECTION III.
    Green Issues A. Origin and our Definition of Green Issues This section investigates
    what are green issues. In many recent literatures, people have addressed green
    issues simply as the synonyms of either energy efficiency (EE) and/or energy consumption
    reductions. However, those understandings are incorrect, even if energy relevant
    issues are recently dominant aspects in the green fields. To understand the relevant
    concepts, we would explore the relevant history of the term “green,” which actually
    was dated back from the origin of the concept “green revolution.” In a narrow
    sense, the green revolution refers to a series of research, development, and technology
    initiatives to increase agriculture (in more narrower sense, rice, wheat, and
    maize) production, particularly in the developing countries, most notably in the
    late 1960s. Both the start time of the green revolution, more accurately, the
    first generation green revolution, have not been uniquely recognized. Many literatures
    thought that the start time of the green revolution was dated back to the year
    of 1943 when, in Mexico [9], Rockefeller Foundation started to sponsor a wheat
    and maize improvement program led by N. Borlaug, called “Father of the Green Revolution,”
    who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his significant contributions to support
    achieving food self-sufficiency and save around a billion people from hunger and
    famine via highly efficient high-yielding varieties of cereal grains and other
    agriculture techniques, such as irrigation increases, synthetic fertilizers, and
    pesticides [10]. Some other literatures thought that the start time of the green
    revolution was around 1930s due to the pioneer works on high-yielding varieties
    of the agrarian geneticist N. Strampelli, while some literatures treated N. Strampelli
    as the forerunner or precursor of the green revolution [11]. We remark that the
    definitions of second generation green revolution have also not been unique, including
    nonenergy relevant definitions, such as [12], and energy relevant definitions,
    such as [13]. There are two different opinions on when and who created the term
    “Green Revolution.” Many people thought based on [14] that the term “Green Revolution”
    were created in 1968 by the former director of United States Agency for International
    Development (USAID), W. Gaud, who stated that “These and other developments in
    the field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution. It is not a
    violent Red Revolution like that of the Soviets, nor is it a White Revolution
    like that of the Shah of Iran. I call it the Green Revolution.” However, some
    evidences have shown that the term of “Green Revolution” had appeared before 1968.
    In 1967 [15], W. O. Reichert has recognized the Green Revolution advocated by
    M. Loomis with the nonviolent and unpolitical feature. In 1962 [16], M. J. Loomis,
    respected as “the Grandmother of the Counter Culture,” addressed the relationship
    between the impact of R. Borsodi and a number of constructive trends on socio-philosophical
    thinking, where M. J. Loomis have recognized that R. Borsodi published his opinions
    about supporting peace via home- and small-scale production on the term of “Green
    Revolution” [17] on July 28, 1943. In [16], M. J. Loomis explained “Green Revolution”
    relevant to the “conservation and improved methods of tilling the soil, the use
    of whole, undevitalized food, good nutrition, and in many cases, simpler diet
    and simple living.” From the aforementioned discussions, the original meanings
    of the term “green” are not about energy issues but more relevant to food sustainability
    as well as the peace of human society opposite to violent wars. In general, green
    issues have not been uniquely defined, but it is not correct to simply treat green
    issues as either EE or energy consumption reductions. We would like to state our
    definition of green issues that green issues refer to those making the world and
    the components both sustainable and friendly in an environmental, economical,
    social, and/or technical sense, or in an equation format as Green = Environmentally/Economically/Socially/Technically
    Sustainable+Environmentally /Economically/Socially/Technically View Source Friendly,
    which stresses not only sustainability objectives but also friendly characteristics
    to environments and human societies. We have presented the aforementioned definition
    of green issues in a number of public presentations since 2011, but it is the
    first time for us to formally publish this definition. We would have more discussions
    on the concept of sustainability on [18]. B. Green Issues in the Big Data Era
    Big data may require a large scale of data centers with huge computing power and
    resources. The increase of energy consumption and other resources would result
    in increased greenhouse emissions and impacts on environments. More specifically,
    big data generation from sensors, video cameras, and other available data sources
    greatly stress the existing data generation devices. Big data acquisitions bring
    a lot of energy consumptions for data collections as well for data transmissions
    in networks. Next, conventional database software cannot properly handle the storage
    of various kinds of big data. More storage capacity is designed for big data storage,
    leading to advanced technology and distributed devices with energy and resource
    inefficiency. Finally, big data analytics brings the challenges of large-scale
    data analytics. Parallel or distributed frameworks and architectures are required
    for big data, which give rise to more consumptions of energy and other resources.
    Nowadays, computationally intensive big data analytics and processing may consume
    a lot of energy and pollute the environment. Considering the aforementioned concerns,
    it is really necessary to establish green initiatives for big data life cycle
    to reduce energy and resource consumptions, to reduce greenhouse gases emission
    and long-lasting harmful effects on our environments. Fortunately, big data may
    be huge threatens to not only environmental changes but also enormous opportunities
    for making environmental improvements. Large scale datasets and analytics increasingly
    are being used by government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and private
    firms to forward environmental protections. For instance, companies like Virginia-based
    OPower used big data to allow homeowners to measure their consumption against
    their neighbors. Cities are optimizing the timing of traffic signals to reduce
    congestions; airports are communicating with planes to increase the efficiency
    of waiting ground crews; and building managers are using data analysis to cut
    energy uses by 10–20 % . Improving ecologically oriented efficiency, promoting
    environmental justices, and tracking climate changes are environmental improvements
    by the use of big data. Greening big data is an important part of green ICT, which
    includes green computing [19] and green communications [5], which are two highly
    overlapped terms. Green computing [19] mainly address investigations and practices
    of efficient and ecofriendly computing, including designs, productions, uses,
    and disposals of computers, associated subsystems, and networking devices efficiently
    and effectively with minimal or without negative impact on the environments. Green
    communications cover all environmentally relevant issues to communications systems
    and relevant applications. Product longevity refers to the whole life of a product
    from the design stage to the end-of-life stage. It is highly expected to have
    longer product life to reduce necessary product disposals in a certain period,
    since these may save natural resources already very limited and fast depleted,
    and more and more product disposals have created more and more wastes, including
    e-wastes, which may be discarded into land soils and ground waters and include
    harmful materials such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and chromium. SECTION IV. Introduction
    for Greening Big Data As initially mentioned in Section III, there are some relation
    clues between big data systems and green issues. In0 Section V–VII, we try to
    have some extensive investigations in green issues within big data systems. It
    is hard to process various big data via traditional database management systems.
    So far, the main IT (information technology) infrastructure for dealing with big
    data is datacenters. The well-known software frameworks for processing big data
    are Hadoop MapReduce [20], Google Mapreduce [21], and Amazon Elastic MapReduce
    [22] . The server clusters running these frameworks in a datacenter will consume
    a lot of energies. It has been reported [23], [24] that, in a datacenter, the
    power consumption of severs for data processing is about 45% of energy, and the
    heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) may consume about 30% of energy.
    With the rapid growth of big data services and applications, datacenter consume
    more and more energy [25], greening datacenters becomes important and challenge
    research issue. Although the energy consumption of big data processing is not
    easily reduced in a datacenter, through the proper arrangements, it is possible
    to save energy consumption of the HVAC part. The efficient HAVC is helpful in
    cooling down the datacenters, and improving the big data services. Actually, besides
    the high energy and resource consumptions during the data processing stage, a
    lot of energies and resources are also consumed in both the data generation, acquisition,
    communication, and storage stages. As shown in Fig. 2, large volume of data, in
    size of petabytes or even zettabytes, are continuously generated from a variety
    of domains, such as industry, agriculture, home appliance, stock market, social
    network, and so on. Especially, it is inevitable that a large number of Internet
    of things (IoT) devices will be connected in order to accelerate the convergence
    of cyber and physical world. Former Cisco CEO J. Chambers predicted that there
    will be 500 billion connected devices by 2025. These devices may even become dominant
    data sources in the future big data. Many geodistributed datacenters from large
    entrepreneurs such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have already deployed worldwide.
    Besides, many companies also established their own private clouds, as complementary
    to public clouds, to deal with their personal data. Nevertheless, the collected
    data shall be efficiently acquired, transmitted and stored in these datacenters
    for further processing or analytics. Each stage in the data life cycle consumes
    ineligible amount of energy and resource with the consideration of high-volume
    big data. As a result, significant efforts shall be contributed to the data acquisition,
    communication, and even storage from the aspects of greenness. This has already
    raised wide concern in the research community and lots of methods toward greening
    big data have already been available in the literature. In Section V–VII, we summarize
    and discuss greening big data on different stages, including big data acquisition,
    big data storage, and big data analytics, during the whole life cycle. An overview
    of our discussions in this paper is summarized in Fig. 3. Fig. 2. Big data scenario.
    Show All Fig. 3. Greening big data. Show All SECTION V. Greening Big Data Generation,
    Acquisition, and Communications This section would like to the issues on generation,
    acquisition, and communications of big data, which all are relevant to a general
    sustainability issue on how to deal with high volume of big data. One direction
    on handling high volumes is big data reduction, for which there are two large
    categories of solutions. Lossy Reduction Reduce or discard unimportant or useless
    data: As a recent progress, recent investigations by Ready Labs, Inc., and Simon
    Fraser University have showed Adblock Plus, a popular, open source, ad-blocking
    Internet browser extension, may significantly reduce network data demands where
    25.0% reduction in bytes downloaded and 40.0% when video traffic considered in
    isolation are achieved [26]. Lossy compression: This could be supported by many
    source coding algorithms [27] and other signal processing methods such as compressive
    sensing. Lossless Reduction Lossless compression [27]: Lossless compression typically
    is used for the individual information or files in an organization. Deduplication
    [28]: Data deduplication, a specialized compression, performs across all the storage
    system to discover and remove duplicate data and an index maintains tracking exactly
    the removal so that the information can be re-accessed when necessary. Similarity-based
    compression methods: As the relevant theoretical studies to similarity-based compression,
    [29] defined the compression-based dissimilarity measure (CDM) as CDM(x,y)= C(xy)
    C(x)+C(y) (1) View Source where x and y stands for two strings, C(x) is defined
    as the size of the compressed x for a given compression, and C(xy) is the size
    of the compressed string for y concatenated to x . Further, [30] introduced the
    concept normalized compression distance (NCD) for a distance metric between two
    strings, which is defined as NCD(x,y)= C(xy)−min(C(x),C(y)) max(C(x),C(y)) . (2)
    View Source Both NCD and CDM are based on the concept of Kolmogorov complexity
    [31]. Recently, a fast compression similarity measure, namely normalized dictionary
    distance, was proposed based on the idea of dictionary [32]. The fast compression
    distance (FCD) [33] has been proposed to reduce the high complexity of the previous
    methods, such as NCD. A new faster similarity measure, called weighted FCD, was
    most recently proposed in [34]. The aforementioned approaches could be also jointly
    used. Xia et al. [35] discussed a joint approach with both compression and deduplication.
    A. Big Data Generations Data generation is the first step of big data. According
    to [36], main sources of big data are enterprise data, IoT data, and biomedical
    data. Not all raw data generated are useful for extracting values, and excessive
    data generation will cause huge burden in energy and resource consumptions, thus
    it is necessary to achieve effective big data generations toward green objectives.
    1) Enterprise Data Recent study [37] has indicated the enterprise data in the
    world have been the main source of big data. The most known enterprises with huge
    data are Internet focused companies, such as Facebook, Google, and Tencent, which
    produce huge data together with huge relevant benefits every day. However, those
    excessive data generations require huge energy consumptions, which force the enterprises
    exploiting green initiatives to deal with big data generations. For example, the
    vast amounts of data being generated could be reused by devices themselves to
    maximize the EE. To be specific, enterprise servers that run on electricity could
    generate additional electrical information that could be analyzed to determine
    the power management mode. In the context of this, servers not only generate massive
    data but also may save energy based on these data. 2) IoT Data IoT [38] is an
    important source of big data. Most IoT data gathered by radio frequency identification
    (RFID) and sensor network technologies exist in many industries, such as agriculture,
    traffic, transportation, medical care, public departments, and families, and so
    on. In sensor networks, IoT devices may be embedded with sensors. From the perspective
    of green initiatives, an emerging category of edge devices (smart phones) are
    potentially utilized in data generation, since these devices can reduce the deployment
    of corresponding sensors, which is considered environmentally friendly. For example,
    [39] introduced mobile crowdsensing, where individuals with mobile devices collectively
    share data and extract information to benefit IoT applications. Utilizing mobile
    devices for sensing may greatly reduce the manufacture and deployment costs. RAMSES
    [40] considered using existing portable devices for IoT data generation in the
    hardware design of devices, and through implementing an RF energy-harvesting circuit
    to wirelessly deliver sensor data to standard RFID readers, the system consumes
    less energy in the process of data generation. 3) Biomedical Data Over the past
    several years, bioinformatics has become an all-inclusive term for everything
    relevant to both computer and biology sciences, so that biomedical areas may also
    bring huge data with the features of large volumes, complicated structures, high
    dimensionality, biological concepts involvements, and insufficient data modeling,
    which may be also supported by green initiatives in data reductions, scalability
    improvements, and energy consumption reductions. B. Big Data Acquisition With
    regard to networking in big data acquisition, a lot of works have focused on data
    aggregation and energy-efficient data acquisition techniques. Besides the general
    discussions in the start of this section, we have further discussions on this
    topic. From the perspective of software technologies, there are a lot of approaches
    in effective data collections. For example, [41] exploited data compression technology,
    which is capable of shrinking the volume of transmitted data, resulting in fewer
    energy consumptions. By defining a new transfer time t total = t total = t compression
    + t transfer + t decompression , the compression decision can be made via comparing
    the original transfer time t original . Compression will be applied if and only
    if t original > t total . Pioneering researchers have already proposed many different
    methods to reduce the data volumes so as to save unnecessary energy consumption.
    These methods can be generally categorized into lossy reduction, lossless reduction,
    and data aggregation. 1) Lossy Reduction For data acquisition in WSNs, Liu et
    al. [42] developed a generic framework on how to explore spatio-temporal correlation
    in wireless sensor network so as to achieve energy-efficient data collections,
    where the sensor nodes receive their local measures of interest, such as temperature
    and light intensity, to the sink node continuously. The data sequence obtained
    at each sensor node creates a time series. Two time series X{ x 1 , x 2 ,⋅⋅⋅,
    x q } and Y{ y 1 , y 2 ,⋅⋅⋅, y q } are assumed to be trend- t -dissimilarity if
    q 1 q <t (3) View Source where q is the total number of the pairs ( x i , y i
    ) for the time series and q 1 is the number of pairs that satisfy ∇ x i ×∇ y i
    ≥0,∇ x i = x i − x i−1 ,∇ y i = y i − y i−1 ,1≤i≤q−1 . According to the dissimilarity
    between the two time series, a clustering algorithm was proposed to achieve energy-efficient
    and continuous data collection. To achieve efficient data collection, [43] proposed
    a principle that limits the unnecessary collection of personal data to greatly
    reduce the relevant energy consumption. Once the purpose for which data are collected
    is known, collected data should be just efficient enough for that purpose. 2)
    Lossless Reduction Marcelloni et al. [44] exploited the high correlation between
    consecutive samples collected by a sensor and proposed an entropy compression-based
    data sampling. A recent study [45] propose MinDiff for Gaussian distributed data
    compression using a dictionary and local prediction method. 3) Data Aggregation
    Data aggregation explores in-network processing during the data routing and applies
    different data operations (e.g., maximum value, minimum value, and average value)
    to reduce the data volume, and hence, energy consumption. Note that there are
    some overlaps between the aggregation techniques and data compression techniques
    but basically they are different. The data aggregation scheme [46] applies compressed
    sensing for both recovery fidelity and EE in WSNs. The compressed sensing decoding
    process reconstructs the signal as μ ^ =Ψ ω ^ , where μ is an n -dimensional signal
    and ω is the optimal solution to the convex optimization problem. min w∈ R n  ∥ω
    ∥ l 1 (= ∑ i | w i |) subject to μ=ΦΨω. (4) View Source This novel aggregation
    scheme enables to investigate the minimum-energy compressed data aggregation.
    In [47], ergelt et al. proposed an aggregation strategy to efficiently use the
    energy and dealing with large data volumes. A recent survey on data compression
    algorithms for WSNs was reported in [48]. Interesting readers may also refer to
    [49] for distributed data aggregation algorithms. C. Big Data Communications Upon
    the completion of raw big data generation, data will be collected and transferred
    through wired or wireless networks for processing or storage. This phase also
    incurs unprecedented energy consumptions, quality of service issues, and other
    sustainability issues in big data era. This challenge also has already been widely
    addressed in the literature. 1) Network Topology In WSNs, numerous sensors can
    produce a significant volume of the data but also incur severe energy consumptions.
    How to optimize network structure as well as data routing for EE also plays an
    important role in greening big data. During the recent years, many energy-efficient
    routing protocols have been proposed for WSNs. For example, Takaishi et al. [50]
    utilized the mobility of the sink node to help the data collection for EE. 2)
    Routing Based on the maximization of network utility, [51] proposed a fully distributed
    asynchronous flow control algorithm in WSN. min ∑ s∈S U s ( x s ) s.t:  R ′′ x≤c
    (5) View Source where U s ( x s ) refers to the utility of flow s under transmission
    rate x s , R ′′ is the generalized routing matrix, and c is the link capacity
    matrix. Static routing cannot efficiently balance traffic for big-data applications,
    [52] tried to reduce each flow bandwidth via a distributed-adaptive-routing algorithm
    with minimal out-of-order packet delivery. Pantazis et al. [53] recently conducted
    a survey on energy-efficient routing protocols in WSNs. In [54], Bergler et al.
    presented an approach to reduce the energy costs for datacenters through selecting
    routing with the current cheapest energy costs. To more effectively and efficiently
    utilize multiple cores in routing the big data transfers, [55] proposed to parallelize
    data transfers via using each core in the routers to calculate a separate shortest
    path. 3) Network Infrastructure Besides efforts on existing IP networks, researchers
    also have investigated network infrastructure revolution for big data. Recent
    advances of software defined networking and optical switching technology make
    it possible to program the network stack all the way from physical topology to
    flow level traffic control. In [56], the EE of the networking components in cloud-based
    environments was provided. Ricciardi et al. [57] provided the modeling and the
    cross-layer optimization approach for the EE and energy-awareness Internet design.
    Wang et al. [58] combined a software-defined networks (SDNs) controller with optical
    switching to tightly integrate application and network control, which may greatly
    enhance application performance with small configuration overheads. Another work
    addressing SDN [59] tried to realize dynamic and highly efficient bulk data transfer
    via a geodistributed datacenter system and an SDN architecture, where data transfer
    demands were modeled as delay tolerant migration requests with different deadlines.
    To reach different levels of optimality and scalability in an online fashion,
    the authors discussed three algorithms for optimal schedules. In [60], the authors
    utilized the approach of information-centric networking (ICN), where name-based
    data retrieval and in-network caching are applied. In existing ICN, content centric
    network (CCN) is not able to efficiently utilize the caches for data sharing due
    to the use of on-path caching, and network of information (NetInf) shows the resolution
    latency to retrieve data. Li et al. [60] integrated the strengths of CCN and NetInf
    with the use of information islands and management plane for direct data retrieval
    and global data discovery, respectively, to facilitate big data sharing. An aggregatable
    name-based routing (ANBR) was proposed to naturally allow consumers to search
    the closest copy of information [60]. 4) Scheduling In [61], Ren et al. proposed
    a better communication scheduling strategy CLSA for smartphone downloading to
    achieve low energy consumption with tolerances of some transmission delays. Wang
    et al. [62] studied the multiple bulk data transfers scheduling problem for network
    congestion reduction, for which the authors proposed to lexicographically minimize
    the congestion among all links in datacenters. SECTION VI. Greening Big Data Storage
    This section discusses greening datacenters, cloud computing, and other data storage
    issues. A data center is a computing resource in which a facility is used to house
    computer systems and associated components. The architecture of datacenter can
    indirectly influence the consumption of energy. A good datacenter design requires
    less amount of energy consumption. According to the United States Department of
    Energy, energy-efficient datacenter designs may impact many technical areas, such
    as ICT systems, environmental conditions, air management, cooling systems, and
    electrical systems. Big data storage systems requires the consumptions of both
    energy and resources, thus green storage should have less energy consumptions,
    resource consumptions, or both. We now consider the following aspects for green
    big data storage. A. Cloud Storage and File System Cloud computing is a recent
    popular and powerful paradigm providing various collections of virtualized resources
    as services suitable for big data storage and processing. As big data applications
    proliferate, distributed file systems store the data in distributed large-scale
    nodes and devices. Although cloud computing may help achieve higher energy and
    resource efficiencies, a big challenge for cloud computing infrastructures is
    to operate together with the increasing costs for energies and resources. Nowadays,
    EE improvements are important targets toward green objectives for distributed
    file systems to store and manage big data. For example, Kaushik and Bhandarkar
    [63] proposed an energy-conserving logical multizoned variant of Hadoop distributed
    file system (HDFS) to manage data processing in Hadoop cluster. Idleness of servers
    may be enabled via data classification, which allowed to use aggressive inactive
    power modes in central processing unit, disks, and dynamic random access memory
    (DRAM). In addition, Lightning [64] is a self-adaptive Commodity Green Cloud Storage
    that dynamically configures the servers into hot and cold zones, where, similar
    to GreenHDFS [63], the servers in cold zone are transitioned to inactive power
    modes and the relevant energy saving significantly save the operating costs of
    the datacenter. Recently, Bostoen et al. [65] made a survey for the research efforts
    on power-aware enterprise storage systems over a decade. Negru et al. [66] reviewed
    the methods and technologies and presented some of the key research challenges
    for energy-aware datacenter operations for cloud storage. The authors mentioned
    that the profitability may not always be expressed with respect to revenue but
    in terms of bio and environment friendliness. B. Database To handle big data,
    large databases should be partitioned across different servers or nodes, which
    may overall consume huge energy consumptions. Mardamutu et al. [67] provided a
    comprehensive critical analysis on EE issues for green databases and proposed
    a redundancy-based solution. According to [68], the first step to achieve green
    databases is to understand the energy requirements of data warehouse to develop
    a relevant plan for EE. Then, it is necessary to optimize the server rooms and
    exploit virtualization to increase performance. Finally, authorities get the feedback
    via analyzing the developed system. Chaudhary et al. [68] studied the tradeoffs
    between the performance and the energy consumption characteristics of analytical
    queries based on various database cluster designs. Based on empirical experiment
    results, the authors proposed a model considering key bottlenecks of EE in a parallel
    database management system. Wu et al. [69] jointly considered hardware accelerator
    for range partitioning (HARP) and a streaming framework with a seamless execution
    environment for streaming accelerators, such as HARP, to provide an order of magnitude
    improvement in partitioning performance and energy for high-throughput, energy-efficient
    data partitioning and processing, which is critical in manipulating large datasets.
    C. Storage Mechanism In addition to green storage systems, there have been lot
    of efforts on green storage mechanisms. One direction is on intelligent storage
    resource management. A particular appeal is on the power-saving from the perspective
    of disks. However, it has been reported that, in a datacenter, the average idle
    period for a server disk is very small compared with the time for spinning down
    and up, which significantly constrains the performance of disk power management
    schemes [70]. Zhu et al. [70] proposed several power-aware storage cache management
    algorithms to improve energy savings for the disk power management schemes. Pinheiro
    et al. [71] introduced diverted accesses to leverage the redundancy in storage
    systems to save disk energy. Another effort [72] tried to enable the storage system
    to turn OFF a large fraction of disks without unacceptable performance degradation.
    For real-time and data-intensive applications, Liu et al. [73] proposed a novel
    distributed energy-efficient scheduler, consisting of three main components, i.e.,
    energy-aware ranking, performance-aware scheduling, and energy-aware dispatching,
    to achieve energy savings via seamlessly involving the process of scheduling tasks
    in data placement. Another direction is on data column reduction to save storage
    resources for energy saving. Lossless compression [27] and deduplication [28]
    are two kinds of lossless reduction. Compression typically is used for the individual
    files in a company. While, data deduplication, a specialized compression, execute
    across all the storage system to identify and remove duplicate data and an index
    maintains tracking exactly what has been removed so that the information can be
    put back when a user needs to access a file. Xia et al. [35] also discussed a
    joint approach with both compression and deduplication. SECTION VII. Greening
    Big Data Analytics Big data analytics may analyze huge volumes of data that conventional
    analytics and business intelligence solutions cannot handle. The process of data
    analytics are normally accompanied with lot of computing workloads, which may
    be time consuming and energy and resource inefficient. There have been many efforts
    addressing green issues in big data computing and processing. We now consider
    how to construct green big data analytics from green big data processing architecture
    and data analytics framework. A. Green Big Data Processing Architecture 1) Innovative
    Architecture Typically, big data are delivered to cloud for analysis, thus the
    EE of datacenter architectures should be considered. Unlike high performance computing
    systems, which generally focus on maximizing raw computing power, big data clusters
    are generally designed to maximize the EE to manage large datasets [74]. Gu et
    al. [75] investigated and compared the energy consumption and the execution time
    for a typical Hadoop-based big data application executed in a traditional Xeon-based
    cluster and an Atom-based (microserver) cluster. Liu et al. [76] presented the
    GreenCloud architecture to reduce datacenter power consumption without sacrificing
    the performance for users, which enables comprehensive online-monitoring, live
    virtual machine (VM) migration, and VM placement optimization. Convey [77], [78]
    was designed to excel at tackling the data-level parallelism with power efficiency.
    The new Convey architecture can exploit massive degrees of parallelism to enhance
    development productivity. Huawei [79] proposed a high throughput computing datacenter
    architecture with PB-level data processing capacity and high EE. In [80], Dben
    et al. provided a preliminary investigation on obtaining energy saving via injecting
    inexactness or approximation into the hardware architecture of a computing system.
    Big data processing naturally requires high parallelism for fast processing. In
    [81], Kanoun et al. proposed a novel low-power many-core architecture to support
    the dynamic data-driven nature of stream mining applications while limited power
    constraints. In [82] , a program optimization issue was studied to handle the
    challenges raised by big data, and the authors discussed using multi/many cores,
    wide single instruction multiple data and the role of dynamic optimization in
    the context of big data and cloud-based architectures. The inherent parallel ability
    of graphics processing unit (GPU) for big data also attracted much attention in
    the community. In [83], Wang et al. proposed the energy-efficient implementations
    of GPUs in both the training phase and the operation phase of neural networks
    for big data analytics. In [84], Park et al. presented a special function unit,
    called memory fast-forward (MFF) unit, to reduce a large number of memory requests
    for big data workloads in GPU. The two key functions of memory pointer chasing
    and memory request coalescing for the proposed MFF unit contribute to reducing
    memory stall time as well as enhancing the real utilization of memory bandwidth
    via removing duplicate memory traffics, thereby improving performance and EE.
    2) Server Management To lower the environmental impact and power consumption of
    datacenters, the authors in [85] proposed to comanage both supply and demand via
    profiling datacenter power consumption, which may be applicable for an enterprise
    datacenter. In [86] , the authors reported an integrated approach for the implementation
    of a Environment Compatible datacenter, ECCO, which is able to automatically and
    dynamically redefine the set of active resources in order to drastically lessen
    the energy consumptions without sacrificing the needs of users. In [87] , Schroder
    and Nebel presented an interesting load and power management method for the server
    allocation in datacenters. Mastelic et al. [88] provided an overview of the infrastructure
    of the cloud computing paradigm to improve EE. In [89], Lin et al. investigated
    how much can be saved through dynamically scheduling the datacenter for big data
    cloud services by turning OFF servers during some periods via an online algorithm.
    3) System Model In [90], a brief overview was provided on the benchmarks for datacenter
    EE, power and energy measurements, benchmarking, and analysis in big data processing.
    In [91], a brief review of measurements and performance evaluation in term of
    EE of datacenter for big data processing was provided. The energy effectiveness
    metric was given by [91] Energy Effectiveness= IT Equipment Power Consumption
    HVAC . View Source As HAVC, e.g., cooling, plays a critical role in energy effectiveness,
    many novel cooling methods have already been proposed. In [92], Wei and Ren introduced
    their green cloud computing proposal, environmentally opportunistic computing,
    where information technology resources were working together with existing facilities
    consuming dominate energy to dynamically adjust process throughput, thermal movement,
    and obtainable cooling. In [93], Ren intended to improve the datacenter water
    efficiency. Since datacenter water efficiency varies by location and also over
    time, the authors proposed a geographical load balancing (GLB) algorithm, called
    GLB for water sustainability (GLB-WS), which dynamically schedules workloads to
    improve the overall water usage effectiveness (an emerging metric for quantifying
    datacenter water efficiency) without violating the electricity cost constraint.
    Berral et al. [94] presented an energy-aware scheduling framework for datacenter
    using machine learning for big data processing. In [95], a green cloud computing
    modeling method was provided to build system software environments. In [96], Pelley
    proposed an analytic framework to model the total power consumption of datacenter.
    In [97], a set of formal models were provided to estimate sustainability impact
    and dependability metrics in datacenter infrastructures based on an integrated
    environment. 4) Renewable Energy Besides optimization on brown energy, green energy,
    a.k.a., renewable energy, also attracted much attention. Addis et al. [98] discussed
    the energy-aware joint management of brown and green energy for networks and cloud
    infrastructures. In [99], Liu et al. tried to achieve the reduction of electricity
    cost and environmental impact via a holistic approach to jointly consider renewable
    supply, dynamic pricing, and cooling supply with IT workload planning to enhance
    the overall sustainability of datacenter operations. In [100], Li et al. presented
    a power provisioning scheme called Oasis to scale power-/carbon- constrained datacenter
    servers to in a economical and green way. B. Green Big Data Processing Frameworks
    It is important to rapidly extract critical information from massive data so as
    to bring values for enterprises and individuals. Different types of frameworks
    could run different types of analytics. For example, MapReduce [101]-based framework
    like Hadoop [102] was aimed for batch-oriented processing. Storm framework [103],
    [104] was used to hand stream processing. Drill [105] plays a role in interactive
    ad hoc query and analytics. From the perspective of green computing, it is necessary
    to build efficient framework for big data analytics. For example, [106] established
    green MapReduce to reduce energy consumption while maintaining a low task response
    time. Goiri et al. [107] proposed a MapReduce framework, GreenHadoop, for a datacenter
    energized by a solar array and the electrical grid, which could predict the amount
    of solar energy to continue and schedule MapReduce jobs to maximize the use of
    green energy. In [108], Cavallaro et al. studied the various smart data analytics
    methods that take advantage of the support vector machines machine learning algorithm
    and parallelization approaches to solve the big data processing problems. In [109]
    , a framework with a greedy algorithm, energy-aware MapReduce scheduling algorithm,
    was proposed to improve the EE of MapReduce applications while remaining the service
    level agreement. To lower cooling energy consumption and ensure thermal reliability
    of the servers, [110] introduced a new efficient data-centric approach T*, which
    makes proactive and thermal-aware file placement to achieve thermal-aware job
    placement in the big data analytics compute model with the knowledge of the uneven
    thermal-profile and differences between the thermal-reliability-driven load thresholds
    of different servers, and the differences in arrival rates of computational jobs,
    sizes, and evolution life spans of the big data in the cluster. In [111], a Green
    cloud enabled framework was proposed as the energy-efficient way of a minimal
    discharge and rectification of the problem of high carbon production so as to
    increase the profit margin. C. Data Reductions for Big Data Computing and Processing
    One of important challenges to the attainability of big data processing is the
    high volume data, especially more typically with high dimensions. There have been
    a number of works toward processing load reductions. Note that we have discussed
    some data reduction issues in Section V. Here, the further relevant issues still
    exist in the stage of big data computing and processing. In [112] , Lathauwera
    and Vandewalleb, reviewed a multilinear generalization of the singular value decomposition
    (SVD) and the best rank-( R 1 , R 2 , R N ) approximation for higher order tensors,
    which may efficiently support dimensionality reduction in higher order signal
    processing. Based on multilinear algebra, Wang and Ahuja [113] proposed a tensor
    rank-one decomposition via decomposing multidimensional data into a collection
    of rank- 1 tensors, which was used in image sequence compression of higher quality
    images to obtain the same compression ratio as principal component analysis, while
    authors [114] also proposed rank- R tensor approximation for the same objective.
    Symeonidis et al. [115] proposed a unified framework for modeling the three kinds
    of entities, users, items and tags, in social tagging systems as a three-order
    tensor, where latent semantic analysis and dimensionality reduction was realized
    based on higher order singular value decomposition. In 2009 [116], National Science
    Foundation, USA, organized a workshop to summarized the relevant issues and challenges
    of tensor-based computation and modeling, which stressed the importance of tensor-based
    mathematics, as important parts of multilinear algebra, on the solving the problems
    of multidimensional datasets. Lua et al. [117] reviewed multilinear subspace learning
    for dimensionality reduction of multidimensional data directly based on their
    tensorial representations. Jun et al. [118] proposed ZIP-IO, an efficient framework
    for field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-accelerated compression. To interactively
    visualize big data directly for large-scale computing, Bi et al. [119] proposed
    a parallel compression method, proper orthogonal decomposition, to reduce the
    data size with low computational cost. Wang et al. [120] utilized a wavelet transform
    to decompose and approximate remote sensing big data with the large scale in the
    space domain, the correlation in the spectral domain, and the continuity in the
    time domain via a two-component Gaussian mixture model to check whether the density
    function of wavelet coefficients for a big dataset is with peaks at zero a heavy
    tailed shape. As data reduction can be applied across different stages for greening
    big data, we summarize some related studies with respect to their characteristics
    (i.e., application stage, lossless or not, main concepts) in Table I. TABLE I
    Data Reduction Techniques for Greening Big Data SECTION VIII. Discussions on the
    Relevance Among Green Measures and Big Data When discussing green issues, many
    people possibly first think about the popular metric, EE. An important question
    is what is the proper definition, meaning, and role of EE in the times of big
    data. Actually, the disputes on the definitions of EE have existed for a long
    time, and up to now, no consistent agreements are available. In 1996, M. G. Patterson
    provided a comprehensive summary on the definitions of EE [122], which we consider
    general enough even at present. The general definition of EE could be [122] EE=
    Useful output of a process Energy input into a process . (6) View Source Remark
    that sometimes the EE is defined via exchanging the positions of the denominator
    and nominator in (6) as EE= Energy input into a process Useful output of a process
    . (7) View Source The author further summarized the definitions of EE into four
    main groups [122]. Thermodynamic: The outputs and inputs of (6) in this case are
    completely based on measurements derived from the science of thermodynamics. Physical
    Thermodynamic: In this case, the inputs of (6) are thermodynamic units, while
    the outputs of (6) are physical units. Economic Thermodynamic: In this case, the
    inputs of (6) are thermodynamic units, while the service delivery outputs of (6)
    measured in market prices. Economic: In this case, both the energy inputs and
    service delivery outputs are purely in terms of market monetary values. In the
    recent works of ICT, physical-thermodynamic definitions of EE for the time t are
    typically used as [5] η(t)= N B (t) E(t) (8) View Source where t refers to a specific
    time or time slot, η(t) is the EE at t , N B (t) is the number of bits of the
    information sequences, and E(t) is the quantity of the relevant energy. Besides
    the general definition of EE for ICT, there have been also quite a few specific
    definitions of EE for ICT in different scenarios [123]–[126]. All those existing
    definitions of EE have not specifically considered big data issues. As discussed
    in [122], for the fairness of comparisons, energy quality issues have to be considered
    using a quality factor β , since different types of energy sources are with different
    qualities. Further, in the context of big data, the degrees of importance for
    different data are different at t , which are expressed as an important factor
    α . When the scenarios are communications and networking, the degrees of importance
    may be expressed as quality of service parameters. Then, we propose to rewrite
    the definition of EE (8) as η e (t)= α N B (t) βE(t) (9) View Source where we
    call η e (t) effective energy efficiency (EEE) to distinguish from the convectional
    definitions of EE. If we compare two different EEE η (1) e (t) and η (2) e (t)
    for two data sequences, which are the same, N (1) B (t)= N (2) B (t), E (1) (t)=
    E (2) (t), β (1) = β (2) , except α (1) > α (2) , it is clear that η (1) e (t)=
    α (1) N (1) B (t) β (1) E (1) (t) > η (2) e (t)= α (2) N (2) B (t) β (2) E (2)
    (t) . We assume that α (1) > α (2) shows that the sequence (1) is more important
    than the sequence (2) at t . For fairness, we would like to have η (1) e (t)=
    η (2) e (t) for β (1) = β (2) , which could be achieved if α (1) N (1) B (t) α
    (2) E (1) (t) = N (2) B (t) E (2) (t) , and in this case, N (1) B (t) E (1) (t)
    < N (2) B (t) E (2) (t) . Thus, E (1) (t) N (1) B (t) > E (2) (t) N (2) B (t)
    says that the energy per bit for the sequence (1) is more than that for the sequence
    (2), in other words, the more important bits should consume more energies at t
    . This result may inspire many new ways to implement future big data relevant
    systems. One may ask how to explain this result if all bits of both important
    and less important bits are actually processed using the same EE λ . Let us assume
    that the number of bits for the data sequence 2 is partitioned into two parts,
    N (2) B(1) (t) and N (2) B(2) (t) where N (2) B (t)= N (2) B(1) (t)+ N (2) B(2)
    (t) , and further assume that the actual energy per bit for the N (2) B(1) (t)
    bits is λ and the actual energy per bit for the N (2) B(2) (t) bits is 0, which
    enables E (2) (t)=λ N (2) B(1) (t)+0 N (2) B(2) (t)=λ N (2) B(1) (t) and E (2)
    (t) N (2) B (t) =λ N (2) B(1) (t) N (2) B (t) <λ . Since not all the bits actually
    consume energy, we may call E (2) (t) N (2) B (t) as virtual EE. This case of
    the N (2) B(2) (t) bits may be implemented using delayed transmissions for the
    scenarios of communications and networking or power shutdown for the scenarios
    of data storage; the actual energy per bit for all the N (1) B (t) bits is λ ,
    which enables E (1) (t)=λ N (1) B (t) and E (2) (t) N (2) B (t) =λ N (2) B(1)
    (t) N (2) B (t) <λ . Using the similar strategy, comparing with the concept of
    resource efficiency λ(t)= N B (t) R(t) (10) View Source where N B (t) is the number
    of bits of the information sequence, and R(t) is the quantity of the relevant
    resources, we also propose the concept of ERE as λ e (t)= α N B (t) θR(t) (11)
    View Source where λ e (t) is the ERE, θ is the quality factor of the resources,
    and α is the importance factor of the information sequence. Similarly, we could
    conclude that the more important bits should occupy more resource at t . Based
    on the similar strategies, the aforementioned new proposals of EE for big data
    era could be easily extended for other different definition formats of EE according
    to different scenarios [123]–[126]. As a remark, we would like to stress the importance
    of resource efficiency or more general ecological efficiency. Remark that the
    term resources here typically does not refer to energy but more general meanings,
    such as spaces, materials, devices, and so on. In literature of recent years,
    although EE and management have been highly investigated [5], resource efficiency
    has highly neglected or much less studied. In 1988 [127] and 1996 [128], H.T.
    Odum created the concept of energy accounting. In 1992 [129], William E. Rees
    proposed the concept of ecological footprints. Although energy accounting and
    ecological footprints are different approaches, both of them tried to study substantiality
    issues via addressing both energy and resources throughput to evaluate the difference
    between demands of humanity and natural sources. Although ecological footprint
    methods recently received some criticisms, such as [130], on the application limitations,
    the authors also agreed to the importance of resource efficiency relevant analysis.
    The concept of ecological footprint has received significant attentions, which
    actually criticized the limitations of the popular concept of carbon footprints.
    Further, we remark that the concerns on energy, resources, and sustainability
    have actually been raised by the relevant information with the supports of big
    data sources, which show the strong correlation among green and big data issues.
    SECTION IX. Challenge and Open Issues Although a number of efforts have been relevant
    to greening big data, many issues are still under-investigated. In this section,
    we outline several promising future research directions on data acquisition, storage,
    and processing, respectively. A. Data Acquisition and Communications Explore in-network
    processing to reduce unnecessary data collection A special challenge is on the
    decision, which essentially is context aware. Consider a scenario where future
    autonomous cars are capable of sensing their surroundings and cooperate with their
    neighbors. Definitely there will be vast volumes of data generated by the vehicles
    at a certain area, but there will be a large information overlapping between the
    collected data. While, it is nontrivial to detect the duplicated or redundant
    data in a specific area. Far beyond that, a variety of forms of data may exhibit
    similar features, and therefore, significant efforts shall be devoted to digging
    out such phenomena to reduce the collected data volume for energy and resource
    efficient data acquisition. Many different compression methods are required to
    explore spatial-temporal correlation between different data flows for the collected
    data volume reduction. Some innovative networking technologies have been proposed
    recently to welcome big data era. Two representative techniques are known as software-defined
    networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). Both intends to promote
    the flexibility, customability, and managability of networks. SDN and NFV provide
    a promising direction for energy-efficient data transmission via enabling flexible
    network resource optimization and allocation. However, at the initial storage
    of SDN and NFV development, many issues toward green networking are still underaddressed.
    One one hand, we shall first consider how to use SDN and NFV to enable efficient
    network management. For example, we shall investigate how to integrate SDN and
    NFV into existing network infrastructure to promote the energy and resource efficiency
    of the hybrid networks. On the other hand, how to lower the energy and resource
    consumption introduced by SDN and NFV themselves shall be also considered. For
    example, we shall consider how to deploy and migrate network functions adaptively
    to reduce the energy and resource consumption. By now, specifically for greening
    big data, the new designs of communication mechanisms and approaches are still
    very limited, and many issues in physical layer, media access control layer, network
    layer, and other upper layers for both wired and wireless networks are to be solved
    to welcome big data era, such as signal processing methods, control plane issues,
    network structures, protocols, hardware and software designs, and so on. B. Storage
    It is highly expected to find innovative storage infrastructures that explore
    a variety of heterogeneous storage resources to reduce the resource and energy
    consumption in datacenters. For example, some recent studies proposed to exploit
    vehicles in airport parking lots to provide storage services. However, such paradigms
    do not support persistent data storage service as the storage resources attached
    on vehicles are volatile. With the consideration of diverse big data storage requirements,
    it is beneficial to investigate how to orchestrate the diversity of storage devices
    towards the objective of greenness. Recent developments in storage techniques
    enable superhigh-speed storage devices for large-scale datacenter applications.
    For example, RAMCloud that keeps all data in DRAM at all times is widely recognized
    as one feasible way for fast big data processing. However, it is still promising
    to find out an efficient way to use traditional storage resources like hard disks
    and the volatile DRAM resources to balance between performance and efficiency,
    with joint considerations of the inherent characteristics (such as reliability,
    read/write speed, capacity, power consumption, and so on) of various storage devices.
    Another noteworthy thing is on the big data garbage. To pursue the vision of big
    data, people may aggressively acquire and store various kinds of generated data.
    However, actually not all these data need to be stored on expensive storage. We
    shall consider how to eliminate such useless data to avoid unnecessary waste of
    storage resource as well as the incurred energy consumption. On the other hand,
    as we already discussed in this survey, the data exhibit both spatial and temporal
    correlation, which can be explored to eliminate the data redundancy or compress
    the data volume. However, it is challenging to determine the extent data reduction
    without incurring negative side effects to data analytics. C. Data Processing
    Similar to storage issues, innovative infrastructures are also demanded for efficient
    data processing. Mobile cloud communities think that mobile devices shall not
    be only treated as service consumers but also shall be service providers. The
    first problem raised is how to orchestrate the infrastructure-based cloud resources
    and infrastructure-less mobile resources for quality-of-service guaranteed service
    provision. With the consideration on high volumes of big data, it is widely believed
    that the data storage and processing shall be jointly considered for various optimization
    objectives, such as cost minimization [131]. While, for energy and resource efficiency,
    we may further take another two important issues, i.e., data acquisition and datacenter
    cooling. These four aspects are highly correlated with each other and impose deep
    impact on the performance, resource, and EE. The tradeoff shall be well balanced
    for efficient and quality of service (QoS) guaranteed big data processing. As
    datacenter is the hotspot of big data processing, we shall also seek new electricity
    provision method for EE. As discussed in this paper, smart grid integrated with
    renewable power supply, also provides a good way for greening big data. A recent
    emerging concept, Energy Internet (EI), with the fusion of information technologies
    and energy technology, is considered as smart grid 2.0 and can better solve the
    energy crisis and environmental pressure [132]. It is interesting to incorporate
    EI into big data and investigate how they interact with each other to promote
    greening big data processing. SECTION X. Conclusion To discuss the green issues
    of big data systems, our discussions have addressed relevant green issues throughout
    the three phases of the life cycle for big data: 1) data generation, data acquisition,
    and data communications; 2) data storage; and 3) data analysis and processing.
    Then, we have analyzed the relevances among green measures and big data, discovered
    that the necessity to adjust the definitions of green measures to respond to the
    times of big data, and proposed the concepts of EEE and effective resource efficiency.

    and content Abstract Better methods are needed to accurately measure and record
    soil water content in real-time and at specified depths on a field scale. Recent
    developments of such a system using multisensor capacitance probes offers great
    potential for rigorous investigation of soil water dynamics over large areas.
    The purpose of this report is to show some of the kinds of information that can
    be obtained using this system to study the real-time soil water content dynamics
    at short time intervals (10 min), typically at four depth positions, under long-term,
    field-scale conditions, with our probes located as far as 125 m form the data
    logger. The systems have been used in the field for three years of continuous
    study (at 10 min increments), to study changes in soil water content, at four
    soil depths (commonly at 10, 20, 30, and 50 cm) as part of a research project
    to quantify temporal and spatial variation in soil properties under plow-tillage
    (PT) and no-tillage (NT) maize (Zea mays, L.). The multisensor capacitance probes
    and monitoring system have proven to be highly sensitive and robust for field
    scale soil water research. Viewing the soil water dynamics in real-time provides
    opportunity for precise control over the timing and amount of water that needs
    to be applied for optimal crop production yet avoiding excess deep percolation
    losses of water and agrochemicals to groundwater. Previous article in issue Next

    1. Introduction Greater understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of
    water under different soil conditions and cultural practices is required for the
    best use of available water resources while minimizing environmental pollution.
    Also, there is a continuous need for better methods to perform accurate, real-time,
    nearly continuous, soil water measurements at specific soil depth intervals and
    minimal soil disturbance, and covering large areas. New developments in precision
    agriculture, remote sensing, surface and subsurface preferential water flow patterns,
    simulation models for soil–water–plant–atmosphere interrelationships over large
    areas and permanent watch of leakage from the waste material depositing sites,
    will depend upon accurate `ground truth'' data provided by independent real-time
    soil water content monitoring systems covering micro to large scale hydrobasins.
    A survey of soil water measurement methods in current use showed gravimetric analysis
    as the most common method, followed by neutron thermalization and, far behind,
    by time domain reflectometry (TDR) and gamma attenuation (Green and Topp, 1992).
    More than 60 years of international work has been conducted on the correlation
    between the apparent dielectric constant of the soil–air–water–chemicals mixture
    (Ka) and the volumetric soil water content (θv) at different electromagnetic field
    frequencies. In the last 20 years two methods, TDR and capacitance, have proven
    to be accurate and useful for real-time monitoring studies (Paltineanu and Starr,
    1997). Abundant experimental data show that the TDR technique is useful in studies
    of real-time soil water content dynamics, with average resolution commonly ranging
    from 0.02–0.005 cm3 cm−3 water (Topp et al., 1980, Topp et al., 1982a, Topp et
    al., 1982b; Topp and Davis, 1985; van Wesenbeeck and Kachanoski, 1988; Zegelin
    et al., 1989, Zegelin et al., 1992; Baker and Allmaras, 1990; Heimovaara and Bouten,
    1990; Herkelrath et al., 1991). However, TDR systems are typically limited to
    small plots of land due to the requirements for short cable length (<25 m) between
    TDR rods and data loggers (Heimovaara, 1993). Another limitation of the TDR is
    the difficulty of monitoring discrete soil depths without having to install rods
    horizontally from a soil pit. These limitations have been overcome with new multisensor
    capacitance probe and soil water monitoring system with probes that can be located
    500 m from a central data logger. Detailed description of the system, along with
    comparisons to other measuring devices was given by Paltineanu and Starr (1997).
    We also tested the sensors in the laboratory on a carefully compacted silt loam
    soil and obtained a highly significant (r2=0.992 for n=15, and RMSE=0.009 cm3
    cm−3 water), nonlinear (θv=0.490 SF2.1674) relationship between the soil volumetric
    water content (θv, cm3 cm−3) and the scaled frequency (SF=(Fa−Fs)(Fa−Fw)−1]. The
    SF represents the ratio of individual sensor''s frequency (inside a PVC pipe,
    5 cm O.D.) in soil (Fs), in nonsaline water (Fw), and in air (Fa). The zone of
    major influence of the sensors represents a cylinder of soil, approximately 10
    cm along the axis of the probe, with a 10 cm ring around its PVC access pipe (Paltineanu
    and Starr, 1997). Thus, the water content at each sensor may be expressed as either
    a volumetric percent or as a depth of water (mm/10 cm). Sensors are placed in
    the probes at user selected depths (10 cm increments) and reading intervals (1
    and 9999 min). These multisensor capacitance probes and monitoring systems have
    been extensively used as an irrigation management tool in Australia since 1991
    (Buss, 1993). We have been using the system as a research tool in several field
    experiments since 1995. The purpose of this report is to show some of the kinds
    of information that can be obtained using this system to study the real-time soil
    water content dynamics at short time intervals (10 min), typically at four depth
    positions (i.e., 10, 20, 30, and 50 cm depths), year around and multiyear, at
    field-scale conditions (0.5 ha), with our probes located as far as 125 m from
    the data logger. 2. Materials and methods This field study was conducted on a
    Mattapex silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Aquic Hapludults) soil at the Beltsville
    Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, MD. The Ap horizon had about 35% sand,
    56% silt, 9% clay, and 0.8% organic-C. This research was part of a broader field
    study in which the field site, under continuous maize production, was incrementally
    changed from moldboard plow tillage (PT) to no tillage (NT) over a four-year period
    (Starr and Paltineanu, 1998). The experimental site had 26 paired-plots (4.6 by
    25 m) separated by a central alley, placed on a quasi uniform 4% slope, with the
    plots laid out on the contour (Fig. 1). Each 4.6 m wide plot was separated by
    a 3.0 m wide berm and drainage ditch to prevent surface runoff from one plot to
    the next. Prior to initiating tillage treatments in 1994, all plots were plowed
    with a moldboard plow to a depth of 20–25 cm, disked, and planted to maize for
    two consecutive years. In 1995, the plots were in their fourth year of maize,
    and one-fourth of the plots in their second year of NT. Both tillage treatments
    were planted with a 6-row no-till planter in 76.2 cm rows at a plant population
    of about 59000 plants ha−1, with wheel-compaction between rows 2 and 3 and between
    rows 4 and 5. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Schematic layout of

    capacitance probes and soil water monitoring system Two EnviroSCAN® (Sentek PTY,
    Ltd., Kent Town, South Australia) soil water monitoring systems with a total of
    16 multisensor capacitance probes (with four sensor depths at each probe) were
    installed at this field site on June 21, 1995. The first set of eight probes were
    placed in four pairs of the PT–NT plots at the non-traffic interrow position (between
    rows 3 and 4), with initial results reported by Starr and Paltineanu (1998). A
    second set of eight probes were placed in plots 4 and 6. Four probes were placed
    at different in-row and interrow positions, resulting in a total of ten probes
    installed in the two intensive study plots. Each of our EnviroSCAN® systems had
    three main parts: (1) eight semi-permanently installed probes with four capacitance
    sensors each, centered at depths of 10, 20, 30, and 50 cm depths; (2) a data logging
    station with two 5-wire cables (<500 m) connected to probes; and (3) an internal
    power supply charged by a solar panel (or by external battery power during extended
    periods of little to no direct sunlight as occurs in the winter months). After
    completing probe installation and hook-up to the data logging station, the system
    was set to record soil water readings at each of the 32 sensors on a 10 min interval.
    The capacitance data may be downloaded to a portable computer, and viewed directly
    in the field, either by depth or cumulatively with depth at each probe, with software
    provided by the EnviroSCAN®. The data may also be dumped to an ASCII computer
    file for additional detailed numerical and graphical analysis. Software provided
    by R. Soppe (USDA, ARS, Water Management Research Lab., Fresno, CA) was used to
    convert the ASCII data to column/row format. An additional program was written
    to reduce the size of the data files to intervals of 20 min to up to 2 h, whenever
    the change from one 10 min interval to the next gave volumetric water contents
    of less than 0.05% at any of the sensors. 3. Results and discussion Two real-time
    soil water dynamics monitoring systems (16 probes with four capacitance sensors
    each), were installed on June 21, 1995 in the PT–NT experiments (Fig. 1), and
    have been working the year around. The exceptions have been for a few days in
    the spring of 1996 and 1997 when the probes were removed for plowing, disking,
    and planting maize. The largest distance from the probes to the data logger was
    about 125 m. The systems have been robust with few maintenance problems during
    the 30 months of functioning in a large experimental site (∼0.5 ha). 3.1. Sensor
    response to cable length The effect of varying cable length was checked by inserting
    four different cable lengths (25, 100, 400, and 500 m) between a multilevel capacitance
    sensor probe, with two sensors, placed in the field and connected to the data
    logger. An average difference in frequency between the readings with the four
    cable lengths at each sensor was 1 in 12786 (<0.008%), giving a coefficient of
    variation, associated with the SF for the four distances of 0.0186 and 0.0183%.
    This CV was about the same as the CV associated with the SF at constant cable
    length (∼3 m) observed when calibrating the sensors in the laboratory (Paltineanu
    and Starr, 1997). These data confirm the manufacturer''s statement that the capacitance
    sensor readings are not affected by cable lengths up to 500 m, which can cover
    field areas up to 80 ha. 3.2. Real-time soil water dynamics across a growing season
    Characteristic soil water dynamics measured with the multisensor capacitance probes,
    across the growing season, are illustrated for one PT–NT pair of multisensor capacitance
    probes (maize row N0 3 in plots 4 and 6, Fig. 1) are shown in Fig. 3. These data
    represent the cumulative water content in the 5–55 cm soil depth interval (summation
    of the four sensor depths, plus interpolated values at the 40 cm depth). Each
    rapid rise in soil water content corresponded to a rainfall or irrigation event
    (Fig. 2). The small changes in water content was not `noisy data'', but reflects
    diurnal changes in soil water content – largely due to ET demand, as shown later.
    Differences in soil water content have been maintained in favor of NT treatment
    throughout the growing season. The general pattern of greater water content under
    NT vs. PT is consistent with these two tillage treatments, with the tillage effects
    largely due to different bulk density distributions and to different surface soil
    conditions that affect infiltration and runoff (Starr and Paltineanu, 1998). Download

    3 of plots 4 and 6. 3.3. Field determination of the in situ apparent water holding
    capacity (aWHC) As shown in Fig. 3, several rainfall events between DOY 175 and
    192, before high ET demand, caused only temporary rises in the soil water content
    as the macro pores filled and drained. The repeating pattern of nearly constant
    maximal water contents following these early-season rainfall events, when the
    maize plants were very small (6–7 leaves, Fig. 2) indicates an in situ aWHC at
    each probe. Thus the aWHC for the NT profile (5–55 cm) was about 172 mm, and about
    160 mm under PT. The aWHC for each sensor depth interval can also be determined
    from the water content data at each sensor depth (Fig. 4). For example, the aWHC
    at the 10 cm sensor of NT (covering a sensing depth interval of 5–15 cm) was about
    27 mm under NT (Fig. 4(a)). The aWHC is very important for establishing irrigation
    and drainage strategies and for minimizing leaching of agrochemicals to deeper
    soil layers. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Water content distribution
    at four sensor depths in maize-row 3 (plots 4 and 6), and showing the apparent
    water holding capacity and breaking points. 3.4. Establishing `breaking points''
    between periods of high and low rates of water loss After the early season rainfall
    events, no additional important rain fell for 24 days (DOY 189-213), when maize
    plants were growing rapidly from 7 to 11 leaves, resulting in rapid drying of
    the soil profile under both tillages (Fig. 3). All extended drying cycles that
    occurred in the presence of high ET demand resulted in an initial multidaily high
    rate of water loss followed by a distinctly slower multidaily rates of water loss.
    `Breaking points'' were observed at the intersection of the slopes of the two
    quasi steady rate of water loss, both by separate (Fig. 4) and cumulative soil
    depths (Fig. 5). Thus the breaking point for NT at the 5–15 cm and 15–25 cm depths
    occurred at DOY 197 a transition period of about four days between the high- and
    low-loss rates is evident at the 5–15 cm depth under NT (Fig. 4(a)). The small
    rainfall events from DOY 203–205 resulted in a temporary cessation of water removal
    at the 15–25 cm depth under NT. A small delay in the rate of water loss also occurred
    at the 25–35 cm depth of NT, but the overall rate of water loss remained nearly
    constant across the entire drying period. A slow but steady rate of water loss
    developed at the 45–55 cm depth interval soon after the breaking point occurred
    in the top two layers, indicating some root activity at this deepest depth. A
    similar pattern was observed for PT but the breaking points occurred sequentially
    in time (DOY 197, 201, and 204) at the top three sensor depths. Also, unlike that
    observed for NT, a breaking point was evident at the 25–35 cm depth of PT, which
    means that the maize roots were searching for water at that depth. `Breaking points''
    become important in predicting irrigation applications. For example, if our first
    priority in this research was to maximize crop yields then we would have applied
    our first irrigation about two weeks earlier than we did. We have observed that
    the critical soil water content that results in these breaking points remain quite
    constant. Thus viewing the data in real-time allows the user to anticipate when
    the breaking points will occur and to provide irrigation at the right time. The
    amount of water to apply can then be easily determined as the difference between
    the aWHC and the breaking point for each probe location. Download : Download full-size

    high Et and full canopy for four PT plots. The vertical arrows approximate the
    breaking points between high and low rates of water loss, and the dashed lines
    represent the mean rates of water losses. 3.5. Real-time dynamics of cumulative
    soil water contents at four plot replicates Real-time changes in cumulative soil
    water content (5–55 cm) at four plot replicates under PT during a drying cycle
    of the four non-traffic interrow positions across the entire experimental site
    (Fig. 1) are shown in Fig. 5. The highly variable initial water contents across
    the four replicates at DOY 220 are partially due to different amounts of sprinkler
    irrigation that were applied four days earlier, i.e., plots 3, 6, 21, and 24 received
    36, 30, 0 and 0 mm or water, respectively. The breaking points here, under full
    maize canopy, occurred approximately at the same time across the experimental
    site – even with the large variation in initial water contents in the four plots.
    The variation in these high rates of water loss (from 5.6–3.9 mm/d) for the four
    plots were directly related to the initial water contents, thus the different
    plots arrived at a critical low-water content at about the same time. As a result,
    the final slow-rates of water loss were about the same for the four PT positions,
    even though the total soil water content varied greatly across the experimental
    site. Clearly, local soil properties and associated rooting patterns affect the
    ability of the maize plants to extract water. Inspection of the diurnal variation
    in water loss indicates both internal drainage and ET losses of water. Night-time
    losses in soil water content are the clearest indication of internal drainage
    losses, and were most evident here in the wettest plots at the start of the drying
    cycle (plots 3 and 6 from DOY 220 to 222). As internal drainage decreased (night-time
    losses approached zero), the daytime losses are clearly due to ET demand alone
    (maize at ear formation stage) resulting in the diurnal changes in soil water
    content becoming increasingly `stair step'' like in appearance. 3.6. Small spatial-scale
    effects of cultural practices on water infiltration Placement of the multisensor
    capacitance probes at the row and interrow positions in plots 4 and 6 provided
    special insight into small-scale effects of cultural practices on the fate of
    water. One of our observations was the fate of small rainfall events. For example,
    in Fig. 3, the 2.3 mm rainfall on DOY 208 was not detected under PT, but resulted
    in an 8.6 mm increase in water content at this in-row position under NT. The stemflow
    water penetration under NT was mostly within the top sensor region (Fig. 4), but
    there was also an associated decrease in the rate of water loss at the next sensor
    depth. The funneling effect by the maize plants, and the greater macroporosity
    of the in-row position of NT are clearly evident from this data (Paltineanu et
    al., 1995). As shown in Fig. 3, by the end of the first major drying cycle the
    soil profile (5–55 cm) was quite dry when 17.5 mm of sprinkler irrigation water
    was applied on DOY 213. More of this water was detected under NT than PT, with
    56.8 mm increase under NT and 23.3 mm increase under PT. In addition to the obvious
    stemflow effects for both tillages, some of the difference in water infiltration
    was likely due to some of that water being absorbed by the dryer PT 0–5 cm surface
    soil (visual observation). The depth and magnitude of water infiltration with
    the first irrigation event in detailed is Fig. 6, where the data are plotted by
    sensor depth across expanded time scales. The irrigation water penetrated to the
    third sensor depth under NT (Fig. 6(a)), reaching a maximum water content of 35–40
    mm for each 10 cm depth interval (i.e., 35%–40% cm3 cm−3). After the initial rapid
    drainage of macropores, the water drainage occurred during the first night followed
    by a combined drainage and plant-water uptake during the first day after irrigation.
    Very little additional drainage was evident the second night followed by a lower
    rate of loss the next day, probably due to ET alone. A similar general pattern
    occurred under PT (Fig. 6(b)), only with less water penetration. The delayed slower
    rise in water content at the 25–35 cm depth from under PT DOY 213.5–214 shows
    internal drainage from above. Further detail of the water penetration under NT
    is given in Fig. 6(c). Note first the changing time increment of the data plotted,
    from 1 h down to 20 min intervals and then up to 2 h intervals. This is due to
    the data compression program, not to varying intervals of the sensor readings.
    Secondly, note the sequence and speed of water penetration from the first sensor
    depth to the third depth, with the peak in water contents moving from one sensor
    depth to the next in about 1 h. This rate of movement suggests substantial filling
    of meso- and macropores, and their associated higher hydraulic conductivities
    than might be expected from the soil matrix of silt-loam soil. Download : Download

    3 (plots 4 and 6). 4. Conclusions The multisensor capacitance probes and monitoring
    system was found to be highly sensitive and robust for field scale soil water
    research. Real-time soil water dynamics by depths, at both small- and large-areas,
    can provide crucial information for understanding the impact of cultural and cropping
    practices on the fate of water in soils. Accurate `ground truth'' data is needed
    for new developments in precision agriculture, remote sensing, soil–water–plant–atmosphere
    interrelationship models, and for improved water management under irrigated agriculture.
    The method provides, among others, the capability for field determination of (1)
    the `apparent water holding capacity'', (2) the `breaking points'' between periods
    of high and low rates of water loss, (3) the small spatial-scale effects of cultural
    practices on water infiltration, (4) real-time viewing of soil water dynamics
    over large areas, and (5) irrigation scheduling strategies. Such capabilities
    are needed for a better and understanding of the fate of water and agrochemicals
    in soils and the effects of soil and crop management practices on the environment.

    point management line (77 vs. 74; water content expressed as the sum of soil water
    content at depths 10, 30 and 50 cm; Fig. 5). This shows that determining the management
    line according to the rate of apparent water uptake is a practical and effective
    tool to define irrigation scheduling, as it has been reported for other species
    (Abrisqueta et al., 2012; Starr and Paltineanu, 1998a, 1998b; Thompson et al.,
    2007a). With respect to the yield components, it was observed that no treatment
    affected crop load, which is why the differences in yield, in both seasons, were
    due to effects in fruit size (Table 1). Show abstract Field assessment of interreplicate

    By depending on the ability of EM sensors mainly to describe θv trends and to
    quantify Δθv within each drying sequence (Starr and Paltineanu, 1998; Singh et
    al., 2018), such an approach might be more accommodating of shortcomings in calibration
    and/or interreplicate variability. Future field studies that implement and evaluate
    this type of approach as well as complex ensemble approaches combining soil moisture
    sensing, soil water balance modeling, and thermal sensing/energy balance modeling
    (Barker et al., 2018) would be greatly welcomed to overcome the challenge of relying
    solely on soil moisture sensor data. Show abstract Deficit irrigation management

    traffic that refers to audio, video, and images, has drastically shifted the vision
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) from scalar to Multimedia Internet of Things (M-IoT).
    IoT devices are constrained in terms of energy, computing, size, and storage memory.
    Delay-sensitive and bandwidth-hungry multimedia applications over constrained
    IoT networks require revision of IoT architecture for M-IoT. This paper provides
    a comprehensive survey of M-IoT with an emphasis on architecture, protocols, and
    applications. This article starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT.
    Then, we discuss the issues considering the characteristics of multimedia and
    provide a summary of related M-IoT architectures. Various multimedia applications
    supported by IoT are surveyed, and numerous use cases related to road traffic
    management, security, industry, and health are illustrated to show how different
    M-IoT applications are revolutionizing human life. We explore the importance of
    Quality-of-Experience (QoE) and Quality-of-Service (QoS) for multimedia transmission
    over IoT. Moreover, we explore the limitations of IoT for multimedia computing
    and present the relationship between the M-IoT and emerging technologies including
    event processing, feature extraction, cloud computing, Fog/Edge computing and
    Software-Defined-Networks (SDNs). We also present the need for better routing
    and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols for M-IoT. Finally, we
    present a detailed discussion on the open research issues and several potential
    research areas related to emerging multimedia communication in IoT. Topic: Mobile

    Resources V. The State-of-the-art CMA Approaches: Taxonomy Show Full Outline Authors
    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: Recently, Cloud-based
    Mobile Augmentation (CMA) approaches have gained remarkable ground from academia
    and industry. CMA is the state-of-the-art mobile augmentation model that employs
    resource-rich clouds to increase, enhance, and optimize computing capabilities
    of mobile devices aiming at execution of resource-intensive mobile applications.
    Augmented mobile devices envision to perform extensive computations and to store
    big data beyond their intrinsic capabilities with least footprint and vulnerability.
    Researchers utilize varied cloud-based computing resources (e.g., distant clouds
    and nearby mobile nodes) to meet various computing requirements of mobile users.
    However, employing cloud-based computing resources is not a straightforward panacea.
    Comprehending critical factors (e.g., current state of mobile client and remote
    resources) that impact on augmentation process and optimum selection of cloud-based
    resource types are some challenges that hinder CMA adaptability. This paper comprehensively
    surveys the mobile augmentation domain and presents taxonomy of CMA approaches.
    The objectives of this study is to highlight the effects of remote resources on
    the quality and reliability of augmentation processes and discuss the challenges
    and opportunities of employing varied cloud-based resources in augmenting mobile
    devices. We present augmentation definition, motivation, and taxonomy of augmentation
    types, including traditional and cloud-based. We critically analyze the state-of-the-art
    CMA approaches and classify them into four groups of distant fixed, proximate
    fixed, proximate mobile, and hybrid to present a taxonomy. Vital decision making
    and performance limitation factors that influence on the adoption of CMA approaches
    are introduced and an exemplary decision making flowchart for future CMA approaches
    are presented. Impacts of CMA approaches on mobile computing is discussed and
    open challenges are presented as the future research directions. (Show More) Published

    10.1109/SURV.2013.070813.00285 Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Since a
    decade ago, the visions of ‘information under fingertip’ [1] and ‘unrestricted
    mobile computing’ [2] aroused the need to enhance computing power of mobile devices
    to meet the exponentially growing demand of mobile users for computing and information
    application services [3]. In the late 90s, the concept of load sharing and remote
    execution aimed to augment computing capabilities of mobile devices by shifting
    the resource-intensive mobile codes to surrogates (powerful computing device(s)
    in vicinity) [4]–[6]. Although remote execution efforts [7]–[18] have yielded
    many impressive achievements, several challenges such as reliability, security,
    and elasticity of surrogates hinder the remote execution adaptability [19]. For
    instance, the resource sharing and computing services of surrogates can be terminated
    without prior notice and their content can be accessed and altered by the surrogate
    machine or other users in the absence of a Service Level Agreement (SLA). SLA
    is a formal contract employed and negotiated in advance between service provider
    and consumer to enforce certain level of quality against a fee. Few years later,
    emergence of cloud resources created an opportunity to mitigate the shortcomings
    of utilizing surrogates in augmenting mobile devices. Cloud is a type of distributed
    system comprised of a cluster of powerful computers accessible as unified computing
    resource(s) based on an SLA [20]. Cloud computing as “a model for enabling ubiquitous,
    convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing
    resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that
    can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service
    or service provider interaction” [21] stimulates researchers to adopt the cutting
    edge technology in mobile device augmentation: Cloud-based Mobile Augmentation
    (CMA). Cloud-based Mobile Augmentation (CMA) is the-state-of-the-art mobile augmentation
    model that leverages cloud computing technologies and principles to increase,
    enhance, and optimize computing capabilities of mobile devices by executing resource-intensive
    mobile application components in the resource-rich cloud-based resources. Cloud-based
    resources include varied types of mobile/immobile computing devices that follow
    cloud computing principles [22], [23] to perform computations on behalf of the
    resource-constraint mobile devices. Figure 1 depicts major building blocks of
    a typical CMA system. It is notable that these building blocks are optional superset,
    and specific CMA system may not have all these building blocks. CMA efforts [24]–[27],
    [27]–[49] exploit various cloud-based computing resources, especially distant
    clouds and proximate mobile nodes to augment mobile devices. Distant clouds are
    giant clouds such as Amazon EC21 located inside the vendor premise —far away from
    the mobile clients—offering infinite, elastic computing resources with extreme
    computing power and high WAN (Wide Area Network) latency. Proximate mobile nodes
    are building a cluster of mobile computing devices scattered near the mobile clients
    offer limited computing power with lower WAN latency than distant clouds. Fig.
    1. Major Building Blocks of an Exemplary CMA System. Show All Although heterogeneity
    among cloud-based resources increases service flexibility and enhances users''
    computing experience, determining the most appropriate computing resources among
    available options and performing upfront analysis of influential factors (e.g.,
    user preferences and available native mobile resources) are critical in the adaptability
    of CMA approaches. Thus, ‘resource scheduler’ and ‘analyzer and optimizer’ components
    depicted in Figure 1 are needed to analyze and allocate appropriate resources
    to each task in a typical CMA system. Moreover, several questions need to be addressed
    before the CMA concept can be successfully employed in the real scenarios. For
    instance, can CMA augment computing capabilities of mobile devices and save local
    resources to enhance user experience? Is CMA always feasible and beneficial? Which
    type of resources is appropriate for a certain task? Answering these questions
    requires ‘monitoring and profiler’, ‘QoS management’, ‘context management’, and
    ‘decision making engine’ components to perform in each CMA system (see Figure
    1). Therefore, an augmentation decision engine similar to those used in [25],
    [33], [49] and exemplary decision making flow presented in this paper (discussed
    in part VI-C) to determine the mobile augmentation feasibility is needed to amend
    the CMA performance and reliability. During augmentation process, the local and
    native application state stack needs synchronization to ensure integrity between
    native and remote data. Upon successful outsourcing, remote results need to be
    returned and integrated to the source mobile device. Thus, the ‘Synchronizer’
    component needs to perform in typical CMA approaches (see Figure 1). Although
    CMA approaches can empower mobile processing and storage capabilities, several
    disadvantages such as application development complexity and unauthorized access
    to remote data demand a systematized plenary solution. Performance of the CMA
    systems is highly influenced by various challenges and issues of wireless networking
    and cloud computing technologies. CMA researchers require a high performance,
    elastic, robust, reliable, and foreseeable communication throughput between mobile
    nodes and cloud servers which is not yet realized despite of remarkable efforts
    and achievements of communication and networking societies. Current shortcomings
    and deficiencies of wireless communication and networking, especially seamless
    connectivity and mobility, high performance communication throughput provisioning,
    and wireless data interception discourage system analysts, engineers, developers,
    and entrepreneurs from deploying CMA-enabled mobile applications due to the high
    risk of system malfunction and user experience degradation. Moreover, CMA systems
    require accurate estimation mechanisms to predict the overall time and energy
    consumption of communication and computation tasks while exploiting clouds. Such
    estimation is a challenging task considering huge infrastructures'' performance
    diversity [50] and policy heterogeneity [51] of cloud services in intermittent
    wireless environment. Despite of blooming efforts endeavoring to analyze and comprehend
    the cloud computing model and behavior [52]–[55], CMA solutions are still unable
    to accurately foresee required time and energy of exploiting cloud resources to
    execute intensive applications. Additionally, sundry cloud challenges, especially
    live VM migration, infrastructure and platform heterogeneity, efficient allocation
    of clouds to tasks, QoS management, security, privacy, and trust in cloud increase
    system complexity and decrease successful CMA systems adoption. Among limited
    studies of the domain, [19] and [56] survey remote execution and application offloading
    algorithms with focus on how task offloading is performed in various efforts.
    Fernando et al. [57] and Dinh et al. [58] sought to explain the convergence of
    mobile and cloud computing, and distinguish it from the earlier domains such as
    cloud and grid computing [59]. The authors describe issues, particularly mobile
    application offloading, privacy and security, context awareness, and data management.
    Sanaei, Abolfazli, Gani, and Buyya [51] present a comprehensive survey on MCC
    with major focus on heterogeneity. The authors describe the challenges and opportunities
    imposed by heterogeneity and identify hardware, platform, feature, API, and network
    as the roots of MCC heterogeneity. They explain major heterogeneity handling approaches,
    particularly virtualization, service oriented architecture’ and semantic technology.
    However, the computing performance, distance, elasticity, availability, reliability,
    and multi-tenancy of remote resources are marginally discussed in these studies
    that necessitate further research to explain the impact of remote resources on
    augmentation process and highlight paradigm shift from the unreliable surrogates
    to reliable clouds. TABLE I List of Acronyms and Corresponding Full Forms. In
    this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art mobile augmentation efforts that employ
    cloud computing infrastructures to enhance computing capabilities of resource-constraint
    mobile devices, especially smartphones. To the best of our knowledge, this is
    the first effort that studies the impacts of cloud-based computing resources on
    mobile augmentation process. We differentiate augmentation from similar concepts
    of load sharing and remote execution, and present augmentation motivation. We
    review efforts that endeavor to mitigate the mobile devices'' shortcomings and
    classify them as hardware and software to devise a taxonomy. The impacts of CMA
    in mobile computing are presented. The characteristics of cloud-based remote resources
    and their role in CMA effectiveness are studied and classified into four groups,
    namely distant immobile clouds, proximate immobile computing entities, proximate
    mobile computing entities, and hybrid based on their mobility and physical location
    traits. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art CMA models are reviewed and taxonomized
    into four classes of distant fixed, proximate fixed, proximate mobile, and hybrid
    according to our cloud-based resource classification. Factors impact on the CMA
    adaptability are identified and described as augmentation environment, user preferences
    and requirements, mobile devices, cloud servers, and contents. Five major metrics
    that limit the performance of CMA approaches are studied. A sample flowchart of
    decision making engines for imminent CMA solutions is presented and several open
    challenges are discussed as the future research directions. Such survey is beneficial
    to the communication and networking communities, because comprehending CMA process
    and current deployment challenges are beneficial in modifying the fundamental
    networking infrastructures to optimize the CMA process. In this paper, we use
    the terms mobile devices and smartphones interchangeably with similar notion.
    Table I shows the list of acronyms used in the paper. The remainder of this paper
    is organized as follows. Section II introduces mobile computation augmentation,
    presents its motivation and describes the taxonomy of mobile augmentation types.
    The impacts of CMA on mobile computing are presented in Section III. Section IV
    presents the analysis and taxonomy of varied cloud-based augmentation resources.
    Comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art CMA approaches is presented and taxonomy
    is devised in Section V. We discuss the CMA decision making and limitation factors
    and illustrate CMA feasibility in Section VI. Finally, open research challenges
    are presented in Section VII and paper is concluded in Section VIII. SECTION II.
    Mobile Computation Augmentation In this Section, we present a definition on mobile
    computing augmentation based on the available definitions on the relevant concepts,
    particularly remote execution [5] and cyber foraging [6]. Additionally, the motivation
    for performing mobile computation augmentation is described and taxonomy of mobile
    augmentation types is presented. TABLE II Initial Features of Mobile Empowerment
    Approaches. A. Definition Indeed, empowering computation capabilities of mobile
    devices is not a new concept and there have been different approaches to achieve
    this goal, including load sharing [4], remote execution [5], cyber foraging [6],
    and computation offloading [60], [61] that are described as follows. We have analyzed
    them and summarized the analysis results in Table II. Results in this Table are
    extracted from the early efforts in each category, which are already deviated
    from their original characteristics due to the research achievements. • Load Sharing
    Othman and Hailes'' work [4] in 1998 can be considered as one of the earliest
    efforts to conserve native resources of mobile devices using a software approach.
    The main idea is inspired from the concept of load balancing in distributed computing
    that is “a strategy which attempts to share loads in a distributed system without
    attempting to equalize its load” [4]. This approach migrates the whole computation
    job for remote execution. It considers several metrics such as job size, available
    bandwidth, and result size to identify if the load balancing and transferring
    the job to the remote computer can save energy. However, they need to send the
    task and data to the nearest base station and wait for the results to return.
    The base station is responsible to find appropriate server to run the job and
    forward the results back to the mobile device. Moreover, computing server is a
    fixed computer and there is no provision for user and code mobility at run time.
    • Remote Execution The concept of remote execution for mobile clients emerged
    in 90s and several researchers [5], [62]–[65] endeavor to enable mobile computers
    to performing remote computation and data storage to conserve their scarce native
    resources and battery. In 1998 [5], feasibility of remote execution concept on
    mobile computers, particularly laptops was investigated. The authors report that
    remote execution can save energy if the remote processing cost is lower than local
    execution. Remote execution involves migrating computing tasks from the mobile
    device to the server prior the execution. The server performs the task and sends
    back the results to the mobile device. However, difference between computation
    power of client and server is not a metric of decision making in this method.
    Moreover, the whole task needs to be migrated to the remote server prior the execution
    which is an expensive effort. It also neglects the impact of environment characteristics
    on the remote execution outcome. Static decision making is another shortcoming
    of this proposal. • Cyber Foraging Satyanarayana in 2001 [6] further developed
    the remote execution idea by considering dynamism in remote execution process.
    The author defined cyber foraging as the process “to dynamically augment the computing
    resources of a wireless mobile computer by exploiting wired hardware infrastructure”.
    Resources in cyber foraging are stationary computers or servers in public places
    —connected to wired Internet and power cable—that are willing to perform intensive
    computation on behalf of the resource-constraint mobile devices in vicinity. However,
    load sharing, remote execution, and cyber foraging approaches assume that the
    whole computing task is stored in the device and hence, it requires the intensive
    code and data to be identified and partitioned for offloading —either statically
    prior the execution or dynamically at runtime —which impose large overhead on
    resource-poor mobile device [19]. Moreover, as Kumar et al. [66] explain, for
    each mobile user that runs the intensive application, the whole offloading process
    must be repeated including decision making process in the device and transferring
    the heavy components and large data to the network. Due to slight differences
    among these concepts, researchers use the terms ‘remote execution’, ‘cyber foraging’,
    and ‘computation offloading’ interchangeably in the literature with similar principle
    and notion. Nevertheless, researchers in recent activities [36], [42], [45], [46]
    aim to enhance computing capabilities of mobile devices in a slightly different
    manner. They assume to store the intensive code and data outside the device and
    keep the rest in the mobile device instead of storing the whole task —including
    both lightweight and intensive code and data —in the mobile device. Therefore,
    the overhead of identifying, partitioning, and migrating the resource-intensive
    task to the remote server is mitigated, energy is saved, and storage problem is
    alleviated in mobile devices. Moreover, storing intensive components outside the
    device —in a publicly accessible storage—can increase their reusability and enable
    more than one user to leverage their computation services. Therefore, we coin
    the term mobile computation augmentation as the wider phrase that subsumes load
    sharing, remote execution, cyber foraging, and other approaches that augment computing
    capabilities of mobile devices. • Mobile Computation Augmentation Mobile computation
    augmentation, or augmentation in brief, is the process of increasing, enhancing,
    and optimizing computing capabilities of mobile devices by leveraging varied feasible
    approaches, hardware and software. Mobile device is any non-stationary, battery-operating
    computing entity able to interact with end-user and execute transactions, store
    data, and communicate with the environment using wireless technologies and varied
    sensors. Smartphone, tablet, handheld/wearable computing devices, and vehicle
    mount computers are mobile device instances. Approaches that can augment mobile
    devices include hardware and software. Hardware approach involves manufacturing
    high-end physical components, particularly CPU, memory, storage, and battery.
    Software approaches can be —but are not limited to —computation offioading, remote
    data storage, wireless communication, resource-aware computing, fidelity adaptation,
    and remote service request (e.g., context acquisition). Augmentation approaches
    can increase computing capabilities of mobile devices and conserve energy. They
    can be leveraged in three main categories of applications, namely (i) computing-intensive
    software such as speech recognition and natural language processing, (ii) data-intensive
    programs such as enterprise applications, and (iii) communication-intensive applications
    such as online video streaming applications. The augmented mobile device performs
    complex tasks that would not be done, otherwise. Hence, the mobile application
    developers do not take into account resource shortcomings of mobile devices in
    developing mobile applications and users will not consider their devices weaknesses
    in utilizing varied complex applications. B. Motivation Mobile devices have recently
    gained momentous ground in several communities like governmental agencies, enterprises,
    social service providers (e.g., insurance, Police, fire departments), healthcare,
    education, and engineering organizations [67]–[69]. However, despite of significant
    improvement in mobile devices'' computing capabilities, still computing requirements
    of mobile users, especially enterprise users, is not achieved. Several intrinsic
    deficiencies of mobile devices encumber feasibility of intense mobile computing
    and motivate augmentation. Leveraging augmentation approaches, vision of performing
    intense mobile operations and control such as remote surgery, on-site engineering,
    and visionary scenarios similar to the lost child and disaster relief described
    in [70] will become reality. In this part, we analyze and taxonomize smartphones''
    deficits that can be alleviated by augmentation. Figure 2 depicts our devised
    taxonomy. 1) Processing Power Processing deficiencies of mobile clients due to
    slow processing speed and limited RAM is one of the major challenges in mobile
    computing [70]. Mobile devices are expected to have high processing capabilities
    similar to computing capabilities of desktop machines for performing computing-intensive
    tasks to enrich user experience. Realizing such vision requires powerful processor
    being able to perform large number of transactions in a short course of time.
    Large internal memory/RAM to store state stack of all running applications and
    background services is also lacking. Beside local memory limitations, memory leakage
    also intensifies memory restrains of mobile devices. Memory leakage is the state
    of memory cells being unnecessarily occupied by running applications and services
    or those cells that are not released after utilization. Garbage-collector-based
    languages like Java in Android2 contribute to memory leakage due to failed or
    delayed removal of unused objects from the memory [71]. Android''s kernel level
    transactions can also leak memory in the absence of memory management mechanisms
    [71], [72]. Moreover, inward deficiency and inefficient design and implementation
    of mobile applications can also waste scarce memory of mobile devices. Thus, in
    the absence of required memory, applications are frequently paused or terminated
    by the operating system leading to longer execution time, excessive resource dissipation,
    and ultimately mobile user experience degradation. 2) Energy Resources Energy
    is the only non-replenishable resource in mobile devices that demands external
    resources to be replenished [73], [74]. Currently, energy requirement of a mobile
    device is supplied via lithium-ion battery that lasts only few hours if device
    is computationally engaged. Battery capacity is increasing at about 5 to 10% a
    year [75], [76] as battery cells are excessively dense [73]. Moreover, mobile
    device manufacturers endeavor to attain device lightness, compactness, and handiness,
    which prevent exploitation of bulky long-lasting batteries. User safety is another
    concern that confines manufacturers to produce low capacity batteries [77]. While
    explosion of a battery with few hundreds milliamperes capacity can jeopardize
    human life [78], explosion of a high-capacity battery can carry catastrophic consequences.
    Energy harvesting efforts [79]–[81] seek to replenish energy from renewable resources,
    particularly human movement, solar energy, and wireless radiation, but these resources
    are mostly intermittent and not available on-demand [82]. For instance, a sitting
    mobile user at night cannot have any external power source in the absence of wall
    power and wireless radiations. Moreover, researchers aim at reducing the energy
    overhead in different aspects of computing, including hardware, OS, application,
    and networking interface [83], [84]. Efforts are directed to develop alternative
    energy resources such as nuclear batteries that will likely last months or years
    [85]. However, significant deal of R&D is needed to fulfill ever-increasing energy
    requirements of mobile users. Hence, in the absence of long-spanning energy on
    mobile devices, alternative augmentation approaches play a vital role in maturing
    mobile and ubiquitous computing. 3) Local Storage Drastic increase in the number
    of applications and amount of digital contents such as pictures, songs, movies,
    and home films [86] from one hand and limited storage of mobile devices from the
    other hand decelerate usability of mobile devices. While PCs are able to locally
    store huge amount of data, smartphones are limited to few gigabytes of space which
    are mostly occupied by system files, user applications, and personal data. Therefore,
    frequent storing, updating, and deleting data as well as uninstalling and reinstalling
    applications due to space limitation cause irksome impediments to mobile users
    [87]. Additionally, delivering offline usability, which is one of the most important
    characteristics of contemporary applications, remains an open challenge since
    mobile devices lack large local storage. Fig. 2. Taxonomy of Augmentation Motivation:
    Intrinsic and non-intrinsic mobile challenges motivate augmentation. Show All
    4) Visualization Capabilities Effective data visualization on small mobile devices''
    screen is a non-trivial task when current screen manufacturing technologies and
    energy limitations do not allow significant size extensions without losing device
    handiness. Currently smartphones like HTC One X3 and Samsung Galaxy Note II4 have
    the biggest screens, at 4.7 and 5.5 inches respectively; however, they are very
    small compared to PCs and notebooks. Therefore, efficient data visualization in
    small smartphones'' screen necessitates software-based techniques similar to tabular
    pages, 3D objects, multiple desktops, switching between landscape and portrait
    views (needs accelerometer), and verbal communication to virtually increase presentation
    area. Recently, computing-intensive mobile 3D display technology is promising
    to noticeably mitigate the visualization deficit of contemporary smartphones.
    Glass-free auto-stereoscopic displays [88] can present 3D data by exploiting binocular
    parallax to offer a different view for each eye. Taking advantages of current
    and imminent software-based techniques beside native tools, especially tilting
    sensors significantly improve the mobile visualization capabilities in the near
    future. However, these approaches are computation-intensive processes that quickly
    drain battery [88], [89]. A feasible alternative solution to realize software-based
    content presentation approaches is to augment smartphones'' computing capabilities.
    5) Security, Privacy, and Data Safety Mobile end-users are concerned about security
    and privacy of their personal data, banking records, and online behaviors [90].
    The dramatic increase in cybercrime and security threats within mobile devices
    [91], cloud resources [92] and wireless transactions makes security and privacy
    more challenging than ever [93]. Moreover, performing complex cryptographic algorithms
    is likely infeasible because of computing deficiencies of mobile devices. Securing
    files using pair of credentials is also less realistic in the absence of large
    keyboard. Data safety is another challenge of mobile devices, because information
    stored inside the local storage of mobile devices are susceptible to safety breaches
    due to high probability of hardware malfunction, physical damage, stealing, and
    loss. Amalgam of these problems and deficiencies in mobile computing stimulates
    researchers from academia and industry to exploit novel technologies and approaches
    to augment computing capabilities of mobile devices which is subject of this study.
    C. Mobile Augmentation Types: Taxonomy In this Section, we analyze and classify
    augmentation approaches into two major types of hardware and software. Our devised
    taxonomy is depicted in Figure 3 and described as follows. Hardware The hardware
    approach aims to empower smartphones by exploiting powerful resources, particularly
    multicore CPUs with high clock speed [94], large screen, and long-lasting battery
    [85], [95]. ARM5 and Samsung6 are major mobile processor manufacturers producing
    multi-core processors such as ARM Cortex-597 and Samsung Exynos 5 Octa core8 that
    perform in higher speed than a single core processors [94]. However, doubling
    the CPU clock speed approximately octuples the device energy consumption [66].
    Nevertheless, augmentation via sophisticated hardware is hindered by several obstacles.
    Firstly, generating powerful processor, large storage, and big screen decrease
    smartphone handiness due to additional heat, size, and weight. Secondly, considering
    the fact that utilizing long-lasting battery in small mobile devices is not feasible
    with current technologies, resource enlargement contributes toward faster battery
    drainage and shorter battery life time. Thirdly, equipping mobile devices with
    high-end hardware noticeably increases their price compare to the stationary machines.
    Unlike PCs, smartphone''s hardware is not upgradable; hence, a new device should
    be possessed in case of technology advancement. Therefore, in the absence of futuristic
    engineering technologies, the hardware-based augmentation process is slow and
    expensive that necessitates alternative augmentation approaches to enhance computing
    capabilities of mobile devices without drastic ownership price hike. Fig. 3. Taxonomy
    of Mobile Augmentation Types. Show All Software Software-oriented mobile augmentation
    approaches are classified into six groups, namely remote execution, remote storage,
    multi-tier programming, live cloud-streaming, resource-aware computing, and fidelity
    adaptation that will be explained later in this part. Resources that are used
    in major software-oriented approaches are classified into two groups, namely traditional
    and cloud-based. Their major differences lie on resource provisioning and access
    strategies, service security and delivery models, and resource characteristics.
    In traditional approaches, researchers leverage centralized resources of distant
    traditional servers or free nearby surrogates. Several problems such as resource
    availability, elasticity, and security of traditional approaches hinder their
    success. For instance, surrogates can terminate their services anytime without
    considering their current load, and can violate user security and privacy by changing
    execution sequence or altering raw and processed data. To alleviate the problems
    of traditional servers, researchers in recent efforts [25], [27], [29], [31],
    [33]–[35], [41], [43], [44], [96] exploit highly available, elastic, secure cloud
    infrastructure. “Cloud is a type of parallel and distributed system consisting
    of a collection of interconnected and virtualized computers dynamically provisioned
    and presented as one or more unified computing resources based on service-level
    agreements established through negotiation between the service provider and consumers”
    [20]. While utilizing cloud resources, users pay for the amount and duration they
    utilize various resources (e.g., CPU, memory, and bandwidth) based on an agreed
    SLA. In the SLA, the amount and quality of required resources such as processor,
    RAM, and storage are specified and user is billed accordingly. Service delivery
    failure will be compensated by the vendor. Lucrative financial benefits of cloud
    services encourage cloud providers to compete in delivering high service availability,
    reliability, security, and robustness to increase their market share. Hence, the
    augmentation performance is less affected by resource unreliability and interruption.
    Moreover, cloud infrastructures are available to end-users via Virtual Machine
    (VM)9 to increase resource utilization ratio and enhance overall security and
    privacy. Virtualization technology aims to enable resource sharing in an isolated
    environment called VM. It realizes execution of multiple operating systems on
    a single machine and enables sharing of large resources among multiple end-users.
    Users can only access to infrastructures allocated to their VMs and cannot access
    prohibited resources and contents. Table III summarizes the comparison results
    of traditional and cloud-based resources and advocates differentiations between
    the conventional servers and clouds. High computing power, elasticity, mobility
    support, low utilization overhead, and security are some of the significant advantages
    of cloud resources compare to the surrogates that advocate the latest paradigm
    shift in mobile augmentation. Software augmentation techniques are classified
    as remote execution (offloading or cyber foraging) [5]–[8], [10]–[13], [16]–[18],
    [25], [29], [30], [33]–[35], [41], [43], [44], [97], remote storage [98], Multi-tier
    programming [36], [45], [46], live cloud-streaming [99], resource-aware computing
    [100], [101], and fidelity adaptation [102] and explained as follows. • Remote
    execution As explained in part II-A,the resource-hungry components of mobile applications
    —in whole or part —are migrated to the resource-rich computing device(s) that
    are willing to share their resources with mobile devices. Rapid development of
    heterogeneous mobile devices obliges adaptive offloading approaches able to enhance
    capabilities of wide range of mobile devices in dynamic environment with least
    processing overhead and latency. The efficiency of offloading approaches highly
    depends on what component(s) can be partitioned? When partitioning takes place?
    Where to execute the component(s)? And how to communicate with the remote server?
    [103]. Offloading approaches perform varied-time analysis to answer these questions,
    which are classified into three groups and explained as below. Design Time Analysis
    In this method, the application''s complexity is analyzed at design time to determine
    the answer of four above questions. Application developer or a middle-ware specifies
    the resource-intensive components of mobile application that can be offloaded
    to the remote server and label them as remote component(s). Programmers decide
    how to partition application and adapt its performance to the dynamic mobile environment
    which is a non-trivial task, mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the execution
    environment. Performing such action needs excessive programming skill and knowledge
    of computation offloading. Design time approaches [8], [10], [12] notably save
    native resources of mobile device by reducing the processing and monitoring overheads.
    However, partitioning prior to the execution is not always optimal and cannot
    accurately adapt performance in diverse execution environments and also imposes
    extra efforts on the application developer or middleware for deciding on partitioning.
    Hence, design time partitioning approaches are likely become obsolete. TABLE III
    Comparison Between Traditional and Cloud-Based Computing Resource. Runtime Analysis
    Runtime or dynamic partitioning referred to methods such as [25], [104] that aims
    to answer four questions at runtime. They identify and partition the resource-hungry
    parts of the application, specify how and where to execute the partitioned components
    [103], [105], and determine how to communicate with the server. In dynamic methods,
    resource requirement of the application is analyzed and available resources are
    detected to decide if the application requires remote resources. Upon decision
    making the system performs offloading. Further monitoring is necessary to gather
    knowledge of available remote resources to maintain execution history. Although
    these approaches provide dynamic and flexible solutions, large amount of resources
    are wasted at runtime that prolongs application execution and decrease energy
    efficiency. Hybrid Analysis The ultimate aim of hybrid approaches [106] is to
    increase performance and efficiency of augmentation methods. Deciding on how to
    perform the offloading mainly depends on the native resources, remote resources,
    and available network bandwidth. In [106], prior to the application execution,
    the system decides based on four options, namely i) no action, ii) dynamic, iii)
    static, and iv) profile only whether to offload or not and in case of offloading
    specify what type of partitioning should take place. The profile only option is
    similar to the no action, but the systems collect execution information to maintain
    execution history for future purpose. • Remote Storage Remote storage is the process
    of expanding storage capability of mobile devices using remote storage resources.
    It enables maintaining applications and data outside the mobile devices and provides
    remote access to them. In early efforts, researchers in [98] utilize iSCSI (Internet
    Small Computer System Interface) [107] —as a well-established protocol for remote
    storage —to access the server''s I/O resources via mobile clients over the TCP/IP
    network to store, backup, and mirror data [108]. However, the throughput of iSCSI
    is highly affected by the mobile-server distance. Using iSCSI is also difficult
    for handling large files such as multimedia and database files. Moreover, due
    to message passing in wireless medium through TCP/IP, the security and processing
    overhead (e.g., cryptography and data compression) are further challenges. To
    alleviate these challenges, several researches as MiSC [109], UbiqStor [110],
    [111], and Intermediate Target [112] are proposed towards realizing remote storage
    on mobile devices. However, due to scalability, availability, performance, and
    efficiency issues of traditional servers, power of remote storage could not fully
    unleash using traditional servers. Several proposals and data storage services
    in academia and industry aim to expand mobile storage by exploiting cloud computing,
    especially Jupiter [31], SmartBox [113], Amazon S310, Mozy11, Google Docs12 and
    DropBox13. For instance, Jupiter expands smartphone storage and assists end-users
    in organizing large applications and data. Jupiter leverages cloud infrastructures
    to store big data of mobile users. Heavy applications are executed inside the
    cloud''s VM of smartphones and results are forwarded to the physical device after
    execution. Amazon S3 is a general purpose storage offering simple operations to
    store and retrieve cloud data while Mozy provides data backup facilities with
    main focus on enhancing cloud data safety against natural disasters. • Resource-Aware
    Computing In resource-aware computing efforts, especially [100], [101], [114]–[116],
    resource requirements of mobile applications are diminished utilizing the application-level
    resource management methods (using application management software such as compiler
    and OS) and lightweight protocols. Resource conservation is performed via efficient
    selection of available execution approaches and technologies [115]. Any mobile
    application consists of application-level resource management method is considered
    as a resource-aware application. For instance, in [101], authors propose an energy-friendly
    scheme for content-based image retrieval applications using three offloading options,
    namely i) local extraction-remote search, ii) remote extraction-remote search,
    and iii) remote extraction-local search. The authors consider available bandwidth,
    image database size, and number of user queries to opt any of three offloading
    options for saving energy. In a high bandwidth network with limited queries, the
    third option is beneficial; the system uploads all un-indexed images to the remote
    server and receives the results to be loaded into the memory. Then, all search
    queries are executed locally. Similarly, applications can decide whether to choose
    2G or 3G in telephony and FTP. Using 2G network for telephony and 3G for FTP can
    noticeably reduce resource requirements of the mobile applications, according
    to the power consumption patterns presented in [117]. 2G network technology consumes
    less energy for establishing a telephony communication, while 3G is more energy-friendly
    for file transfer transactions. • Fidelity adaptation Fidelity adaptation is an
    alternative solution to augment mobile devices in the absence of remote resources
    and online connectivity. In this method local resources are conserved by decreasing
    quality of application execution, which is unlikely desirable to end-users. As
    a well-known fidelity adaptation approach, we can refer to the YouTube14. Users
    in YouTube can adjust the streaming quality based on available bandwidth. To achieve
    optimized performance, researchers [79], [118] leverage composition of cyber foraging
    and fidelity adaptation. • Multi-tier Programming Developing distributed multi-tier
    mobile applications leveraging remote infrastructures is another technique employed
    in efforts such as [36], [45], [46], [119] to reduce resource requirements of
    mobile applications. The main idea in this type of mobile applications is to reduce
    the client-side computing workload and develop the applications with less native
    resource requirements. Certainly, the computationally intensive components of
    the applications are executed outside the device, whereas the interactive (user
    interface) and native codes (e.g., accessing to the device camera) remain inside
    the device for execution. Multi-tier applications are lightweight aiming to consume
    the least possible local resources by utilizing remote components and services,
    whereas native applications are monolithic applications often require runtime
    migration for execution. Therefore, monitoring time and communication overhead
    of multi-tier applications are shrunk leading to explicit resource saving and
    user experience enhancement. • Live Cloud Streaming In recent efforts to harness
    cloud resources, researchers from Onlive15 and Gaikai16, among other organizations
    introduce new approach to augment computing capabilities of mobile devices, entitled
    live cloud streaming [99]. In live cloud streaming approaches, mobile device acts
    as a dump client able to interact with server using a browser or application GUI.
    In live cloud streaming applications, entire processing take place in the cloud
    and results are streaming to the mobile devices. However, usability of cloud-streaming
    is hindered by latency, network bandwidth, portability, and network traffic cost.
    Functionality of cloud-streaming applications absolutely depends on the network
    availability and the Internet. Transferring mobile-user input to the server is
    another critical factor that requires considerable attention under wireless Internet
    connection. Moreover, since majority of mobile network providers deploy ‘pay-as-you-use’
    data plans, the large data traffic of cloud-streaming services imposes high communication
    cost on users. Yet congestion handling remains an open issue at peak hours. Entirely
    relying on cloud-streaming infrastructures and avoiding smartphones resources’
    utilization impact on application responsiveness and levy extravagant ownership,
    maintenance, power, and networking expenses to the cloud-streaming service providers,
    which is not a green computing approach. SECTION III. Impacts of CMA on Mobile
    Computing This Section discusses the advantages and disadvantages of performing
    a CMA process on mobile computing that are summarized in Table IV. We aim to demonstrate
    how CMA approaches mitigate deficiencies of mobile computing explained in Section
    II-B. In this Section the terms ‘cloud resources’ and ‘cloud infrastructures’
    refer to any type of cloud-based resources and infrastructures discussed in Section
    V. A. Advantages In this part, eight major benefits of utilizing cloud resources
    in mobile augmentation processes are introduced. 1) Empowered Processing Empowering
    processing is the state of virtually increased transaction execution per second
    and extended main memory leveraging CMA approaches. In computing-intensive mobile
    applications, the hosting device either does not have enough processing power
    and memory or cannot provide required energy. A common solution is to offload
    the application —in whole or part —to a reliable, powerful resource with least
    energy and time cost. In computation offloading, the complex, CPU- and memory-intensive
    components of a standalone application are migrated to the cloud. Consequently,
    the mobile devices can virtually perform and actually deliver the results of heavy
    transactions beyond their native capabilities. Although surrogates in traditional
    augmentation approaches [8]–[10], [12] could increase computing capabilities of
    mobile devices, excessive overhead of arbitrary service interruption and denial
    could shadow augmentation benefits [19], [120]. Cloud resources guarantee highest
    possible resource availability and reliability. Leveraging CMA approaches, application
    developers build mobile application with no consideration on available native
    resources of mobile devices and mobile users dismiss their devices'' inabilities.
    Hence, computing-and memory-intensive mobile applications like content-based image
    retrieval applications (enable mobile users to retrieve an image from the database)
    can be executed on smartphones without excess efforts. However, a flexible and
    generic CMA approach that can enhance plethora of mobile devices with least configuration,
    processing overhead, and latency is a vital need in excessively diverse mobile
    computing domain. Such diversity is mainly due to the rapid development of smartphones
    and Tablets, and sharp rise in their hardware, platform, API, feature, and network
    heterogeneity [121] in the absence of early standardization. 2) Prolonged Battery
    Long-lasting battery can be considered as one the most significant achievements
    of CMA approaches for large number of mobile users. Smartphone manufacturers have
    already utilized high speed, multi-core ARM processors (e.g., Cortex-A57 Processor17)
    being able to perform daily computing needs of mobile end-users. However, such
    giant processing entities consume large energy and quickly drain the battery that
    irks end-users. CMA solutions can noticeably save energy [96] by migrating heavy
    and energy-intensive computing to the cloud for execution. Although energy efficiency
    is one of the most important challenges of current CMA systems, several efforts
    such as [53]–[55], [122] are endeavoring to comprehend the energy implications
    of exploiting cloud-based resources from mobile devices and shrinking their energy
    overhead. In traditional cyber foraging or surrogate computing approaches, energy
    is saved by computation offloading, but several issues such as lack of mobility
    support and resource elasticity can neutralize the benefits of energy-hungry task
    offloading. 3) Expanded Storage Infinite cloud storage accessible from smartphones
    enables users to utilize large number of applications and digital data on device.
    Hence, they are not obliged to frequently install and remove popular applications
    and data due to the space limit. Online connectivity is essential to access cloud
    storage. In such online storage systems, data are manually or automatically updated
    to the online storage for maintaining the consistency of the online storage system.
    Storing applications in cloud storage provides the opportunity to update the code
    without consuming any mobile I/O transactions which enhances user experience and
    improves the smartphones'' energy efficiency —because I/O transactions are energy-hungry
    tasks. 4) Increased Data Safety CMA efforts can bring the benefit of data safety
    to the mobile users. Naturally, stored data on mobile devices are susceptible
    to loss, robbery, physical damage, and device malfunction. Storing sensitive and
    personal data such as online banking information, online credentials, and customer
    related information on such a risky storage significantly degrades the quality
    of user experience and hinders usability of mobile devices. Due to the scarce
    computing resources, especially energy in mobile devices, performing complex and
    secure encryption provisions is not feasible. Hence, by storing data in a reliable
    cloud storage [113], [123], users ensure data availability and safety regardless
    of time, place, and unforeseen mishaps. Threats such as device robbery or physical
    damage to the mobile devices will effect on the tangible value of the device rather
    than intangible value of the data. 5) Ubiquitous Data Access and Content Sharing
    Cloud infrastructures play a vital role in enhancing data access quality. Storing
    data in cloud resources enables mobile users to access their digital contents
    anytime, anywhere, from any device. Hence, the impact of temporal, geographical,
    and physical differences is noticeably decreased that enriches user experience.
    Moreover, cloud storages facilitate data sharing and contribution among authorized
    users. Every file and folder in cloud, usually has a protected unique access link
    that can be obtained by the owner to share them among legitimate users. Network
    traffic is hence, shrunk because data is accumulated in a central server accessible
    to unlimited users from various machines. Cloud can significantly enhance data
    transfer among different mobile devices. One of the most irksome user''s impediments
    is to transfer data from current mobile device to a new handset. Apart from its
    temporal cost, porting data from one device to another, especially to a heterogeneous
    device is a risky practice that puts data is in the risk of corruption and loss
    of integrity. Stored data on Cloud remain safe and can be synchronized to any
    number of mobile devices with minimum risk. However, a reliable data access control
    mechanism is required to adjust user permissions. 6) Protected Offloaded Content
    Cloud storage solutions aim to protect remote codes and data while ensure user''s
    privacy. This is one of the most important gains of replacing surrogates with
    cloud resources. Cloud servers deploy virtualization technology to isolate the
    guest environment from other guests and also from their permanent software stack.
    Moreover, cloud vendors deploy strict security and privacy policies to not only
    ensure confidentiality of user content, but also to protect their properties and
    business. Implement internal security provisions particularly the state-of-the-art
    biometric security systems to protect their physical infrastructures and avoid
    unauthorized access. Employing complex content encryption, frequent patching,
    and continuous virus signature update inside the company premise or seeking technical
    services from a trusted third party [124] are other examples of security provisions
    undertaken in cloud to further protect cloud storage. 7) Enriched User Interface
    As described in part II-B4, visualization shortcomings of mobile devices diminish
    user experience and hinder smartphones'' usability. However, cloud resources can
    be exploited to perform intensive 2D or 3D screen rendering. The final screen
    image can be prepared based on the smartphone screen size and streamed to the
    device. Consequently, screen adaptation also is achieved when cloud side processing
    engine automatically alter the presentation technique to match screen image with
    the device screen size. TABLE IV Impact of CMA Approaches in Mobile Computing.
    8) Enhanced Application Generation Cloud resources and cloud-based application
    development frameworks similar to µCloud and CMH, facilitate application generations
    in heterogeneous mobile environment. Once a cloud component is built, it can be
    utilized to develop various distributed mobile applications for large number of
    dissimilar mobile devices. In the presence of cloud components, application programmer
    needs to develop native mobile components and integrate them with relevant, prefabricated
    cloud components to develop a complex application. When a mobile-cloud application
    is developed for Android device, by slightly changing native components the application
    is transited to new OS like iOS18 and Syrnbian19 which significantly save time
    and money. B. Disadvantages Despite of many advantageous aspects of cloud services,
    their success is hindered by several drawbacks and shortcomings that are discussed
    as follows. 1) Dependency to High Performance Networking Infrastructure CMA approaches
    demand converged wired and wireless networking infrastructures and technologies
    to fulfill intersystem communication requirements. In wireless domain, CMAs need
    high performance, robust, reliable, high bandwidth wireless communication to realize
    the vision of computing anywhere, anytime, from any-device. In wired communication,
    fast reliable communications ground is essential to facilitate live migration
    of heavy data and computations to a regional cloud-based resources near the mobile
    users. Efforts such as next generation wireless networks [125] and the open mobile
    infrastructure [126] with Open Wireless Architecture (OWA) by Sieneon [127] contribute
    toward enhancing the networking infrastructures'' performance in MCC. 2) Excessive
    Communication Overhead and Traffic Mobile data traffic is significantly growing
    by ever-increasing mobile user demands for exploiting cloud-based computational
    resources. Data storage/retrieval, application offioading, and live VM migration
    are example of CMA operations that drastically increase traffic leading to excessive
    congestion and packet loss. Thus, managing such overwhelming traffic and congestion
    via wireless medium becomes challenging, especially when offioading mobile data
    are distributed among helping nodes to commute to/from the cloud. Consequently,
    application functionality and performance decrease leading to user experience
    degradation. 3) Unauthorized Access to Offloaded Data Since cloud clients have
    no control over their remote data, users contents are in risk of being accessed
    and altered by unauthorized parties. Migrating sensitive codes as well as financial
    and enterprise data to publicly accessible cloud resources decreases users privacy,
    especially enterprise users. Moreover, storing business data in the cloud is likely
    increasing the chance of leakage to the competitor firm. Hence, users, especially
    enterprise users hesitate to leverage cloud services to augment their smartphones.
    4) Application Development Complexity The excessive complexity created by the
    heterogeneous cloud environment increases environment''s dynamism and complicates
    mobile application development. Mobile application developers are required to
    acquire extensive knowledge of cloud platforms (i.e., cloud OSs, programming languages,
    and data structures) to integrate cloud infrastructures to the plethora of mobile
    devices. Understanding and alleviating such complexity impose temporal and financial
    costs on application developers and decrease success of CMA-based mobile applications.
    5) Paid Infrastructures Unlike the free surrogate resources, utilizing cloud infrastructure
    levies financial charges to the end-users. Mobile users pay for consumed infrastructures
    according to the SLA negotiated with cloud vendor. In certain scenarios, users
    prefer local execution or application termination because of monetary cloud infrastructures
    cost. However, user payment is an incentive for cloud vendors to maintain their
    services and deliver reliable, robust, and secure services to the mobile users.
    In addition, cloud vendors often charge mobile users twice; once for offioading
    contents to the cloud and once again when users decide to transfer their cloud
    data to another cloud vendors to utilize more appropriate service (e.g., monetary
    and QoS (Quality of Service) aspects). 6) Inconsistent Cloud Policies and Restrictions
    One of the challenges in utilizing cloud resources for augmenting mobile devices
    is the possibility of changes in policies and restrictions imposed by the cloud
    vendors. Cloud service providers apply certain policies to restrain service quality
    to a desired level by applying specific limitations via their intermediate applications
    like Google App Engine bulk Ioader20. Services are controlled and balanced while
    accurate bills will be provided based on utilized resources. Fig. 4. Taxonomy
    of Cloud-based Computing Resources. Show All Also, service provisioning, controlling,
    balancing, and billing are often matched with the requirements of desktop clients
    rather than mobile users [128]. Considering the great differences in wired and
    wireless communications, disregarding mobility and resource limitations of mobile
    users in design and maintenance of cloud can significantly impact on feasibility
    of CMA approaches. Hence, it is essential to amend restriction rules and policies
    to meet MCC users requirements and realize intense mobile computing on the go.
    7) Service Negotiation and Control While cloud users are required to negotiate
    and comply with the cloud terms and conditions for a certain period of time, often
    cloud agreements are nonnegotiable and policies might change over the time. Moreover,
    there is no control over the cloud performance and commitments in the absence
    of a controlling authority or a trusted third party. Hence, CMA services are always
    volatile to the service quality of cloud vendors. SECTION IV. Taxonomy Of Cloud-based
    Computing Resources Researchers [24]–[27], [27]–[35]–[43], [45]–[49] aim to obtain
    user requirements and preferences by exploiting varied types of cloud-based resources
    to augment computing capabilities of resource-constraint smartphones. Based on
    the distance and mobility traits of such varied cloud-based computing resources,
    we classify them into four groups, namely distant immobile clouds, proximate immobile
    computing entities, proximate mobile computing entities, and hybrid that are taxonomized
    in Figure 4 and explained as follows. Table V represents the comparison results
    of these cloud-based computing resources. This Table can be utilized as a guideline
    for appropriate selection of cloud-based infrastructures in future CMA researches.
    A. Distant Immobile Clouds Public and private clouds comprised of large number
    of stationary servers located in vendors or enterprises premises are classified
    in this category. They are highly available, scalable, and elastic resources that
    are often located far from the mobile nodes accessible via the Internet. Although
    public cloud resources are likely more secure compared to the other types of resources
    due to complex security provisions and on-premise infrastructures [129]–[132],
    they are vulnerable to security attacks and breaches like Amazon EC2 crash [93]
    and Microsoft Azure security glitch [133]. Accessing cloud resources, especially
    public clouds often carries the risk of communicating through the risky channel
    of Internet. However, giant clouds are endeavoring to maintain security-for more
    market share- and could establish high reputation-based trust by providing long-term
    services to the users. Additionally, the performance and efficacy of these approaches
    are affected by long WAN latency due to the long distance between mobile client
    and stationary cloud data centers. One potential approach to shorten the distance
    between mobile device and cloud is to migrate the remote code and data to the
    computing resources near to the mobile device via live migration of the VM from
    the cloud [134]. However, live migration of VM is a non-trivial task that requires
    great deal of research and development, particularly in networking environment
    due to several issues such as large VM size, hard-to-predict user mobility pattern,
    and limited, intermittent wireless bandwidth. Resource utilization is enhanced
    in clouds due to the virtualization technology deployment. Several VMs can be
    executed on a single host to increase the utilization efficiency of the clouds,
    while each computation task runs on a single isolated VM loaded on a physical
    machine. However, VM security attacks such as VM hopping and VM escape [135] can
    violate the code and data security. VM hopping is a virtualization threat to exploit
    a VM as a client and attack other VM(s) on the same host. VM escape is the state
    of compromising the security of the hypervisor and control all the VMs. TABLE
    V Comparison of Cloud-Based Servers. B. Proximate Immobile Computing Entities
    The second type of cloud-based computing resources involves stationary computers
    located in the public places near the mobile nodes. The number of computers in
    public places such as shopping malls, cinema halls, airports, and coffee shops
    is rapidly increasing. These machines are hardly performing tense computational
    tasks and are mostly playing music, showing advertisement, or performing lightweight
    applications. Moreover, they are connected to the power socket and wired Internet.
    Therefore, it is feasible to leverage such abundant resources in vicinity and
    perform extensive computation on behalf of resource-constraint mobile devices.
    It can also reduce latency and wireless network traffic while increases resource
    utilization toward green computing. Another group of proximate immobile computers
    are Mobile Network Operators (MNO) and their authorized dealers scattered in urban
    and rural areas, private clouds, and public computing kiosk [136] that can be
    exploited in smartphone augmentation. However, protecting security and privacy
    of mobile user and computer owner hinder utilization of such nearby resources.
    Several shortcomings such as insufficient on-premise security infrastructure,
    lack of tight security mechanisms, and inefficient update and maintenance procedures
    inhibit utilizing such resources (except MNOs) for CMA approaches. Owners of these
    resources may attack mobile users and access their private data on the mobile
    devices or falsify offloading results. Also, malicious users may leverage these
    resources as an attacking point to violate mobile users'' security and privacy.
    On the other hand, security and privacy of resource owners are also susceptible
    to violation. Owners of computer devices participating in resource sharing require
    robust mechanisms to protect and isolate the guest code and data from their host
    applications and data. Virtualization aims to realize such isolation mechanism,
    but issues such as VM hopping and VM escape require to be addressed before its
    successful adoption [135]. Among all proximate immobile resources, MNOs may be
    considered unique in terms of security and privacy features. MNOs, in general,
    have been serving mobile users for long time and could establish high degree of
    trust among mobile users. It is feasible to assume that MNO''s certified dealers
    also can inherit MNO''s trust if central management and monitoring process is
    undertaken by MNOs [46]. C. Proximate Mobile Computing Entities In this category
    of cloud-based infrastructures, various mobile devices, particularly smartphones,
    Tablets, notebooks, wearable computers, and handheld computing devices play the
    role of servers based on cloud computing principles. The main benefit of utilizing
    nearby mobile resources is their proximity to the mobile clients. Also, hardware
    and platform heterogeneity [51] between mobile servers and clients can be mitigated,
    because both sides are mainly ARM-based devices with mobile OSs. Moreover, contemporary
    smartphones are able to provide value added context-and social-aware services
    [137], [138] that contribute to the context-awareness of mobile applications.
    However, mobile devices'' resources are limited and they are unable to perform
    intensive context-computing [139]. Realizing distributed computing on cluster
    of nearby mobile devices requires several issues, particularly application architectures,
    resource scheduling, and mobility to be addressed. Fig. 5. The Hybrid Cloud Concept
    for MCC. Show All Moreover, security and privacy of mobile devices as a service
    provider is a critical concern in CMA. Mobile devices are intrinsically susceptible
    to loss and robbery, and their constraint resources inhibit exploiting robust
    security mechanisms inside the device. Furthermore, with ever-increasing popularity
    of mobile Apps (i.e., mobile applications) in online App stores such as Google
    Play21 and Samsung APPS22 [140] number of mobile security threats are rising sharply
    and malware-contaminated Apps are becoming serious threats to the mobile users
    [141]. Several security threats have been identified in an experiment of Android
    mobile applications with the potential to violate the security of mobile users
    [142]. Risk of such contaminated codes can likely be transferred to the non-contaminated
    mobile devices by utilizing their computation resources and request for results
    of a remote computation. Hence, establishing trust between mobile devices and
    end-users becomes a challenging task. D. Hybrid (Converged Proximate and Distant
    Computing Entities) Hybrid infrastructures as depicted in Figure 5 are comprised
    of various proximate and distant computing nodes, either mobile or immobile. The
    main idea behind building hybrid resources is to employ heterogeneous computing
    resources to create a balance between user requirements (mainly latency and computation
    power) and available options [143]. The latency sensitive codes are offioaded
    to the nearest computing device(s) whereas the most intensive and least latency
    sensitive tasks are migrated to the furthest resources. Perhaps, the utilization
    costs of nearby resources are more than the remote servers. Beneficial characteristics
    of hybrid resources summarized in Table V advocates their usefulness in maximizing
    the augmentation benefits. However, deployment, management, and resource scheduling
    processes in dynamic mobile environment are non-trivial tasks. Developing an autonomic
    management system similar to CometCloud [144] in cloud computing and MAPCloud
    [143] in MCC to automatically manage, optimize, and adapt hybrid infrastructures
    in the cloud-mobile applications can significantly improve the quality of hybrid
    CMA approaches. Hybrid cloud infrastructures can deliver enhanced security and
    privacy features to the CMA approaches and increase the QoS. Hybrid clouds are
    comprised of resources with varied security, privacy, and trust features which
    can be efficiently utilized by CMA and mobile users as a trade-off. For instance,
    security sensitive computations can perform a security-latency trade-off and execute
    computation inside a secure distant cloud. SECTION V. The State-of-the-art CMA
    Approaches: Taxonomy Cloud-based Mobile Augmentation (CMA) is the-state-of-the-art
    mobile augmentation model that leverages cloud computing technologies and principles
    to increase, enhance, and optimize computing capabilities of mobile devices by
    executing resource-intensive mobile application components in the resource-rich
    cloud-based resources. According to our resource classifications in previous Section,
    we analyze and taxonomize the state-of-the-art CMA approaches into four models,
    namely distant fixed, proximate fixed, proximate mobile, and hybrid which are
    depicted in Figure 6. For each model, we describe few CMA efforts and tabulate
    the comparison results in Figure 10. A. Distant Fixed Majority of CMA approaches
    [25], [27], [29], [31], [33]–[35], [41], [43], [44], [54], [145] leverage fixed
    cloud infrastructures in distance due to its straightforward approach. Utilizing
    stationary cloud eliminates several management complexities (e.g., resource discovery
    and scheduling for mobile cloud-based servers) and alleviates reliability and
    security concerns [18]. Works in this class of CMA systems aim at reducing the
    complexity and overhead of utilizing distant cloud. For instance, in [54] authors
    propose an energy-efficient offline job scheduling model based on makespan minimization
    model to enhance energy efficiency of distant fixed CMA systems. Their main notion
    is to separate the data transmission from the job execution. During their work,
    authors provide several optimization solutions aiming to reduce the energy consumption
    of the device during the offloading process. However, for the sake of simplicity,
    the authors study the energy consumption of tasks in offline mode only which does
    not consider runtime dynamism of MCC. Fig. 6. Taxonomy of State-of-the-art CMA
    Models. Show All Exploiting cloud resources is feasible in several real scenarios
    such as live cloud streaming [99], enterprise applications (e.g., Customer Relation
    Management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning [146]), and Social Networking.
    Cloud streaming mechanism has already described in II-C as an example of utilizing
    distance fixed resources. In [146], researchers leverage cloud resources in developing
    a CRM application to enhance efficiency of sale representatives for a pharmaceutical
    company. The representative meets the physician in medical centers to promote
    drugs, present samples and promotions material, and he records all sale results
    and details through the mobile application. The huge database of the company is
    stored inside the cloud and the sale representative can request to process, get,
    or update data in database without storing data locally. We describe some of the
    distant fixed CMA approaches that utilize distant fixed cloud resources for mobile
    augmentation as follows. The terms immobile, fixed, and stationary are interchangeably
    used with the same notion. CloneCloud: [34] is a cloud-based, fine-grained, thread-level,
    application partitioner and execution runtime that clones entire mobile platform
    into the cloud VM and runs the mobile application inside the VM without performing
    any change in the application code. The CloneCloud enables local execution of
    remaining mobile application when remote server is running the intensive components
    unless local execution tries to accessing the shared memory state. Cloud resources
    in this effort simulate distributed execution of a monolithic application in a
    resourceful environment without engaging application developer into the distributed
    application programming domain. CloneCloud can significantly reduce the overall
    execution time using thread-level migration. When the local execution reaches
    the intensive component(s), the CloneCloud system offloads the component(s) to
    the cloud and continues local execution until the application fetches data from
    the migrated state. The local execution is paused until the results are returned
    and integrated to the local application. However, the communication overhead of
    transferring the clone of mobile platform, application, and memory state and frequent
    synchronization of the shared data between the mobile and cloud can shrink the
    power of cloud. Such overhead becomes more intense in case of heavy, data- and
    communication-intensive, and tightly coupled mobile applications where an alternative
    execution of resource- intensive and lightweight components exists. Frequent code
    and data encapsulation and migration, and mobile-cloud data synchronization excessively
    increase the communication traffic and impact on execution time and energy efficiency
    of the offloading. Elastic Application: Elastic application model [33] is a CMA
    proposal that leverages distant fixed cloud data center for executing resource-intensive
    components of the mobile application. Authors in this model partition a mobile
    application into several small components, called weblet. Weblets are created
    with least dependency to each other to increase system robustness while decrease
    the communication overhead and latency. The weblet execution is dynamically configured
    to either perform locally or remotely, based on the weblet''s resource intensity,
    execution environment quality, and offloading objectives. The distinctive attribute
    of this proposal is that application execution can be distributed among more than
    one machine and cooperative results can be pushed back to the device. To achieve
    such goal, multiple elasticity patterns namely replication, splitter, and aggregator
    are defined. In replication pattern, multiple replicas of a single interface are
    executed on multiple machines inside the cloud. Hence, failure in one replica
    will not compromise the system performance. In splitter pattern, the interface
    and implementation are separated so that several weblets with varied implementations
    can share a single interface. In aggregator, the results of multiple weblets are
    aggregated and pushed to the device for optimized accuracy and efficacy. The authors
    endeavor to specify the execution configurations (specifying where to run the
    weblets) at runtime to match the requirements of the applications and users. To
    enhance the overall execution performance and enrich user experience, the system
    is able to run the weblets both locally and remotely. A weblet can be executed
    remotely in a low-end device while the same can be executed locally on a high-end
    device. Elastic application model pays more attention to the user preferences
    by enabling different running modes of a single application (e.g., high speed,
    low cost, offline mode). Although weblet characteristics are mainly inherited
    from the well-known web services, determining weblets organization based on the
    functionality, resource requirements, and data dependency impose burden on programmers.
    Virtual Execution Environment(VEE): Hung et al. [28] propose a cloud-based execution
    framework to offload and execute the intensive Android mobile applications inside
    the distant cloud''s virtual execution environment. The quality and accuracy of
    execution environment is highly influenced by the comprehensiveness and accuracy
    of emulated platform. This method uses a software agent in both mobile and cloud
    sides to facilitate the overall system management. The agent in mobile device
    initiates VM creation and clones the entire application (even native codes and
    UI components) and partial data/memory state from device to the cloud. Unlike
    CloneCloud, VEE aims to reduce latency by migrating the segment of data stack
    explicitly created and owned by the application to the VM instead of copying the
    entire memory; cloning the entire memory state, especially for heavy applications
    significantly increases latency and traffic. During remote execution, the system
    frequently synchronizes the changes between device and cloud to keep both copies
    updated. In order to increase the quality and efficiency of remote execution in
    virtual environment and avoid data input loss at application suspension stages,
    the system stores input events (reading a file, capturing a face, storing a voice)
    exploiting a record/replay scheme and pseudo checkpoint methods. However, these
    methods engage application developers to separate the application state into two
    states, namely global and local, and to specify the global data structures. The
    global state contains the program domain and application flow, whereas the local
    state contains local data structures required by a method. Programmer usually
    needs to identify global state when the application is paused. Once the application
    is suspended, the global state will be loaded to avoid re-execution and the latest
    Android checkpoint is applied to the system to reflect all the changes made from
    the last checkpoint. However, all changes, especially user input might be lost
    from the last checkpoint. To record the changes after the last checkpoint, the
    record/replay mechanism is deployed by creating a pseudo checkpoint. To create
    a pseudo checkpoint, the application notifies the local agent to identify the
    input events and record required information. Upon the application resumption,
    the pseudo checkpoint is restored to restore the application to the state prior
    to the suspension. In this effort, code security inside the cloud is enhanced
    by exploiting encryption and isolation approaches that protects offloaded code
    from cloud vendors eavesdropping. Using a probabilistic communication QoS technique,
    the authors aim to provide a communication-QoS trade-off. For instance, the control
    data (usually small volume) needs highest accuracy while video streaming data
    (often large volume) requires less communication accuracy. Moreover, the authors
    are optimistic that offering secondary tasks such as automatic virus scanning,
    data backup, and file sharing in the virtual environment can enhance quality of
    user experience. Although this approach aims to enhance the quality of application
    execution and augment computation capability of mobile clients and save energy,
    but responsiveness in interactive applications are likely low due to remote UI
    execution. Instead of migrating entire application to the cloud, it might be more
    beneficial to utilize some of the local mobile resources instead of treating mobile
    device as a dump client. Data passing between mobile device and cloud for interactive
    applications might degrade quality of experience, especially in low-bandwidth,
    intermittent networks. Virtualized Screen: Virtualized screen [42] is another
    example of CMA approaches that aims to move the screen rendering process to the
    cloud and deliver the rendered screen as an image to the mobile device. The authors
    aim to enrich the user experience by migrating the screen rendering tasks to the
    cloud with the assumption that majority of computation- and data-intensive processing
    take place in the cloud. Hence, abundant cloud resources'' exploitation simplifies
    the CMA system architecture, prolongs mobile battery, and enhances the interaction
    and responsiveness of mobile applications toward rich user experience. Screen
    virtualization technique (running partial rendering in cloud and rest in mobile
    depending on the execution context) is envisioned to optimize user experience,
    especially for lightweight, high-fidelity, interactive mobile applications that
    entirely run on local resources. Their conceptual proposal aims to enhance visualization
    capability of mobile clients, mitigate the impact of hardware and platform heterogeneity,
    and facilitate porting mobile applications to various devices (e.g., smartphone,
    laptop, and IP TV) with different screens. To reduce the mobile-cloud data transmission,
    a frame-based representation system is exploited to forward the screen updates
    from the cloud to the mobile. Frame-based representation system captures and feeds
    the whole screen image to the transmission unit. This approach updates each frame
    based on the previous frame stored inside both the mobile and cloud. However,
    a rich interactive, responsive GUI needs live streaming of screen images which
    is impacted by communication latency. Although the authors describe optimized
    screen transmission approaches to reduce the traffic, the impact of computation
    and communication latency is not yet clear, as this is a preliminary proposal.
    Moreover, utilizing virtualized screen method for developing lightweight mobile-cloud
    application is a non-trivial task in the absence of its programming API. Cloud-Mobile
    Hybrid (CMH) Application: Unlike application offloading solutions, authors in
    this proposal [32] introduce a new approach of utilizing cloud resources for mobile
    users. In this effort, the authors propose a novel CMH application model, in which
    heavy components are developed for cloud-side execution, whereas lightweight or
    native codes are developed for mobile devices execution. CMH Applications execution
    does not need profiling, partitioning, and offloading processes and hence produce
    least computation overhead on mobile devices. Upon successful cloud-side execution,
    the results are returned back to the mobile for integrating to the native mobile
    components. However, developing CMH applications is significantly complex due
    to the interoperability and vendor lock-in problems in clouds and fragmentation
    issue in mobiles [51]. Cloud components designed for a specific cloud are not
    able to move to another cloud due to underlying heterogeneity among clouds. Similarly,
    mobile components developed for a particular platform cannot be ported to different
    platforms because of heterogeneity. Yet isolating development of mobile and cloud
    components creates further versioning and integration challenges. To mitigate
    the complexity of CMH application developments and facilitate portability, the
    authors leverage Domain Specific Language (DSL) [147], [148]. A DSL is a programming
    language with major focus on solving problem in specific domains. MATLAB23 is
    a well-known DSL-based tool for mathematicians. A parser takes a DSL script and
    converts codes into an in-memory object to be forwarded to various automatic component
    generators. The system needs different code generators for various mobile and
    cloud platforms. Once the mobile and cloud components are generated, the CMH application
    can be assembled for various mobile-cloud platforms. However, utilizing DSL-based
    techniques requires more generalization efforts to be beneficial in developing
    all types of CMH applications. μ Cloud: Similar to the CMH framework, μ Cloud
    [36] is a modular, mobile-cloud application framework that aims to facilitate
    mobile-cloud application generation, promote application portability, minimize
    the development complexity, and enhance offline usability in intensive mobile-cloud
    applications. Fulfilling separation of concerns vision, skilled programmers independently
    develop self-contained components which do not have any direct inter communications
    with each other. Unskilled mobile users can mash-up (assembling available components
    to build complex application) these prefabricated components to generate a complex
    mobile-cloud application. Cloud vendors provide infrastructure and platform as
    cloud services to run prefabricated cloud components. The main idea in this proposal
    is to avoid local execution of the resource-intensive components. Hence, components
    are identified as cloud, mobile, and hybrid; mobile components are executable
    exclusively on mobile and cloud components are strictly developed for cloud server
    while hybrid components can either run locally or remotely. Hybrid components
    have either multiple implementations or a single implementation that need a middleware
    for execution. Each component has a triplet of identifier, input/output parameters,
    and configuration. To alleviate offline usability issue, the authors leverage
    mobile-side queuing and cloud-side caching to maintain data in case of disconnection.
    Data will be transferred upon reconnection. Application is partitioned into components
    and organized as a directed graph. Nodes represent components and vertices indicate
    data/control flow. Application is divided into three fragments; in each fragment,
    a managing unit called orchestrator executes and maintains component''s mash-up
    process. The output of each component is forwarded using the pass-by-value semantic
    as an input to the subsequent component. Unlike elastic application model [33],
    the design and implementation of components in μ . Cloud is statically performed
    in early development phase. Thus, any improvement in resource availability of
    mobile devices or environmental enhancement (like bandwidth growth) will not improve
    the overall execution of µCloud applications. Such inflexibility decreases the
    application execution performance and degrades the quality of user experience.
    SmartBox: Smartbox [113] is a self-management, online, cloud-based storage and
    access management system developed for mobile devices to expand device storage
    and facilitate data access, and sharing. It is a write-once, read many times system
    designed to store personal data such as text, song, video, and movies which is
    not appropriate for large scale computational datasets. In Smartbox, mobile devices
    are associated with a shadow storage to store/retrieve personal data using a unique
    account. To facilitate data sharing among larger group of end-users in office
    or at home, a public storage space is provisioned. Smartbox exploits traditional
    hierarchical namespace for smooth navigation and employs an attribute-based method
    to facilitate data navigation and service query using semantic metadata such as
    the publisher-provider metadata. Data navigation and query using tiny keyboard
    and small screen irk mobile users when inquiring and navigating stored data in
    cloud. Moreover, mobile users need always-on connectivity to access online cloud
    data which is not yet achieved and is unlikely to become reality in near future.
    WhereStore: WhereStore [149] is a location-based data store for cloud-interacting
    mobile devices to replicate necessary cloud-stored mobile data on the phone. The
    main notion in this effort is that users in different places doing various activities
    need dissimilar types of information. For instance, a foreign tourist in Manhattan
    requires information about nearby places of interest rather than all the country.
    Hence, identifying the location and caching predicted data deemed can enhance
    the system efficiency and user experience. However, efficient prediction of future
    user location and required data, and determining the right time for caching data
    are challenging tasks. Wukong Wukong [150] is a cloud-oriented file service for
    varied mobile devices as a user-friendly and highly available file service. The
    authors provision support of heterogeneous back-end services such as FTP, Mail,
    and Google Docs Service in a transparent manner leveraging a Service Abstraction
    Layer (SAL). Wukong enables applications to access cloud data without being downloaded
    into the local storage of mobile device. Authors introduce cache management and
    pre-fetch mechanisms in different scenarios to increase performance while decreasing
    latency. However, it cannot always reduce latency due to the bandwidth limitation
    and I/O overhead. In operations with long gap between open and read, it is beneficial
    to pre-fetch data from cloud to the device that significantly improves user experience.
    Data security is enhanced via an encryption module and bandwidth is saved using
    a compression module. While compression methods utilized in this proposal is inefficient
    for multimedia files like image and music, it can compress text and log files
    noticeably. We conclude that one of the most effective solutions to tackle bandwidth
    and latency limitations in distant-fixed CMA approaches, especially cloud storage
    is to decrease the volume of data using imminent compression methods. While various
    compression methods work well on specific file types, a cognitive or adaptive
    compression method with focus on multimedia files can significantly improve the
    feasibility of cloud-storage systems. B. Proximate Fixed Researchers have recently
    proposed CMA approaches in which nearby stationary computers are utilized. Utilizing
    nearby desktop computers initiates new generation of services to the end-user
    via mobile device. In [26], the authors provide a real scenario in which Ron,
    a patient diagnosed with Alzheimer, receives cognitive assistance using an augmented-reality
    enabled wearable computer. The system consists of a lightweight wearable computer
    and a head-up display such as Google Glass24equipped with a camera to capture
    the environment and an earphone to send the feedback to the patient. The system
    captures the scene and sends the image to the nearby fix computers to interpret
    the scene in the image using the object or face recognition, voice synthesizer,
    and context-awareness algorithms. When Ron looks at a person for few seconds,
    the person''s name and some clue information is whispered in Ron''s ear to help
    greeting with the person. When he looks at his thirsty plant or hungry dog, the
    system reminds Ron to irrigate the plant and feed his dog. The nearby resources
    are core component of this system to provide low-latency real-time processing
    to the patient. In this part, we explain one of the most prominent proximate fixed
    efforts as follows. Cloudlet: Cloudlet [26] is a proximate fixed cloud consists
    of one or several resource-rich, multi-core, Gigabit Ethernet connected computer
    aiming to augment neighboring mobile devices while minimizing security risks,
    offloading distance (one-hop migration from mobile to Cloudlet), and communication
    latency. Mobile device plays the role of a thin client while the intensive computation
    is entirely migrated via Wi-Fi to the nearby Cloudlet. Although Cloudlet utilizes
    proximate resources, the distant fixed cloud infrastructures are also accessible
    as backup in case of Cloudlet scarcity. The authors employ a decentralized, self-managed,
    widely-spread infrastructure built on hardware VM technology. Cloudlet is a VM-based
    offloading system that can significantly shrink the impact of hardware and OS
    heterogeneity between mobile and Cloudlet infrastructures. To reduce the Cloudlet
    management and maintenance costs while increasing security and privacy of both
    Cloudlet host and mobile guest, a method called “transient Cloudlet customization”
    is deployed which uses hardware VM technology. It enables Cloudlet customization
    prior to the offloading and performs Cloudlet restoration as a post-offloading
    cleanup process to restore the host to its original software stake. The VM encapsulates
    the entire offloaded mobile environment (data state and code) and separates it
    from the host permanent software. Hence, feasibility of deploying Cloudlet in
    public places such as coffee shops, airport lounge, and shopping malls increases.
    Unlike CloneCloud and Virtual Execution Environment efforts that migrate the entire
    mobile OS clone to the cloud, Cloudlet assumes that the entire OS clone exists
    and is preloaded in the host and runs on an isolated VM. In mobile side, instead
    of creating the VM of the entire mobile application and its memory stack, the
    systems encapsulates a lightweight software interface of the intensive components
    called VM overlay. Fig. 7. Cloudlet-based Resource-Rich Mobile Computing Life
    Cycle. Show All The VM overall offioading performance is further enhanced by exploiting
    Dynamic VM Synthesis (DVMS) method since its performance solely depends on the
    mobile-Cloudlet bandwidth and cloudlet resources. DVMS assumes that the base VM
    is already available in the target Cloudlet and user can find the matching execution
    environment (VM base) among silo of nearby Cloudlets. Upon discovery and negotiation
    of the Cloudlet, the DVMS offioads the VM overlay to the infrastructure to execute
    launch VM (base + overlay). Henceforth, the offioaded code starts execution in
    the state it was paused. Upon completion of Cloudlet execution the VM residue
    is created and sent back to the mobile device. In the Cloudlet, the VM is discarded
    as a post-offioading cleanup process to restore the original Cloudlet state. In
    mobile side, the results will be integrated to the application and local execution
    will be resumed. To present a clear understanding of the overall process, the
    sequence diagram of Cloudlet-based resource-rich mobile computing is depicted
    in Figure 7. Despite the noticeable offioading improvements in the Cloudlet, its
    success highly depends on the existence of plethora of powerful Cloudlets containing
    popular mobile platforms'' base VM. Encouraging individual owners to deploy such
    Cloudlets in the absence of monetary incentives is an issue that must be addressed
    before successful deployment in real scenarios. Although energy efficiency, security
    and privacy, and maintenance of Cloudlet are widely acceptable, further efforts
    are required to protect the overall CMA process. Moreover, few minutes offioading
    latency in Cloudlet is unacceptable to users [151]. C. Proximate Mobile Recently,
    several researchers [24], [45], [152]–[155] propose CMA approaches in which nearby
    mobile devices lend available resources to other mobile clients for execution
    of resource-intensive tasks in distributed manner. Utilizing such resources can
    enhance user experience in several real scenarios such as Optical Character Recognition
    (OCR) and natural language processing applications. The feasibility of utilizing
    nearby mobile devices is studied in [24] where Peter, a foreign tourist visiting
    a Korean exhibition finds interest in an exhibit, but cannot understand the Korean
    description. He can take a photo of the manuscript and translate it using the
    OCR application, but his device lacks enough computation resources. Although he
    can exploit the Internet web services to translate the text, the roaming cost
    is not affordable to him. Hence, he leverages a CMA solution by utilizing computation
    resources of nearby mobile devices to complete the task. Some of the CMA efforts
    whose remote resources are proximate mobile devices are explained as follows.
    MOMCC: Market-Oriented Mobile Cloud Computing (MOMCC) [45] is a mobile-cloud application
    framework based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that harnesses a cluster
    of nearby mobile devices to run resource-intensive tasks. In MOMCC, mobile-cloud
    applications are developed using prefabricated building blocks called services
    developed by expert programmers. Service developers can independently develop
    various computation services and uploaded them to a publicly accessible UDDI (Universal
    Description Discovery and Integration) such as mobile network operators. Fig.
    8. MOMCC Concept. Show All Services are mostly executed on large number of smart-phones
    in vicinity which can share their computation resources and earn some money. To
    enhance resource availability and elasticity, distant stationary cloud resources
    are also available if nearby resources are insufficient. In order to become an
    laaS (Infrastructure as a Service) provider, mobile devices register with the
    UDDI and negotiate to host certain services after secure authentication and authorization.
    Mobile users at runtime contact UDDI to find appropriate secure host in vicinity
    to execute desired service on payment. The collected revenue is shared between
    service programmer, application developer, UDDI, and service host for promotion
    and encouragement. Figure 8 depicts the MOMCC concept. However, MOMCC is a preliminary
    study and its overall performance is not yet evident. Several issues are required
    to be addressed prior to its successful deployment in real scenarios. Executing
    services on mobile devices is a challenging task considering resource limitation,
    security, and mobility. Also an efficient business plan to satisfy all engaging
    parties in MOMCC is lacking and demand future efforts. MOMCC can provide an income
    source for mobile owners who spend couple of hundred dollars to buy a high-end
    device. In addition, faulty resource-rich mobile devices that are able to function
    accurately can be utilized in MOMCC instead of being e-waste. Hyrax: Hyrax [152]
    is another CMA approach that exploits the resources from a cluster of immobile
    smart-phones in vicinity to perform intense computations. Hyrax alleviates the
    frequent disconnections of mobile servers using fault tolerance mechanism of Hadoop.
    Similar to MOMCC and Cloudlet, due to resource limitations of smartphone servers,
    the accessibility to distant stationary clouds is also provisioned in case the
    nearby smartphone resources are not sufficient. However, Hyrax does not consider
    mobility of mobile clients and mobile servers. Hence, deployment of Hyrax in real
    scenarios may become less realistic due to immobilization of mobile nodes. Lack
    of incentive for mobile servers also hinders Hyrax success. Hyrax is a MCC platform
    developed based on Hadoop [156] for Android smartphones. In developing Hyrax,
    the MapReduce [157] principles are applied utilizing Hadoop as an open source
    implementation of MapReduce. MapReduce is a scalable, fault-tolerant programming
    model developed to process huge dataset over a cluster of resources. Centralized
    server in Hyrax runs two client side processes of MapReduce, namely NameNode and
    JohTracker processes to coordinate the overall computation process on a cluster
    of smartphones. In smart-phone side, two Hadoop processes, namely DataNode and
    TaskTracker are implemented as Android services to receive computation tasks from
    the Job''Iracker. Smart-phones are able to communicate with the server and other
    smartphones via 802.11g technology. Nevertheless, the cloud storage connectivity
    in Hyrax is missing. It demands several gigabytes of local storage to store data
    and computation. Hence, user cannot access distributed data over the Internet
    or Ethernet. The author utilizes the constant historical multimedia data to avoid
    file sharing. Hence, it is less beneficial for interactive and event-oriented
    applications whose data frequently changes over the execution and also data-intensive
    applications that require huge database. The overall overhead in Hyrax is high
    due to the intensity of Hadoop algorithm which runs locally on smartphones. Virtual
    Mobile Cloud Computing (VMCC): Researchers in [24] aim to augment computing capabilities
    of stable mobile devices by leveraging an ad-hoc cluster of nearby smartphones
    to perform intensive computing with minimum latency and network traffic while
    decreasing the impact of hardware and platform heterogeneity. During the first
    execution, required components (proxy creation and RPC support) are added to the
    application code to be used for offloading; the modified code will remain for
    future offloading. For every application, the system determines the number of
    required mobile servers, security and privacy requirements, and offloading overhead.
    The system continuously traces the number of total mobile servers and their geolocation
    to establish a peer-to-peer communication among them. Upon decision making the
    application is partitioned into small codes and transferred to the nearby mobile
    nodes for execution. The results will be reintegrated back upon completion. However,
    several issues encumber VMCC''s success. Firstly, this solution, similar to Hyrax,
    is not suitable for a moving smartphone since the authors explicitly disregard
    mobility trait of mobile clients. Secondly, application code should be available
    for manipulation which is not always feasible. Thirdly, every computing job is
    sent to exactly one mobile node; so, the offloading time and overhead will be
    increased when the serving node leaves the cluster. Fourthly, the offloading initiation
    might take long since the offloading''s overall performance highly depends on
    the number of available nearby nodes; insufficient number of mobile nodes defers
    offloading. Finally, in the absence of monetary incentive for mobile nodes the
    likelihood of resource sharing among resource-constraint mobile devices is low.
    D. Hybrid Hybrid CMA efforts are budding [46], [143], [158] to optimize the overall
    augmentation performance and researchers are endeavoring to seamlessly integrate
    various types of resources to deliver a smooth computing experience to mobile
    end-users. For instance, mCloud [159] is an imminent proposal to integrate proximate
    immobile and distant stationary computing resources. Authors are aiming to enable
    mobile-users to perform resource-intensive computation using hybrid resources
    (integrated cloudlet-cloud infrastructures). Hybrid solutions aim to provide higher
    QoS and richer interaction experience to the mobile end-users of real scenarios
    explained in previous parts. For instance, in the foreign tourist example, the
    image can be sent to the nearby mobile device of a nonnative local resident for
    processing. When the processing fails due to lack of enough resources, the picture
    can be forwarded to the cloud without Peter pays high cost of international roaming
    (Peter may pay local charge). We review some of the available hybrid CMAs as follows.
    SAM: SAMI (Service-based Arbitrated Multi-tier Infrastructure for mobile cloud
    computing) [46] proposes a multi-tier IaaS to execute resource-intensive computations
    and store heavy data on behalf of resource-constraint smartphones. The hybrid
    cloud-based infrastructures of SAMI are combination of distant immobile clouds,
    nearby Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), and cluster of very close MNOs authorized
    dealers depicted in Figure 9. The compound three level infrastructures aim to
    increase the outsourcing flexibility, augmentation performance, and energy efficiency.
    The MNO''s revenue is hiked in this proposal and energy dissipation is prevented.
    Nearby dealers can be reached by Wi-Fi. MNO''s can be accessed either directly
    via cellular connection or through dealers via Wi-Fi and broadband. Connection
    is established via cellular network to contact distant stationary clouds. The
    cluster of nearby stationary machines (MNO dealers located in vicinity) performs
    latency-sensitive services and omits the impact of network heterogeneity. SAMI
    leverages Wi-Fi technology to conserve mobile energy because it consumes less
    energy compared to the cellular networks [117]. In case of nearby resource scarcity
    or end-user mobility, the service can be executed inside the MNO via cellular
    network. However, if the resources in MNO are insufficient, the computation can
    be performed inside the distant immobile cloud. Fig. 9. SAMI: A Multi-Tier Cloud-based
    Infrastructure Model. Show All The resource allocation to the services is undertaken
    by arbitrator entity based on several metrics, particularly resource requirements,
    latency, and security requirements of varied services. The arbitrator frequently
    checks and updates the service allocation decision to ensure high performance
    and avoids mismatch. To enhance security of infrastructures, SAMI employs comparatively
    reliable and trustworthy entities, namely clouds, MNOs, and MNO trusted dealers.
    MNOs have already established reputation-trust among mobile users and can enforce
    a strict security provisions to establish indirect trust between dealers and end
    users ensuring that user''s security and privacy will not be violated. SAMI application
    development framework facilitates deployment of service-based platform-neutral
    mobile applications and eases data interoperability in MCC due to utilization
    of SOA. However, SAMI is a conceptual framework and deployment results are expected
    to advocate its feasibility. SAMI imposes a processing overhead on MNOs due to
    continuous arbitration process. Moreover, though the authors discuss the monetary
    aspects of the proposal, a detailed discussion of the business plan is missing,
    for example in what scenario resource outsourcing is affordable for the mobile
    application? How does income should be divided among different entities to be
    satisfactory? MOCHA: In MOCHA [158] authors propose a mobile-cloudlet-cloud architecture
    for face recognition application using mobile camera and hybrid infrastructures
    of nearby Cloudlet and distant immobile cloud. Cloudlet is a specific, cheap cluster
    of computing entities like GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) capable of massively
    processing data and transactions in parallel. Cloudlets are able to be accessed
    via heterogeneous communication technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular.
    The mobile users often access processing resources via Cloudlet rather than directly
    connecting to the cloud —unless accessing cloud resources bears lower latency.
    Cloudlet receives the smartphones intensive computation tasks and partitions them
    for distribution between itself and distant immobile clouds to enhance QoS [26].
    MOCHA leverages two partitioning algorithms: fixed and greedy. In the fixed algorithm,
    the task is equally partitioned and distributed among all available computing
    devices (including Cloudlet and cloud servers), whereas in greedy algorithm, the
    task is partitioned and distributed among computing devices based on their response
    times; the first partition is sent to the quickest device while the last partition
    is sent to the slowest device. The response time of the task partitioned using
    greedy approach is significantly better than fixed, especially when Cloudlet server
    is utilized in augmentation process and large number of clouds with heterogeneous
    response time exist. However, smartphones in MOCHA require prior knowledge of
    the communication and computation latency of all available computing entities
    (Cloudlet and all available distant fixed clouds) which is a resource-hungry and
    time-consuming task. SECTION VI. CMA Prospectives People dependency to mobile
    devices is rapidly increasing [90], [160] and smartphones have been using in several
    crucial areas, particularly healthcare (tele-surgery), emergency and disaster
    recovery (remote monitoring and sensing), and crowd management to benefit mankind
    [161]–[163]. However, intrinsic mobile resources and current augmentation approaches
    are not matching with the current computing needs of mobile-users, and hence,
    inhibit smartphone''s adoption. Upon slow progress of hardware augmentation, the
    highly feasible solution to fulfill people computing needs is to leverage CMA
    concept. This Section aims to present set of guidelines for efficiency, adaptability,
    and performance of forthcoming CMA solutions. We identify and explain the vital
    decision making factors that significantly enhance quality and adaptability of
    future CMA solutions and describe five major performance limitation factors. We
    illustrate an exemplary decision making flowchart of next generation CMA approaches.
    A. CMA Decision Making Factors These factors can be used to decide whether to
    perform CMA or not and are needed at design and implementation phases of next
    generation CMA approaches. We categorize the factors into five main groups of
    mobile devices, contents, augmentation environment, user preferences and requirements,
    and cloud servers, which are depicted in Figure 11 and explained as follows. 1)
    Mobile Devices From the client perspective, amount of native resources including
    CPU, memory, and storage is the most important factor to perform augmentation.
    Also, energy is considered a critical resource in the absence of long-spanning
    batteries. The trade-off between energy consumed by augmentation and energy squandered
    by communication is a vital proportion in CMA approaches [74]. Device mobility
    and communication ability (supporting varied technologies such as 2G, 3G,Wi-Fi)
    are other metrics that are important in the offloading performance. 2) Contents
    Another influential factor for CMA decision making is the contents'' nature. The
    code granularity and size as well as data type and volume are example attributes
    of contents that highly impact on the overall augmentation process. Hence, the
    augmentation should be performed considering the nature and complexity of application
    and data. For instance, latency sensitive small data are efficient to be processed
    locally, whereas sensitive big data are encouraged to be stored in a large reliable
    cloud storage. Similarly, offloading a coarse-grained, large code to a distant
    fixed cloud via a low bandwidth network is not feasible. 3) Augmentation Environment
    Mobile computing is a hetrogeneous environment comprised of non-uniform mobile
    nodes, communication technologies, and resources. One of the most influential
    environment-dependent factors is the wireless communication medium in which majority
    of communications take place. Wireless is an intermittent, unreliable, risky,
    and blipping medium with significant impact on the quality of augmentation solutions.
    The overall performance of a low cost, highly available, and scalable CMA approach
    is magnificently shrunk by the low quality of communication medium and technologies.
    Selecting the most suitable technology considering the factors like required bandwidth,
    congestion, utilization costs, and latency [164] is a challenge that affects quality
    of augmentation approaches in wireless domains. Wireless medium characteristics
    impose restrictions when specifying remote servers at design time and runtime.
    Moreover, dynamism and rapidly changing attributes of the runtime environment
    noticeably impact on augmentation process and increase decision making complexity.
    Augmentation approaches should be agile in dynamic mobile environment and instantaneously
    reflect to any change. For example, user movement from high bandwidth to a low
    bandwidth network, receding from the network access point, and rapidly changing
    available computing resources complicate CMA process. 4) User Preferences and
    Requirements End-users'' physical and mental situations, individual and corporate
    preferences, and ultimate computing goals are important factors that affect offloading
    performance. Some users are not interested to utilize the risky channel of Internet,
    while others may demand accessing cloud services through the Internet. Hence,
    users should be able to modify technical and non-technical specifications of the
    CMA system and customize it according to their needs. For example, user should
    be able to alter degree of acceptable latency against energy efficiency of an
    application execution. Selecting the most appropriate resource among available
    options can also enhance overall user experience. Fig. 10. Comparison of CMA Approaches.
    Show All 5) Cloud Servers As explained, CMA approaches can leverage various types
    of cloud resources to enhance computing capabilities of mobile devices. Therefore,
    the overall performance and credibility of the augmentation approaches highly
    depend on the cloud-based resources'' characteristics. Performance, availability,
    elasticity, vulnerability to security attacks, reliability (delivering accurate
    services based on agreed terms and conditions), cost, and distance are major characteristics
    of the cloud service providers used for augmenting mobile devices. Utilizing clouds
    to augment mobile devices notably reduces the device ownership cost by borrowing
    computing resources based on pay-as-you-use principle. Such elastic, cost-effective,
    reliable, and relatively trustworthy resources are embraced by the scholars, industrial
    organizations, and end-users towards flourishing CMA approaches. B. Performance
    Limitation Factors Performance of varied CMA solutions is impacted by several
    factors. We describe fix major performance limitation factors as follows. 1) Heterogeneity
    MCC is a highly heterogeneous environment comprised of three diversified domains
    of mobile computing, cloud computing, and networking. Although heterogeneity can
    provide flexibility to the mobile users by providing selection alternatives, it
    breeds several limitations and challenges, especially for developing multi-tier
    CMA-based applications [51]. Dissimilar mobile platforms such as Android, iOS,
    Symbian, and RIM beside diverse hardware characteristics of mobile device inhibit
    data and application portability among varied mobile devices. Portability is the
    ability to migrate code and data from one device to another with no/less modification
    and change [165]. Existing heterogeneity in cloud computing including hardware,
    platform, cloud service policy, and service heterogeneity originates challenges
    such as portability and interoperability and fragment the MCC domain. Network
    heterogeneity in MCC is the composition of various wireless technologies such
    as Wi-Fi, 3G, and WiMAX. Mobility among varied network environments intensifies
    communication deficiencies and stems complex issues like signal handover [125].
    Inappropriate decision making during the handover process like (i) less appropriate
    selection of network technology among available candidates and (ii) transferring
    the communication link at the wrong time, increases WAN latency and jitter that
    degrade quality of mobile cloud services. Consequently delay-sensitive content
    and services are degraded [166] and adoption of CMA approaches are hindered. Fig.
    11. Critical Factors in CMA Decision Making. Show All 2) Data Volume Ever-increasing
    volume of digital contents [86] significantly impacts on the performance of CMA
    approaches in MCC. Current wireless infrastructures and technologies fail to efficiently
    fulfill the networking requirements of CMA approaches. Storing such a huge data
    in a single warehouse is often impossible and demands data partitioning and distributed
    storage that not only mitigates data integrity and consistency, but also makes
    data management a pivotal need in MCC [167]. Applying a single access control
    mechanism for relevant data in various storage environments is another challenging
    task that impacts on the performance and adoption of CMA solutions in MCC. 3)
    Round-Trip Latency Communication and computation latency is one of the most important
    performance metrics of mobile augmentation approaches, especially when exploiting
    distant cloud resources. In cellular communications, distance from the base station
    (near or far) and variations in bandwidth and speed of various wireless technologies
    affect the performance of augmentation process for mobile devices. Moreover, leveraging
    wireless Internet networks to offload content to the distant cloud resources creates
    a bottleneck. Latency adversely impacts on the energy efficiency [74] and interactive
    response [168] of CMA-based mobile applications due to excessive consumption of
    mobile resources and raising transmission delays. Recently, researches [169],
    [170] are emerging toward decreasing the networking overhead and facilitating
    mobility (both node and code mobility) in cloud-based offloading approaches. For
    example, Follow-Me Cloud [169] aims at enabling mobility of network end-points
    across different IP subnets. The authors employ the concept of identifier and
    locator separation of edge networks using OpenFlow-enabled switches. Leveraging
    the Follow-Me Cloud, mobile nodes can move among access networks without being
    notified of any change or session disruption. All corresponding nodes that have
    been communicating with the mobile node can continue their communication without
    interruption. When the node migrates, its old IP turn to identifier and its new
    IP address becomes locator address so that all other nodes can keep communication
    with the moving node. However, for each packet traveling to/from the mobile node,
    there is an overhead of manipulating the locator/identifier values. Future improvement
    and optimization efforts will enhance the CMA systems'' performance. In cloud
    side, computation latency significantly impacts on the application responsiveness.
    Researchers study the impact of cloud computation performance on the execution
    time and vindicate 12X reduction in performance time violation [171]. Thus, the
    increased latency degrades the quality of user experience and adversely impacts
    on the user-perceived performance of CMA solutions. 4) Context Management and
    Processing Performance of CMA approaches is noticeably degraded by lack of sufficient,
    accurate knowledge about the runtime environment. Contemporary mobile devices
    are capable of gathering extensive context and social information such as available
    remote resources, network bandwidth, weather conditions, and users'' voice and
    gestures from their surrounding environment [137], [138]. But, storing, managing,
    and processing large volume of context information (considering MCC environment''s
    dynamism and mobile devices'' mobility) on resource-constraint smartphones are
    non-trivial tasks. 5) Service Execution and Delivery SLA as a formal contract
    between service consumer and provider enforces resource-level QoS (e.g., memory
    capacity, compute unit, and storage) against a fee, which is not sufficient for
    mobile users in highly dynamic wireless MCC environment. User-perceived performance
    in MCC is highly affected by the quality of cloud computations, wireless communications,
    and local execution. Hence, varied service providers, including cloud vendors,
    wireless network providers, and mobile hardware and OS vendors need to collaborate
    and ensure acceptable level of QoS. For successful CMA approaches, comprehensive
    realtime monitoring process is expected to ensure that engaging service vendors
    are delivering required services in acceptable level based on the accepted SLA.
    C. CMA Feasibility Although CMA is beneficial and can saves resources [40], several
    questions need to be addressed before CMA can be implemented in real scenarios.
    For instance: is CMA always feasible and beneficial? Can CMA save local resources
    and enhance user experience? What kind of cloud-based resources should be opted
    to achieve the superior performance? Vision of future CMA proposals will be realized
    by accurate sensing and acquiring precise knowledge of decision making factors
    like user preferences and requirements, augmentation environment, and mobile devices,
    which are explained in previous part. A decision making system, similar to those
    used in [25], [33], [49], analyzes these vital factors to determine the augmentation
    feasibility and specifies if augmentation can fulfill mobile computation requirements
    and enrich quality of user experience. Figure 12 illustrates a possible decision
    making flow of future CMA approaches. Availability of mobile resources to manage
    augmentation process and volume of cloud resources to provision required resources
    significantly impact on the quality of augmentation [9]. Similarly, user preferences,
    limitations, and requirements affect the augmentation decision making. For instance,
    if augmentation is not permitted by users, the application execution and data
    storage should be performed locally without being offloaded to a remote server(s)
    or be terminated in the absence of enough local resources. Similarly, augmentation
    process can be terminated if the execution latency of delay-sensitive content
    is sharply increased, quality of execution is noticeably decreased, or security
    and privacy of users is violated [19]. Furthermore, usefulness of CMA approaches
    highly depends on the execution environment. Offloading computation and mobile-cloud
    communication ratio, distance from mobile to the cloud, network technologies and
    coverage, available bandwidth, traffic congestion, deployment cost, and even nature
    of augmentation tasks alter usefulness of the CMA approaches [40]. For instance,
    performing an offloading method on a data-intensive application (e.g., applying
    a graphical filter on large number of high quality images) in a low-bandwidth
    network imposes large latency and significantly degrades user experience which
    should be avoided. Similarly, migrating a resource-hungry code to an expensive
    remote resource can be unaffordable practice. Suppose in a sample augmentation
    approach R C is the total native resources consumed during augmentation, R M is
    the total native resources consumed for maintenance, and R S is the total resources
    conserved in augmentation process. Explicitly for a feasible augmentation approach
    R C + R M << R S . However, in some traditional augmentation approaches, the left
    side of the equation exceeds the right which is not effective in augmenting resource-poor
    mobile devices [19]. Fig. 12. An Exemplary Decision Making Flow of Future CMA
    Approaches. Show All SECTION VII. Open Challenges In this Section, we highlight
    some of the most important challenges in deploying and utilizing CMA approaches
    as the future research directions. A. Reference Architecture for CMA Development
    Recently, researchers leverage dissimilar structures and techniques in utilizing
    cloud resources to augment computation capabilities of mobile devices. Also, different
    efforts focus on varied types of mobile applications, particularly multimedia,
    intense games, image processing, and workflow processing applications. Such diffusion
    scatters CMA development approaches and increase adaptability challenges of CMA
    solutions. In the absence of a reference architecture and unified CMA solution,
    various CMA approaches need to be integrated to all mobile OSs to serve multi-dimensional
    needs of various mobile users which is a non-trivial task. The reference architecture
    is expected to be generic enough to be deployed in family of CMA approaches. B.
    Autonomic CMA CMA approaches are drastically increasing volume of distributed
    mobile content in a horizontally heterogeneous mobile cloud computing environment
    [121]. Exploiting heterogeneous communication technologies to employ diverse cloud-based
    infrastructures for augmenting a plethora of dissimilar mobile devices is significantly
    intensifying complexity and management. Employing lateral solutions and controlling
    the mobile phones using outside entities (e.g., third party management systems)
    to deal with such complexity might further amplify complexity. A feasible alternative
    to mitigate such complexity is to develop autonomic self-managing, -healing, -optimizing,
    and -protecting CMA approaches [172] able to adapt to environment dynamism and
    hide complexity. C. Application Mobility Provisioning Enabling continuous and
    consistent mobility in CMA models (especially proximate mobile and hybrid) to
    provision ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to cloud-based computing
    resources is a vital challenge. Seamless code mobility in CMA models is more challenging
    compared to the traditional augmentation approaches, because in CMA approaches
    service providers and consumers can move during the augmentation process which
    intensifies the code mobility [173]. Therefore, communication disruption and intermittency
    can cause several challenges, especially dismissal of always-on connectivity,
    excessive consumption of limited mobile resources, and frequent interruption of
    application execution which decreases quality of computing services and degrades
    quality of mobile user experience [73]. Also, it levies redundant costs on cloud-mobile
    users and inhibits reliability of CMA models. Hence, alleviating such difficulties
    using Web advancements [170] and imminent lightweight cognitive mobility management
    systems with least signal traffic and latency can significantly enhance the ubiquitous
    connectivity and increase the positive impact of CMA. D. Computing and Temporal
    Cost of Mobile Distributed Execution Noticeable computation and communication
    cost of migrating tasks from the mobile device to the remote servers and receiving
    the results is another challenges of CMA approaches in MCC, which is intensified
    by mobility and wireless communication constraints. Although researchers [45],
    [152] endeavor to reduce the distance of mobile devices and service providers
    by leveraging nearby mobile/fixed computing devices, several mechanisms, particularly
    resource discovery and allocation, service consumer and provider mobility management,
    and distributed runtime are required to realize the CMAs vision. Accurate allocation
    of resources to the mobile computation tasks demands comprehensive knowledge about
    structure and performance features of available service providers and resource
    requirements of mobile computation tasks. Thus, QoS-aware scheduling efforts such
    as [143] are necessary to enhance the CMA usability. E. Seamless Communication
    Maintaining a continuous communication between mobile service consumers and mobile/fixed
    service providers in intermittent heterogeneous wireless environment is a non-trivial
    task. User mobility and wireless disconnection highly impact on resource utilization
    ratio. When the mobile service providers and consumers loss communication link
    due to mobility-made prolonged distance, the service consumer requires to either
    performing local execution or re-initiating augmentation process. Similarly, the
    resource-constraint mobile server consumes its scarce resources for processing
    an orphan computation whose results are ineffectual after losing the communication
    link. Potential solutions may transfer partially-completed tasks to a nearby node
    or initiate parallel execution on third device before disconnection, or cache
    results for future references. F. Multipoint Data Bridging Unlike traditional
    offloading methods that require point-to-point code and data migration and processing,
    CMA approaches require multipoint data migration and interoperation to achieve
    the maximum benefits from the distributed heterogeneous infrastructures in mobile-cloud
    ecosystem. Connecting heterogeneous systems (based on wired or wireless), understanding
    geographical information resources, and exchanging data between/across two or
    more heterogeneous systems [174] are the main issues in CMA system which demand
    arousing data interoperation techniques in multi-domains mobile cloud environment.
    The inward heterogeneous architectures and data structures of mobile devices and
    cloud systems with different APIs can exemplify the intensity of multipoint data
    bridging challenge [23]. Hence, offloading computational tasks from a mobile device
    to a cloud, performing computational interoperation among varied clouds (for cost
    and performance concerns), and pushing results to the mobile device become challenging
    tasks [175]. Therefore, multipoint data bridging in dynamic heterogeneous environment
    remains as a future research direction to realize accessing, interpreting, processing,
    sharing, and synchronizing distributed contents. G. Distributed Content Management
    Rapid growth in digital contents and increasing dependency of mobile users to
    cloud infrastructures impede content management for mobile users. Researchers
    distribute code and data among heterogeneous nearby and distant resources via
    different communication technologies to optimize CMA process. Although executing
    complex, heavy applications and accessing large data volume are facilitated, managing
    huge volume of distributed contents for smartphone users is not straightforward.
    Therefore, enabling mobile users to efficiently locate, access, update, and synchronize
    highly distributed contents requires future research and developments. H. Seamless/Lightweight
    CMA Developing lightweight mobile computing augmentation approaches to increase
    quality of mobile user experience and to develop CMA system independent of any
    particular situation is a significant challenge in mobile cloud environment. Offloading
    bulk data in limited wireless bandwidth, and VM initiation, migration, and management
    in a secure and confidential manner are particular tasks in CMA system that noticeably
    increase overall execution time, intensify the augmentation latency, and decrease
    the quality of mobile user experience. CMA approaches are generally hosted and
    executed inside the mobile devices to conserve their local resources and hence,
    need to avoid excessive resource hungry transactions. A feasible approach to decrease
    the volume of digital contents —in limited bandwidth networks —is to utilize effective,
    efficient data compression methods. Available compression techniques are unlikely
    efficient considering structure of current multimedia files. Moreover, approaches
    like Paravirtualiztion [176] as a lightweight virtualization technique can reduce
    the overhead by partially emulating the OS and hardware. Paravirtualization approaches
    virtualize only parts of the hardware required for computing. Thus, the mobile-side
    VM creation overhead is diminished and the impact of VM migration on network is
    reduced. Therefore, realizing lightweight CMA approaches demands lightweight computation
    and communication techniques (particularly in virtualization, data compression,
    and encryption methods) to reduce intra-system correspondence, data volume, and
    I/O tasks. I. Security in Mobile Cloud One of the most challenging aspects of
    CMA is protecting offloaded code and data inside the cloud. While securing contents
    inside the mobile consumes huge resources, offloading plain contents through insecure
    wireless medium and storing plain data inside the cloud highly violates user security
    and privacy. Despite of the large number of research and development in establishing
    trust in cloud [177]–[180], security and privacy is still one of the major user
    concerns in utilizing cloud resources that impede CMA deployment. Addressing such
    crucial needs by employing a novel lightweight security algorithm in mobile side
    and a set of robust security mechanisms in cloud demand future efforts to promote
    CMA among smartphone users. In privacy aspects, though recent social behaviors
    of users in social websites such as Facebook and tweeter advocates that large
    community of users partially forfeit privacy, they still need certain degree of
    robust privacy to protect their confidential, clandestine data. J. Live Virtual
    Machine Migration Live migration of VMs between distributed cloud-based servers
    (especially for distant servers) is a crucial requirement in successfully adopting
    CMA solutions in MCC, considering wireless network bandwidth and intermittency,
    and mobility limitations. When a mobile user moves to a place far from the offloaded
    contents (code or data), the enlarged distance increases access latency and degrades
    user-observed application performance. Hence, mobilizing the running VM along
    with the mobile service consumer without perceivable service interruption becomes
    essential to avoid user experience degradation. However, sharp growing computation
    and data volume in blipping wireless environment intensifies live migration of
    VM. Therefore, efforts similar to VMware vMotion [181] and [122], [182] are necessary
    to optimize VM migration in MCC. Reducing computation complexity and overhead,
    energy, data volume, and communication cost are critical in low-latency low-cost
    migration of VM in MCC. Furthermore, after successful live VM migration, it is
    essential to ensure that migrated VM is seamlessly accessible via initial IP address
    when the VM changes its physical machine. Future efforts similar to [183], [184]
    and LISP [185] are needed to realize the vision of seamless access to migrating
    VM in MCC. SECTION VIII. Conclusions Augmenting computing capabilities of mobile
    devices, especially smartphones using cloud infrastructures and principles is
    an emerging research area. The ultimate goal of CMA solutions is to realize the
    vision of unrestricted functionality, storage, and mobility regardless of underlying
    devices and technologies'' constraints. Elasticity, availability, and security
    are considered as the most significant characteristics of remote computing resources.
    Augmenting smartphones significantly improves their usability and adoption in
    various critical areas such as healthcare, emergency handling, disaster recovery,
    and crowd management. Enterprise organizations also leverage such value-added
    services to enhance quality of services delivering to their end-users. However,
    several communication and networking challenges, particularly live VM migration,
    seamless back-end and front-end mobility, handover, context awareness, and location
    management decelerate adoption of cloud-based augmentation solutions in MCC. Similarly,
    irreconcilable and unpredictable bandwidth, jitter, communication delay, inconsistent
    network throughput, and non-elastic wireless spectrum and infrastructures encumber
    upfront planning for CMA. In this paper, we have presented a comprehensive survey
    on mobile augmentation process and reviewed several CMA approaches. We have described
    deficiencies of current mobile devices as a motivation for augmentation. Comparing
    surrogates as traditional servers with contemporary cloud-based infrastructures
    advocates adaptability of cloud computing and principles as an appropriate back-end
    technology in mobile augmentation domain. Cloud resources in this domain are manifested
    as distant immobile clouds, proximate mobile and immobile computing entities,
    and hybrid combination of resources. CMA approaches not only enhance processing,
    energy, and storage capabilities of mobile devices, but also amend data safety
    and security, data ubiquity, accessibility, and user interface while facilitate
    distributed application programming. Despite of significant CMA approaches advantages,
    several disadvantages hinder their adoption in mobile computing. Several open
    challenges particularly, autonomic CMA, seamless application mobility provisioning,
    distributed content management, and multipoint data bridging are the most prominent
    open challenges that demand future efforts. Authors Figures References Citations

    In recent years, underwater visible light communication (UVLC) has become a potential
    wireless carrier candidate for signal transmission in highly critical, unknown,
    and acrimonious water mediums such as oceans. Unfortunately, the oceans are the
    least explored reservoirs in oceanogeographical history. However, natural disasters
    have aroused significant interest in observing and monitoring oceanic environments
    for the last couple of decades. Therefore, UVLC has drawn attention as a reliable
    digital carrier and claims a futuristic optical media in the wireless communication
    domain. Counterparts of traditional communications, the green, clean, and safe
    UVLC support high capacity data-rate and bandwidth with minimal delay. Nevertheless,
    the deployment of UVLC is challenging rather than terrestrial basis communication
    over long ranges. In addition, UVLC systems have severe signal attenuation and
    strong turbulence channel conditions. Due to the fact that, this study provides
    an exhaustive and comprehensive survey of recent advancements in UVLC implementations
    to cope with the optical signal propagation issues. In this regard, a wide detailed
    summary and future perspectives of underwater optical signaling towards 5G and
    beyond (5GB) networks along with the current project schemes, channel impairments,
    various optical signal modulation techniques, underwater sensor network (UWSN)

    evolution of underwater visible light communication (UVLC) towards the next-generation
    wireless network 5G and 5G beyond (5GB) vision would have an enhancement in overall
    system performance while satisfying the current requirements. From the perspective
    of VLC, data transmission is highly secure with very minimal interception. The
    5GB is an advanced wireless communication networking approach that provides a
    downlink data rate of more than 1Gbps. Moreover, the drawback in 5GB is the high
    cost of infrastructural development [1]. On the other hand, the ongoing transition
    of VLC across the 6G wireless network has more eminence over 5G network such as
    enhanced machine-type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable & low-latency communication
    (uRLLC) [2]. However, a promising VLC technology has no interference as RF communication
    system does. Therefore, VLC has acceptability of benefits to deploy, where the
    RF wireless networks are less implemented such as medical fields, oil rigs and
    gas plants, nuclear power plants (NPPs), underwater communication and further
    numerous applications [3]. As the oceans are mysterious water reservoirs that
    need to be explored through various signal processing techniques and applications
    such as undersea monitoring, observing marine life, detecting oil and natural
    gas sources, early warning of tsunamis, floods, and underwater location coordinates
    for navigation purposes [4]. Under these conditions, underwater wireless communication
    (UWC) has become an essential approach to exploring undersea sectors and plays
    a significant role in order to provide the natural phenomenal underwater activities.
    The state-of-the-art UWC in coastal securities, fishing farms, marine transportation,
    and pollution control have been implemented for several decades [5]. UWC networks
    are necessarily vital approaches in inaccessible and unmanageable regions of the
    deep ocean, which are highly sought-after research areas among scientists, researchers,
    and academics. A comprehensive and detailed discussion on UWC as a potential method
    of wireless signal transmission is recorded as in [5]–[9]. In addition, the proposed
    deployable underwater communication technologies in existing surveys support the
    collection of the oceanographic data, observation of water pollution, undersea
    monitoring, immediate warning of floods & natural disasters, and the phenomena
    of melting ice sheets due to global warming caused by rising ocean levels are
    also discussed in [9]. Recent studies encourage exploring the oceanic environment
    by deploying UWC technologies such as electromagnetic waves (EM) in terms of RF,
    acoustic, and optical waves propagation. As RF waves highly attenuate by the seawater
    and change the properties conductor to dielectric at 250GHz frequency ranges [10].
    Therefore, RF carriers are not feasible and cover short ranges of communication
    in an aquatic medium. As claimed by the existing underwater architectural system
    in literature, the frequency ranges of EM waves in underwater propagation is extremely
    low between 30−300Hz for military applications [11]. A large sized antenna is
    required in UWRF signaling for better performance in underwater mediums [12].
    Similarly, RF waves are also operated as ultra-low frequencies (ULF) to proceed
    with low attenuation but at a very high budget and at a low data rate. it provides
    low data rates [13]. Most recently, a joint technical WMO-IOC Commission for Oceanography
    and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) as an observing network of the Global Ocean Observing
    System (GOOS) has proposed a high-frequency radar network (HFR) in 2017s [14].
    In [14], the proposed communication system has drawn an attention of HFR system,
    that is continuously observed and map of ocean currents up to 200km offshore site
    in the coastal area. It supports detecting the floating objects on the sea surface,
    such as fishing ships, buoys, floating nodes, boats, yachts, etc., and extremely
    helpful for rescue operations. In the HFR networking system, the signal propagation
    is held from the radar and the signal reception by the conduction ocean waves,
    measuring the Doppler shift and giving direction and velocity. A pictorial view
    is depicted the function of HFR by Fig.16. FIGURE 1. An overview of RF-VLC hybrid
    communication system where the oceanographic data collects by distinct types of
    underwater sensor network nodes architecture (1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D types of UWSNs
    architecture). The extracted data has been transferred to the offshore station
    for further analysis. In this type of scenario, the different internet of underwater
    things (IoUT) are included to communicate with each other by utilizing the latest
    wireless network or beyond. As depicted, the floating nodes collect the information
    along with the network nodes at the specified depth in the underwater medium.

    in an extraordinarily dark in dense aqueous medium. The typical visible light

    16. A hieroglyphic overview of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) in diversified
    possible underwater applications. Each Internet-connected tool functioned differently
    for a specific purpose. As floating nodes, sea gliders, Unmanned underwater vehicles
    (UUVs), Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are used for long-range communication,
    localization, bathymetric data-collection, and real-time monitoring. On the other
    hand, the high-frequency radar, a floating drifter, geographical satellite, surface
    floating gliders, and Tsunami buoy are used for continuously observation and mapping
    ocean currents, oceanographic imaging and geographical mapping, and early detection
    warning of the tsunami and tectonic plates movement. Moreover, the clod cards
    and animal telemetry are usable for studying the underwater flow pattern and observation
    of the marine environment. Show All At a glance, EM waves were initially used
    as low-frequency ranges to transmit signals on terrestrial-based communication
    for reliable communication to achieve high bandwidth. Though, in an underwater
    environment, RF waves propagate differently compared to terrestrial-based signaling
    and totally depend on water mediums. The advantageous feature of RF waves propagate
    with high velocity (similar to the optical waves) provide efficient communication
    among the network nodes. Underwater wireless RF (UWRF) experiences signal fading
    and easily attenuates over very short distances in underwater. It is challenging
    to transmit signals through RF waves in a highly turbid water medium. An impressive
    survey work is proposed on UWRF based communication in seawater, where the authors
    widely discussed the recent advances of RF waves for coastal and military applications
    [11]. Besides UWRF, the acoustic waves are received the utmost interest in signal
    propagation over long distances in underwater medium with the limited bandwidth
    [15]. The traditional acoustic wireless carriers propagate over long distances
    with a low speed of approximately 1500m/s , and a meager data rate [12]. Generally,
    acoustic waves propagation speed is influenced by channel impairments. Conversely,
    the speed of acoustic waves increases tremendously due to fluctuation of the temperature
    and salinity of the water [8]. The affecting factors such as scattering, reflection,
    and absorption by suspended particles corrupt acoustic signals. Therefore, the
    main concern of UWC is the establishment and architectural design of underwater
    sensor networks (UWSNs) for obtaining proper communication among nodes. An exhaustively
    detailed review study of UWSN is summarized in [16]. Additionally, the shipbuilding
    industries are also increasingly interested in widespread communication through
    sensor network architectures. The possible UWSNs applications are over-viewed
    in various underwater applications such as observing strong influences of the
    aqueous medium, undersea nutrient production, natural oil retrieval, underwater
    transportation, and the impact of water climate regulation on ecological system
    [17]. In these corresponding applications, the sensor nodes such as autonomous
    underwater vehicles (AUVs), remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) support
    the data collection with the onshore nodes (sub-station) [18]. The cluster of
    underwater sensor networks is depicted in Fig.1, Fig.14 and sensor network architecture
    in Fig.16. Due to the limited data rate and bandwidth of UWRF and acoustic waves,
    an alternative optical signaling approach has become the most significant and
    reliable wireless carrier candidate for digital signaling in underwater [19].
    For instance, in the first stage of optical signaling, fire, fire-smoke, fire
    beacons, torches, and reflecting sunlight were introduced. In the starting phase
    of optical signaling about 800 BC, the ancient Romans and Greeks used to transmit
    optical signals for communication purposes over long ranges [20]. During 1880s,
    the optical wave-based telephone (photophone) was invented by the famous scientist
    Alexander Graham Bell for signal transmission over 210m [21]. In this photophone,
    a parabolic mirror with a selenium cell was used as an optical signal receiver.
    In the end of the 19 th century, the continuous development of optical signaling,
    Heliographs were firstly proposed to deliver messages through optical waves in
    the battlefield for military applications [22]. Generally, the heliographs were
    assembled with a dual-layer of mirrors and directly used to control the light
    beam propagation. For further development of optical communication, lasers were
    introduced as an alternative for signal transmission to serve wireless carrier
    over long distances [12]. On the other hand, the demand for ocean exploration
    is hiking up for a couple of decades. For instance, a real-time data streaming
    fiber optics signaling is applicable for several underwater applications and proposed
    during 1970s [23]. However, the main drawback of fiber optics is highly cost setups
    and unpleasant for undersea species. Moreover, in connection with the limited
    propagation coverage and high attenuation, underwater signaling is highly challenging
    to fill the gap of the desired communication. For consistent development of optical
    signaling, He-Ne laser ( λ =632.8nm) was investigated as an optical signal carrier
    over the 30 – 40km range during 1960s [23]. In the early ages of laser development,
    the very initial foundational laser link was established to control commercial
    traffic in Japan by Nippon Electric Company during 1970s [21]. This deployed laser
    link was firstly used for signal transmission over 14 km. Later on, full-duplex
    communication Free Space Optics (FSO) enabled He-Ne laser at 0.6325μm was introduced
    for communication between the cities of Yokohama and Tamagawa in Japan [21], [23].
    To keep evolution going, FSO communication technology was proposed to transmit
    high data-rate signals with minimal delay over long distances among communication
    nodes, which is extensively discussed in [12] and [24]. Later, in the end of the
    20 th century, the numerous developments have been documented for optical signaling.
    Kahn and Barry extended Gfeller and Bapst’s work, where they demonstrated a laser
    of wavelength 780 – 950nm with high data rates 50 – 70Mbps [21], [25] [26]. In
    laser counterparts, the implementation of Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in VLC
    are widely used as transmitters through an illumination nature that provides an
    ultrahigh bandwidth to achieve a high data rate. For optical signal transmission
    and receiving, LDs and LEDs are the potential tools and widely use in optical
    communication over very short, short, medium and long ranges as per the requirement
    of the applications [27]. Therefore, these LEDs are considered the main sources
    of optical signal contributors. Moreover, the various light sources, photosensors
    transmit and receive optical signals such as a laser diode (LDs), Avalanche photodiode
    (APD), p-n diode, etc. The consumption of LED seems to be a novel approach cause
    of its dual nature. LED turn-on and turn-off ability turns a new communication
    paradigm formally known as the visible light communication system. Although, the
    invention of LEDs received a remarkable extent of research for high data transmission
    of its dual nature as illumination and signal carrier [28]. The illumination phenomenon
    occurs based on the visible light wave spectrum at the wavelength 380 – 750nm,
    which is used as a transmitter and an image sensor at the receiver end [29]. Historically,
    VLC was proposed by the Visible Light Communications Consortium Japan (VLCCJ),
    Japan Electronics & Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) CP-1221,
    and CP-1222 during 2003s to 2007s [21]. For continuous development of VLC, the
    Visible Light Communications Associations (VLCA) was established in Japan for
    further standardization [30]. As Japan Traffic Management Technology Association
    (JTMTA) and VLCC conducted an experiment where they achieved 4800 kbps data rate
    over a distance of 300m. Overall, Japan had contributed the initiatives for the
    development of products based on VLC signal modulated technologies. Additionally,
    in 2012s, Casio Japan developed the new Apple application “Picapicamera” for users
    where the images could be sent instantly through VLC technology [27]. In contrast,
    the modulation schemes and dimming phenomenon supports possible VLC communication
    that has been widely investigated by IEEE 802.15.7 standard [31]. The optical
    wireless communication (OWC) IEEE 802.15.7r1 standardization is used for short-range
    communication as VLC implementation [32]. The new era of optical communication
    has become a more significant trade for digital wireless signaling media with
    the integration of different techniques, which are mentioned in Table 1. Subsequently,
    the optical camera communications (OCC) system is used as image sensors at the
    receiver end to provide triple functions simultaneously, i.e., illumination, data
    transmission, and wireless energy transfer [20]. TABLE 1 An Overview of the Different
    Optical Communication Technologies Along With the Description of Transceivers
    are Used. In Addition, the Distinct Characteristics and the Possible Applications
    of an Individual Technique are Also Summarized TABLE 2 The Description of Acronyms
    and Notations are Used in This Study TABLE 3 Nomenclature and Description of Acronyms
    are Used in This Research All the above matter facts for real-time data streaming
    and high bandwidth signal propagation approaches are needed. Therefore, underwater
    optical wireless communication (UWOC) in terms of visible light, particularly
    the blue-green spectrum of wavelength (450–532)nm [20], has been chosen and is
    widely used for high data transmission underwater communication. In the UWOC,
    the hydrological optical beam experiences signal absorption due to electron transition
    and converted into another form of energy. It is noticeable that water offers
    transparency with blue-green light spectrum [20] rather than with other light
    spectrum wavelengths. Moreover, the ocean water offers less attenuation for the
    blue light spectrum while the green light spectrum is attenuated by coastal water
    [33]. The optical signal attenuation depends on the inherent optical properties
    (IOPs), and apparent optical properties (AOPs) of water medium [34]. Additionally,
    the physio-chemical properties of the water channel supports fading contribution
    due to absorption, optical scattering, and reflection caused by turbidity, pressure,
    temperature, and existing suspended material within the water environment [35].
    As a result, underwater visible light communication (UVLC) has become a complementary
    approach compared to traditional acoustic communication in high data rates ranging
    from hundred Mbps to Gbps over short range applications. Even UVLC has received
    superiority over traditional underwater acoustic and EM signaling. As compared
    to the existing traditional UWC techniques, UVLC technology has advantages in
    harsh environments as it is handy to use, easy to deploy with low cost, and highly
    qualitative communication media [36]. A broad detailed scenario of UVLC and connecting
    nodes optically in an underwater environment is depicted in Fig.1. Underwater
    signaling is entirely different from the terrestrial radio environment due to
    its energy costs and signal propagation phenomena. As a result, it is challenging
    to provide energy to power-hungry devices in underwater mediums. To cope with
    the energy harvesting (EH) issues, Simultaneously Wireless Information and Power
    Transfer (SWIPT) [37] and Simultaneously Light-Wave Information and Power Transfer
    (SLIPT) techniques [38], [39] are proposed in the literature in preference to
    powered up UWSNs. SWITP, wireless power transfer (WPT), and SLIPT will be widely
    discussed in further sections in this study. At a glance, EH is an optimum solution
    for power supply to activate the internet-enabled devices. Although, very few
    existing EH techniques are capable of supplying energy to the internet of underwater
    things (IoUTs). Several EH techniques are proposed in the open literature to power
    up underwater-based sensor nodes through RF and acoustic waves, which are mentioned
    in section IX. Considering the EH scheme in acoustic communication, the Microbial
    Fuel Cell (MFC) and Acoustic Piezo-Electric (APE) techniques are the key enabling
    solutions for self-energizing nodes [40]. WPT and SWIPT techniques are investigated
    and introduced to provide energy with information transmission simultaneously
    over the wireless network [37]. Similarly, SLIPT has been announced as a futuristic
    wireless carrier candidate for EH and information transmission through light wave
    [41]. A more detailed summary and comparison between SWIPT and SLIPT is recorded
    in the literature in [42]. Furthermore, enabling the next-generation wireless
    network proliferates the communication system quality and efficiency. 5G enabled
    underwater wireless communication system will be the futuristic communication
    networking system that has been introduced recently in [35]. The authors in [43]
    and [44] are investigated the Filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) and generalized
    frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) schemes which are considered as the latest
    reliable networking techniques for 5G applications in underwater. Improving the
    system quality of communication setup within the higher signal modulation techniques
    also significantly achieves a high data rate. The higher modulation techniques
    support a high degree of signal transmission between transceivers with minimum
    delay. The different types of optical signal modulation techniques are summarized
    in [45] and [21]. The hybrid links established for the long ranges of communication
    in different channel environmental conditions are used to deploy according to
    the requirement. A hybrid RF-UWOC system is investigated in [46]–[52]. Therefore,
    throughout this study, we present the various optical signal modulations, demodulations
    techniques, and their implementations in various wireless systems with recent
    trends in the underwater environment. A. Related Survey Literature The various
    existing works are recorded based on UWC techniques and investigated with numerous
    emerging development methods in this domain. The existing related works are summarized
    by Table 4. For several decades, accelerating UWC to explore the underwater environment
    has become an alternative communication media that attracts human activities in
    an aqueous medium. Plenty of underwater wireless applications based on acoustic
    waves are investigated in existing works to explore the oceanic environment. However,
    the limited signal propagation speed and bandwidth recorded in underwater sound
    waves caused communication delay among nodes [12]. Therefore, the requirement
    for underwater acoustic communication setups for real-time monitoring and to access
    underwater applications are typically challenging. Based on underwater acoustic
    communication (UWAC), the most promptly military applications, especially in underwater
    acoustic communications among nodes such as submarine to the base station, submarine
    to ship, and submarine with military divers, are widely summarized in [53]. On
    the other hand, underwater optical signaling propagation reliably supports high
    bandwidth and high data-rate with minimal delay and latency. This is particularly
    appealing for real-time underwater applications [54]. To mitigate of its limitations,
    a hybrid mixed communication system design and evaluation of underwater optical-acoustic
    networks are investigated as in [55]–[59]. Similarly, for real-time scenarios,
    the performance of RF underwater communications operating system at frequency
    ranges 433MHz to 2.4GHz is investigated [60]. A range of existing hybrid underwater
    links are summarized in Table 4. Due to high signal propagation delay and very
    few kbps data rate in UWAC, counterparts of UWRF could be a complementary solution
    to receive high data rate and bandwidth range. For short distances, the RF conduction-based
    system design for voice communication in an aqueous medium has been recorded in
    [61]. TABLE 4 The Table is Summarized the Most Recent Existing Similar Works Along
    With the Related Contributions From the Perspective of Future Directions. Furthermore,
    it has Also Mentioned the Channel Modeling, Impairments, Signal Affecting Factors,
    and the Most Widely Deployable Underwater Applications Prior works are designed
    on theoretical propositions as a function of the physical properties of channels
    such as pressure, temperature, salinity, etc. A recent survey on UWOC is widely
    discussed about signal propagation-related issues based on the physical layer
    and localization technique in [13]. The authors in [62] investigated the path
    loss performance of a vertical UVLC link with the physical properties of the water
    channel considering n th water layers. A UVLC system model considering LOS & non-LOS
    vertical configurations and the variation of refractive index is also presented
    in [63]. The survey [12] is exhaustively enlisted the critical factors of optical
    signals propagation in an underwater medium where the authors modeled the UWOC
    channels. However, the survey is provided a detailed summary of optical signal
    modulation and demodulation techniques according to the experimental setup of
    the system. UWOC wireless carriers as FSO and UVLC technology have been compared
    and widely discussed in [64]. The higher modulation techniques of UVLC have become
    attention for developing optical signals in the underwater environment. Due to
    this, a 16-QAM modulation scheme for underwater signaling was proposed in [65].
    The authors in [65] are investigated the four types of different geometrical shaped
    16-QAM constellation experimental approaches for improving the system efficiency.
    The most recent work based on the MIMO-OFDM scheme utilizing VLC in underwater
    is proposed as in [66] and [67], where the authors proposed the BER performance
    of the system under consideration of weak turbulence channel conditions. Another
    study is observed the BER performance over NOMA-based assisted UVLC link as in
    [68]. In hybrid communication, EH is an issue concerning nodes in active modes.
    An EH hybrid acoustic-optical underwater sensor networking system was investigated
    in [69]. The authors in [70], are introduced the possible underwater applications
    and the differences between the terrestrial-based wireless network (TWSNs) with
    the underwater sensor network nodes (UWSNs). In the previous work [4], we reviewed
    the comparison among the three most significant UWC technologies and concluded
    the various advantages of UWOC over traditional wireless carriers. In this presented
    survey, we studied the recent advent of UVLC within different channel conditions.
    The following complementary sub-topics are widely summarized in this research
    as follows; UVLC channel model is considered within the combined influence of
    weak to strong turbulence channel conditions along with the pointing error between
    transceivers; The performance of underwater hybrid communication is obtained in
    different water types along with the simulation results; The distinctive VLC higher

    applications in marine industries all around the world; A diverse study of IoUTs
    and implementation in different underwater locations for required applications
    are also summarized; Integration of UVLC towards 5G and 5GB networking in UWC
    domain is concluded; A SLIPT assisted scheme, based on time-switching and power
    switching methods to powered up UWSNs is highlighted in this research. B. Motivations
    and Contributions Since humans footed on earth, oceanic reservoirs are least explored
    and are far-fetched to envisage the undersea environments. We tend to know more
    about the moon and mars rather than oceans existed on our earth. The interest
    growth of human activities in underwater is proposed the new research advances
    become familiarization with the natural oceanic phenomenal activities. Numerous
    UWC systems demand plenty of underwater applications for new research perspectives
    in this particular domain due to the immense development of industrialization.
    Traditional acoustic signaling is widely used for various underwater applications
    over long ranges. Nevertheless, a novel optical communication wireless media has
    been proposed recently to fulfill the requirement of desired data rate. Therefore,
    optical wireless signaling has become a potential wireless candidate for information
    transmission, and energy harvesting technology. However, UVLC is in its early
    age to cope with signal transmission and energy harvesting issues wirelessly in
    highly turbid water mediums. This study carries an exhaustive survey of UVLC towards
    5GB futuristic networking system, the latest and current projects are running
    through the globe, channel modeling, UWSNs architectures, IoUTs enabled applications,
    and their contributions are perspectives. The main contributions and recent trends
    of UVLC through this study are as follows; The main purpose of this research is
    to provide a clear understanding of the main characteristic features of UVLC terminology
    towards future 5GB networking systems. In addition, the study also discusses signal
    processing extraction methodology with the possible solutions to the current factual
    challenges of improving the efficiency and potential wireless carriers of data
    communication in the underwater environment; An essential goal of this study includes
    a clear viewpoint of technical aspects of underwater networking architectural
    communication applicable for various applications and different higher modulation
    optical signal processing techniques among students, young scientists, and researchers
    to understand challenges and future directions in the corresponding domain; An
    extensive range of underwater applications requires communication techniques with
    high performance and reliability. Due to this, most of the significant channel
    impairments and challenges are widely studied. However, absorption, scattering,
    misalignment of transceivers (Pointing Error), and turbidity are the main influencing
    factors overlooked in single-hop, dual-hop, and hybrid multi-hop wireless communications;
    A wide detailed summary of VLC modulation, and demodulation techniques towards
    5G enabled FBMC, and GFDM techniques are briefly summarized. UVLC enabled 5GB
    supports a proper connection among underwater-based internet-connected elements
    with the satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the sake of expanding
    human activities [1]; This study is visualized the most distinctive type of UWSN
    architectures to power up the nodes through SWIPT and SLIPT schemes; the UWSNs
    architecture in both academic and industrial perspectives are majorly discussed;
    The discussion of this survey study provides a forum among the students, researchers,
    and engineers. In addition, the key fundamentals of this proposed survey are associated
    with professionals communication academics. C. Paper Structure The remainder of
    the paper is organized into XV sections. An underwater wireless communication
    overview enabled with different communication media is presented in section II.
    We are discussing the fundamentals and propagation terminology of UVLC along with
    the types of waters, channel impairments in section III. The necessity of signal
    transmitter and receivers are summarized by section IV. Further, an exhaustive
    survey relating to the current project schemes and future deployments are widely
    summarized in section V. In section VI, there are plenty of computational methods
    discussed to provide a problematic solution of bulk data in optical signal processing.
    To cope with the channel impairments and signal fading factors have taken into
    account. Therefore the various UVLC system models are proposed and their overview
    is given in VII. The modulation schemes are the most practical terms to propagate
    digital signals. Due to this, the optical modulation and demodulation techniques
    are introduced in section VIII. Furthermore, deploying UVLC systems in critical
    environmental conditions is challenging and far-fetched to transfer energy to
    underwater-based sensor nodes. The SLIPT, SWIPT, and WPT wireless energy transfer
    and simultaneous information decoding schemes are broadly discussed in section
    IX. The aim of this study is to improve the performance and coverage range of
    UVLC by integrating with traditional UWC technologies. The various possible dual,
    triple, and multi-hop hybrid communication link system models are also presented
    in section X. For long-ranges communication coverage, the distinctive UWSNs architecture
    beneficial for various underwater applications is tabulated and introduced by
    section XI. Recent advancements of internet-connected devices underwater according
    to the requirements and advantages are also over-viewed in section XII. The implementation
    and future trends in UVLC towards 5G and 5GB are investigated in section XIII.
    Underwater optical wireless applications and recent advances are the impressive
    features of this study are summarized by section XIV. Finally, Section XV concludes
    the paper. SECTION II. Underwater Wireless Communication as an Overview UWC networks
    are challenging and become a significant approach to exploring an inaccessible
    unguided sector in the deep ocean with a wired and wireless connection. The deployable
    technologies allow to get familiar with the oceanic environment. Therefore, UWC
    accommodates an opportunity for oceanographic data collection and analysis, water
    pollution, underwater environmental monitoring, changes in currents, early warning
    of flood or tsunami, and observing the phenomena of ice sheet melting due to global
    warming cause of rising water level of oceans [4]. Nowadays in UWC, the three
    most significant distinctive technologies are employable for transmitting the
    information. These wireless carrier candidates are based on optical, sound, and
    electromagnetic waves based [5], [13]. The signal transmission is dependent on
    signal strength which is affected by the brutally chemical properties of the channel.
    The optical signal could be absorbed, scattered, and reflected caused by the chemical
    vitality of the channel, and suspended particles in a water environment [10].
    Considering UWRF, which is used for short ranges, the signal decay happens by
    the hydrological properties and water channel. These water channel properties
    known as permittivity, conductivity, and permeability are directly responsible
    for the contribution of RF signal attenuation while increasing frequency ranges
    [37]. Since the saline seawater allows to propagate RF waves in few meters at
    extra low-frequency range of (30–300Hz), which is enabled to the transmission
    of few characters per minute to submarine [11]. Moreover, RF waves at the frequency
    range MHz to GHz accomplishes work efficiently in hybrid scenarios [4]. However,
    for shallow water scenarios, RF-enabled communication is called buoyant communication
    [5]. The UWRF system requires a costly and large sized information transmission
    antenna along with high energy-consuming transceivers [71]. In hybrid UWRF signaling,
    it offers a significant platform for the connection between underwater and terrestrial-based
    nodes. It also permits the exploration of the forbidden field of ocean and underwater
    environment. Extremely low frequencies (ELF) are used for long ranges underwater
    communication while the high frequencies (HF) strongly attenuate the cause of
    signal losses [72]. On the other hand, the frequency ranges as ultra-high frequency
    (ULF) to medium frequency (MF) are mainly used for a variety of underwater environments
    [73]. As far as long ranges in underwater signaling, acoustic waves are widely
    used and challenging communication technology to deploy in an underwater environment
    [74]. Nevertheless, in UWAC propagation, the speed of sounds deficient with high
    delay over long ranges [75]. According to [9] and [76], an impressive feature
    of UWAC offers an incremental speed propagation on raising the temperature of
    the water. An impressive increment (approximately 4m/s) has been recorded on rising
    1°C of water temperature. Moreover, the salinity is also another cause of signal
    fading, and acoustic waves speed in enhanced by 1.4m/s while rising salinity 1
    practical salinity unit (PSU). In respect to receiving signals over long distances
    under consideration of plane wave model or spherical wave model, emerging technology
    is widely known as UWSNs, which is alternative and a complimentary communication
    media solution, especially for military and naval tactical, operational applications
    [77]. SECTION III. Fundamentals of Underwater Visible Light Communications UVLC
    has become a unique advantageous technology in the new era of wireless signaling
    that has drawn attention as a dominant signal propagation over short ranges in
    the harsh underwater medium. Towards the next generation of 5GB wireless networking
    system, UVLC will be applicable for numerous undersea applications such as geographical
    mapping, underwater navigation, naval operations, data-retrieving among nodes,
    and high quality of UWSNs are also considered [119]. Additionally, UVLC has superiority
    including high data-rate, real-time steaming data transfer with high security
    compared with its counterpart traditional underwater signaling acoustic and RF
    signaling. Despite all of these advantages, several factors affect the signal
    propagation, such as absorption, scattering, and turbulence due to the IOPs and
    AOPs properties of water channel and nature of light [5], [9], [12], [34], [79].
    The affecting factors cause signal fading, limiting a limited communication range
    for UVLC systems. Another degradation of signal fading is multi-path propagation
    that generates an inter-symbol interference (ISI). In this context, the fading-free
    impulse response (FFIR) of UVLC channel, which is a MIMO-UVLC system, has been
    recently investigated in [105]. In [105], the authors presented a thorough approach
    to UVLC channel characterization, performance analysis, and effective transmission
    along with the reception methods of the proposed system model. Moreover, in another
    study [120], the authors proposed a CDMA-UVLC approach based on assigning unique
    Optical Orthogonal Codes (OOC) for each underwater mobile user. An underwater
    cellular optical CDMA network and related applications of serial relaying mechanism
    has been recently proposed in [121] and [122]. The wireless signal transmission
    underwater is challenging, especially when optical transceivers are deployed.
    Acoustic and VLC are complementary deployable communication technologies to fulfill
    the desired communication gap in the wireless communication domain. However, acoustic
    link suffers signal attenuation and high signal propagation latency. The implantation
    of acoustic transceivers is expensive, bulky (highly challenging to deploy rather
    than optical setup), and high power consumption. The VLC link is considered as
    an alternative viable underwater signaling technology over moderate distances
    compared with acoustic and EM waves. To mitigate all the above facts, optical
    communication systems are defined as horizontal and vertical or slant links according
    to their implementation direction [123]. The horizontal links are proposed to
    improve the system performance and minimize the turbulence effects [63]. On the
    other hand, in the underwater vertical or slant link scenario, the transceivers
    are arranged in LOS link configuration [100]. A. Underwater VLC Configuration
    Links UWC is expected to achieve desirable receiving information in the underwater
    environment significantly. The design of a VLC link can be classified into three
    most significant categories such as i) UVLC Line of sight (LOS) link, ii) Retro-reflector
    assisted LOS link, and iii) Non-LOS configuration link. UVLC Line of Sight Communication
    (LOS) Link:- Generally, in optical communication LOS links are widely used; the
    LOS scenario is depicted by Fig.2. In this scenario, the deployable transceivers
    should be aligned and directly linked to one another in the line of direction
    of signal propagation. This type of combination supports and enhances the power
    efficiency, as well as immunity of the environmental distorting effects such as
    ambient and artificial light source [124]. Additionally, the LOS scenario is the
    most reliable approach for an underwater wireless communication system in terms
    of high data rate, better BER performance, improving system efficiency, and system
    performance. However, the drawback of LOS links is the mobility of transceivers
    due to water currents and the random flow of water waves. Even the received optical
    signals depend on the physical parameters of the experimental setup. According
    to [124], the LOS communication link by using laser diode wavelength 470nm is
    capable of covering 200m distance in the deep ocean that allowed 5Mbps data-rate
    transmission. On the other hand, in coastal ocean water, yellow-green LEDs are
    the optimal solution to deal with the signal scattering, and field of view (FOV)
    a wide-angle of beam causes increased attenuation. The propagation loss under
    Beer Lmabert’s law can be defined as follows [125], h pl ij (λ, d ij )=exp{−c(λ)
    d ij }, (1) View Source where i , j are denoted the transmitter and receiver nodes,
    the euclidean distance between the transceivers and the total sum of absorption
    and scattering as extinction coefficient are defined as d ij and c(λ) , respectively.
    The propagation losses depend on the path loss component as well as the geometrical
    parameters of the setup. Generally, the geometrical gain in optical LOS scenario
    can be written as [79], h gl ij = A i cos( ϕ ij ) 2π(1−cos( θ i ) d 2 ij , (2)
    View Source where the receiver aperture area of nodes and the beam divergence
    angle of i th transmitters are represented as A i and θ i , respectively. Furthermore,
    the channel conditions, which are the contribution of the path-loss and geometrical
    losses, are defined as follows [101], h ij = h pl ij + h gl ij . (3) View Source
    The channel conditions h ij is modified by replacing (1) and (2) into (3) given
    as follows, h ij = 2π(1−cos( θ i ) d 2 ij ) e {−c(λ) d ij } + A i cos( ϕ ij )
    2π(1−cos( θ i ) d 2 ij ) . (4) View Source Furthermore, for approximation of the
    maximum achievable distance to achieve a specified bit-error-rate is investigated
    in [101], which can be defined as, d ij = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ W( c(λ) 2 (1−T)( D r
    θ F ) h ( T−1 2 ) ij ) c(λ) 2 (1−T) ( D r θ F ) T ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ 1 1−T (5) View
    Source where W , D r , T , and θ F represent the Lambert-W function, the aperture
    diameter, the correction coefficient for data fitting with the simulation results,
    and divergence angle for full-width transmitted beam, respectively. For the LOS
    of laser diode, the divergence angle is generally planned for few milliradians,
    whereas LEDs fixed a divergence angle below 140 milliradians for diffusing light
    to a wide-angle [13]. At the receiver end, the received power ( P j t ) describes
    the product of transmission power efficiency, channel gain, propagation loss,
    and geometrical loss [79] of setup i.e. P j t = P i t η i t η j r h gl ij χ( ψ
    j i ) h pl ij (c(λ), d ij cos( ϕ j i ) ), (6) View Source where P j t , P j r
    , η i t , η j r , χ( ψ j i ) and ψ j i are denoted as the transmission and received
    signal powers, transceivers efficiencies, concentrator gain, and the incident
    angle concerning the receiver axis, respectively. UVLC Retro-reflector-assisted
    LOS Link: Optical retro-reflector type links are based on the back-scatter phenomenon
    principle consisting of a light source with an optical reflector. In this scenario,
    the capacity of the source is more powerful than the receiver node [125]. Although,
    the reflector is considered an interrogator with a basic anatomical design with
    minimal power availability. Consequently, the optical beam propagation source
    continuously emits a light beam during propagation of the light signal modulated
    and reflected by a local reflector then received by the destination. A UVLC retro-reflector
    LOS link is depicted by Fig.3. In more contrast, the retro-reflector scenario
    is sub-divided into two significant categories known as photon-limited and contrast-limited
    retro-reflector [5]. The photon-limited retro-reflector phenomena occurs in shallow
    waters such as lakes, deltas, and rivers either clear sea waters. In this scenario,
    the link range and the system capacity depends on the received falling photons
    at the detector end due to absorption phenomena. Although, the retro-reflector
    link is most widely used in turbid harbor water mediums, where signal scattering
    is considered an influential factor for system range and capacity. A contrast
    limitation for more specific uses underwater imaging applications is reducing
    the number of photons responsible for reducing the image contrast and quality.
    The reflector is capable of amplifying the modulated signal or light beam for
    the sake of better system performance in both scenarios as photon and contrast
    limited retro-reflectors [13]. Even, the retro-reflectors reflect the modulated
    beam and signals to the interrogator when the modulated signals are received on
    it [125]. In this retro-reflector design, if η t , η r , and η Ret are the optical
    transmitter efficiency, receiver efficiency and retro-reflector efficiency, then
    the received power in retro-reflector link is given as follows [13], [125], P
    j r = P i t η t η r η Ret h ij χ( ψ j i ) h j i (λ, 2 d ij cos( ϕ i ) ) ×[ A j
    cos( ϕ j i ) 2π d 2 ij (1−cos( θ i )) ][ A r cos( ϕ ij ) π d ij tan( θ r ) 2 ],
    (7) View Source where the aperture receiver area of reflector, the divergence
    angle of the reflector, and the angle between the receiver trajectory of the source
    are denoted by A r , θ r , and ϕ j i , respectively. UVLC Non-LOS Configuration
    Link:- Non-line of sight (NLOS) optical signal propagation happens due to existing
    or suspended large scale particles or obstructions, even misalignment of the transceivers,
    and random orientation of the transceivers in underwater mediums. In this aspect,
    the reflected light from the sea surface or the bottom of water reservoirs (in
    shallow regions) could be beneficial to facilitate multi-point communication as
    depicted in Fig.4. In the NLOS scenario, the cone of light is emitted by the source
    with inner and outer angles θ min and θ max in an upward direction. This upward
    optical beam strikes with the water surface with an annular area A nn , either
    a reflection of the light beam strikes with the ocean surface and reached the
    desired nodes. In contrast, if the transceivers are designed vertically upward,
    then the propagated beam partially refracts and partially reflects with the water
    surface. The reflected light beam propagates from the transmitter, which locates
    x distance apart water surface as depicted in Fig.4, where A nn is defined as
    equal power density while apart at a distance x 0 . The annular surface area can
    be written as follows [125], A ann =2π(x+ x 0 ) 2 [cos( θ min )−cos( θ max )],
    (8) View Source where (x+ x 0 ) is defined as the radius of the spherical geometry,
    which means the uniform power density in free space. The received power at the
    specified destination in the NLOS scenario is expressed as [126], P j r = P i
    t η i t η r j h NLOS ij χ( ψ j i ) h pl ij (c(λ), x+ x 0 cos( ϕ j i ) ). (9) View
    Source B. The Necessities and Advantages of UVLC UVLC has become a potential wireless
    candidate (transmission standard IEEE 802.15.7) for signal transmission in an
    underwater environment without any interference as in RF signaling. There are
    plenty of benefits to deploying VLC over traditional acoustic waves as very cost-effective,
    easy to install, high data transmission 3Gbit/s, real-time monitoring [105], and
    the collection of bathymetric data [127]. Under consideration of UVLC the blue-green
    colored optical wavelengths have been chosen for no-radiation and non-harmful
    for underwater species [128]. Numerous applications are deployed underwater where
    channel conditions emerge with a high-power LED-based VLC system. For real-time
    communication scenarios the underwater sensor network nodes (UWSNs) are connected
    with visible light sources and further communicate with the base station (BS)
    [129]. The sensors positioning system and localization in the UVLC system have
    been drawn attention in the literature in supporting and improving the system
    capacity and efficiency. For instance in the initial stage of VLC, it was deployed
    intensively in mining sectors and further used as a wireless candidate in underground
    areas [130]. The electromagnetic waves as VLC counterparts, are absorbed and effortlessly
    attenuated by underground channels. Therefore, the evolution of VLC technology
    to bridge the gap in such complex applications as mining sectors, tunnel operations,
    and underwater communication. Due to this, most organizations are seeking further
    developments in the VLC communication systems. It turns the clock back as Disney
    Research had developed an in-light lightning system for their theme parks [131].
    Huawei just recently signed an agreement with a German company Schnell Li-Fi to
    build optical hospitals that make the hospitals smarter and remotely operation
    could be possible through the wireless connected medical equipment [132]. These
    applications will support safer operations because visible light is free of interference
    compared to electromagnetic carriers. Another key driver is that the VLC (enabled
    LEDs) can deploy and make the oceans smarter, supporting an urgent need for efficient
    and highly secure communication. The micro-LEDs are being used for high data transmission
    in VLC systems. However, LEDs are tiny in size, and transmission power is relatively
    low compared to the laser. At a glance, lasers are not associated with the efficiency
    Doppler effect, which means they can reach higher power and higher power density
    even a very tiny device. Also, the laser operation in the stimulated emission
    regime has a much higher modulation bandwidth compared with LEDs. The requirement
    is to move from LED to laser source because lasers have more advantages over LEDs.
    A recently developed narrow bandwidth blue lasers-based distributed feedback laser
    (DFB) wave-guide structure has been proposed [133]. The DFB laser structure with
    III-layer nitride is still under development. An experimented wave-guide structure
    builds a high-speed DFB blue laser with enormous potential for future speed Li-Fi
    applications. C. The Characterization of Oceanic Layers Generally, the deep oceans
    are categorized into three distinct zones for optical signaling, i.e., Euphotic,
    Disphotic, and Aphotic zones widely known as sunlight zone, twilight zone, and
    midnight zone, respectively, depicted in Fig.5. The range of the visible light
    signal, living organisms, and the variation of pressure concerning the depth is
    also summarized in Fig.5. Euphotic zone: The sunlight zone is the top layer of
    the water surface; enough amount of sunlight penetrates this zone. The green algae
    can survive due to the primary source of sunlight, and photosynthesis happens
    [134]. Moreover, the living creatures can be found in this zone [135]. The typical
    depth of this zone depends on water quality, such as the clarity or murkiness
    of the water. The depth of this zone varies in different in water types of waters.
    Euphotic zone can be quite deep up to hundreds of meters while it can be 15m meters
    in coastal ocean water in vertical column [5], [136]. Generally, the depth of
    the sunlight zone is approximated up to 200m from the water level. In this zone,
    the temperature fluctuates approximately 28 0 C to freezing point − 2 0 C [137].
    Twilight Zone: The twilight zone is formally known as the Disphotic zone, which
    is beneath the Euphotic zone. The expected depth of this zone varies from 200m
    to typically 1km in the ocean [138]. At this level, a small amount of light visualize
    and rarely the algae alive in this zone. The very dim light falls and the dim
    blue light could penetrate this zone. There is not sufficient light to sustain
    the photosynthesis process in the disphotic zone. Some adaptable creatures can
    be found in the Twilight zone. The pressure increases and the temperature falls
    due to increasing depth. Mid-Night zone: A vast portion of the ocean belongs to
    this layer, known as the Aphotic zone. Approximately 90% of the ocean consists
    in the Midnight zone. It is entirely dark; there is no light extent this massive
    unguided water sector. The water pressure extremely low and below the freezing
    point. The depth of the midnight zone varies more than 1000m to 11km where is
    no light has taken place. The temperature fluctuates far from a chilling temperature
    of 40C to −150C or below. Rarely or more specific living organisms and creatures
    can be found in this zone [139]. D. Different Water Types, Challenges & Affecting
    Factors in UVLC Systems Considering the channel conditions which affect optical
    signal propagation, the water has been categorized into different categories.
    According to [10], the three main types of waters exist and are classified for
    optical signaling as clearest water, intermediate water, and murkiest water. The
    geographical location of the clearest ocean water is located in the Mid-Pacific
    and Atlantic oceans, whereas intermediate water is possibly found in the Northern
    Pacific ocean. The North Sea and Eastern Atlantic oceans are the major water reservoirs
    of the murkiest water. Furthermore, another classification is commonly discussed
    in the open literature, which has been sub-divided into four distinctive categories:
    i) Pure seawater, ii) Clear ocean water, iii) Coastal ocean water, and finally,
    iv) Turbid harbor & estuary water. The light beam attenuates in these water differently.
    As in pure seawater the optical signals absorb because of the chemical composition,
    while the scattering loss occurs widely in clear ocean water due to its higher
    concentration of particles than pure seawater. A higher amount of particle concentration
    is founded in coastal ocean water rather than clear ocean water, which causes
    a higher rate of scattering and absorption of the light beam. Moreover, turbid
    harbor and estuary water has the highest concentration of particles. The deployment
    of UWOC is more challenging as per channel condition requirements. The channel
    properties vary with distinct water types and geographical conditions [10]. Additionally,
    another classification while the propagation of light beam based on the environmental,
    geographical conditions, and the chemical vitality of the water is categorized.
    The subcategories are called as IOPs, and AOPs [140]. The IOPs are only medium
    dependents on existing substances and the composition of the medium [140], while
    AOPs depend on both the mediums and nature of the light beam. The AOPs are used
    to evaluate the ambient light levels for communication near the water surface.
    AOPs contribute radiance, irradiance, and reluctance. In more contrast, the spectral
    absorptive coefficient and volume scattering function are the two main factors
    that are considered in IOPs [141]. The transmission of the light beam experiences
    the absorption of photons by water and further converts them into another form
    of energy to increase the temperature of water molecules. In absorption phenomena
    the signal path-loss occurs where the beam intensity does weaken and the propagated
    photons absorb by the channel. The absorption occurs by chlorophyll in phytoplankton
    at colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), by water molecules and existing salt
    contents [140]. Moreover, the CDOM matters are the combinations of the two components
    known as fulvic and humic acid as mentioned in [142]. In more detail, the absorption
    and scattering phenomena in different waters have been discussed in further subsections.
    The absorption effect is calculated in terms of wavelength and represented by
    α(λ) . Though, scattering is defined as the randomness of photons with the direction
    of beam propagation. The optical signal scattering phenomena occur by the vitality
    of salt ions in pure water and collimated with particle matters. The scattering
    coefficient measurement per meter is denoted by β(λ) . Due to scattering and absorption,
    the energy of the optical beam falls and occurs the overall attenuation. The typical
    values of α(λ) , β(λ) , and extinction coefficients c(λ) in different water mediums
    are summarized in Table 5. Absorption & Scattering Phenomenon in UWC:- Signal
    scattering in UVLC is the function that changes signal path, direction, and distance
    covered by photons in the underwater medium. The energy loss of optical beam by
    water (interaction between photon and water molecules) cause absorption, while
    the collision happens with suspended particles in UWOC. The optical signal absorption
    is an irreversible process where the photons lose their energy and improve the
    water temperature of water molecules. In more detail, if the photons strike with
    suspended particles and change their direction of propagation, scattering happens.
    The total energy loss of propagated optical beam due to absorption and scattering
    can be defined as the energy loss per meter. In addition to that an another cause
    of energy loss is inter-symbol interference (ISI), where the receiver aperture
    captures fewer incoming photons on its cross-sectional area. The extinction coefficient
    (summation absorption and scattering) is the signal loss phenomenon and directly
    affects the signal intensity and changes the direction of an optical beam. Concerning
    the physio-chemical properties of the channel and the geometrical model of absorption
    and scattering coefficient are proposed in [5] and [13]. Due to the harsh water
    channel conditions, the best way to understand the signal attenuation mechanism
    through a geometrical model of a water element is depicted by Fig.6. The optical
    beam energy is either absorbed by dangle particles or is transformed into heat
    energy, or raises water molecules thermal energy. Therefore, signal absorption
    affects signal strength, while the scattering phenomenon occurs the spreading
    photons randomly and strikes with the suspended particle. As a result, signals
    are partially received by detecting aperture or delayed to reach the destination.
    Thus, multi-path fading, time-jitter, and ISI occur in UWOC. To reduce ISI, the
    optimal multiple-symbol detection (MSD), as well as sub-optimal generalized MSD
    (GMSD) algorithms, are further investigated as in [105]. TABLE 5 The Typical Values
    of the Contribution Underwater Absorption, Scattering, and Extinction Coefficients.
    The Data is Applicable for Different Waters Mediums [5], [82] The recent surveys
    are detailed severe attenuation in optical signaling in harsh water cause absorption
    and scattering. Absorption and scattering are the two phenomenons responsible
    for signal fading caused by the suspended particles, the quality, and nature of
    water, dissolved organic matters affecting the signal strength, phase, and arrival
    angle of the received beam. The blue-green wavelength spectrum of visible light
    severs the minimum amount of absorption in pure seawater rather than coastal and
    turbid harbor water [143]. Moreover, light scattering is the cause of organic
    and inorganic matters due to the strong spatial and temporal dispersion of photons,
    which may affect photon strength and intensity [144]. E. Affecting Factors in
    UVLC Signaling In the UWOC system, the absorption and scattering effects light
    pulses by existing suspended particles leading to photons path loss and intensity
    deviation. Both of these signal fading factors are wavelength-dependent per meter
    of signal propagation distances. Generally, these factors occur due to the interaction
    of the light beam with micro and macromolecules of water, algal sediments, and
    color division organic materials. In general, the organic particles are responsible
    for absorbing photons while inorganic particles are creditworthy for scattering
    [143]. Further, the CDOM strongly absorbs the light photons in the ultra-violate
    (UV) spectrum [144]. The total signal fading contribution by absorption α(λ) and
    scattering β(λ) of optical beam energy loss describes in terms of extinction coefficient
    c(λ) known as signal attenuation as c(λ)=α(λ)+β(λ) . The extinction coefficient
    depends on the different water types. To formulate the expression for absorption
    and scattering, an elemental unit volume of water δ(V) with thickness δ(r) is
    considered and depicted by Fig.6. If the intensity of incident light-beam is denoted
    by P i (λ) with fixed wavelength λ collides with unitary elemental water volume.
    The incident beam is passing through the elemental volume and experiences absorption
    & scattering. The outcome beam is split into three fractions; as a certain amount
    of power, an incident beams P a (λ) absorbed and some extent of incident power
    P si (λ) will scatter at an angle ψ i . The remaining apparent beam P ri (λ) passed
    through the element and detected by receiver. Thus, the energy conservation law
    and total incident power is calculated as the addition of all above fractions,
    i.e., P i (λ)= P a (λ)+ P si (λ)+ P ri (λ) . Furthermore, the absorbed signal
    power ratio A(λ) and B(λ) scattered signal power ratio are defined as, A(λ)≡ P
    a (λ) P i (λ)  and  B(λ)≡ P s (λ) P i (λ) . (10) View Source In (10), the absorption
    and scattering ratios with the radius δr of an elemental water volume are infinitesimally
    small. Then taking the limits by an elemental water volume, the absorption and
    scattering coefficients can be written as [117], α(λ)= β(λ)= lim δ(r)→0 [δA(λ)/δ(r)]=dA(λ)/dr,
    lim δ(r)→0 [δB(λ)/δ(r)]=dB(λ)/dr, (11) (12) View Source Apart from the absorption
    and scattering, the seawater acts as a conductor medium for electromagnetic waves
    and offers dielectric properties for optical signaling [9]. In more precise terms,
    the seawater dramatically serves conductivity to dielectric at 250GHz frequency
    range [10]. However, underwater optical signals experience several extreme challenges
    and might be affected by fluctuation of scintillation index, scattering, absorption,
    dispersion, and temperature fluctuation due to the physio-chemical properties
    of the channel. Optical waves do not propagate simultaneously in water such as
    on a terrestrial basis, but accelerate exponentially in the water medium due to
    attenuation. The attenuation is the total contribution of signal fading, absorption,
    and scattering. In UWOC, scattering losses occur cause of discontinuity of the
    water molecules, while absorption occurs by the physical properties of channel
    conditions. In coastal ocean water, the optical signals are extremely corrupted
    by noise and path loss due to more scattering; the scattering event happens by
    the collision of the optical beam with the existing suspended particles and multiple
    reflections of angles [145]. The phenomena of absorption in UOWC have to be firmly
    taken into account cause several photons could reach the photo-detector or receiver
    end by passing harsh channel conditions. Absorption is a high wavelength-dependent
    process where the transmitted photons are absorbed and converted into chemical
    or heat energy of the water. For instance, in [142] the authors have modeled absorption
    coefficient under consideration of absorptivity by pure seawater in terms of chlorophyll
    as a function of wavelength. The absorption by chlorophyll is defined as the change
    in light beam intensity per meter of path length. The total contribution of absorption
    is the chlorophyll and the color dissolved organic components (CDOMs) i.e., [146]–[148]
    α(λ)= α w (λ)+ α cl (λ)+ α f (λ)+ α h (λ). (13) View Source In (13), the absorption
    coefficient of water, chlorophyll absorption coefficient are represented by α
    w (λ) and α cl (λ) . Moreover, the two CDOM components fulvic acid absorption
    coefficient α f (λ) , and humic acid absorption coefficient α h (λ) are defined,
    respectively. The individual absorption and scattering components for different
    water mediums are calculated in (14) and (15) to model. As a result, we consider
    transmitting the blue-colored spectrum wavelength (450nm) of visible light. The
    absorption coefficient by water types with respect to water concentration of ranges
    0≤ w c ≤15 mg/ m 3 , is calculated as follows, α w (λ)= α 0 w (λ) [ w c w 0 c
    ] a 0 w , (14) View Source where w 0 c =1mg/ m 3 is the reference water concentration.
    For the different types of water the a 0 w (λ) differentiate accordingly [142].
    The water concentration for different water types such as for pure sea water,
    clear ocean water, coastal ocean water and turbid harbor water varies 0.0405λ
    , 0.114λ , 0.179λ and 0.266λ , respectively. According to [145], the absorption
    component due to chlorophyll a cl (λ) with respect to the chlorophyll concentration
    C 0 c varies 0≤ C c ≤12mg/ m 3 , and can be written as, α cl (λ)= α 0 c (λ) [
    C c C 0 c ] 0.0602 , (15) View Source where the reference concentration of chlorophyll
    C 0 c =1mg/ m 3 , and α 0 c is equalized to 0.0602λ . Furthermore considering
    the CDOM components as, fulvic and humic acid absorption coefficients also formulated
    with respect to the chlorophyll concentration [146], α f (λ)= α h (λ)= α 0 f C
    f exp(− k f λ), α 0 h C h exp(− k h λ), (16) (17) View Source where the specific
    absorption coefficient for fulvic and humic acid component are a 0 f and a 0 h
    respectively. The concentrations of fulvic acid C f and humic acid C h in mg/
    m 3 can be expressed as follows [147], C f = C h = 1.74098 C c exp[0.12317( C
    c C 0 c )], 0.193348 C c exp[0.12343( C c C 0 c )]. (18) (19) View Source Due
    to suspended large and small scale particles underwater, the scattering phenomena
    occurs. The scattering coefficient β(λ) defines the total signal loss due to the
    redirection of the photons. In contrast, the total scattering is the sum of scattering
    coefficient of water β w (λ) , small particles β s (λ) , and large particle β
    l (λ) , respectively. The scattering function is wavelength and concentration-dependent.
    Therefore, total scattering can be calculated as [142], [146]–[148], β(λ)= β w
    (λ)+ β s (λ) C s + β l (λ) C l , (20) View Source where the small scale concentration
    C s and C l the concentration of large scale in g/ m 3 can be calculated as [145]
    C s = C l = 0.01739 C c exp[0.11631( C c C 0 c )]g/ m 3 , 0.76284 C c exp[0.03092(
    C c C 0 c )]g/ m 3 . (21) (22) View Source Another noticeable optical property
    concerning signal scattering is known as albedo scattering, which is the ratio
    of scattering signal loss to the total signal losses [144]. The albedo scattering
    number is formed as, ω 0 = (Scattering signals β(λ) )/(Total signal scattering
    c(λ) ). The albedo number shows a significant scale factor to measure absorptivity
    or scattering of water medium, which varies from 0.25 to 0.8 for clear ocean water
    to turbid coastal water. The scattering phenomenon is stated as the detected optical
    information in terms of angular, temporal, and polarization which causes the degradation
    in the number of photons at the receiver end. The cause of suspended CDOM and
    inorganic particles, the scattering coefficient may be termed as the function
    of the volumetric scattering function β v (VSF) over total angles (θ) as follows
    [149], β(λ)=2π ∫ π 0 β vsf (λ;θ)sin(θ)dθ. (23) View Source Moreover, the VSF is
    prescribed the normalization of β(λ) by the scattering phase function. Therefore,
    the spectral VSF coefficient β ¯ v (θ,λ ) is defined as follows, β ¯ v (θ,λ)=
    β v (λ,θ) β . (24) View Source Simultaneously, the optical beam propagated through
    the water channel and lost some fraction of its propagation energy in interaction
    with water molecules, number of biological substances, CDOM, etc. The are two
    signal-affecting mechanisms widely considered as absorption and scattering. The
    optical signals are severely affected by the channel turbidity due to the random
    fluctuation of the refraction index. F. Turbulence Turbulence is another cause
    of optical signal fading resulting from the random fluctuation in the refractive
    index. Plenty of valuable experimental results have recently been recorded in
    the open literature on characterizing underwater optical turbulence (UOT). In
    other words, turbidity is described as the varying changes in refractive index
    due to fluctuation of density, salinity, and pressure of underwater environment
    that affects optical signal propagation. It means the random variation in scintillation
    index induced turbidity in the channel environment. The consistency of oceanic
    turbulence occurs by wave current, physio-chemical properties of water, large,
    and small suspended particles. The wave currents are defined as weak to strong
    turbulence conditions based on Reynolds number. If Reynolds number ρ≤1000 , then
    water flow is considered laminar or steady flow, with the minimal fluctuation
    in scintillation index. Whether, if it is 1000 ≤ρ≤2000 , then the flow has shown
    uncertainty, which means weak turbulence channel conditions. In the case where
    Reynolds number 2000≤ρ exceeds 4000, then it is considered as heavy turbulence
    channel conditions. G. Affect of Noise in UWOC Noise is the factor that corrupts
    the signals, which directly affects the signal efficiency during communication.
    In UWOC, the noise occurs due to the reception of a random variation of photons
    propagation by transceivers. Different background noise sources are widely studied,
    such as quantum shot noise, optical-excess noise, optical background noise, photo-detector
    dark current noise, diffused extended background noise, background noise from
    sunlight, or other objects in the optical communication systems received at the
    receiver end. There are different types of noises in UWOC are recorded in existing
    literature [4], [5], [9], [150]. Optical Excess Noise: The communication setup
    should be more accurate and reliable for information transmission purposes. However,
    some irregularities or faults in the experimental setup causes falling transmission
    accuracy. Due to inaccuracy of the transceivers noise occurrence, the glitches
    happen and corrupt the received signals defined as excess optical noise. Background
    Noise: In contrast to this noise, background noise is considered black-body radiation;
    the refracted sunlight is responsible as the main source of background noise.
    This type of noise majorly interfered by the sunlight, limiting the optical system
    performance for tens of meters (mostly in the Euphotic zone). The noise contribution
    of total background environment in the literature is recorded as in [4], [5],
    [9], and [150]. The total background noise power in optical signal propagation
    is defined as follows [150], P BG = P B G sol + P B G black−body . (25) View Source
    For channel modeling, the background noise variance σ 2 BG =2qR P BG B , depends
    on electronic signal bandwidth B , power of solar background P B G sol , and electron
    charge q , respectively. Furthermore, P B G sol is expressed as, P B G sol = A
    R (πFOV ) 2 δλ T F L sol . (26) View Source In (26), the receiver aperture area,
    the optical filter transmissivity is presented by A R , and T F , respectively.
    However, the solar radiance also depends on down-welling irradiance E , underwater
    reflectance of down-welling irradiance R , the directional dependence of underwater
    radiance L f , diffuse attenuation coefficient K , and the underwater depth d
    . Therefore, the solar radiance L sol is expressed by (27) as follows, L sol =
    ER L f exp(−Kd) π . (27) View Source Furthermore, the noise power of a black-body
    irradiance expressed as P BG = 2h c 2 γ A R (πFOV ) 2 δλ T A T F (λ ) 5 [ e (hc/λkT)
    −1] , (28) View Source where c , h , k , and γ are described as the speed of light,
    the Plank constant, the Boltzmann constant and the radiant factor. Moreover, the
    signal transmission factor in underwater is defined as T A =exp(− τ 0 ) . Photo-Detector
    Dark Current Noise: The dark current noise is described and related to the photo-diode
    [35]. This type of noise occurs due to electrical current leakage from the photodetector.
    The variance of the dark current noise can be defined by (29), which is the function
    of electron charge q , the DC intensity I DC , and electronic bandwidth [150],
    σ 2 DC =2q I DC B. (29) View Source Current Shot Noise: This type of noise is
    generated while receiving the signals at the receiver end. If the signal power
    symbolized by P s , then the shot noise variance can be written as [10], σ 2 ss
    =2qr P s B. (30) View Source Thermal Noise: The random motion of electrons generates
    noise within the conductor medium due to a temperature rise. To model the thermal
    noise, if it considers The noise figure parameters F=4 , load resistance R l =100Ω
    , and equivalent temperature T e =290K are taken, then thermal noise variance
    given as [10], [150] σ 2 TH = 4k T e FB R l . (31) View Source In the UWOC system
    model, the sum of total noise variances is responsible for the system noise. Therefore,
    without any interference of optical signal, the noise variances of electrical
    current at the detector end is given as, σ 2 I = σ 2 TH + σ 2 DC + σ 2 BG + σ
    2 ss . (32) View Source SECTION IV. Transceivers for UVLC A. Transmitter and Transducer
    The function of optical transducers is to transform the modulated information
    into an optical or electrical or vice-versa signal pattern. The transducers are
    mounted on transceivers and fixed on a well-defined path for smooth signal propagation
    in an underwater medium. In another words, the transducers are designed to generate
    an optical signal from an electrical signal made from optical transmitters during
    optical beam propagation. On the other hand, an actuator can be used in UWOC [9]
    to generate the pulse of optical signal in electrical format at the receiver end.
    With the rapidly increasing interest in exploring aquatic media, UWOC plays a
    vital role in realizing a wide range of scientific, commercial, and coastal security
    applications. VLC is an alternative communication media as a UWOC implementation
    in the range of LEDs illuminating light sources. In UVLC, the transmitter transforms
    digital information into analog format over channel conditions. Generally, LEDs
    and LDs are used for signal transmission over high data rates and bandwidth. Another
    adhesive advantage is LED structure, where the photons are emitted spontaneously
    at different phases. In coherent radiation, the photons are stimulate by another
    photon that is radiated with phase correlation [151]. More precisely, LEDs excel
    as incandescent reliable light sources, power consumption devices, and efficient
    luminous tools. The LEDs efficiency operate 210 m/W more than the incandescent
    lamps efficiency [45]. The multi-functional transmitter-enabled LEDs emit light
    and information simultaneously with the optical dimming power this is most widely
    used; for efficient signal propagation while the optical transmitters do not use
    flickering phenomena. In a general aspect, the LEDs are designed for white-light
    emission sources and divided into two categories: blue and red-green-blue (RGB)
    emitting types of LEDs. Both types of LEDs emit different colors of light, as
    yellow-white light causes phosphorus polishing. Blue LEDs are considered more
    energy-efficient and widely use for light illuminating systems rather than blue
    LEDs. The blue-LEDs could achieve reliability for optical signal transmission
    by combining yellow color (RGBY). In optical beam propagation, the VLC link depends
    on the dimming or switching nature of LEDs. The optical sources are categorized
    as laser transmitter type or an LED type optical transmitter. Consequently, the
    laser type of technological sources quiet different and are used according to
    the application requirement. An argon-ion laser is a well-known laser transmitter
    suitable for converting electrical signals into an optical format [10]. A transducer
    assists in converting and then transmitting all maximum quantities of photons
    toward the receiver or other nodes. For optical signal modulation, different types
    of laser modulators are being used. In general, the laser modulator is designed
    for low data rates over long-distance signal propagation, [9]. Compared to laser
    modulators, LEDs are cheaper though they cover very short ranges. The arrangement
    of an LED array is designed in a hexagonal type pyramidal shape for high-intensity
    and long-distance optical beam propagation, as proposed in [148]. In this type
    of pyramidal LED array structure, a single lens is used to illuminate the LED.
    This structure must be very compact for the output signals. For the sake of a
    signal, the direction can be created by switching an intense beam towards the
    destination. B. Optical Receiver Optical receivers are the collection arrangements
    of all-optical signal transmission within a medium. In other words, receivers
    could be defined as the process of optical signal entities absorbed by the photodetector
    and the photons detection on its surface to generate an electrical signal called
    an optical receiver. The conversion process of photons energy into an electrical
    signal is performed through photoelectric effect. Otherwise stated, the received
    photons at the semiconductor junction diodes release either an electron or a hole.
    Subsequently, these released entities moved to the conductance and release their
    excessive energies [21]. The propagated optics are collected by a lens for the
    detection and demodulation process at the receiver end. A photo-sensor is used
    to convert optical signals for further analysis. Taking into account improving
    system performance, a photo-sensor is characterized as easily accessible, very
    cost-effective, robust, and small in size, along with the low current consumption
    [152]. To cope with these advantages, plenty of different types of photo-sensors
    are being used and summarized in recent surveys as [9], [152]. These photo-sensors
    are photo-resistors, phototransistors, photomultiplier tubes, avalanche photodiode
    (APD), p-n photodiodes, and a photon detector semiconductor, photo-sensors, and
    biologically-inspired quantum photo-sensors (BQP). PIN and avalanche photodiode
    (APD) are widely used as a photodetectors in optical communication [153]. SECTION
    V. Current Project Schemes on UVLC In this section, we provide the details of
    the most recent current project in underwater medium currently running worldwide.
    A wide detailed description are summarized in Table 6. Most recently, UNEXMIN
    project scheme [154] was launched and funded by the European Commission (EU) for
    3D mapping and more widely autonomous exploration of European flooded mines (AUEFM)
    during the period of 2016 – 2019. The main purpose of this project scheme was
    to develop a novel underwater robotic system for bathymetric, oceanographic, oceanic
    bathyscaphical data collection, and ocean exploration in 3D geographical imaging
    in real-time monitoring and video streaming. The Robotics Explorer is made by
    three robots named UX-1a, UX-1b, and UX-1c to adjoining for the purpose of valuable
    geological and mineralogical information collection. UX-1 is the first prototype
    was proposed to open the new technological lines and uncover mysterious challenges
    in this research project development. The first prototype was finished in April
    2018 and has been tested at the Kaatiala mine (Finnland), Idrija mine (Slovenia),
    during 2018, and later in Urgeirca mine (Portugal), Ecton mine (England), Molnar
    Janos cave (Hungary) during 2019. The Surf3DSLAM project [155] was coordinated
    by the University de Girona, Spain, and proposed an innovative research proposal
    for Probabilistic 3D Surface Matching for Bathymetry based Simultaneous Localization
    and Mapping (Surf3DSLAM) by deploying aquatic vehicles. The main challenges of
    this research project were navigation and detection of the exact position of the
    underwater vehicles. Further development of this project scheme proposed a remotely
    operated underwater vehicle (ROV) instead of AUV that supports low operational
    cost. The main objective of Surf3DSLAM was to accurately localize the ROVs and
    AUVs in 3D environmental space under the concept of simultaneous localization
    and mapping (SLAM). To associate SLAM within the 3D environment, the whole investigation
    was addressed as Surf3DSLAM. Surf3DSLAM framework mainly aimed to deploy AUVs
    for navigation purposes, replace other economical, efficient robotics vehicles,
    and further deploy for safe and precise surveys in an unguided aqueous environment.
    Most recently underwater activities are unveiling the mystery of occupied water
    territories and exploring natural mineral sources. Due to this, project scheme
    as Submarine Cultures Perform Long-Term Robotic Exploration of Unconventional
    Environmental (subCULTron) [156] was proposed and coordinated by the University
    Graz, Austria. This project was launched and aimed to achieve a long-lasting self-determination
    learning device, a self-configurable, self-maintainable underwater robotic tool
    in very high-impact-modified application areas in Italy. The main perspectives
    of this project are to develop a better quality of communication and energy harvesting
    among the underwater sensor nodes. The subCULTron is subdivided into few sections
    as the entitled project. The upper layer of sea surface in the proposed system,
    and the artificial objectives are introduced as the information collective robotic
    tools for long-run system exploration capabilities. The artificial robotic tool
    allows monitoring the marine environment, and the incredible natural oceanic environments,
    including biological materials such as algae, bacterium, and aquatic species.
    In contrast through subCULTron, a deployed artificial lily-pad on water surface
    communicates with human-culture and transmit energy along with the collected information
    from ship traffic. Apart from that, the artificial fish floats and exchanges information
    with mussels and lily-pad. The subCULTron is aimed to propose the real world for
    humans and animals in cohabitants of high impact such as venice canals and lagoon.
    Thus, the cultural evolution promotes a sub-culture development and an artificial
    society underwater along with the cultural services of human society over the
    water reservoir. The TRIDENT project scheme [157] formally known as Marine Robots,
    and Dexterous Manipulation for Enabling Autonomous Underwater Multipurpose Intervention
    Missions (MRDME-AUMIM) was proposed for multipurpose underwater challenges in
    highly turbid and complexity channel conditions. In other words, the development
    of novel methodology for marine robotics systems accommodates versatile dexterous
    adaption and the capabilities for operational activities in unguided underwater
    environments. This project scheme also has drawn attention to various specific
    skills in marine environments: navigation, bathymetric data, geographical mapping,
    vehicle-manipulator systems, dexterous manipulation, and the development of a
    wide range of intelligent control UWSNs architectural techniques. The project
    has been classified into two phases. In its first phase, the autonomous surface
    craft (ASC) is carried AUV towards the sector to be surveyed, while in the second
    phase, the assembly of ASC and AUV navigate the underwater targeted position.
    The latest project scheme [158] entitled Smart and Networking Under Water Robots
    in Cooperation Meshes (SWARMs) was funded by the EU and also coordinated by Universidad
    Politechnica de Madrid, succeeded to forward the extensive research of AUVs/ROVs
    to the next level. The further development of AUVs/ROVs research provides a solution
    to the threat of offshore industries. SWARM project aimed to expand a better utilization
    of robotics in underwater, various marine applications and offshore operations,
    which affects the assigned safety patterns and operational costs. The main attraction
    of the project research is to improve AUVs’ autonomy and enhance the usability
    of ROVs in the underwater environment. Moreover, no specialized underwater vehicles
    are required; instead of AUVs/ROVs work in a cooperative network; as a result,
    it opens the doors for new futuristic underwater applications. At a glance, the
    achievements of SWARM could be demonstrated in several testing sites and numerous
    applications such as inspection and water pollution monitoring. Oceans and seas
    are the source of life on earth and the most significant water source for humankind.
    Nevertheless, these water reservoirs are affected by human interactive activities.
    Therefore, exploring these massive water mediums are necessary by deploying artificial
    devices or robots, called marine robots. In general, the vitality of marine robotics
    technology is an enormous significance in an extensive range of functional underwater
    applications. These applications are mostly utilized to observe and monitor purpose
    and the life beneath the water surface, observation of water pollution, oil and
    gas rig observations, surveillance and coastal securities, fish farming, and early
    detection warning of natural disasters. Given this, an innovation of the project
    scheme Sibiu-HCEV [159], is introduced as the resolution of an intelligent hybrid
    high capacity electric underwater ROVs. The Sibiu-HCEV is an underwater floatable
    robot at different depths in an unguided water environment that is an innovative
    invention in underwater robotics technology to reduce risk to the capital expenditure
    (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX). Marine robotics industries are rapidly
    growing up to uncover the complexity of harsh oceanic environments. The marine
    robots have pulled back the curtains of the mysterious thesaurus of the deepest
    oceans. This underwater robotics industrial sector is a crucial, significantly
    cost-effective domain with considerable entry barriers to resources and developments.
    The project EUMarineRobots [160] is aimed to extend the underwater challenges
    into more depth, remotely operations, and in the very hostile marine environment.
    Additionally, the aim of EUMarineRobots are deploying for a full range of air
    and open international access to Europe. EUMarineRobots has an impressive research
    group from ten countries in marine robotics research infrastructure network. This
    network distinguishes the various technical infrastructures for diverse navigation
    beyond marine and in the marine robotic sectors. Since the early ages, underwater
    applications are based on acoustic links for long range communications. However,
    RF and optical waves are capable of supporting large bandwidth and high data rates
    but efficiently attenuated due to the physio-chemical vitality of the marine environment.
    The primary objectives of the project were recently proposed as UNDERWORLD [161]
    to re-evaluate the electromagnetic communication through UWSNs deployment for
    various underwater applications such as navigation, localization, natural disaster,
    detection of coral reefs, and coastal security purposes in real-time scenarios.
    This project aims to enhance industrialization in marine observatory systems,
    naval tactical operations, seaport management infrastructures, and underwater
    environmental monitoring. Moreover, underwater environmental monitoring in an
    aqueous medium is widely deployed with acoustic waves, but these applications
    apply in shallow waters such as rivers, dams, lakes, and remotely coastal areas.
    Throughout this project scheme. Another main contribution of this project is to
    improve the characteristics of antennas for two ways of communication among transceivers.
    Earthquakes, Tsunami, and floods are sudden natural events which occur due to
    an imbalance of water reservoirs and waves (water currents). These events are
    entirely impossible to control or prevent but can be detected earlier by deploying
    the sensors nodes or anchored architecture of UWSNs with the sea bottoms. The
    seismometers are used to sense the unacceptable seismic frequency at a standardized
    scale. These seismometers are highly detectable sensor nodes those capable for
    detecting and recording waves emitted by the most miniature earthquakes. It is
    far expensive to deploy seismometers at the ocean bottom to investigate water
    currents and seismic waves detection. Due to these issues, the novel project scheme
    funded by the EU entitled Ocean-DAS had recently proposed new tools for underwater
    seismology through ocean-bottom distributed acoustic sensors [162]. The main aim
    of Ocean-DAS is to develop a low-cost deployable alternatives for monitoring seismicity
    in remote areas of the oceans. The Ocean-DAS are enabled with the fiber optical
    wires for telecommunication which transforms the data into powerful seismic sensing
    arrays. Through the support of this opto-electronic unit, more than a 50km span
    could be monitored. The most recent project scheme is proposed entitled as Cooperative
    Underwater Surveillance Networks (COUSIN) funded by Engineering and Physical Sciences
    Research Council (EPSRC) [163] during 2021s to 2023s. The project scheme focuses
    on the underwater surveillance system for a specific country or region. The surveillance
    system is investigated for more precise benefits in various underwater applications
    in numerous fields such as pollution monitoring, coastal or harbor securities,
    import and export duties, human trafficking, smuggling, maintaining integrity,
    and detecting attacks on underwater infrastructure. The main expected contribution
    of this project scheme is to track, target and search for suspicious objects,
    and convey information to the base station for further investigation. The detectable
    target through this project scheme could be an artificial object such as UUV,
    surface vehicle, submarine, source of pollution, underwater species, active volcanos,
    oil & gas pipeline repaitment, ice objects, or divers, etc. Furthermore, surveillance
    and underwater monitoring are the main functions through the long-range acoustic
    link. For underwater geographical mapping and target detection, the SONAR waves
    are the key beneficial technologies while over the sea-surface detection, radio
    detection and ranging (RADAR) are the most widely used. The main objective of
    COUSIN is to design a low-cost underwater acoustic network to improve the underwater
    monitoring and surveillance system capabilities. The current ongoing project scheme
    entitled Technologies for Ocean Sensing (TechOceanS) [164] funded by the European
    Commission (EC) and coordinated by the National Oceanography Center, UK. TechOceanS
    is organized by the research group of ten universities in Europe. The oceans are
    affected by human beings by flushing and trashing unwanted decomposable materials
    such as plastics that are threatening to harm underwater species. Due to human
    activities direct and indirect involvement in the underwater environment, the
    ice caps melt, and the water level rises. Therefore, an urgent need to deploy
    an advanced ocean observational technology through resistance to extract the decompose
    plastic materials. At first glance, the project has developed the scheme to monitor
    and observe ocean biology, chemical composition changes, and plastic monitoring
    through underwater vehicles nine pioneering technologies. The proposed novel solution
    by TechnOceanS is comprised of a group of five sensors; the two sensors are used
    for imaging data collection of the specified seabed, marine biology, and plastics.
    A sampler is used to collect thousands of particle samples for further analysis
    and the rest of use for a new artificial intelligence (AI)- based image processing
    method for data compression and information transmission. The most recent proceeding
    project scheme established for Long Distance Underwater Wireless Optical Communication
    System using Visible Light Laser Array with Directivity Control Function (LD-UWC-VLC-LADCF)
    [165], and funded by Japan Society for the Promotion Science (JSPS). The purpose
    of this scheme is to improve the quality of visible light signaling over long
    ranges in the underwater environment. In this research perspective, the main two
    challenges are extending the transmission distance in gigabit-class with high-speed
    UWOC. The first point is the verification of the effect of distance extension
    while multiple visible light laser are propagated propagating in a high turbid
    water medium. Secondly, the construction of a light beam in a particular direction
    through evaluating the experimental data available. TABLE 6 The Latest Underwater
    Communication Project Schemes are Currently Running All Around the World. Additionally,
    the Future Directions and the Most Significant Contribution in the Scientific
    Community, Underwater Applications, and the Results of the Corresponding Project
    Schemes are Summarized SECTION VI. Computational Methods Nowadays, solving complex
    and huge data-based problems are typically possible without a real experimental
    setups. This is achieved through simulation-enabled computer science and engineering
    methodologies. Moreover, computational engineering methods support automaticity,
    design, and optimization of the complex problems. Therefore, the computational
    research methods provide the new advancements investigating the mythologies in
    computing such as algorithms, models, simulations, and system performances in
    order to understand the complexity of social, biological, technological, and everlasting
    patterns and their behaviors [166]. These computational research methodologies
    provide a solution for better understanding of random behavior of the system as
    follows: Automatically categorization and information extraction of the selected
    data-sets; Differentiate a bulk data into a specific group and particular level
    for the analysis; The system design and model of the emergence of new behaviors
    from individual-level interactions; A detailed explanation of emergence of a system
    network; Recognizes and refrigerates the thresholds within a complex system; Classifies
    and finds a the pattern within the massive data-sets for further analysis by using
    other techniques; Identify meaningful structural patterns within the webs of relationships.
    In more detail, computational engineering methodologies are defined as the development
    and exploitation of more realistic computational models. As a result, the computational
    engineering methodology opens new perspectives and challenges of more sophisticated
    key problems of huge data structures. Additionally, computational methodologies
    are numerically mathematical and depends heavily on computer architectural system.
    It means that the numerical efficiency should be achieved by extracting the maximum
    amount of correct information from the minimum number of grid points, as well
    as establishing a linear proportionality between the incoming time and the unknown
    number. Due to this, several computational approaches are studied in this study
    as follows. A. Monte-Carlo Computational Method The probabilistic format of the
    computational method is widely known as the Monte-Carlo simulation. In UWOC, this
    computational method is used to track the number of photons emitted by an optical
    source within the underwater medium. A high bandwidth underwater optical communication
    channel by utilizing Monte-Carlo simulation is widely discussed in [167]. The
    simulation approach of photons propagation is rigorous within turbid medium, in
    a more detailed description, Monte-Carlo simulation computational methods are
    used to provide the specific details of the propagated photons geometry as mentioned
    in [168] and [169]. Generally, the optical signals propagation depends on the
    medium waves. This is an alternative computational approach to eliminate the unbounded
    error growth in co-variance equation computationally as described in [170]. B.
    Numerical Modeling of Wave Propagation As aforementioned, that the optical beam
    spreads in an underwater medium and depends on the water flow (channel conditions).
    The different types of water flow have been categorized and summarized according
    to the flow pattern in [171]. Laminar flow is defined as where the fluid particles
    move along in a well-defined path and each water layer slides smoothly over the
    adjacent layer. While the turbulent flow is defined as the zig-zag flow pattern
    of water particles. The laminar flow changes into turbulent flow if the Reynold’s
    number is more than that 4000. The Reynold’s condition satisfies as laminar flow
    below 2000, otherwise turbulent flow [172]. Due to this, the optical beam propagation
    experiences a huge loss due to turbulence, signal absorption, and scattering by
    the suspended particles within the medium. Therefore, the necessity is to model
    the turbulence channel. Moreover, a numerical method for free surface flow that
    builds for nonlinear shallow water equation and utilizes a non-hydro-static pressure
    term to describe short waves are presented in [173]. C. Beer Lambert’s Law Computational
    methods are employed as the most significant solution for optical signaling in
    underwater mediums. An ordinary simulation method is widely employs for optical
    signaling in an aqueous medium known as Beer Lambert’s law. This law is described
    the optical signal attenuation due to the existence of suspended particles underwater.
    It is mathematically defined as the function of optical received signal power,
    the Euclidean distance apart from the transceivers, and the extinction coefficient
    of the medium. This type of channel model is used for optical signaling for any
    type of water availability, especially, for path loss fading. The mathematical
    expression of Beer Lambert’s law is shown below: P r (λ,d)= P t exp−c(λ)d, (33)
    View Source where P r and P t are denoted as the received and transmitted optical
    signal strength at the receiver and transmitter ends. Also, the extinction coefficient
    c(λ) is the sum of total optical signal absorption and scattering which are the
    optical wavelength dependents. The experimental values of extinction coefficient,
    for the readers references are widely discussed in [5], [82], [84], [86], and
    [174]. Additionally, due to transceivers physical parameters, geometrical losses
    are also considered for diffused LDs and semi-collimated light sources LEDs. Therefore,
    the modified Beer-Lambert law is the function of path loss ( h pl ) and geometrical
    losses ( h gl ) are given as [101], h l ≈ = h pl + h gl , ( D r θ F ) 2 d −2 t
    exp(−c ( D r θ F ) τ d 1−τ t ). (34) View Source The contributed channel condition
    coefficient h l in terms of path loss and geometrical losses are presented in
    (34). In (34), the receiver aperture diameter D r , full-width transmitter beam
    divergence angle θ F , and correction coefficient τ are defined. According to
    [101], the maximum achievable distance between communication nodes to obtain the
    BER performance of the vertically point-point system is given as follows, d= ⎡
    ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ W( c 2 (1−T))( D R θ 1/e ) ( 1 Q(BER) 2 σ 2 n P t r 2 η 2 − − − −
    − √ ) ( T−1 2 ) c 2 (1−T) ( D R θ 1/e ) T ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ 1 1−T . (35) View Source
    where W , Q , η , and T are defined as the Lambert-W function, error function,
    electrical to optical conversion efficiency, and correction coefficient. D. Radiative
    Transfer Differential Theory and Computational Method Radiative transfer theory
    (RTE) deals with computing derivatives of radiometric measures with respect to
    desired visual of geometrical parametrization, and facilitates the gradient-based
    optimization in various applications [175]. Additionally, the RTE is deployable
    in neutron transportation, astrophysics, and biomedical image analysis [175],
    [176]. Furthermore, the energy conservation-based radio transfer theory is used
    to model the optical waves in participating media. For better RTE understanding
    the assumptions are made, if considers the test volume V⊆ R 3 with the corresponding
    boundary ∂V , and the interior radiance field L(s,ω) is defined over the position
    s∈V/∂V , and light-transport directions ω∈ S 2 . Then, the RTE equation given
    as follows [175], L=( K T K C + K S )L+ L (0) , (36) View Source where, K T ,
    K C , and K S are denoted as the transport operator, collision operator, and interfacial
    scattering operator, respectively. Additionally, the Reynolds transport theorem
    is also an alternative method to solve computational problems. The Reynolds theorem
    for f scalar value function is defined for n -dimensional manifold ω parameterized
    with some π∈R as (37). If it is an assumption that Γ(π)⊂V(π) be an (n−1) dimensional
    manifold given by the union of the external boundary ∂V(π) and the internal one
    containing the discontinuous locations of f . Then, Reynold’s theorem could be
    specified as follows [177], ∂ π ( ∫ V(π) fdV(π)) = ∫ V(π) f ˙ dV(π)+ ∫ Γ(π) <n,
    x ˙ >Γ(π). (37) View Source Furthermore, f ˙ := ∂ π , x ˙ := ∂ π x , dV and dΓ
    denotes the standard measures associated with V and Γ0 ; Moreover <⋅,⋅> indicated
    the dot (inner product between two vectors.) Furthermore, n is the normal direction
    at each x∈Γ(π) . E. The Data Assimilation Algorithms for Numerical Models The
    data assimilation refers to the procedure of incorporating data into a model simulation
    to improve the upcoming predictions. The predictions of the system behavior can
    be defined by the measurement of the physically numerical based model. More specifically,
    the system should be more simplified for a better understanding of computational
    methods. In many applications, the data assimilation approaches are accurate to
    describe the dynamic behavior of the system. Utilizing the data assimilation techniques
    the measurement and model outcomes are used to obtain an optimal estimation of
    the state of the system. However, the main hurdles in advanced data assimilation
    schemes are the bulky computational load that is required for solving a real problem.
    On the other hand, the assimilation algorithm is an essential tool to obtain efficient
    variational data for further analysis. Due to this, More accurate data assimilation
    methods are variational data assimilation and Kalman filtering computational method
    is widely used. Data assimilation for minimization computational method widely
    discussed in [178] as follows, X k+1 =f( X k ,p,k)+B(k,p) u k , X 0 = x 0 (38)
    View Source where X k is the system state, u k is the input of the system, f is
    a nonlinear function, p is a vector containing the uncertain parameters, and B(k)
    is an input matrix. Besides, the Kalman filter assimilation computational method
    could be written as, X k+1 =F(k) X k +B(k) u k +G(k) W k , (39) View Source where
    the Gaussian noise process is denoted by W k with zero mean and covariance matrix
    Q(k) and G(k) is the noise input matrix. SECTION VII. UVLC Channel Modelling Modeling
    of UWOC channel leads to a better understanding of optical signal propagation
    and supports exploring aqueous mediums. UVLC is considered an alternative communication
    media to meet the requirements in high data rate, large bandwidth, and high communication
    speed to deploy in various underwater applications. Moreover, for long ranges
    UVLC communication, the necessity is to design a system for efficient signal transmission.
    Generally, the signal absorption reduces the signal strength that is attenuated
    in the transmitted signal. Despite that, the scattering phenomena is responsible
    for the optical beam deflection from its initial position, this contributes to
    signal fading. As a result, Monte-Carlo simulation is being used, which is an
    alternative approach to deal with the statistical methodology for the evaluation
    of channel characteristics by generating a number of random photons and further
    obtained the simulation performance interaction of each photon within the medium
    [179]. Optical signal propagation is categorized into two main streams based on
    the type of detection techniques. They are: non-coherent intensity modulation
    and direct detection (IM/DD) signal modulation technique. However, the IM/DD is
    generally used as an optical signal modulation scheme to decode information at
    the receiver. In non-coherent systems, the detector directly detects information
    through emitted light. Another aspect of the signal detection technique is the
    coherent detection, where a local oscillator (LO) is being used to mix optical
    signals before detection which improves the receiver sensitivity [180]. In more
    contrast, coherent and heterodyne detection techniques are widely discussed as
    in [29]. A local oscillator uses incoherent detection scheme which comprises of
    the received signal to the carrier beam detected by the photodetector. Furthermore,
    the coherent detection scheme is also sub-categorized into two main classes as
    heterodyne and homodyne detection [21]. The LO operates as the same frequency
    with the optical signal in the homodyne detection scheme, while the frequency
    could be different in the heterodyne detection scheme. In the VLC setup, the system
    consists of an optical transmitter for signal modulation by LED illumination phenomena.
    On the other hand, a receiver enables a photosensitive diode for the decoding
    process from the detected light power. The block diagram consists of a transmitter
    and a receiving system depicted by Fig. 8. The different approaches use to model
    the undersea VLC system. A. Oceanic Turbulence Channel Modeling The most influential
    optical signal phenomenon is channel turbidity. Turbulence occurs due to random
    fluctuation in the refractive index of the water medium caused by the variation
    in temperature and salinity. Therefore, turbulence phenomena affects the performance
    of optical signal propagation in an aqueous medium. The affecting performance
    and channel modeling of highly turbid water mediums are presented in existing
    literature [100], [102], [181]–[183]. The fluctuation in the refractive index
    is directly related to the nature of the water channel as a function of temperature,
    salinity, pressure, and density. Due to increasing underwater depth, the temperature
    decreases and pressure increases; nevertheless, the water is slightly compressible
    affecting highly pressurized and dense water environments. Taking into account
    underwater turbulence, the scintillation index ( σ 2 I ) leads turbidity which
    is the main cause of optical signal fading. In more detail, the broad study of
    modified underwater optical turbulence (UOT) model is investigated mathematically
    by (40), as shown at the bottom of the next page, Show All [184]. As stated UOT
    spectrum model in (40), where κ , ϵ and C 0 , C 1 is defined the magnitude of
    the spatial frequency, dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass
    of fluid and fluid constants, respectively. Moreover, Kolmogorov micro-scale length
    η is represented ratio of kinematic viscosity ( ν ) and ϵ . The dissipation rate
    of mean-squared refractive index χ n , the thermal expansion coefficient α , and
    saline contraction coefficients are given as, χ n = α 2 χ T + β 2 χ S −2αβ χ TS
    . (41) View Source Considering plane and spherical wave models of scintillation
    index ( σ 2 I ) for different Gaussian beams are widely discussed in [185]–[187].
    However, the scintillation index is defined as the variance of the received signal
    normalized intensity I , which is expressed in [8], σ 2 I = ⟨ I 2 ⟩− ⟨I⟩ 2 ⟨I
    ⟩ 2 . (42) View Source As varying scintillation index causes heavy turbulence,
    that can be highly affect of optical signal propagation. It means the more unsatisfactory
    performance of the system and degrades the system efficiency. Various existing
    works are recorded to channel models in weak and heavy turbidity channel conditions.
    In existing research, plenty of statistical channel models under weak turbulence
    intensity fluctuation and mathematically are defined PDFs for turbulence. The
    experimental model under lognormal distribution is mentioned as in [100], [188]–[190].
    Therefore, the probability density function (PDF) of turbulence channel condition
    under lognormal distribution is given as follows, f I (I)= exp(− (ln(I)−2 μ n
    ) 2 8 χ 2 n ) 8π χ 2 n h 2 − − − − − − √ . (43) View Source In spite of strong
    turbulence channel conditions, UVLC channel model into successive j th number
    of water layers, and following Gamma-Gamma (GG) distribution model is proposed
    as in [33] and [114], f I j ( I j )=2 ( α j β j ) ( α j + β j ) 2 Γ( α j )Γ( β
    j ) ( I j ) ( α j + β j ) 2 −1 K α j − β j (2 α j β j I j − − − − − √ ), (44)
    View Source where the Gamma function and modified Bessel function of the second
    kind are denoted by Γ(⋅) and K ( α j − β j ) (⋅) , respectively. The PDF in (44),
    for normalization conditions it satisfies the equality of turbulence channel coefficient
    as E{ I J } 2 =1. Besides of it, the scintillation index for GG distribution is
    given as [191], σ 2 I j = 1 α j + 1 β j + 1 α j β j . (45) View Source Furthermore,
    under-consideration of j th vertical water layers, the large and small scale factors
    for the plane wave model are defined by α j and β j respectively. The α j and
    β j can be written as follows [33], [183], α j = β j = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ exp ⎛ ⎝ ⎜
    ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 0.49 χ 2 I j (1+1.11 χ 12 5 I j ) 7 6 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ −1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ −1

    the scintillation index which is known as Rytov variance [102]. Consequently,
    under-consideration of plane wave model, the large scale factor α , and small
    scale factor β for multiple water layers can be written as [192], [193], α k =
    β k = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ exp ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 0.49 χ 2 I k (1+0.18 d 2 +0.56 χ 12 5 I

    and (49), the Rytove variance is calculated for k th environment layers as χ 2

    to 10 −17 m −2/3 (weak turbulence regime) with uncertainties values 10 −15 m −2/3
    in terrestrial based communication [194]. Moreover, the Rytov variance χ 2 I k
    ≫1 depends for large scale cells for plane wave model while χ 2 I k ≪1 for small
    scale cells. However, in (46) and (47) the Rytov variance is modeled [184, Eq.

    dependent along with δ = 1.5 C 2 1 (κη ) 45 + C 3 1 (κη ) 2 , respectively. B.
    Pointing Errors and Non-LOS Communication Link Pointing error is another issue
    in optical signal propagation that contributes to the signal fading in the underwater
    environment. Due to the random water current flow and movement of floating nodes,
    a uniform constant tracking pointing system necessary to maintain for a reliable
    communication link. Generally, the pointing error is defined and considered with
    the two essential categories as bore-sight and jitter [195]. For more detail,
    in [195] the authors are defined the bore-sight determines on a stable displacement
    transceiver (between detector center and the beam center), whereas jitter is the
    random displacement process between of beam center at the detector plane [196].
    Under consideration of Gaussian beam model for jitter phenomenon, if the optical
    beam propagates through the distance z between the source and destination along

    observation the misalignment of the transceivers is modeled by utilizing the beam
    spread function (BSF) as [85]. SECTION VIII. Modulation, Demodulation, and Channel
    Coding Techniques for UVLC VLC signal modulation is totally different from terrestrial-based
    communication cause of non-encoding features in phase, and amplitude [198]. In
    general, the accomplishment of LEDs in the VLC system has triple features as illumination,
    high-speed data communication, and energy harvesting simultaneously [27]. The
    Maximum Flickering Time-Period (MFTP) of the light should be minimized for the
    minimal flickering phenomena [31]. On the other hand, the dimming process control
    of light supports the potential energy conservation purposes [31]. Generally,
    VLC modulation techniques deploy under IM/DD, and coherent modulation (CM) based
    scheme, which is further classified as a single carrier modulation (SCM), multi-carrier
    modulation (MCM), and color domain-based modulation (CDBM) schemes [3]. The various
    type of VLC modulation schemes are summarized by the Table 7. Moreover, the pictorial
    classification of VLC modulation techniques is depicted by Fig. 9. It is noteworthy
    that IM/DD modulation schemes are less suitable for high-data-rate applications
    [21]. For that reason, there is an alternative option Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM)
    which is used to modulate the intensity of the continuous optical waves and widely
    use for laser beams propagation [199]. Although the CM scheme offers more advantages
    over IM/DD enabled system in detection performance and minimize the background
    noise, the better sensitivity of the receiver, low cost, and complexity to install
    setup [200]. Modulation schemes are the most critical ways to expand bandwidth,
    such as OOK, pulse position modulation (PPM), and pulse width modulation (PMW)
    have advantages regarding system complexity when using to enhance the performance
    of the VLC system. However, the Discrete Multitone (DMT) modulation, OFDM modulation,
    and Carrier-less Amplitude Phase (CAP) modulation have better spectral efficiency
    [27]. TABLE 7 Consider the Underwater Optical Modulation Techniques, the Single
    Carrier Modulation Scheme (SCM), and Color Shift Keying (CSK) are Summarized in
    This Table. The Research Objectives, Design System Model, and Future Directions
    are Also Briefly Described A. Single Carrier Modulation Scheme In SCM, the communication
    setup leads to improve channel capacity. Nevertheless, the system complexity is
    increased due to the cost factor. The IM/DD setups have several benefits as easy
    to install, very cost-effective, and less complex as compared with the coherent
    system. The photo-detectors are used to convert optical signals into electrical
    signals under IM/DD technique. As the dimming process is widely noticed in optical
    signaling consequently, several dimming processes have been proposed in [201].
    Furthermore, the PPM, DMT, and OOK are also proposed to accommodate dimming phenomena
    [202]. Generally, for regular system model design, signal carrier modulation (SCM)
    schemes are widely used. In consideration of SCM- IM/DD, several modulation techniques
    are investigated such as OOK, PAM, variable pulse position modulation (VPPM) and
    differential pulse position modulation (DPPM) pulse position modulation (PPM),
    pulse width modulation (PWM) and color shift keying (CSK), etc., [21], [27] and
    are mentioned in Table 7. B. OOK Modulation Scheme Under Consideration IM/DD IM/DD
    scheme is well known and easy to install, and a cost-effective signal propagation
    scheme. In this scheme, the signals have to propagate through the source directly
    or by the external modulator. Despite the receiver side, the signal information
    is demodulated through the direct detection process; therefore, the whole system
    is named as intensity-modulation & direct-detection. An ordinary process to modulate
    optical signal information through light and the intensity regulated by the OOK
    scheme. The illumination of LEDs are turned “off” and “on” phenomena according
    to the bit-stream as the digital numbers “0” and “1” [27]. Such as the presence
    and absence pulse phenomena of light intensity depending on the bit duration.
    The LEDs are not completely turned off in the “off states”; nevertheless, the
    signal intensity level decreases in this state. The OOK scheme uses and is divided
    into the pulse format with a return to zero (RZ) and without a return to zero
    (NRZ), [29]. In a more vast discussion, the format contains the digital bits “1”
    in NRZ while the RZ format occupies the remaining parts of the bits represented
    by “0”. The performance of the OOK modulation technique severely degrades and
    can be improved by updating the higher modulation schemes as followed in Table
    7. C. Pulse Modulation Schemes Aforementioned, the OOK modulation technique is
    an essential signal modulation scheme that supports low data rates with low performances.
    Pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is more tolerant of the effect of the multi-path
    channel as mentioned in [27]. PAM modulation scheme is the process where the message
    is encoded in terms of amplitude of the optical pulse. Despite the PAM scheme,
    OOK is recorded as widely used under consideration of IM/DD optical communication
    scheme because of its simplicity and resilience to the intrinsic nonlinearities
    of laser origin. Even, in pulse position modulation (PPM) scheme, the division
    of symbol k is transmitted into an equal time slot within the 2 M constellation
    symbol M . A single pulse in PPM scheme during each symbol period suffers from
    low data-rate [45]. To cope up with this issue in PPM, a pulse width modulation
    (PWM) scheme is investigated as in [231], where it deals with dimming control
    cause of lower intensity control and varies with the pulse width proportion of
    the instantaneous values of the signals. Therefore, for multi-pulse in each symbol-time
    transmission the multi-pulse modulation (M-PPM) scheme was proposed [29]. On the
    other hand, in [3], authors comprised as PAM required more power for large bandwidth
    while PPM suffers low spectral efficiency. Continuously developing of optical
    pulse modulation schemes, a differential pulse position modulation (DPPM) scheme
    is introduced to improve the overall throughput spectral efficiency of PPM [232].
    However, the DPPM is based on a very short pulse duration width for an alternative
    signal propagation. Due to this, the combination of DPPM and PWM in the form of
    DPWM has achieved a higher bandwidth efficiency than PPM and OOK. The most significant
    advantage of DPWM is that it solves the narrow pulse problem and has low power
    efficiency. To control the brightness of the LED in the PPM scheme, a Variable
    PPM (VPPM) is proposed as in [233]. However, the VPPM combines PWM and 2-PPM,
    which control the brightness and data transmission along with the controlling
    dimming level to flickering position. As a result, the multiple Pulse Position
    Modulation (MPPM) has gained a more power-efficient scheme than OOK, PAM, and
    PPM. Taken into an account of optimum power and bandwidth efficiency, a hybrid
    Multiple Pulse Amplitude and Position Modulation (MPAPM) signal propagation scheme
    is proposed in [234]. However, an Overlapping Pulse Position Modulation (OPPM)
    [235] is proposed for improving bandwidth efficiency and high data-rate in MPPM.
    Utilizing VPPM for data transmission, the system offers complexity; an alternative
    approach, a Variable Rate Multi-pulse Modulation (VR-MPPM) [233], is investigated
    to cope with the complex issues to achieve both data rate and brightness control
    simultaneously. Furthermore, an expurgated PPM (E-PPM) modulation scheme is proposed
    to improve the performance of a peak-power limited M-ary communication system
    mentioned in Table 7. D. Color Domain Based Shift Keying (CSK) Modulation Color
    Phase Shift Keying (CSK) is defined by VLC IEEE 802.15.7 standard to improve system
    performance compared with other modulation schemes [45]. The IEEE standards for
    the CSK scheme are categorized into three sub-categories based on data rates known
    as PHY-I operates 11.67 to 266.6 kb/s, PHY-II operates on 1.25 to 96 Mb/s and
    PHY-III that is operated on 12 to 96 Mb/s [31]. CSK modulation is the color space
    chromaticity dependent on utilizing the three colors intensities as Green, Red,
    and Blue LED of the source. The main principle of multi-color LED is the color
    shift keying where the VLC beam implemented as 4-CSK, 8-CSK, and 16-CSK modulation
    schemes light sources. The 3-Color CSK [210] and 4-CSK modulation schemes are
    proposed based on IEEE 802.15.7 standard [211]. The different CSK modulation schemes
    have been proposed in [236]–[238] and Table 7. E. Coherent & Multi-Carrier Modulation
    Techniques Despite IM/DD modulation scheme, the coherent scheme employs both phase
    and amplitude signals to modulate corresponding information. A local oscillator
    is used to convert the optical signals at the receiver end, which are referred
    to homodyne and hetrodyne detection mechanism. As a result, the coherent modulation
    scheme supports a high spectral efficiency and background noise resistivity but
    more channel complexity. However, multi-carrier modulation schemes are followed
    OFDM, where orthogonal sub-carriers are used as data transmission. A particular
    fading channel is converted into a flat fading channel as in the OFDM technique
    and using as a single tap equalizer. The different types of OFDM-based optical
    modulation schemes are proposed in open literature [239], [240]. The various multi-carrier
    modulation schemes are summarized in Table 7. The signals are converted from parallel
    format into serial ones for demodulation by using IFFT and then further transmitting
    to the LED transmitter. At the receiver end, the signal demodulation process happens
    by photo-diode (PD). Several multi-carrier modulation techniques are discussed
    in further Tables and subsections. DCO-OFDM:- Generally, OFDM uses RF communication
    which cannot be directly accessible to use in VLC because of the real and unipolar
    values of optical signals [241]. Therefore the conversion is needed; firstly,
    the bipolar signals are transformed into unipolar format and then the non-positive
    integers should be clipped. Generally, the RF-OFDM signals are converted into
    optical-OFDM by the Hermitian symmetry method. In contrast, the DC-bias converts
    into bipolar OFDM, which is known as DCO-OFDM. The mathematical expression of
    DC bias is given as [241], B DC =μ E{x(t ) 2 } − − − − − − − √ , (53) View Source
    where DC bias is defined by B DC of 10 log 10 ( μ 2 +1) dB. The proportionality
    constant and standard deviation of unclipped signals are represented by μ and
    E{x(t ) 2 } − − − − − − − √ , respectively. On the other hand, the expression
    for clipping operation can be written as follows [241], x(t)={ x 0 (t), 0, if  x
    0 (t)>0 if  x 0 (t)≤0. View Source The continuous development of LED carries new
    trends in optical communication. It is obvious that in DCO-OFDM, the power efficiency
    decreases while the modulation sequence increases. This makes it less compatible
    with several VLC applications. Therefore, a substitutional modulation technique
    is required. The novel substitutional technique is investigated only heterogeneous
    subcarriers for operation and also removes subcarriers known as ACO-OFDM [213].
    In contrast, the drawback of ACO-OFDM spectral efficiency is that half of DCO-OFDM
    causes half of the subcarriers rejection. PAM-DMT [221] has become an alternative
    methodology based on Fourier transform properties. In PAM-DMT, the real part of
    the signals is ignored while considering the imaginary values of the received
    signals. Moreover, for unipolar OFDM, the Flip-OFDM was also proposed [230]. The
    recently proposed Flip-OFDM technique is classified into two classes. In this
    classification, the second class is the replica of the original one. It means
    both of the classes contain the equivalency under DC bias-based modulation techniques.
    Therefore, in DCO-OFDM, the spectral efficiency falls up to half rather than ACO-OFDM.
    F. Hybrid Modulation Techniques In optical signaling, long distances coverage
    is challenging. For covering, long-range communication hybrid links are the key
    solution approaches for further wireless communication and mentioned in Table
    4 and Table 4. A single LED is used to transmit the signal in the further development
    of hybrid links instead of multiple arrays of LEDs. To deal with the issues in
    hybrid communication, spatial optical OFDM (SO-OFDM) is proposed. The SO-OFDM
    has received better BER performance than DCO-OFDM [241]. On the contrary, the
    reverse polarity optical OFDM (RPO-OFDM) is also introduced to control LED illumination
    in the VLC system [227]. The combined PWM technique deals with the real values
    in optical OFDM to control dimming phenomena in the VLC system. SECTION IX. Optical
    Energy Harvesting (OEH) The integration of IoTs, is a novel approach for wireless
    signaling in an underwater environment through IoUTs [70]. Optical waves can carry
    information and transfer energy simultaneously to power up the batteries of communication
    nodes. Even, to deploy an underwater communication setup is much more challenging
    than terrestrial-based communication. Therefore, the UVLC techniques are the potential
    wireless candidates for communication and energy transmitting media within the
    communication networks. Due to this, simultaneously, light-wave information and
    power transfer (SLIPT) has been proposed as a potential wireless candidate for
    communication and power transmission through optical link connectivity [242].
    Compared with simultaneous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT),
    SLIPT performs better in specific channel condition requirements. This section
    provides an overview of SLIPT methodology through time, power, and spatial space
    dependency. Moreover, the LEDs are capable of transmitting signals in underwater
    environments with conveniently low-cost rather than RF signaling [20]. Internet-connected
    devices are the power-hungry tools those need to harvest energy being in an active
    mode. WPT is quite challenging among wireless nodes, specifically underwater.
    Although this, WPT has gained research attention in the most recent years [41],
    [243]–[245]. Initially, the idea of WPT came up during the 1890s [246]. Later
    on, the integration of WPT was triggered by SWIPT, where only electromagnetic
    waves carry information and power in different required application scenarios.
    SWIPT has become a futuristic digital energy transmitting technology in the wireless
    communication domain. However, RF-energy harvesting (RF-EH) systems experienced
    major technical problems due to transceiver circuits and suffered from relatively
    low efficiency. It is noteworthy that EM waves propagate over few meters in the
    underwater environment. Consequently, to get rid of the radiation rate of EM waves,
    it is replaced by VLC enabled light sources such as laser diode and LEDs. A hybrid
    RF and light-wave power transfer scheme with the color diversity of optical beam
    has been recorded in [247]. The authors in [247], are proposed a novel RF-VLC
    ultra-small cell network and the proposed system model consists of multiple terminal
    devices along with an optical angle-diversity transmitter with a multi-antenna
    RF access point. For shallow water communication, the fading of the optical signal
    due to the limited sunlight or background light effect is the leading cause of
    EH harvesting efficiency. SLIPT methodology can be a complementary energy harvesting
    (EH) approach to transfer energy via visible light in IoUT networking system.
    For instance, the RF/VCL hybrid communication and EH scheme is proposed in [248],
    where the authors designed a VLC link to harvest energy at the relay and furthered
    this harvested energy by transferring it with the base station through an RF link.
    However, a more sophisticated optical transceivers setup is required in the SLIPT
    scenario based on modulation and demodulation schemes, including the time, power,
    and space splitting format. A. Switching Technologies As the main concern of the
    SLIPT scenario, the switching technique has played the most significant role in
    transmission power and simultaneously information transmission. Generally, time,
    power, and space switching schemes are proposed in the open literature [249].
    In the time switching aspect, the receiver acts to decode information in the time
    slot t , whether the reaming time slot (1−t) is assigned for the harvesting energy.
    Furthermore, the received signals split into photo-voltaic and photo-conductive
    modes of receiving as well as decoding the signals. In addition, the low-power
    hybrid system can perform the function of switching between two solar cell modes
    in the cooperative communication aspect. While in power splitting mode, the receiving
    terminal self charges and detects the incident light beam information. The light
    beam splits into dual power factors as α and ( 1−α ), respectively. The power
    factor Pα is responsible for EH; else remaining power fraction P(1−α) is assigned
    for information decoding. In this power splitting scenario, the power splitting
    component could function passively; the reason is splitting the incident beam
    divides into two portions. Nevertheless, in this scenario, it is considering n
    th number of transceivers in a communication system and functioning for energy
    harvesting capabilities and information decoding. In this type of system architecture,
    the spatial splitting approach applicable. In this anticipated system design,
    each transmitter node is independent of each others and could transmit the signal
    and energy received by each receiving node. Furthermore, the time switching SPLIT
    approach could be utilized within this scenario for the same receiver, which acts
    as “Energy Harvester” and “Signal Decoder” over different periods. These two switching
    techniques would be beneficial to deploy in critical environments such as undersea
    and underground communication and wireless energy transfer. For long-range communication,
    the UWSNs are deployed within a particular depth in an undersea environment. Being
    in an active mode of sensor networks to replace the batteries and transfer energy
    wirelessly is quite challenging. To cope up with this issue, a novel hybrid SWIPT
    and SLIPT wireless power transfer techniques are investigated [247]. RF and light-wave
    power transfers are complement to each other in their relative profits and losses
    during signal propagation. An alternatively switchable process towards the 5GB
    wireless network to transfer power in shallow waters over moderate depth in underwater
    mediums is summarized in this section. SWIPT and SLIPT are the EH utility process
    where signal energy is converted into usable electric energy. An EH-system harvests
    the energy from nature such as solar energy, wind, rising temperature, and vibrational
    EH approaches are recorded in [250]. As, we are surrounded by an electronic world,
    embedded devices, remote sensors, and low-power electronic devices are necessarily
    required for power transfer and batteries to store the electrical capacity. Due
    to the limitations of the battery lifespan, they should be replaced as per requirement.
    In underwater SLIPT, the signal recognition and simultaneously receiving energy
    is a novel approach amongst researchers. The most significant advantage of the
    EH scheme is the applicability for remote locations and harsh water channel conditions.
    This type of EH technology is cost-effective, improves safety and reliability
    [251]. In the SLIPT scenario, it offers high bandwidth, extremely high speed,
    and energy efficiency. Furthermore, the movement of the renewal traditional EH
    technologies towards to SLIPT is the solution for environmentally friendly technology,
    which belongs to the class of green communication [252]. B. SLIPT in Underwater
    Communication An underwater SLIPT scenario is depicted by Fig. 10. Throughout
    the proposed system model, the received signal splits into two chunks simultaneously,
    which are responsible for energy harvesting and information decoding. At the receiver
    end the received signals are converted into AC and DC components. The AC component
    is responsible for the signal decoding while the DC component uses for the EH
    purposes [253]. According to Fig. 10, in the SLIPT system model, if m(t) represents
    the modulated electrical signal and A denotes the peak amplitude. If, + A I assigns
    for a bit “1” while − A I for “0” in modulation and demodulation of VLC signal.
    In consideration of modulation process to control the optical intensity of LED
    with the DC bias ψ , the peak amplitude for each bit is given as [41], A I ≤min(ψ−
    I L , I H −ψ), (54) View Source where I L and I H are denoted the minimum and
    maximum input bias current. Furthermore, in the point-to-point communication scenario,
    the harvested energy is modified and given by [41], [254], E EH = = f I DC V t
    fTrI P t B V t ln(1+ rIh P t ψ I 0 ), (55) View Source where f , I DC , V t ,
    T , r , P t , and I 0 are defined as the fill factor of solar panel, the DC component
    I DC =rI P t ψ , the thermal voltage, time duration during energy harvesting,
    the photo-detector resistivity, the power component, and the dark saturation current
    of solar panel, respectively. Time-Switching (TS) SLIPT Receiver Architecture
    The TS receiver architecture is a disjoint scheme as well as the splitting factors
    t and (1−t) denoted for the optimization in the SLIPT system. According to the
    splitting factor, the ability to gain the idea of exploit harvested energy with
    adequate BER performance. Moreover, the TS mechanism represents separate two-time
    frames for EH and information decoding (ID). Furthermore, TS can use for only
    one function at a time, energy transfer or receiving signal [253]. The TS-SLIPT
    block diagram architecture under the SPLIT system is depicted by Fig.11. Power-Switching
    (PS) SLIPT Receiver Architecture The PS receiver architecture is another combined
    scheme as received current distributed into two phases. The DC component of the
    current phase uses for EH, while the AC component of the current phase uses for
    information decoding purposes. Compared with the TS-SLIPT scheme, the PS design
    could reach high efficiency in EH at the receiver end. Additionally, the PS-SLIPT
    mechanism works at the same time with different power domains for EH and ID [42].
    Fig.12 shows the block diagram of the PS-SLIPT receiver architecture. C. SLIPT
    and SWIPT Schemes The authors in [42] widely discussed which comprised both of
    futuristic SLIPT and SWIPT schemes. In both schemes, the authors obtained the
    behavior of system BER & outage performances along with amount of harvested energy.
    Therefore, the BER and outage performances in the SLIPT scheme perform better
    than the SWIPT scheme at the consecutive photodetector sensitivity and power splitting
    factors. On the contrary case according to [42], the EH in SWIPT shows superior
    performance rather than indoor enabled SLIPT technology. SECTION X. Hybrid Underwater
    Wireless Communication Optical communication as VLC is a promising complementary
    approach instead of RF and acoustic waves signal transmission in the underwater
    medium over short distances. Enabling next generation of wireless network 5GB
    optical communication technique allows the massive number of connectivity of IoUTs.
    In recent years there is a growing interest in deploying VLC as a communication
    link in underwater integrated with existing RF and acoustic waves. Therefore,
    hybrid RF-VLC and FSO-VLC wireless communication links are proposed and showed
    impressive system performances expect to deploy individual point-to-point or point-to-multi-point
    communication links. A wide detailed summary of various hybrid communication techniques
    are depicted by Fig.1 and Fig.13. In RF-UWOC hybrid communication system [48]
    an electromagnetic link combines with an optical link, while in underwater FSO-VLC
    system [255] enables both of optical links for signal propagation. Additionally,
    a dual-hop acoustic-optical link is widely used for signal propagation in the
    underwater medium over long-ranges [256]. In hybrid underwater communication aspect
    various signal transmission techniques are developed and use to enable with FSO,
    VLC, sonar, and underwater acoustic waves. It is challenging to deploy an optical
    communication hybrid network system towards to 5GB and connecting IoUTs. Optical
    wireless communication link supports highly secure signal propagation media under
    visible light (VL), infra-red (IR), and ultraviolet (UV) frequency bands. Nowadays,
    numerous optical wireless communication systems are being developed under consideration
    above three optical frequency bands. In a hybrid link scenario, RF and acoustic
    waves are not required line-of-sight (LOS) nor short ranges but support high mobility
    and better performance in NLOS conditions. The hybrid approaches are integrated
    with two multi-hops different wireless communication technologies such as RF-VLC
    [257], [258], RF-FSO [47], [48], and PLC-VLC [259], [260] are investigated in
    the open literature to provide various advantages as per requirement and deployment.
    Additionally, a hybrid wireless communication system facilitates the integration
    of multiple wireless carrier candidates to cover long-ranges communication along
    with better system performance that overcome the limitation of an individual technology.
    A. RF/FSO Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link FSO has become an alternative solution
    for a wireless communication system with high bandwidth over long distances. Terrestrial
    FSO is most widely used as a LOS wireless communication approach that operates
    within 850–1550 nm of optical spectrum wavelength. Due to strong channel conditions,
    the FSO links are attenuated by atmospheric conditions, especially atmospheric
    turbulence, fog, snow, and dust limiting channels. Plenty of FSO based applications
    are recorded in open literature as in [171]. Mostly, in the FSO system the channel
    turbulence phenomenon is a highly noticeable event of the fluctuation of the scintillation
    index. The turbulence effect occurs due to the flexibility of refractive index
    variation inhomogeneities in an atmosphere where the temperature and pressure
    fluctuates. RF waves attenuate easily in an underwater environment and propagate
    over short distances. In hybrid communication over long ranges RF waves signify
    as a promising signal transmission technique. Therefore, RF-FSO underwater is
    a potential solution for acquiring high bandwidth over long distances. In this
    section, an RF-FSO hybrid communication system model is proposed to obtain the
    system performance. A source node S communicates with an underwater-based destination
    D through a floating buoy. The floating buoy works as a decode-and-forward (DF)
    relay protocol R and depicted by Fig.13. The source node transmits the RF signals
    with an average signal power P s . Further, the relay receives the transmitted
    signals re-generates then forwards to the destination D through FSO link. In another
    aspect, if we use the AF relay protocol, the relay received a signal copy from
    S and amplifies then forward to D . Additionally, we consider the RF-FSO combination
    follows Rayleigh flat fading and FSO link is experienced by strong turbulence
    channel conditions for communication between R and D . For strong turbulent channel
    conditions, the fading is modeled through Gamma-Gamma distribution. In hybrid
    communication relaying technique has been widely promoted for signal transmission
    over long ranges. Due to the limitation of FSO signaling on terrestrial based
    communication, the channel impairments have to be taken into account. As turbulence
    and pointing errors are the main cause of optical signal fading, the hybrid communication
    link is widely studied in literature and the performance investigated through
    different modulation and demodulation techniques. In an underwater communication
    scenario, optical communication is a permissible communication media for signal
    transmission. Thus, a number of RF-Optical [46]–[48], [50], [51] and acoustic-optical
    [69], [256], [261], [262] hybrid communication systems are investigated. B. RF/VLC
    Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link In optical communication aspect VLC shows an
    impressive performance for signal transmission over short distances. VLC uses
    LED luminaries, which are very cost-effective, easy to install, and 100 Gbps data
    can be achieved. Similarly, VLC also affects by strong channel conditions, especially
    sunlight. VLC integrated with RF and a hybrid RF-VLC combination shows better
    performance in different waters. A dual-hop hybrid RF-VLC underwater communication
    link proposed in [114]. The system model consists of three or more nodes for signal
    transmission where a relay function re-generates or amplifies signal information
    and further communicates with the underwater-based destination. In [114], the
    system model is assumed in half-duplex mode with a single antenna at relay, while
    the nodes are fixed. Moreover, the relay should mount two directional antennas
    in full-duplex mode, where one antenna receives the transmitted signals from source
    and the other antenna towards to the destination for further communication with
    the destination. The BER performance of RF-VLC dual-hop hybrid cooperative communication
    system [257] in different water types under strong channel conditions are depicted
    by Fig.14. C. FSO/VLC Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link The traditional underwater
    communication media is modeled by acoustic waves that supports low data rate and
    bandwidth with high delayed signal propagation. FSO-VLC combination full-fill
    the acceptability of desired communication requirements with a highly achievable
    data rate. This hybrid communication could be operating in half and full-duplex
    mode as both are optical links and sever almost the same channel impairments.
    The high turbulence channel conditions, current water waves, misalignment, and
    physio-chemical properties such as pressure, temperature, and salinity affects
    FSO and VLC links. A hybrid FSO-VLC combination is proposed in the open literature,
    where an AUV communicates with terrestrial based station through a floating buoy
    that functions as a relay to assist received information from the source-based
    station. The BER performance of an investigate FSO/VLC dual-hop hybrid communication
    system [257] in different water types is depicted by Fig.15. D. PLC/VLC Dual-Hop
    Hybrid Communication Link Another approach of hybrid underwater communication
    VLC link combined with power line communication (PLC) technology. A telecommunication
    technology PLC is based on the use of power grids for high-speed information transmission.
    The low transmission speed and poor noise immunity are the bottlenecks of this
    technology. Rather than this, the advent of PLC strengthens digital signal processors
    (DSP), making it possible to use more complex signal modulation methods such as
    OFDM modulation. PLC can be used to create a small base station where the main
    requirements for the network are ease of implementation, device mobility, and
    easy scalability. The small cell base station (CBS), e.g., femtocell access point
    (FAP) are used as a small cellular base station that serves 6–8 users. In hybrid
    PLC-VLC combined communication link a small power grid antenna connects with the
    small base station (SBS) through line cable. The signal is transmitted from SBS
    to the antenna via cable and further this antenna mounts by LEDs for further signal
    transmission to divers or UWSNs in shallow water. E. Optical-Acoustic and RF-Acoustic
    Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link The study of acoustic waves involves the discovery
    and deployment of sound waves transmission in fluid media. Acoustic waves are
    generally defined as mechanical and longitudinal vibrational ripples that can
    travel through solid, liquid, or gas mediums in a wave patterns. Underwater acoustic
    is an alternative signal propagation method of sound in water, especially over
    long ranges undersea. Sound waves are the most effective energy transmission wireless
    carriers that propagate over long distances in the ocean. Moreover, acoustic waves
    can tolerate the pressure and the temperature of the deep oceans. Neither RF nor
    optical waves are suitable for long-range transmissions in an underwater environment
    as acoustic waves [263]. Usually, the speed of acoustic waves is comparably low
    (Approximately 1500 m/s) [74]. Although, according to the layer clarification
    the speed varies in cold water and lower than normal water. Acoustic waves are
    used for long-ranges transmissions approximately up to 15 – 20 km, but these waves
    cannot achieve high bandwidth signals undersea. Due to low frequency, bandwidth,
    speed, and additionally the received signals are delayed at the destination [264],
    [265]. However, the sound waves depend on the compressibility and density of the
    medium. In [266], an acoustic sound speed profile (SSP) system model has been
    proposed for 1 km as follows, c= 1448.96+4.591T−0.591 T 2 +0.00029 T 3 +(1.340−0.01T)(S−35)+0.0163z,
    (56) View Source where the temperature in 0C, salinity in PSU, depth in meters,
    and speed of sound in m/s are denoted by T , S , z , and c , respectively. Sound
    waves propagate according to water current concerning every instant of time. An
    empirical model is described as a function of physical water properties such as
    temperature, salinity, and pressure varies with depth. Stratification of these
    parameters lead to stratification of wave motion, which entails the existence
    of specific profiles. Mackenzie has developed a mathematical formula in applied
    science during 1981s [267]. As already discussed, underwater optical communication
    is an alternative approach that refers to transmit signals in an aqueous medium.
    VLC communication has more superiority in comparison to acoustic waves but over
    short distances. To fulfill the gap of long-range communication, a hybrid optical-acoustic
    communication system is considerable. In this type of system model, the underwater-based
    mobile station transmits the acoustic signals and further convert into optical
    format for decoding purposes at the targeted node. SECTION XI. Underwater Sensor
    Networks Architecture Recently, there have been growing interests in underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). The fundamental source of ocean exploration
    underwater sensor architecture is defined as a group of sensor nodes that are
    established undersea to exchange information wirelessly with the base station
    (BS) and floating vehicles (nodes). The growing interest of UWSNs for a wide variety
    of purposes about oceanography, monitoring marine life, seismic surveillance,
    oil-fields exploration, military applications, and deep-sea activities. In this
    regard, the necessity of UWSNs contributes a significant role in UWC. Generally,
    UWSN nodes are enabled with acoustic and optical links for data transmission within
    various applications. Energy conservation and self battery powered is a critical
    issue in UWSN technology. This survey estimates the target position and improves
    energy efficiency in hibernating and an active mode of underwater sensor nodes
    (USNs). The network of underwater sensors fixed with a certain depth or with the
    bottom of the deep ocean for early detection warning of an earthquake, tectonic
    plate movements, and active volcanos before striking the coastal and residential
    areas. The floating nodes are used to detect ice sheet melting and rising water
    level phenomenon, coral reef, water pollution, and physio-chemical properties
    of water. The development of floating nodes AUV supports to improve the quality
    of geographical mapping and navigation systems in underwater sectors. Localization
    is another significant application of UWSNs for tracking location or Global Positioning
    System (GPS) in harsh water mediums [268]. The integration of sensor nodes architecture
    has permitted to allow communication, localization, and GPS. In an underwater
    environment, navigation and localization are the two most significant challenges
    for mobile robots, floating nodes, and different underwater applications. Aforementioned,
    acoustic and optical signal-based sensor networking systems are the most widely
    used for various underwater applications. Through the proposed underwater applications
    the acoustic and optical transponders are used to navigate an AUV. The sound navigation
    and ranging (SONAR) enabled AUV methodology has been proposed with the two basic
    configurations introduced as side-scan SONAR (SSS) and Forward-Looking SONAR (FLS)
    in [269] and [270]. The above SSS and FLS are used for monitoring marine life
    and detection for underwater environmental changes [271]. While an array of sensor
    nodes with a camera or without a camera can be implemented for long ranges navigation
    and imaging systems [272]. A. Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) SLAM is
    an AUV-enabled imaging technique and an essential solution for mapping unknown
    locations within the unknown environment to develop a consistent geographical
    mapping of an underwater environment [271]. In contrast, the SLAM imaging AUV-based
    technology that supports constructing a 3D image in different color frames is
    widely discussed in [273]. The authors in the above-proposed work defined a color-coding
    representation for the reconstruction of unknown mapping sectors, where each color
    code has its specified distance measurement between AUV and obstacles. The various
    methods are presented in the literature of SLAM to the reconstruction of the unknown
    sectors in underwater environment [271], [274]–[277]. Each method has its inadequacies
    and strengths according to the desired interaction, inspection, and navigation
    implementation. Furthermore, underwater SLAM is differentiated into acoustic-based,
    and vision-based categories [278]. The acoustic-based underwater SLAM is used
    for intense unknown segments, while the vision-based SLAM is suffered from limited
    visibility and background noise by natural sources in shallow waters. Therefore,
    a high-definition FLS SLAM could be a promising alternative solution in geographical
    mapping to mitigate the problematic solution. B. Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network
    UASNs is an approach that supports the exploration of extremely dark and highly
    deep oceans. UASNs deploy for various underwater applications such as for detection
    submarines and unmanned operations for military purposes. The UWSNs architecture
    is categorized into fixed 2D and mobility 3D sensors. In the 3D type of architectural
    sensor system, the motion of nodes controls the internal navigation system. The
    floating nodes are free to move underwater with the drift and unpropelled type
    of portable devices such as unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), AUVs, ROVs, drifters,
    and gliders. The main function of these devices is to collect oceanographic data
    from an aqueous medium. The various types of UWSNs are summarized by Table 8.
    The drifter operates mostly through the ground, which drifts with wind and surface
    waves to acquire the possible measurement of marine sectors, further sharing the
    collected data with the base station through satellite. Moreover, the gliders
    are driven by the buoyant force and connected with the floating buoy or the cluster
    head for sharing collected data. In existing work, there are the two main groups
    of UASNs known as content-based and scheduled-based protocols proposed in [279].
    UASNs are classified into two categories as content-based and scheduled-based
    nodes. The Content-based nodes exchange signals to each other, while scheduled-based
    nodes eliminate the exchange of aggregated data between transmission nodes. Alternatively
    stated content-based nodes do not meet the desired gap and are critically suitable
    for UWC. In contrast, due to high propagation latency and narrow bandwidth, the
    scheduled-based nodes such as TDMA and FDMA are less suitable. However, CDMA is
    a more suitable approach for UAN to be deployed in underwater medium [268]. TABLE
    8 The Various Types of Underwater Sensor Network Nodes (UWSNs) Architectures Established
    in the Open Literature to Cope With Issues of Highly Delay, Low Bandwidth, Heavy
    Turbulence Channel Conditions. The Architectures are Enabled for the Required
    Underwater Applications From Short to Long Ranges C. Architecture of Underwater
    Sensor Network Nodes (UWSNs) UASN is commonly used for underwater exploration
    but quite adequate to meet the demand for real-time streaming and high data rate
    scenario. RF wave-based underwater sensor network nodes (UWRFSNs) are the potential
    approachable technique TO full-fill the requirement of various underwater applications.
    In this section, the discussion is carried out of the different types UWSNs along
    with their deployment challenges. 1D-UWSNs Architecture: The single dimension
    (1D) UWSNs are the self-employed types of deployable networks underwater. In this
    type of sensor network, the individual node is self-configured by itself. In this
    type of architecture, each node has the capability of sensing and it is responsible
    for processing collection data within the remote area [281]. The sensor node could
    be fixed with a seabed or a floating buoy responsible for collecting the useful
    oceanographic data and further shared with the BS. In another scenario, the floating
    buoy could be the buoyant type of node that floats a certain depth underwater
    and then float towards the BS for information transmission. AUVs also function
    as self-configured individual nodes; they can floats at any horizontal and vertical
    depth to sense the data and share it with the onshore data center. The 1D-UWSNs
    type of architecture enables acoustic, EM, and optical communication-based wireless
    signaling technology. The 1D-UWSNs are widely deployable for single-hop communication
    where the nodes directly communicate with the BS; in VLC scenario 1D type of UWSNs
    usable for plenty of underwater applications in shallow waters such as rivers,
    dams, lakes, etc. 2D-UWSNs Architecture: The 2D type of UWSN is referred as a
    group of sensor networks (cluster) where the nodes communicate with the cluster
    head. The fixed or anchored cluster head collects the sensed data from each node
    and further transmits it to the vertical buoyant transceiver of the BS. In 2D-UWSN
    architecture, it is considered that each node communicates with the cluster head
    horizontally and communicates with the vertical buoyant node as well. Thus, this
    type of node architecture is called 2D-UWSNs, based on acoustic, EM, and optical
    waves-based wireless signaling technology for long ranges in an underwater environment.
    In the UVLC scenario, all local and cluster head nodes link and transmit the information
    with the remote station. The 2D type of UWSNs architecture is proposed in [291]
    for the purpose of short-term aquatic exploration applications and extensively
    discussed. The 2D-type of UWSNs is depicted in Fig.1. 3D-UWSN Architecture: The
    3D type of UWSN describes the network architecture where the sensor cluster nodes
    are deployed in different depths in underwater medium. Due to different depths,
    the clusters communication links established are variable in 3D space geometry
    in undersea. The communication link among the sensor nodes would be in three dimensions
    space for the mobility of data transmission. Additionally, in 3D-UWSNs, the cluster
    communicates among the neighboring clusters at varying depths, and the cluster
    network nodes communicate with their cluster head. All the cluster heads collect
    the sensed data by their local sensors and further transmit it to the buoyant
    node or with the BS. The 3D type of UWSNs can be deployed for underwater applications
    requirement based on acoustic, EM, and optical communication [281]. Moreover,
    the 3D underwater sensor network localization has been widely discussed in [282].
    In UVLC enabled sensor network communication, the high probability of real-time
    monitoring and achieving high data rate. The 3D-type of UWSNs is depicted in Fig.1.
    4D-UWSN Architecture: The 4D type of sensor network architectural system is designed
    by combining anchored sensor nodes with the floating or mobile UWSNs nodes at
    different underwater depths. The 4D-UWSN architecture is deployable for long ranges
    communication among the nodes. Mostly, the mobile UWSNs consist of ROVs for the
    data collection from an anchored or fixed nodes at the seabed in varying depth.
    The ROVs can be submersible robots, vehicles, ships, and even submarines. Each
    node can relay information with ROV and depending on the distance between the
    node and ROV. Furthermore, the signal transmission is the distance-dependent between
    underwater sensor nodes and ROV [292]. The 2D-type of UWSNs is depicted in Fig.16.
    SECTION XII. Recent Development of Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) The network
    of the internet of underwater things (IoUTs) is a potential novel approach for
    data collection within the underwater environment that has to be transferred with
    the BS for further analysis. IoUTs is a group of wireless network-enabled smart
    devices and could be a wide range of underwater sensor nodes architecture. The
    different types of UWSNs architectures are discussed in the earlier sections for
    various underwater application purposes. The system architecture of IoUT has received
    attention for developing smart ocean and innovative business surrounded by smart
    interconnected underwater water objects [70]. The most widely deployable IoUTs
    are discussed as follow and depicted by Fig.16. A. Sea Gliders and Autonomous
    Underwater Vehicles The Internet-connected devices structure provides a pretty
    reasonable communication bridge among the nodes. For underwater communication
    purposes, wirelessly connected devices are recognized as the internet of underwater
    things (IoUTs). These devices could be identified as network nodes, AUVs, moving
    gliders, ROVs and floating buoys, etc. Whereas sea gliders and AUVs provide the
    measurement of oceanic environment over long-ranges especially for bathymetric
    data collection. The thrust and movement of the sea-gliders are used as an electrically
    driven propellers and are operated by an installed battery that provides upthrust
    with buoyancy for forwarding or upward motion. The AUVs and sea-gliders are designed
    to cover thousands of miles for several months within underwater mediums. These
    devices sink up to 1km from the sea surface due to their energy capacity limits.
    Furthermore, these types of nodes are deployed for oceanographic data collection
    and GPS purposes. An architecture of IoUTs that involves the multiple wave gliders
    for acoustical observation is proposed [293]. The internal sensors of sea-gliders
    determine the direction of vehicle when it dives underwater. The external sensor
    scans the ocean to collect the data. The movement of sea-gliders, AUV, UUV, and
    ROVs, is shown in Fig.16. B. Underwater Animal Telemetry Animal telemetry is another
    effective approach for ocean exploration and uses to observe the marine environment.
    This tagging technology enables us to get to know about the marine life inhabitants
    and their interaction with coastal shelf ecosystem to polar seas and the open
    oceans [294]. Animal telemetry supports observing the exploration summary of the
    vast oceans, underwater environmental changes, and marine pollution. The air-sea
    interface is necessary to understand the observation and oceanic exploration of
    daily water conditions, driving global climate changes, biogeochemical cycle process,
    heavy wind and water currents to exchange the momentum and other micro-particles
    [294]. The various IoUTs such as HFR, satellites, drifters, and autonomous surface
    vehicles (ASVs) are widely used to observe the air-sea interface. To mitigate
    such challenges, the development of a small communicating device that can be mounted
    on the floating seabird back that contained a sensing data unit with a battery
    is capable of measuring the water surface, water currents, and winds over the
    sea [294]–[297]. For more details about animal telemetry, a pictorial view is
    referred to for this approach in Fig.16. C. A Deep Detectable Tsunami Buoy Tsunamis
    and earthquakes are sudden events and highly impossible to control. Nevertheless,
    these events are predictabled by deploying an early detectable device called a
    tsunami buoy. The primary function of a tsunami buoy is the detection and monitoring
    of the high level ocean water waves (Tides). The tsunami events are generated
    by undersea earthquakes that bureau of meteorology confirms. The tsunami buoys
    are deployed for observation and recorded the changes in sea level and bottomless
    oceans. It enhances the capability for early detection warning of tsunamis and
    floods before hitting the land. The buoy splits into two major components: the
    pressure sensor anchored with the sea bead and a surface buoy that floats on the
    water surface. The anchored sensors at the sea-bed are used to measure the changes
    in the height of the water column (the height h of the water column is the function
    of water pressure p as p=ρgh ). In more contrast, the measured water column height
    utilized for communication purposes with the floating buoy (works as a relay)
    through sound waves and further relayed via satellite to the tsunami warning center
    [298]. The function of the tsunami buoy is depicted in Fig.16. D. Underwater Floating
    Drifters Through the immense development of drifters, observing the global ocean
    currents and their effects are the main concerns. Recent advancements of drifters
    support the ocean circulation patterns in real-time monitoring the deployment
    of the drifters possibly in shallow water by a ship or another source. On the
    deployment of the drifter when it floats, the transmitter is activated and starts
    to share the collected oceanographic data with the satellite, this collected data
    is further to transmitted with the offshore BS for analysis. Other inbuilt sensors
    at drifters are responsible for collecting the various types of data such as water
    surface temperature, wind, ocean color, pressure, and salinity [299]. The data
    synchronization with the satellite has been depicted in Fig.16. E. Underwater
    Hydrophones Generally, the signal propagation effects by channel impairments;
    noise is one of signal corrupting factors. The array of hydrophones are designed
    to be deployed for noise detection in an aqueous medium. Also, the hydrophones
    produce a limited voltage signal over high-frequency ranges while receiving the
    underwater sound from any direction. Deployment of an array of hydrophones amplifies
    and records the received noise more precisely. Omni-directional and Hemi-directional
    hydrophones support to collect the sound from a particular direction; it is also
    to track underwater the movement of underwater species. Therefore, hydrophones
    are the fundamental tools for plenty of undersea acoustic applications such as
    Sono-buoys, wired hydrophones, and autonomous hydrophones [287]. In addition,
    the NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) under NOAA’s National
    Marine Sanctuaries also frequently uses hydrophones [300]. In addition to that
    NOAA’s PMEL derives a long-term datasets for the global ocean acoustic environment.
    It has been utilized to identify and evaluate acoustic influences of human activities
    and natural disasters such as the eruption of an underwater volcano and glacial
    earthquakes in the marine environment [301]. The deployment of hydrophones in
    the underwater scenario has shown in Fig.16. F. Clod Cards Use the Measurement
    of Water Flow The clod cards are ice-shaped identical trapezoidal geometries and
    made by alabaster or plaster of Paris (gypsum blocks) and utilize to analyze underwater
    flow patterns. The ingredients of clod cards or made by the combination of the
    100ml of freshwater with 80gm plaster of Paris powder manufactured by the Hobby
    Craft Trading limited, Dorest UK [302]. In [302], the clod cards were sanded at
    the bottom of the water bodies to accomplish a consistent weight of 12.5 ± 1.5
    gm. Every individual plaster cube must be glued with the plastic plate size 3×8
    cm with silicone cement in this strategy. To measure the exact water flows analysis,
    the four clod cards established in four cardinal directions in front of their
    faces are fixed to a straight pole for at least 24 hours. The requirement of clod
    cards deployment in predetermined sites for various underwater applications such
    as divers, ROVs, and floating nodes. After a limited and fixed time duration (approximately
    1 to 2 days), the clod cards have to be retrieved, dried at 40 0 C , and reweighed
    to calculate the decay and the strong water flow. Conversely, the exact weight
    loss of the plaster of Paris is determined from each card and sent to the laboratory
    for further analysis. As a result, it can be concluded that the clods who lost
    more weight are exposed to greater water flow than those who lost less weight.
    Accordingly, the cloud card can be used to measure several other essential parameters
    from the ocean. An implementation of a clod card has been depicted in Fig.16.
    G. Satellite Oceanography The weather observational satellite is the most significant
    tool to share constructive information with the base station. Additionally, the
    satellite plays a vital role in ocean observation research and functions as an
    intermediate communication node for information transmission between the underwater
    and offshore base stations. For oceanographic data collection, environmental satellites
    are widely used to capture images and calculate the surface temperature of oceans.
    It is also used to know the water patterns and further shared the collected data
    with the terrestrial-based stations for analysis. For real-time video, steaming
    could be possible by utilizing satellites in different color coding techniques
    for water flow analysis. It supports determining the impact of floods and tsunami
    along the coastal area along with the detection of algal blooms. In the most recent
    years, remote sensing technology-enabled with the satellite that has boosted for
    data synchronization with altimetry (study to measures the height of sea surface),
    scatterometry (study to measures wind speed and direction), as well as the bathymetric
    (study of the ocean floor) approaches. These are the technologies that make the
    smart satellite for ocean observation, monitoring, and GPS. Additionally, to monitor
    early detection warnings to evacuate the coastal area and develop major storms,
    such as hurricanes and tornadoes, geosynchronous environmental satellites are
    being used. The most important information of coral reefs, coastal habitats, and
    similar environments can be analyzed by the satellite photography [303]. In Fig.16,
    an environmental satellite is depicted for ocean mapping. H. Remotely Operated
    Vehicles (ROVs) ROVs are accessed remotely and functioned similarly as a robot.
    This type of node has been designed for underwater exploration and deployment
    for various underwater applications to find the lost ships, repair and monitor
    gas pipelines, habitat mapping, etc. Specifically, the ROVs are equipped with
    sensors and sampling tools for data collection at variable distances from the
    oceans. A network cable is used to detect and observing the objects by illuminating
    the light, establishes a communication link between the base station and floating
    node to controls commands of the proper node movement. The ROV is a well-equipped
    floating vehicle enabled with advanced features that contain a lighting system
    with a camera at the frontal portion for videography to record a better sub-aquatic
    panorama. It is especially utilized in the aquatic medium for the contribution
    of geology education and sea life learning [304]. The exploration and functioning
    of ROV in an underwater medium have shown in Fig.16. SECTION XIII. Integration
    of Advance and Next Generation Communication Technology Currently, with the immense
    enhancement of data traffic in telecommunication industries, a large number of
    regular users have been observed. An alternative communication media has an essential
    role in the wireless networking era to fulfill the requirements of further innovations,
    research, and further development of new emerging communication technologies.
    The development of optical communication applications in visible light has become
    an immense growth in different fields. Nowadays, the trade of VLC applications
    became more reliable and highly efficient in acquiring indoor and outdoor scenarios.
    VLC uses the limited frequency ranges about 430 – 790 THz at the wavelength ranges
    380 – 750 nm. The benefit of this frequency range is the compatibility with the
    human eye with no effect on an electrical circuit. The basic concept in VLC signaling
    is the information modulation happens at the receiver end while demodulation is
    held by a photo-detector and decodes the signal from received information under
    fluctuation of the light intensity. The communication link is enabled with a lighting
    system as LED, which offers a considerable bandwidth with a desirable high data
    rate. Cellular technologies have changed and support improving the system qualities
    and performances. To proliferate smart internet-connected devices, emerging advanced
    future wireless networks play an ample role for an efficient and reliable communication
    link among the network architectural nodes as 5G networks have shown superior
    performances as a key enabling wireless technology. Also, the 5GB and 6G would
    be offered an immense performance while linked with the multiple nodes. The latest
    5GB wireless network would significantly impact various wireless connected applications
    such as intelligent transportation, device-to-device (D2D) communication, underwater
    optical communication, and internet-connected devices. The most recent survey
    on 6G wireless network carried out an outperform study about VLC enabling communication
    signaling through laser and LEDs [305]. A. 5G Networking System in Underwater
    5G wireless communication system has been designed to offer a significant improvement,
    especially for enhancing the system capacity, spectral efficiency, and energy
    efficiency of the communication system. For efficient and reliable wireless communication,
    5G is widely accepted to combine the small cell, picocells, and macrocells [306].
    The commercial use of 5G during 2019s established a collaborative communication
    system on a terrestrial basis, excluding the underwater environmental communication.
    The deployment of a 5G wireless network underwater will be an innovative step
    to improve data extraction from an aqueous medium for further analysis. As being
    improving the system capacity and essential assets of high data rate underwater
    wireless communication technology, optical communication towards 5G is the key
    solution that attracts the scientific community. Although, the most recent experimental
    study and the performance evaluation of 520nm wavelength laser-diode towards 5G
    is presented as [307]. In [307], the authors analyzed the performance of an underwater
    optical system under consideration of varying salinity conditions in pure water.
    Facing these issues, the Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) is
    proposed as a novel underwater wireless network candidate towards the next generation
    standard based on multi-branch multi-carrier filter bank in [43]. It is presented
    and generalized the traditional OFDM technique with several advantages as minimal
    peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Minimizing PAPR is one of the key advantage
    features in GFDM over OFDM and a significant parameter to analyze the performance
    characteristics of the communication system [308]. As recorded the limited bandwidth
    in underwater acoustic, OFDM suits for communication purposes. In contrast, OFDM
    offers a profitable integration over single-carrier modulations against the frequency
    selective fading [309]. Therefore, to come up for all these issues, the requirement
    to deploy multi-carrier transmission schemes. GFDM [310] and filter bank multi-carrier
    (FBMC) [311] are proposed the new promising emerging communication techniques
    towards 5G applications. B. Predictable 5G and Beyond (5GB) Networking System
    in Underwater The forthcoming next-generation 5G and beyond (5GB) communication
    will indeed offer numerous advanced services with ultra-high capabilities, an
    extensive number of device connectivity, very ultra-low energy consumption, and
    latency along with ultra-high security, extremely high quality of services (QoS),
    and high-resolution experience (HRE) [312]. The 6G networks are anticipated to
    accommodate and exceeded performance in comparison with 5G. Thus, the exceptionally
    high data will greatly impact networking users and the critical factor for more
    complex future challenges in various sectors such as in healthcare, long-range
    communication, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, underwater communication,
    etc. Though, the prediction to launch the 6G communication system is anticipated
    till 2030s [313]. Indeed, the 6G wireless communication network will provide the
    next level of signal transmission qualitative performance compared with 5G communication.
    The recent advances of and application of optical communication technologies towards
    5G/6G are summarized in detail [314]. An extremely high data rate up to 100Gbps
    by deploying VLC has been confirmed in [315] and [316]. Internet of underwater
    things (IoUTs) is the essential part of an underwater communication system connected
    with a standardized communication network for data extraction in the real-time
    scenario from the underwater environment. The implementation of 6G integrating
    UWC will be a revolutionary step to explore aqueous mediums as IoUTs connected
    with VLC. The most significant aim is predicted to connect underwater-based nodes
    with satellites for global coverage and observation all around the globe. C. Internet
    of Underwater Things (IoUTs) IoUTs refer to internet-connected devices that can
    easily and legitimately retrieve information through cabled or wireless-enabled
    connectivity. UIoTs claims to be an extension and development phase of IoTs, which
    allows the extraction of anonymous information from smart ocean [317]. IoUTs are
    enabled by the most recent developments of AUVs, ROVs, smart underwater sensor
    networks, and routing protocols. The architecture of UIoTs depicted in Fig.1 and
    Fig.13, enable numerous applications in an underwater environment in terms of
    sensing, monitoring, and identify underwater objects. In underwater internet of
    things (UIoTs), the sensor network nodes collect data and communicate with the
    cluster head. Furthermore, the received data has to transmit with a base station
    for subsequent analysis. The IoUTs structure enables the UVLC link to be classified
    into two major categories: horizontal and slant communication systems. Described
    in more detail, the horizontal link has been an extensively focused study on increasing
    data rate and signal propagation length along with reducing underwater turbulence
    effects while slant links formed high depth considering wave height wind speed,
    sea surface slope, and heavy turbulence conditions. On the other hand, in the
    vertical link for high depth, pressure increases up to 10bar for each k th layer
    (each layer for k=10m ) in addition temperature decreases from 250C to freezing
    point, the above matter facts due to varying salinity which affects the refractive
    index. SECTION XIV. Underwater Optical Wireless Network Applications Oceans are
    mysterious and challenging water bodies to explore. Plenty of natural disasters
    such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis occur by imbalanced water
    phenomena that could be observed and monitored by deploying communication links.
    To address the requirement of current emerging underwater applications which have
    been used in the context of rising water level, environmental monitoring, marine
    life, early detection tsunami, oil and gas rigs exploration, volcanic eruptions,
    coastal securities, and sliding tectonic plates, jointly with various hybrid wireless
    communication systems. Moreover, undersea wireless communication over long distances,
    UWSN plays an essential role in data transmission. The traditional acoustic modems
    are widely used in long-range UWC, whether low speed (approximately 1500 m/s)
    in such complexity of water channel conditions [318]. In more contrast, for high
    depth, the floating nodes AUVs, and UAVs are used to transfer information from
    source to destination. RF waves transmission show poor performance in an underwater
    environment cause the EM waves propagation depend on the intrinsic properties
    of the channel. Contrarily, the water medium has more density, permittivity, and
    higher electrical conductivity than air. Therefore, RF waves easily attenuate
    when propagating over successive distances [94]. For such transmission scenarios,
    a high data rate cooperative dual-hop RF-UVLC and FSO/UVLC systems are needed
    to be deployed [48], [180] [319]. As, VLC provides a high capacity of data rate
    over moderate distances, an acceptable wireless media for underwater mapping,
    and real-time video streaming with high resolution and various UVLC applications
    as follows. A. Ocean Floor Bathymetry The study of exploring the ocean floor is
    referred to the depths and shape of the underwater terrain [320], as stated bathymetry
    is the most significant investigation that deploys in numerous underwater applications.
    Additionally, the collection of geographical and oceanographic data analysis updates
    of weather and natural hazards on our earth. The massive water reservoirs are
    still unmapped, unexplored, and unobserved sectors. Only a very few oceanic portions
    have been mapped systematically by direct measurement [127]. The rest of the unexplored
    fraction of oceans are predicted by the satellite altimeter data, which is the
    approximated estimation structure of the seabed. A newly sounding technique is
    proposed that supports measuring ocean depth over less than 18% of the seafloor
    resolution about 1km [321]. Furthermore, the two most significant seafloor mapping
    techniques are proposed as Single Beam Echo-Sounders (SBES) [127], [322] and Multi-beam
    Echo-Sounders (MBES) [127], [323], respectively. The use of the two-way travel
    time of sound waves methodologies are used for measurement sea depth directly,
    where the sound waves strike with the seabed. On the other hand, in the MBES system,
    the enabled fan generates sound waves for further data collection. These sound
    waves are responsible for re-echoing signals generated in areas of the strait
    perpendicular to that fan, leading to the ocean floor mapping. Therefore, the
    established system receives hundreds of beams capable of mapping the narrow sectors
    up to 150 degrees. B. Underwater Environmental Exploration and Monitoring Most
    of the underwater environmental monitoring applications are related explicitly
    to observing manual and habitable activities in the oceanic environment. By deploying
    the UWSNs, the water pollution, water flows, and lives could be monitored. Additionally,
    the tectonic plate movement, underwater thunderstorms, earthquakes, and new formation
    of lands due to the eruption of volcanoes (the lava plays a significant role in
    forming a chunk of the island, etc.) being monitored. The floating nodes at different
    depths can observe and collect data of the 3D geometry of open oceans and terrains
    as human beings are highly interested in exploring the underwater environment
    since their existence. The scientific community is a witness in the exploration
    of less than 5% of oceans. A vast number of underwater applications are immersed
    by floating nodes as AUVs, ROVs, and UUVs for monitoring and observing the marine
    lives along with the three-dimensional geographical data within real-time scenario
    [283]. The study of monitoring water quality, pollution, impurities underwater
    is more challenging. Various water samples are being used to monitor water quality
    regarding the pH level, oxygen ( O 2 ), and ammonium nitrate ( N H 3 ). Moreover,
    the underwater monitoring also includes water macrophytes or hydrophytes, marine
    species, coral reefs, and algae for further analysis. In more contrast, environmental
    monitoring is also a fundamental approach through IoUT enabled applications which
    include the physio-chemical properties of water such as pressure, temperature,
    and variation in underwater are the main concerns [324]. The continuous monitoring
    of underwater helps to check remotely the pH water level. The water pollution
    monitoring is also substantial for the ecological system, especially for undersea
    species. IoUT provides an opportunity to explore the bottomless underwater reservoirs
    to discover lost human civilizations and lost treasure. Moreover, to identify
    the roughness of the seafloor, natural minerals, oil, and gas treasures. Many
    lost-treasure discoveries were made through the IoUTs. C. Navigation & Surveillance
    Oceans are highly complex and unguided water bodies which are 95% unexplored in
    scientific research. As a result, underwater navigation is more complicated than
    terrestrial basis. UWSNs are appropriate and the most suitable technological approach
    that supports navigation in hulking aqueous mediums. Especially, for navigation
    the 3D underwater sensor network (USN) localization system is investigated in
    [282]. In [282], the authors propose the superiority of 3D Underwater Sensor Positioning
    (USP) systematic planning, which is beneficial for improving localization capabilities
    over existing 3D sensor architectures with predictable, balanced communication
    underwater. An AUV-assisted localization scenario of USNs roaming across the underwater
    sensor fields is presented in [325]. A wide range of localization of acoustic
    network nodes in the underwater medium is summarized in open literature as in
    [326]–[332]. Since optical communication is a novel technique to implement the
    localization and navigation purposes. Therefore, the authors in [333] investigated
    the connectivity of underwater wireless optical sensor networks (UWOSNs) as the
    influential factor to the system performance. Most recently, an extensive study
    based on received signal strength to the centralized localization scheme is proposed
    in [13]. Counterpart surveillance is a more efficient tool for node detection
    for military purposes or coastal securities. AUVs are used as emerging communication
    nodes for surveillance and retrieving information for defense operations. A most
    recent survey summarized the AUV capabilities for underwater communication in
    [271]. The authors in [271] are widely discussed the possible underwater application
    through AUV such as signal transmission, localization, and navigation purposes
    where the RF waves are incapable of retrieving the digital information. D. Naval-Mine
    Reconnaissance As we know that underwater environments are highly deepest and
    massive water reservoirs, countless mines in oceans could be found by deploying
    UWSNs connecting with ships safe voyage or floating and operational activities.
    A recent work is proposed to design an underwater mine detection system in [334].
    The authors have suggested a model minefield that includes the type of mines to
    be detected and mine-clearing operations by deploying the sonar waves in the various
    depth of the oceanic environment. Another impressive work in the open literature,
    where the authors have proposed the detection of underwater mines in real-time
    scenarios [335]. In [335], an AUV floats at different depths with sonar waves
    transmission along with a camera for real-time observation. Naval mines are also
    a real threat to maritime and naval tactical operations. Underwater-based mines
    hide or buried by the high altitude of tides and water currents, even covered
    by muddy soil at the sea bottom [336]. In most of the conditions, the naval mines
    are undetectable by low-frequency ranges. To cope with this issue, the challenge
    is that a high-frequency range of sonar should be mounted through an AUV to detect
    or bathymetric data of naval mines. For instance, the ECA Group deals with the
    issues within an innovative technological solution to perform complex missions
    in hostile or harsh environments [336]. According to SOACYS, the first prototype
    in the form of a 5 to 40m longship is used to collect oceanic data 1 Teabyte within
    2400km of survey lines [337]. This small ship prototype is used for various applications
    such as UneXploded Ordnance (UXO), debris, boulders, pipelines/cables, marine
    archeology, sedimentary studies, etc. E. Border & Coastal Securities The border
    and coastal securities applications are mainly used to observe unwanted activities
    in coastal areas such as entry port security, land border security, and maritime
    border security. Taking account of these issues, USWNs an emerging technique for
    various military operations and are used for military communication purposes.
    These integral networking signals have a key role in providing such facilities
    to the military as surveillance, intelligence, localization, targeting positions,
    and tracking nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. A high capacity command
    control communication system of ASELSAN is used to enhance situational awareness,
    accurate decision making, and faster response qualities in coastal and border
    security system solutions [338]. F. Seismic Monitoring and Ocean Sampling The
    oceans are extremely large water reservoirs that change over the time. The sensor
    nodes are the main advantageous communication networking tools for sampling and
    observing the underwater environment, collecting oceanographic data, and transmitting
    signals to the source (e.g., base stations, etc.). The floating sensor nodes could
    be deployed at high depth for ocean mapping and underwater sampling activities.
    Furthermore, earthquakes, tsunami, and floods are sudden and unexpected events
    that cause major catastrophy worldwide. Sudden slip of bedrock causes seismic
    waves that shake the ground. UWSNs are dedicated to monitoring seismic activities
    and recording data for early detection warning [339]. G. Future Direction UVLC
    has drawn attention to the futuristic deployment of UWC, which opens the doors
    of advanced wireless communication systems towards 5GB networking system in the
    nearest future. Currently, it is possible to transmit the data at high speed as
    well as the wireless energy transfer through the illumination phenomena of LEDs.
    UVLC has a fruitful future perspectives due to the wide range of popularity of
    LEDs all around the world [42]. Therefore, UVLC has shown potential acceptability
    for next-generation 5GB networking systems for further developments in the digital
    wireless generation of communication phase. LEDs are very cost-effective optical
    signaling elements that have more superiority over traditional wireless communication
    media. The light spectrum of the optical beam visible light and LED illumination
    is a comfortable illusion for aquatic species. Therefore, the essentiality for
    promising extensive research is required for more advanced, very cost-effective
    light-emitting and photon receiving detectors. The less expensive, tiny in size,
    less power consumption, and high compatibility with neighboring optical network
    UVLC claim the most significant wireless carriers. The traditional acoustic and
    RF wireless candidates are lagging behind for underwater signaling with low data-rate
    (few kbps); therefore UVLC fills the gap (Mbps to Gbps data transmission rates)
    of desired communication. In more contrast, the IoUT networks support the mobility
    of the devices in a very divisive medium within 3D channel coverage. Plenty of
    UWC applications enabled with ROVs, UUVs, and AUVs are widely employable with
    VLC format. The hybrid communication systems with 5GB networks are capable of
    connecting an enormous number of devices on terrestrial to underwater-based internet
    connecting things for further exploration of unguided oceanic sectors. The predictable
    scenario is establishing the underwater environment of the satellite becoming
    a universal digital communication sphere. As a substitute, UVLC supports high
    data rates (3Gb/s DMT VLC transmissions) [340] over short distances with low latency.
    SECTION XV. Conclusion UVLC approach builds up a wireless connection between terrestrial
    and floating nodes in an underwater environment. The possible solution to cope
    with the challenges and affecting factors of signal propagation are widely studied
    in this research. UVLC has become the most significant trade for signaling in
    aqueous mediums towards the futuristic 5GB wireless networking systems. The most
    recent advances through the current project schemes all around the globe to enhance
    the interest in marine industries along with various underwater applications are
    the main perspectives. The UVLC technological critics of signal propagation and
    channel impairments are the main issues due to the various types of underwater-based
    hybrid communication scenarios are summarized in this paper. Additionally, the
    architectural design of UWNs with higher modulation techniques is quite challenging
    to deploy over long-range communication in marine industries. Due to this, the
    different types of hybrid communication approaches are investigated according
    to requirements and geographical environments. The IoUTs play an ample role as
    a backbone in communication among transceivers. In the IoUT networks, the modems
    may contain some advanced signal tools for the purpose of achieving reliable high-data
    rates with diminishing influential factors such as noise and channel impairments
    in the correspondence of physical layers. This study contributes the solution
    of various range of channel impairment challenges and provides an overview of
    the latest projects schemes along with the future perspectives towards the 5GB
    networking system in this particular domain. Authors Figures References Citations

    Metrics Abstract: IoT systems use sensors to collect data from smart environments
    and manage resources through data analysis. An IoT system deals with many connected
    devices with different network and hardware constraints in a real-world scenario.
    An IoT system needs to handle low-latency data analysis, security threats, internal
    vulnerabilities, and network disconnections, which cause data loss and incorrect
    decisions. Trustworthiness (also known as dependability) provides various features
    for an IoT end-to-end data flow, such as resilience, security, availability, reliability,
    scalability, maintainability, heterogeneity, hardware resources management, fault
    management policies, and data quality. This paper presents a survey on trustworthiness
    and dependability in IoT systems and proposes the Trustworthiness for IoT Framework
    (TW-IoT) to provide trustworthiness at the data level for mist and fog-based IoT
    systems. The TW-IoT framework provides data trustworthiness to ensure a continuous
    and uninterrupted operation of IoT data flow. We also discuss challenges and trade-offs
    related to data trustworthiness in IoT. Thing-Mist-Fog-Cloud IoT computing continuum.

    I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is a networked system with billions
    of connected physical devices (sensors and actuators) transmitting and receiving
    data in a given context application [1]–[3]. IoT systems can monitor water distribution
    and irrigation in agriculture, reduces logistics costs, monitor patient health
    in a hospital, or optimize vehicle traffic through smart traffic lights [4]–[7].
    Therefore, an IoT system grants services to smart scenarios in different contexts,
    efficiently managing hardware, software, and communication resources to reduce
    costs in specific domains. In IoT, dealing with vulnerabilities of a vast number
    of heterogeneous and hardware-constrained devices is a challenge [4], [8]. Trustworthiness
    enhances IoT system features to handle several system challenges. However, there
    is no consensus in the literature about the definition of trustworthiness, as
    some research lines limit this concept to security scope handling only malicious
    attacks [9], [10]. Risks and threats for IoT systems involve malicious attacks
    by external agents and system threats such as faults, vulnerabilities, or unexpected
    system behaviors. Trustworthiness and dependability [11], [12] are similar concepts.
    They include requirements of system availability, reliability, scalability, maintainability,
    heterogeneity, data quality, hardware resources, security, agility in the response
    time, and system and network resilience [13]. A way to enforce trustworthiness
    requirements in IoT systems is using fog computing because it allows real-time
    data analysis at the edge [14]–[17]. Fog computing does not limit data analysis
    to a centralized cloud server. Fog enables local data analysis at the network
    edge [18], [19], reducing the network throughput and the need for data processing
    in a cloud [20], as well as allowing faster decision-making at the edge [19],
    [21]–[23]. However, even a fog-based IoT system has trustworthiness challenges,
    considering mechanisms to manage the IoT devices’ data flow and the network, memory,
    and energy consumption constraints [8], [24], [25]. This paper presents a research
    overview of IoT trustworthiness to identify problems, challenges, approaches,
    solutions, and technologies. We identify gaps and challenges about trustworthiness
    in IoT systems and also propose the Trustworthiness for IoT Framework (TW-IoT).
    Based on mist [26] and fog computing, TW-IoT provides trustworthiness from a data
    flow perspective throughout different IoT stages (thing, mist, fog, and cloud).
    The main contributions of this paper are (i) to clarify concepts, characteristics,
    and gaps about trustworthiness in IoT systems, (ii) to propose the TW-IoT framework
    that contains a set of techniques and mechanisms for ensuring trustworthiness
    in the development of an IoT system based on mist and fog computing, (iii) to
    propose a data flow for each IoT stage (thing, mist, fog, and cloud), using the
    TW-IoT framework, (iv) to expose some trade-offs among trustworthiness mechanisms
    for the IoT data flow and finally, (v) to present the challenges related to trustworthiness
    in IoT systems. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II
    defines a fog-based IoT system architecture, Section III contextualizes concepts
    of trustworthiness, dependability, and data trustworthiness, Section IV presents
    this paper adopted terminologies, and Section V describes the trustworthiness
    related studies. Section VI introduces the TW-IoT framework for data trustworthiness
    in IoT systems based on mist and fog computing. Section VII exemplifies TW-IoT
    mechanisms for IoT data flow stages (thing, mist, fog, and cloud), and Section
    VIII explains trade-offs between these mechanisms. Section IX discusses the lessons
    learned and challenges, and finally, Section X presents conclusions and future
    work. SECTION II. Thing-Mist-Fog-Cloud IoT Computing Continuum The Internet of
    Things (IoT) connects billions of embedded devices (sensors and actuators), transmitting
    and receiving data in a network [1], [27]. Through Internet, sensors send data
    to be processed and analyzed in a cloud server, whose results can generate instructions
    to actuators. Fig. 1 describes the underlying IoT Computing Continuum [28], providing
    the rationale for analyzing the trustworthiness concept, based on four processing
    stages: thing, mist, fog, and cloud. FIGURE 1. Thing-Mist-Fog-Cloud IoT computing
    continuum. Show All A. Thing Stage The Thing stage contains the physical devices:
    sensors and actuators. Sensors gather data from a specific environment, sending
    them to the Mist stage and beyond. After it, the IoT system uses data fusion or
    different models (e.g., machine/deep learning) according to a specific application
    [29]. As a result, the model generates a decision and sends it back to actuators
    in the Thing stage as commands to change the environment accordingly (e.g., turn
    on/ off some equipment). B. Mist Stage The mist processing stage is closer to
    sensors [30], playing the role of a specific fog node deployed in the field, providing
    direct support for the communication of sensors and actuators with the Internet.
    Mist computing is a subset of fog computing, running on constrained resource equipment,
    such as single-board computers [31], [32]. A mist node significant function is
    behaving as a radio gateway for sensors and actuators, as defined by RFC 8376
    [33]. Also, it can store, preprocess, and analyze data in a distributed fashion
    over multiple nodes. For that reason, one of the mist computing benefits is to
    improve the system scalability, as it may help increase the autonomy of devices
    closer to the edge [26]. C. Fog Stage Fog computing addresses new challenges related
    to the massive amount of data generated by the increasing use of IoT systems [16],
    [18], [20]. Fog computing supports a virtualized computing platform that offers
    processing, storage, and communication services between devices, users, and the
    cloud datacenter [34]. The main goals of fog computing are (i) decreasing latency
    for real-time services negatively affected by the long physical distance between
    devices and cloud data centers, (ii) enabling system load-balance at the edge
    and reducing processing in the cloud, and (iii) decreasing data traffic between
    the edge and the network core as the system does not need to send all data to
    the cloud. Similarly to a cloud service, a fog node can store data and process
    models such as machine learning or data fusion algorithms to forecast certain
    behaviors or make decisions. However, there are significant differences between
    cloud and fog, such as the limited availability of computing resources, the security
    policies, and the hardware performance (memory and processing) [16], [35]. Fog
    is not a mandatory stage in IoT systems. However, its potential benefits may be
    worth it, such as reduced response times at the edge and more robust network resilience
    [36]. Local data processing also prevents sending irrelevant data to the cloud
    [22] by analyzing sensor data locally [20]. D. Cloud Stage Cloud computing has
    data processing high performance because it provides hardware resources in a scalable
    approach through cloud services virtualization [37]. A cloud service customer
    can execute multiple processes on a large scale since the cloud provides distributed
    hardware resources on demand for these processes [38]. The cloud plays a crucial
    role in any IoT system. Theoretically, the cloud stage is not needed because everything
    can be processed at an edge, e.g., in a farm office for smart agriculture. However,
    in practice, the cloud’s resources, robustness, and reliability, either public
    or private, are unavoidable characteristics. SECTION III. Trustworthiness and
    Related Paradigms In this section, we explain the concepts of trustworthiness,
    dependability, and data trustworthiness. A. Trustworthiness and Dependability
    Trustworthiness allows the uninterrupted continuity of system services [39]. In
    other words, a trustworthy (dependable) system should adapt and tolerate vulnerabilities
    throughout its life cycle [40]. The trustworthiness definition consists of system
    requirements concerning multiple aspects, such as security, resilience, availability,
    reliability, scalability, maintainability, heterogeneity, data quality, hardware
    resources, and fault management policies [13]. Some authors limit the trustworthiness
    concept as dealing with system security only [9], [41]. However, throughout this
    paper, trustworthiness and dependability are equivalent concepts [11], [12]. Trustworthiness
    is not only associated with failures in the system security level (by attacks)
    but also with general system vulnerabilities [13], [42]–[44]. Therefore, we consider
    the concepts of trustworthiness and dependability as synonyms, even though there
    is no consensus in the community [11], [12]. IoT critical systems need to deal
    with privacy, heterogeneity, and data analysis from billions of devices [45] in
    real-time, as well as system failures and real-time decision-making [45], [46].
    Consequently, trustworthiness is essential in these IoT environments [47]–[50].
    B. Data Trustworthiness Trustworthiness is not limited only to enhance the system
    at the software/hardware level but also to improve the system at the data level
    [44], [51]. An IoT system that collects data in an environment must ensure the
    data trustworthiness, verifying if that data contains relevant information to
    the application domain. Data trustworthiness needs to ensure data veracity, according
    to the IoT system context [52], [53]. For example, supposing the IoT system collects
    data from tropical weather. In that case, the IoT system must verify the data
    behavior, referring to these climate conditions. Otherwise, in future data analysis,
    the IoT system may not respond correctly, making wrong decisions, causing a vulnerability
    at the data level. In an IoT system, ensuring data trustworthiness also means
    ensuring resilient data flow. Therefore, the data trustworthiness consists of
    maintaining data flow continuity and trusted system decisions [44], [53]. SECTION
    IV. Adopted Terminologies We adopt terminologies in this paper as the IoT system
    concepts, IoT smart service, IoT smart application, context, and a mechanism in
    our proposal called the integration of smart everything (explained in Section
    VII). We refer to the system context as circumstance or condition related to external
    or internal variations in an IoT system environment [17], [54], [55], as the weather
    temperature, energy consumption, soil moisture, or wind velocity measurement variations.
    An IoT smart service contains smart applications. For example, a smart service
    refers to smart farming, smart mobility, or smart hospital service. At the same
    time, a smart application corresponds to applications of these smart services.
    Thus, a smart farming service contains smart applications like smart irrigation,
    smart water management, smart pest control, and a smart monitoring crop growth
    application. The IoT system represents the entire hardware and software system,
    which contains IoT smart services and, consequently, IoT smart applications. An
    ideal IoT system has multiple smart services connected by the mechanism that we
    call smart everything. SECTION V. Trustworthiness Related Studies We searched
    studies that explicitly use concepts and definitions of trustworthiness and dependability
    with the following combination of terms: dependability and IoT, trustworthiness
    and IoT, trustworthy IoT. We searched papers in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library,
    Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Springer Link. We also examined the abstracts
    of the articles. For the survey scope, we found a total of 57 studies related
    to dependability and trustworthiness. We perceived that 56 investigations refer
    to IoT, fog, or edge computing. We also observed that one study only focusing
    mainly on physical devices (sensors and actuators). We identified 24 papers referring
    only to trustworthiness, 27 to dependability, and six mentioned both terms (TABLE
    1). TABLE 1 Topics Per Paper A. Related Studies Categories We classify 57 studies
    related to dependability and trustworthiness: 18 present conceptual studies, 10
    introduce a framework, 10 describe a mathematical investigation, eight present
    a performance analysis, six report algorithms or techniques, three show an architectural
    approach, and two focus on hardware related issues (Fig. 2). FIGURE 2. Related
    studies categories. Show All 1) Conceptual Regarding studies that present definitions
    on dependability and trustworthiness, some papers explore the state of the art
    and definitions [9], [42], [43], [56]–[63]. We also found surveys on trustworthiness
    [64]–[68] and dependability [69] and a systematic literature review (SLR) on dependability
    [70]. 2) Framework Design Some papers propose a framework for resource management
    in fog/cloud [71], other propose a framework for trust management for IoT devices
    [51], [72], [73], and fog nodes [74]. Also, some papers focus on security issues
    [10], [75]–[77] or fault recovery [78]. 3) Mathematical Approach Among research
    on IoT dependability, we found five studies that present mathematical approaches
    to measuring system reliability and availability [79]–[83]. In contrast, two others
    propose a calculus to estimate a confidence score to sensors [41], [84], and users
    [85]. We also found a proposal for an optimization approach for some dependability
    characteristics [86] and a theoretical approach based on Markov models to deal
    with vulnerabilities in a healthcare system [87]. 4) Performance Analysis Among
    the papers reporting a performance evaluation, some analyze trustworthiness by
    energy consumption [88]–[90], evaluate protocols [91], and communication interfaces
    [92]. Two papers compare different machine learning techniques for malicious data
    detection [93], [94], and another one compares machine learning techniques for
    data (image) reconstruction [95]. 5) Algorithms/Techniques We identified papers
    that propose techniques or algorithms to improve dependability characteristics
    [39], [96]–[98], or techniques related to trust management mechanisms [99], [100].
    6) Architectural Approach We found three studies that propose architectural approaches:
    an architectural approach for a gateway that provides security to an IoT system
    [101]; a conceptual architecture for data provenance [102]; a standards-oriented
    approach [103]. 7) Hardware Design We found two studies that propose solutions
    at the hardware level, dealing with system cryptography [104], and with limited
    computational resources in IoT focused on device memory constraints [105]. B.
    Trustworthiness Features We consider the following set of features describes the
    trustworthiness concept: security (integrity, confidentiality, availability, and
    authenticity), system and network resilience, data quality (and semantic integrity),
    system availability, system reliability, scalability, maintainability, survivability,
    heterogeneity, IoT constraints (latency, memory, processing power, energy consumption),
    fault management and redundancy (see TABLE 2). TABLE 2 Trustworthiness Features
    in Related Work 1) Security Data security is a feature for ensuring the IoT system
    trustworthiness [64], [88], [106]. A secure system needs to provide data integrity,
    authenticity, confidentiality to protect data from malicious attacks or not authorized
    access [107]. As shown in TABLE 2, we observed that security is the most mentioned
    feature of an IoT system’s trustworthiness. The main security features that we
    found as follows: Integrity: refers to data content preservation, ensuring that
    data is not corrupted or altered by a malicious user or software. Integrity is
    strongly associated with IoT system trustworthiness because fraudulent data turns
    the system no longer reliable [64] since it makes wrong decisions [66]. Authenticity:
    IoT data is authentic when it comes from a source that is a trusted part of the
    system [104], [107]. Unknown sensors can transmit non-authentic data with information
    that differs from the application context [97]. One way to deal with unreliable
    sensors in IoT is through the traceability of transmitted data [73] or by verifying
    the behavior of network sensors’ energy consumption [84]. When there is a lack
    of data authenticity, integrity is not necessarily compromised, as the data is
    not corrupted or altered but fabricated. Therefore, a trustworthy IoT system must
    deal with mechanisms to verify data authenticity. Confidentiality: ensures that
    third parties have no access to IoT devices’ data by packet interception [65].
    Consequently, the IoT system must restrict data access via encryption mechanisms
    and access validation policies [64]. Availability: from the security viewpoint,
    availability deals with interruptions [9], [104] caused by attacks such as denial
    of service (DoS), for example. However, the availability concept has a broader
    scope. A system can stop working even without any external attack but due to other
    vulnerabilities. 2) Resilience Resilience of a computer system is part of the
    trustworthiness concept [94]. It includes the ability to deal with system failures.
    Thus, a resilient system can prevent, tolerate, mitigate, remove, and predict
    failures [108], [109]. In a system with devices connected to a network, resilience
    is responsible for maintaining or recovering the communication service between
    devices, regardless of network failures [110], [111]. The concept of resilience
    is the system’s ability to resist failures [112] using recoverability (survivability),
    adaptability, and the capacity to manage failures [13]. Network, hardware, or
    software vulnerabilities can interrupt a system service, so the system must react
    to these failures when they occur. However, there are computing costs to support
    system resilience [113]. The system requires resources to recover from a failure,
    to solve or mitigate a threat, reducing or compromising the system performance.
    A resilient IoT system must deal with resource constraints (network, battery,
    memory, and processing capacity limitations) because IoT devices must react to
    failures as quickly as possible. After all, operations must occur in real-time
    [69]. A resilient fog-based IoT system data flow must prevent data losses caused
    by the network connection failure between mist/fog components. The fog also needs
    to deal with data loss due to low storage capacity in mist/fog nodes memory [111].
    A relevant resilience challenge deals with network disconnection between components
    of different IoT stages, such as thing, mist, fog, or cloud [16], [114]–[121].
    Therefore, it is necessary to establish mechanisms to ensure resilience to fog-based
    IoT systems for data transmission [16], [122], such as fault management mechanisms
    for IoT nodes [16]. A resilient system must provide security and fault management
    mechanisms. The survivability concept offers the system’s continuity through fault
    recovery techniques, which recovery techniques are one of the fault management
    features. Moreover, redundancy is a technique that the system uses to recover
    from a failure. 3) Fault Management In computer systems, a failure represents
    an unexpected behavior. In the IoT data domain, it is possible to exemplify some
    of these behaviors as data integrity loss due to semantic/syntactic vulnerabilities,
    packet loss due to network interference or connection loss between fog nodes [70],
    and data loss caused by network exhaustion or device memory overflow. The literature
    categorizes fault management into four main aspects: fault detection, fault prediction,
    fault recovery (or mitigation), and fault prevention: Fault detection: fault detection
    in IoT is the verification of unexpected behavior using, for example, statistical
    analysis or machine learning methods [69]. IoT makes it possible to detect sensor
    failures, for example, by monitoring data values coming, such as the detection
    of outliers [97]. Fault prediction: consists of predicting the fault occurrence.
    In IoT, the most common method for predicting a fault is through probabilistic
    models or data regression techniques. Fault recovery or mitigation: A way of recovering
    from a failure in IoT is, for example, using load balancing between nodes to mitigate
    service discontinuation [74]. Some studies also deal with IoT fault recovery by
    using redundancy techniques [58]. Fault prevention: When the system predicts a
    fault (perceive the fault condition before it occurs), the system can perform
    mechanisms to prevent a failure (which refers to the system’s inability to operate).
    Redundancy is an example of a mechanism for fault prevention by replicating data
    from a fog node to other fog nodes. 4) Survivability Survivability is part of
    the concept of resilience and represents a system’s ability to survive attacks,
    failures, or degradation [13], [61]. In the fog computing scope, survivability
    maintains the data flow continuity between the IoT stages (from the thing stage
    until the cloud stage). This feature uses some mechanisms to increase an IoT system’s
    ability to survive vulnerabilities, such as data replication or fault management
    mechanisms. Also, fog-based IoT systems can rely on load balancing. In the fog
    node’s imminent resource exhaustion, the fog can transfer its workload to other
    nodes [74]. An open issue related to survivability is data loss [16], which can
    occur by an eventual disconnection between IoT stages, such as between fog and
    cloud. After a disconnection, when the connection returns, the data not sent to
    the cloud is not necessarily immediately transmitted, causing a data flow gap
    between fog and cloud. Therefore, IoT stages must store data temporarily during
    disconnections and transmit it to the next stage when the connection is active
    again. Delay-tolerant networking (DTN) is a mechanism that deals with data loss
    due to network disconnections [123] and can be used together with fog-based IoT
    systems [124]–[128]. However, these proposals only focus on delay or packet loss,
    disregarding the solution impact on fog resources. Besides, the DTN design does
    not deal with IoT trustworthiness requirements. 5) Redundancy Redundancy increases
    IoT systems’ reliability and availability [58] by replicating data from one node
    to other nodes. When, for example, a fog node A fails, the system continues to
    operate if other fog nodes B and C have a data copy from the failed fog node A.
    Redundancy is not limited to providing system data replication. It also includes
    connection replication using different communication technology on the same IoT
    device [82], [83]. For example, in case of a connection failure in the LPWAN interface,
    the device may use a Wi-Fi or 4G connection to reestablish communication with
    other nodes [92]. 6) Data Quality/Semantic Integrity Data quality is related to
    the IoT system context, and it directly impacts the solution decisions. The system
    context refers to a circumstance or condition related to external or internal
    variations in an IoT system environment [17], [54], [55], as the weather temperature,
    energy consumption, soil moisture, or wind velocity measurement variations. Assuring
    data quality involves verifying whether the gathered data represents the actual
    system context [51], which means that semantic data integrity is essential in
    assessing data quality [129]. For example, in an environment where the climate
    is always humid, data with a dry climate’s characteristics is likely wrong. As
    the IoT system context directly impacts the actuators’ actions, maintaining data
    quality ensures data trustworthiness [51]. The IoT system can verify data trust
    by the data type, system behavior, and context. Therefore, an IoT system previously
    needs to know the context and problem domain to provide trustworthy data analysis
    [129]. An IoT system needs to use meaningful data for decision-making [130], which
    means that part of the initial data processing must identify and remove data outliers.
    However, in cases of fake or manipulated data, it is necessary to observe whether
    the data comes from unreliable sensors [65], [95]. A data filter can solve this
    problem [97] since fake data can compromise future system actions. 7) System Availability
    Availability ensures that the IoT system continues operating as long as possible.
    There are methods to keep the system available, like managing hardware redundancy
    [63], [82], and maintaining a fault management mechanism [58]. Some IoT applications
    are latency-sensitive and, consequently, require low latency for transmitting
    packets between IoT stages. Therefore, these systems are always available when
    it performs all actions in real-time [60]. System availability is a metric that
    indicates the operation system probability until it begins a failure state (Equation
    1) [131]. Therefore, availability is given by the MTTF (mean time to failure)
    divided by MTTF + MTTR (mean time to repair). Availability= MTTF MTTF+MTTR (1)
    View Source 8) System Reliability Reliability, as well as availability, is a relevant
    metric to ensure IoT trustworthiness. However, it is worth empathizing that both
    concepts differ since availability demands the whole system to be continuously
    available, while reliability refers to system operations’ confidence [63]. Thus,
    reliability can be measured by the probability that a system will behave as expected
    for a specific time interval (t). We measure the reliability by the MTBF (mean
    time between failures) metric if the system has some fault recovery mechanism.
    However, we measure the reliability by the MTTF (mean time to failure) if there
    is no recovery mechanism. For calculation, the first case we consider λ=1 / MTBF
    and for the second λ=1 / MTTF. Thus, we describe reliability by Equation (2),
    where R (t) is the reliability function of time t, and λ is the miss rate [132].
    R(t)= e −λt (2) View Source 9) Scalability In a scenario with thousands or millions
    of sensors, IoT systems must satisfy the scalability demand to sustain a massive
    data transmission, storage, and analysis in real-time [15], [19]. A trustworthy
    system must be scalable because poor system performance and slow data analysis
    can result in delayed and, consequently, wrong decisions. Besides, with imprecise
    choices, the system harms data trustworthiness. The scalability feature implies
    providing more computing resources to the IoT system [63]. In a fog-based IoT
    system, nodes can become computationally saturated because, in a real scenario,
    the fog is responsible for dealing with thousands of devices [60]. Therefore,
    the scalable deployment of fog computing systems requires the necessary hardware
    infrastructure. The IoT system is more trustworthy with thousands of sensors because
    it stores more information, allowing it to make more precise decisions based on
    the gathered data. However, a system with many sensors demands additional security,
    network, and resilience requirements. Maintain a scalable and continuous data
    flow requires communication resilience between the IoT stages (mist-mist, mist-fog,
    fog-fog, and fog-cloud) [24], [122]. 10) Heterogeneity A real IoT system scenario
    comprises several heterogeneous communications and device technologies [27]. IoT
    communication protocols provide interaction between different devices because
    IoT devices have different hardware technologies and cannot understand each other.
    Multiple protocols differ in terms of packet formats and communication technologies,
    and not all protocols can support every IoT system [133]. Furthermore, dealing
    with heterogeneity is an essential trustworthiness issue. LPWAN (low power wide
    area network) technologies provide long transmission ranges, low energy consumption,
    and low bandwidth. LPWAN is an attractive technology for IoT systems that send
    a few dozens of bytes every couple of minutes or hours [134], [135]. LoRaWAN,
    Sigfox, and NB-IoT are LPWAN technologies leading this front [27], [136]. There
    are other technologies for IoT system communications, as Bluetooth [133], Zigbee
    [137], and Z-Wave [138]. The IoT developer can also adopt IEEE 802.11 standards
    (Wi-Fi), transmitting over short-range distances by devices with no battery constraints
    [133]. IoT system trustworthiness solves the interconnection problems between
    heterogeneous devices. The massive number of highly heterogenous devices can increase
    communication faults in IoT infrastructures [69]. Hence, the system must support
    interoperability [76], allowing intercommunication between applications and devices
    for every connected node [20]. 11) Quality of Service (QOS) IoT systems, based
    on fog or not, must process data from thousands of sensors in real-time. Therefore,
    there is a concern with network latency in sending data from a stage to another
    since a long packet delay can impair critical decisions ’ agility and correctness.
    There is also a data loss problem caused by low-quality network connection [89]
    or caused by a disconnection between IoT stages. Some IoT latency-sensitive systems
    do not accept packet delay or packet loss problems [50]. These circumstances only
    contribute to generating undesirable behavior, affecting the system’s trustworthiness.
    As previously mentioned, trustworthiness also deals with the choice of communication
    technologies. There may be interference between specific transmission protocol
    frequencies or range restrictions between devices [133], [136]. For example, for
    the Zigbee technology [137], the transmission distance range is lower than the
    LoRaWAN range [136]. 12) Memory Capacity Maintaining all system data stored is
    a way to ensure IoT data trustworthiness [56]. However, IoT devices frequently
    suffer from primary memory constraints. Keeping data in an IoT device for an indefinite
    time has a high cost. If we suppose a fog node that loses the cloud connection
    but continues to receive data from sensors and stores the data until the Internet
    connectivity returns, the storage memory can overflow. In this case, data fusion
    is a way to reduce these costs, joining consecutive stored data [105]. 13) Energy
    Consumption Most IoT devices have little autonomy due to limited battery [88],
    [59]. The impact of this constraint can reflect in (i) faults of data gathering
    whenever a sensor runs out of battery [89], (ii) storage gaps in a data time series,
    and (iii) wrong data analysis, since the gap in time series, harms the data analysis,
    and consequently untrusty decisions. Therefore, data trustworthiness needs to
    consider the device’s energy consumption. In smart farming, energy harvesting
    is a feasible solution for device battery constraints, such as photovoltaic cells
    [139]. However, this strategy does not work for all scenarios. For this reason,
    a relevant research challenge is reducing energy consumption in IoT devices [140],
    [141]. 14) Processing Power One critical aspect of IoT systems design and development
    is the limited devices processing power capacity [59]. Therefore, it is crucial
    to consider the processing constraints, especially for mist and fog nodes, since
    they are, to a great extent, responsible for ensuring trustworthiness. In latency-sensitive
    IoT systems, some scenarios require real-time data processing [56], and the processing
    power directly impacts a system execution time (see Equation 3) [131]. Many IoT
    operations are related to fault detection, data redundancy, or load balancing.
    Therefore, IoT processing power is a concern to provide trustworthiness to IoT
    systems. CPU execution time for a program = CPU clock cycles for a program Clock
    rate (3) View Source 15) Maintainability Maintainability refers to a system’s
    capacity to deal with changes [59], [69], including system evolution and adaptation.
    In a resilient computer system, adaptability suggests that the system can learn
    specific attack types to make the most appropriate decisions to protect against
    an attack [13]. C. V’S of Big Data and Trustworthiness Features in IoT Big data
    systems have several V features, such as variety, veracity, volume, velocity,
    and value [142], [143], which overlap some data trustworthiness characteristics
    for IoT. Variety deals with heterogeneity problems such as the treatment of data
    types. Veracity relates to data quality. Volume reflects the concern of analyzing
    information on a very large scale. Velocity assumes that computer systems must
    process and store data in real-time. Finally, value considers the data relevance
    for an application [142], [143]. SECTION VI. TW-IoT Framework: a Mist-Fog-Based
    Framework for Data Trustworthiness to the Internet of Things In Section V, we
    presented the related studies on trustworthiness for IoT. However, there is still
    an unbridged gap in the literature: an architectural framework with concrete roles
    and mechanisms to ensure data trustworthiness in each stage of a mist-fog computing
    architecture. With this challenge in mind, we propose the Trustworthiness for
    IoT Framework (TW-IoT) (Fig. 3), comprised of features, mechanisms, recommendations,
    and methods to ensure data flow continuity and data trustworthiness for mist-fog-based
    IoT systems. The proposed framework contains four stages (thing, mist, fog, and
    cloud), based on the IoTinuum architecture [28] (Section II) and four layers (device,
    transport, data, and model) based on the IoTecture architecture [28]: Device Layer:
    comprises different mechanisms to ensure data trustworthiness in the physical
    devices. Transport Layer: contains mechanisms responsible for packet security
    and trustworthiness in connection, communication, and data transmission over the
    network. Data Layer: contains mechanisms for ensuring data quality and dealing
    with meaningful information in the data, as data value and veracity. Model Layer:
    this layer is related to trustworthiness in data decision models and system data
    analysis. FIGURE 3. TW-IoT framework mechanisms. Show All We also propose six
    data trustworthiness design views: data processing, data resilience, data trust,
    data security, data heterogeneity, and data fusion (Fig. 3). A. Data Resilience
    View The IoT system needs to ensure continuous and uninterrupted data flow through
    the IoT stages. Therefore, we design the data resilience view to endure vulnerabilities
    and data loss. This view includes data prediction, data flow persistence (data
    persistence mechanism, load balance, redundancy), and storage management mechanisms.
    1) Data Persistence Mechanism This mechanism focuses on ensuring data persistence
    when the network between the IoT stages disconnects. The data persistence mechanism
    improves communication between the different IoT stages, considering typical limitations
    of mist and fog nodes. The data persistence mechanism regularly performs health
    checks in network connections to avoid data losses between IoT stages. Simultaneously,
    mist and fog nodes store the data locally because they send the data later when
    the link returns, after a connection failure event. The IoT nodes have constrained
    memory resources, so deploying together the data persistence mechanism and the
    data filter mechanism (subsection B.1) reduces the amount of data transmitted.
    This persistence mechanism may cause inconveniences for long disconnections without
    the filtering mechanism, such as mist memory overflow and long data transmission
    delays. 2) Data Prediction Data prediction is a mechanism that maintains data
    flow persistence when the data from a previous stage does not reach the destination
    stage. One of the reasons for data loss is the run out of the battery of the sensors
    or network disconnections. Without the complete time series, the system makes
    incorrect decisions. Data prediction using machine learning algorithms can mitigate
    the data time series gaps and provide more reliable decisions. However, supposing
    that the system receives the lost data at the future moment, the system needs
    to replace the original data with the data created by prediction algorithms. In
    other words, it needs to compose new historical data. 3) Storage Manager Billions
    of sensors can periodically collect and transmit data. The mist/fog stages are
    responsible for storing this massive amount of data, but these nodes have limited
    memory capacity. One way to solve this problem is by using data filtering (subsection
    B.1). The system needs to evaluate how long the mist/fog nodes should preserve
    old data, thus assessing the impact that deleting old data cause on the system’s
    trustworthiness. 4) Load Balance The load balancing mechanism prevents a mist/fog
    node from exhausting memory and processing resources. When a fog node reaches
    maximum hardware utilization in an IoT scenario, fog can alert mist nodes to redirecting
    part of future data to other fog nodes with time-driven sensors. In IoT scenarios
    with event-based sensors, an overloaded fog node can temporarily redirect data
    to another fog node. 5) Redundancy Redundancy is a way to ensure system continuity
    in the event of IoT node failures. Through redundancy, the system may find a new
    data path through other mist or fog nodes. A redundancy mechanism presumes that
    nodes always replicate data to other nodes whenever possible. Therefore, if a
    node loses connection or fails, the system can use another node to maintain the
    data flow. B. Data Fusion View This design view is responsible for implementing
    data filtering mechanisms in the mist and fog stages. It is also responsible for
    verifying and selecting data models used to make decisions. 1) Data Filtering
    Data reduction (filtering) mechanisms optimize the data flow between mist, fog,
    and cloud [22], [144]–[148]. However, data filtering must deal with mist and fog
    resource constraints regarding the processing and storage capacity for a smart
    service (like smart farming) or with different smart applications of this service
    (like smart irrigation, smart water management, or smart crop growth monitoring).
    Data filters are particularly relevant at the mist and fog stages, especially
    in long disconnections, given the need to store data temporarily until the connection
    returns. Filtered data occupies less memory space, thus avoiding memory overflow.
    Also, data can be transmitted faster when the connection returns, minimizing latency.
    Filtering mechanisms can achieve significant data reduction while dealing with
    memory and latency constraints. In general terms, IoT data transmitted in short
    intervals can contain identical or very close values and classified through a
    data fusion model. This approach divides the data filtering mechanisms into two
    main methods: (i) the data fusion filtering method (by data sampling or classification
    [148]) and (ii) the data compression filtering method: Data fusion filtering method:
    fusion-based data filtering can adopt different techniques, considering smart
    applications and the computational capacity of IoT stages. The mist node has not
    the same computational power as the fog node. In other words, different stages
    need to apply different data fusion techniques for various applications. Therefore,
    it is necessary to evaluate the fusion filtering techniques concerning the constraints
    of each IoT stage. Data fusion can reduce the amount of data stored by statistical
    sampling or by data classification techniques. However, supposing that the sampling
    or classification techniques are not precise or accurate, the filtered data may
    lose details. Consequently, the system can make worse decisions. Data compression
    filtering method: allows the compression of data content and reduces data to a
    smaller size, thus lowering the resource requirements for transmission and storage.
    The data compression advantage is maintaining its details when uncompressed because
    it restores the original content. However, uncompressing generates computational
    costs because data always returns to the original size, demanding more resources
    from that particular IoT stage. 2) Quality of Context (QOC) in Data Fusion Filtering
    The consequence of fusion-based filtering is data reduction, which requires the
    data quality to be maintained. Therefore, one needs to understand how much reduction
    can be performed without jeopardizing future analysis in a given context. Ensuring
    the quality of the context in data fusion means refraining from excessively filtering.
    Therefore, IoT system designers can use a mechanism to verify the filtered data’s
    quality based on the application context and decision models. 3) Analytic Models
    An IoT system needs to perform data gathering, monitoring, and analysis to extract
    information from a given context. Thus, based on environmental conditions or circumstances
    (context), the system makes decisions based on application rules (decision data
    models) for each specific smart application [54], [130], [149]. IoT systems can
    analyze data from individual IoT smart services (as smart farming) and store information
    from sensors of different smart applications (like smart irrigation, smart water
    management, or smart crop growth monitoring, for example). Thus, the system can
    analyze data from more than one smart application to enhance the decisions. As
    the decision accuracy is directly related to the data model, this mechanism needs
    to automatically select a decision model according to the specific smart application.
    C. Data Trust View The data trust view provides a data path without data syntactic
    and semantic integrity losses with meaningful information. This view deals with
    the features of data value, data veracity, entity veracity, data order, and data
    periodicity. 1) Data Value According to the smart application, the data value
    presumes that sensors must gather the necessary and relevant information for the
    IoT system. The lack of data or unnecessary excess of data can negatively impact
    future decisions. Therefore, the data value mechanism is responsible for checking
    the essential data to the IoT system based on the application and the data decision
    model. For example, in a smart farming service, the data value mechanism works
    as follows: a sensor collects soil moisture measures from three different depths
    in a field. Supposing that the crop is in an early growth stage, the plant root
    size only reaches the first depth. Therefore, the IoT system can safely discard
    soil moisture measurements from deeper depths because they do not convey meaningful
    information. 2) Data Veracity The data veracity mechanism must verify and discard
    outliers in a data set for a given context. It also perceives manipulated, corrupted,
    and fabricated data targeted by attacks or interference. 3) Entity Veracity The
    entity veracity is an extension of the data veracity concept to verify whether
    an entity, like a sensor or mist node, is transmitting unreliable data to fog.
    The veracity mechanism is responsible for identifies untrusted entities using
    a trust score. IoT designers can use algorithms to obtain this score [41], [51].
    They can form the entity trust score by identifying the number of untrusted packets
    and their origin entity. An untrusted entity transmits untrustworthy data caused
    by malicious attacks or internal hardware/software failures. Therefore, the IoT
    system needs to discard received data from that entity to ensure the data trustworthiness.
    4) Periodicity Data gathering frequency directly impacts the network traffic between
    the IoT stages and the accuracy of system decisions. The shorter the gathering
    interval, the greater the number of collected data and perceived details. Some
    IoT systems have time-driven sensors gathering data by a fixed time interval.
    It is essential to find the ideal time interval for data gathering to obtain relevant
    decisions according to the smart application [134]. 5) Data Ordering After a network
    disconnection between the fog and the cloud, the fog nodes can send past and present
    data not ordered. Because of it, the IoT system needs to put data in order. An
    IoT application can analyze a data time series to make a decision. Sometimes the
    data order matters to guarantee trustworthy choices. Therefore, maintaining the
    chronological data order impacts the IoT system data trustworthiness. D. Data
    Processing View A fog-based IoT system needs to execute instructions and handle
    the massive data transmission in batch, in real-time, or near real-time speed.
    The lambda architecture addresses the data volume and processing in real-time
    and batch [150]. However, this architecture works for high-performance systems.
    The IoT system designers can reuse concepts from this architecture and apply them
    to fog computing standards. 1) Data Volume A massive data volume requires an indispensable
    concern with the system’s scalability. The IoT system must calculate and evaluate
    how much data each node can store and analyze, considering its hardware resource
    constraints. A node that reaches its hardware limits may use a load balancing
    mechanism to maintain the data flow under normal operating circumstances. 2) Data
    Transmission Velocity IoT latency-sensitive systems require real-time decisions,
    so mist/fog needs to analyze data in real-time. Data transfer delays may cause
    unexpected or delayed decisions. Consequently, the transmission velocity impacts
    data trustworthiness. Developers of a mist-fog-based IoT system need to design
    the IoT stages considering the communication protocols, the data flow volume,
    and hardware constraints used for each mist/fog node to increase the data transfer
    velocity. 3) Data Processing Velocity The IoT system developers need to consider
    batch, near real-time, and real-time data processing techniques for different
    smart applications to ensure desirable speed performance. 4) Auto Power On/Off
    The scope of the data processing view also deals with the execution of data gathering
    by sensors. The auto power-off mechanism works for IoT systems based on time-driven
    sensors (i.e., not event-driven sensors). This mechanism turns sensors off to
    consume less energy. It only turns the sensors on again during the next data gathering
    period. This mechanism is feasible in many fog-based IoT systems, such as in the
    SWAMP project scenario [6], that sensors gather data periodically in 10-minute
    intervals. However, supposing that the gathering time interval is too short, IoT
    designers need to conduct a performance evaluation to verify the impact of energy
    consumption before deploying it. E. Data Heterogeneity View The heterogeneity
    view has mechanisms that deal with different communication protocols, data types,
    and data formats for various smart applications. 1) Device Technology In a scenario
    with billions of sensors from different hardware and software vendors, it is expected
    that the sensors use other measurement units and scales for the same type of data.
    For example, temperature sensors may gather data in various scales such as Celsius,
    Fahrenheit, or Kelvin. Therefore, this mechanism proposes to homogenize different
    data scales. 2) Communication Technology Homogeneity There are several communication
    protocols, and each one better meets the demands of specific environments. Supposing
    that a fog node receives packets from different protocols, such as LoRa, Sigfox,
    and Zigbee, the fog node needs to understand the protocol formats and extract
    data from packet payloads. The communication technology homogeneity mechanism
    interprets message patterns for different protocols. This mechanism can also convert
    several protocol messages into only one type of protocol message format. 3) Data
    Type The IoT system deals with different data types to make a decision. Smart
    healthcare data from a hospital, for example, may contain text, audio, video,
    and image. IoT system designers need to consider all data types, integrating it
    with the scale conversion mechanism, whether this mechanism did not previously
    deploy in the thing stage. 4) Data Format In the IoT stages, it is necessary to
    deal with different data types and formats. For example, in smart city applications,
    images may have other formats such as JPEG, PNG, or BMP. Data values may also
    have different formats such as binary, octal, hexadecimal, or decimal. This mechanism
    needs to use a well-known technique to homogenize the data formats into just one,
    enabling the IoT stages to analyze it. 5) Data Application Integration A fog-based
    IoT system handles many smart applications that belong to the same smart service.
    A smart farming service, for example, can support different smart applications,
    such as precision irrigation, crop stock management, or pest control. Considering
    that data gathering and decisions for different smart applications influence the
    whole system environment, this mechanism needs to combine data between different
    smart applications of the same smart service. Additionally, it needs to adequately
    analyze data by selecting and merging different data analytics models. 6) Integration
    of Smart Everything A complex and robust smart city environment includes smart
    homes, smart healthcare, and smart mobility. In this case, the system needs to
    manage and integrate different smart services to interconnect the entire system.
    Therefore, we suggest a mechanism that allows the system to make decisions based
    on integrated data analysis using the data knowledge of all IoT smart services.
    In a hypothetical smart city system, an IoT home service detects a home accident.
    The home service transmits this information to a smart healthcare service that
    requests a smart mobility service to check the city’s best route and send an ambulance.
    Therefore, in this case, the heterogeneity view is responsible for integrating
    all system services by a mechanism called the integration of smart everything.
    Section VII.D describes the proposal for the operation of this mechanism. F. Data
    Security View Security is essential for maintaining data trustworthiness in an
    IoT system. A fog-based IoT system uses data encrypting for every IoT stage to
    ensure data confidentiality and integrity. There are various data encryption and
    decryption algorithms that demand specific execution time and computational resources.
    The decision of the security policy needs to consider hardware constraints inherent
    to each IoT stage. SECTION VII. Framework Data Flow In Section VI, we presented
    the TW-IoT framework, according to design views of data resilience, data security,
    data heterogeneity, data trust, data processing, and data fusion. The TW-IoT provides
    methods and mechanisms that satisfy data trustworthiness requirements, ensuring
    data flow continuity for mist and fog-based IoT systems. In this Section, we exemplify
    the TW-IoT framework data flow for our IoT stages. Our framework allows developers
    to choose the mechanisms to compose the data flow for each IoT stage. A. Thing
    Data Flow We designed a data flow for a microcontroller with sensors and actuators
    in the thing stage (Fig. 4). For the sensor’s data flow, a developer chooses to
    combine the framework mechanisms differently, using optional auto power on/off
    and data conversion mechanisms. In contrast, the packet encryption mechanism is
    obligatory for this data flow. Regarding actuators, the microcontroller receives
    a packet(s) and only needs to decrypt the packet payload to execute the system
    decision. FIGURE 4. Thing data flow. Show All The thing stage can use mechanisms
    to turn the radio on/off, convert the scale value, and calibrate the collected
    data. The auto power on/off mechanisms save the device battery, and calibration
    is responsible for converting the collected data in meaningful information into
    the same scale values. The framework also allows data encryption deployment to
    encapsulate data into packets and transmit them to the mist. Depending on the
    data transmission technology, the packets are in LoRa, Sigfox, or Zigbee format.
    B. Mist Data Flow The mist stage uses mechanisms to deal with communication technology
    heterogeneity, data flow persistence, data encryption and decryption, data homogeneity,
    data value and veracity, data analytics, and data filtering techniques (Fig. 5).
    FIGURE 5. Mist data flow. Show All The packets that arrive in the mist have different
    message formats, such as LoRa, Sigfox, or Zigbee format. Then, in the mist stage,
    the communication technology homogeneity mechanism is responsible for identifying
    the packet format and convert it into a single format. After handling packet heterogeneity,
    mist uses the data flow persistence mechanism to store data, avoiding data loss
    even if the fog stage is disconnected. A mist node can send packets to other mist
    nodes to maintain the data redundancy, avoiding data loss if a mist node fails.
    Supposing the mist hardware resources (CPU and memory) are close to reaching the
    capacity limit, mist redirects part of the stored packets to another mist node.
    When the IoT system is in normal operating conditions with an active connection
    between mist and fog, the mist node sends packets to fog by the data flow (A).
    When the fog connection is not active, the mist can choose two other paths, the
    first path (B) can compress data, and the second path (C) can analyze and filter
    data. Being the choice of data flows (B or C) a design option. Assuming the data
    flow follows path B (Fig. 5), the mist filter mechanism compresses the packet
    content, generating a file as output. Then, the mist awaits the fog connection
    returns to sends the file. In this case, the mist does not need to decrypt the
    data, making the data flow more secure against attacks. In case of interception,
    the file only has compressed encrypted packets. However, when a fog node receives
    this file, it needs to uncompressing the data, causing an additional computational
    cost to the fog stage. Assuming the data flow follows path C, the IoT system chooses
    to follow through the data filter, the data analysis, or both mechanisms but first
    following by packet payload decryption. Whether the system is handling LoRa packets,
    it uses LoRaWAN Network Server as ChirpStack [151] to decrypt each packet payload.
    After decryption, the IoT system converts data according to the data type and
    format. It checks the data’s veracity and value and can follow two paths: data
    analysis or data filtering. In data analysis, mist uses an analytic data model
    to make a decision. Data filtering occurs through two approaches (i) data compression
    and (ii) data fusion. Additionally, data fusion can use redundant data filtering
    based on statistical sampling or data characteristics. The choice of data filtering
    approaches and techniques is a design option. In our data path, the mist analyzes
    the data and sends decisions to actuators until the fog connection returns. The
    mist also filters data during a disconnection. If the connection returns, the
    system encrypts the filtered data and sends it to fog. Consequently, when new
    packets arrive at the mist, the older packets do not delay the mist node to send
    new packets to fog. Then, the system data flow continues to operate uninterruptedly.
    C. Fog Data Flow The mist (Fig. 5) sends filtered data or raw data to fog (Fig.
    6). Supposing the fog receives raw data from the mist. In that case, fog needs
    to handle this raw data by mechanisms like data homogeneity, data value, and data
    veracity. Consequently, the fog stage must have the same mechanisms deployed in
    the mist stage. FIGURE 6. Fog data flow. Show All The mist stage transfers packets
    with raw data or filtered data to the fog stage. When the packets contain raw
    data, the fog needs to filter and handle data similarly to the mist, but with
    some differences, passing by more mechanisms through the data path. In the data
    flow persistence mechanism, a fog node sends the data to other fog nodes to deal
    with redundancy and load balancing. Also, the fog node checks its cloud connection
    and the cloud transmission delay. Supposing the IoT system tolerates the cloud
    data transfer delay and that the communication channel between fog and cloud is
    active, the fog node transmits the data directly to the cloud. However, this delay
    is not acceptable for many IoT systems. In various smart applications, the IoT
    system must analyze data in real-time. In these situations, the fog node needs
    to analyze and filter data instead of the cloud. Upon receiving data, the fog
    node decrypts the packet payload, which can follow alternative paths: (i) if a
    packet contains filtered data, the fog node process it to make a decision, but
    (ii) if fog receives raw data, the flow passes through the data homogeneity step,
    i.e., through value mechanism (Section VI.C.1) and veracity mechanism (Section
    VI.C.2), and later on through the entity veracity mechanism (Fig. 6). The entity
    veracity mechanism (Section VI.C.3) checks the entity ID, battery level, packet
    latency, outliers, and possible manipulated data to estimate if the packet comes
    from a trusted or untrusted entity. Assuming the fog node detects an untrusted
    packet, the fog node discards the packet. It can also discard all packets from
    that entity in the future. However, if the entity is trusted, fog stores the data.
    After these steps, the fog node can use the data prediction mechanism to fill
    missing data in times series if necessary. The data flow takes two simultaneous
    paths in a row: (i) via data filtering, sending filtered data over the cloud,
    and (ii) via data analysis mechanism, where fog chooses an analytic model to analyze
    data and make decisions. Finally, the fog sends decisions to actuators. D. Cloud
    Data Flow Cloud (Fig. 7) decrypts the packet’s payload to verify whether the fog
    filtered the data. If data is not filtered, the cloud follows data homogeneity,
    value, veracity, and prediction steps. Also, the cloud selects application analytic
    models before the data analysis. After processing the data analysis mechanism,
    the cloud sends data and decisions to the user IoT application, the system actuators,
    and the integration of smart everything service (Fig. 7), responsible for transmitting
    relevant data and decisions between services in different smart services (Fig.
    8). FIGURE 7. Cloud data flow. Show All FIGURE 8. Cloud service integration data
    flow. Show All The cloud data flow includes an integration service for interconnecting
    different smart services, like a smart home, smart hospital (health care), and
    a smart mobility service (Fig. 8). In general, each service includes different
    smart applications. A smart farming service, for example, covers precision irrigation
    and pest control applications but not monitoring patient heartbeat, which is an
    application for smart hospital service. In Section VI.E.6, we mentioned the integration
    of the smart everything mechanism (Fig. 8). We discussed that a smart home service
    reports a domestic accident to a smart hospital service. Through a smart mobility
    service, the hospital verifies the best route for an ambulance to rescue the person
    who suffered the accident. This integration mechanism contains a module called
    Link Module (Fig. 8), which receives data from every smart service in the system
    and only sends part of it to virtual sensors. It means that a smart service only
    receives data related to its smart applications through the virtual sensor. The
    integration flow works in 3 steps: (i) cloud sends each smart service’s data (and
    decisions) in the IoT system to the Link Module, (ii) this module sends only relevant
    data for each virtual sensor, and (iii) the virtual sensors send data to the smart
    services. Therefore, each smart service receives data from other smart services
    through a virtual sensor (Fig. 8). Virtual sensors may send non-relevant data
    to a smart service. However, the TW-IoT framework can use the data value step
    to verify the data relevance for a specific smart service (Fig. 3 and Fig. 7).
    SECTION VIII. Trade-Offs Between Mist and Fog Data Flow The TW-IoT framework mechanisms
    provide data trustworthiness in a mist-fog-based IoT system. Still, the IoT designers
    need to consider some trade-offs through the data flow in different IoT stages.
    The mist and fog data flow needs to consider, for example, computing costs for
    mechanisms related to data security and data filtering techniques. A. Data Security
    and Data Filtering in Mist Stage Supposing the connection between mist and fog
    fails, the mist can follow two distinct flows (B or C): decrypt the packet payload
    and compress the encrypted packet content (Fig. 5). Filtering by data fusion requires
    decrypting data in the mist. However, decryption makes data more susceptible to
    malicious attackers. An attacker can capture the decrypted data from the mist
    or discover the method used to encrypt data again in the mist. However, by using
    data filtering by data compression, the mist keeps the data encrypted without
    additional security service and does not expose data to external attackers. It
    has a cost for unpacking data in the next IoT stage and possibly a cost for data
    traffic latency between mist and fog. B. Advantages and Disadvantages of Data
    Filtering Mechanisms There are advantages and disadvantages to different data
    filtering mechanisms. The mist and fog filtering methods are (i) fusion filtering
    by statistical sampling, which deals with redundant data, (ii) fusion filtering
    by data classification, and (iii) filtering by data compression. The filtering
    redundant data method reduces the data to a sample of data by statistical sampling.
    It means that IoT stages can reduce the amount of data, storage costs, and massive
    data traffic. However, it may cause data details loss and induces the IoT system
    to non-accurate decisions. Filtering by data classification can categorize data
    by machine learning techniques and only transmits each category number to the
    next IoT stage [148]. It ensures a more significant reduction in the amount of
    data than the filtering redundant data method. The categories found by the classification
    should be strictly faithful to the analytic data model for the analysis. This
    method may lead to wrong decisions. Through this filtering, the loss of details
    is even more significant. In data compression filtering, the original data remains
    intact, preventing possible equivocate system decisions. However, there is a higher
    cost for storing data, a network delay cost by sending the compressed file, and
    a computational cost to uncompressing the data in the next IoT stage. C. Data
    Analysis and CPU Usage in the Mist Stage Mist devices have low computational power,
    but data analysis demands high CPU resources depending on the algorithm or data
    model. Performing data analysis in the mist stage is a design option. However,
    a long disconnection between the mist and fog stages can cause the system to wait
    a long time without analyzing and making decisions. It compromises the system’s
    trustworthiness. It is essential to emphasize that data analysis in the mist must
    happen during a network disconnection, but using light algorithms for demanding
    less processing resources. However, using light algorithms for data analysis may
    generate untrusted decisions. The IoT designer must balance the data analysis
    complexity power and the CPU usage, maintaining the decisions’ accuracy. D. Data
    Prediction and CPU Usage in Fog Stage The data prediction techniques generally
    use regression algorithms that demand high CPU usage. Therefore, the choice of
    prediction technique should consider the fog nodes’ CPU processing power. E. Storage
    Time in IoT Stages The IoT system deals with continuous and uninterrupted data
    flow from billions of sensors. However, the mist and fog nodes have constrained
    memory capacity. The mist and fog nodes need to keep the data (received by sensors)
    because they need to analyze data and maintain the data flow persistence. The
    TW-IoT framework allows the IoT stages to store 3 data categories: raw data, refined
    data, and filtered data. According to the application, the IoT designers need
    to decide the memory usage percentage for each of these data categories and how
    long they remain stored in memory. They need to resolve it without compromising
    the data trustworthiness and future decisions. SECTION IX. Challenges This section
    presents some challenges of data trustworthiness in a fog-based IoT system, identified
    throughout this paper. A. Connection Redundancy The IoT may use different communication
    technologies with diverse packet formats and specificities. Some systems deploy
    IoT nodes with two or more communication protocols [92]. A monitoring mechanism
    can prevent disconnections and low network performance by automatically switching
    the IoT node connection technology. In this way, each IoT node receives and transmits
    data over more than one communication protocol. A node can select a communication
    protocol with better network performance to transfer data. It is a challenge to
    deploy, in a real scenario, billions of sensors with connection redundancy mechanisms
    without increase the hardware costs. B. Data Filter by Data Knowledge Fog data
    reduction (filtering) aims to reduce the amount of data stored and transmitted
    by the mist and fog stages. These techniques can discard redundant data or data
    with no relevant variations [48], [147]. However, the fog needs to consider the
    analytic data model and the smart application for data filtering because the filtered
    data will represent the original data and generate trusted decisions [147]. A
    relevant challenge is to create a mechanism that precisely and accurately filters
    data without previously knowing the analytic data model or application context.
    In other words, the challenge is to design a context-independent data filtering
    mechanism only based on the data. C. Agile Fault-Recovery A fog-based latency-sensitive
    IoT system needs to execute fault recovery near real-time since the fog must provide
    data analysis in real-time. The velocity of fault recovery may impact system availability
    (Equation 1). It is challenging to offer mechanisms that recover the system of
    failures in real-time. Agility in fault recovery is a challenge. D. Automatic
    Registration of Devices Secure IoT platforms require registering devices (including
    sensors) on the mist/fog servers. It allows the IoT system to recognize devices
    as trust devices and enhance the system trustworthiness. In a real scenario, the
    IoT system has to register billions of devices. In an ideal scenario, a developer
    simply needs to connect new sensors to the network, and the system automatically
    recognizes them. However, new devices without a previous system notification may
    bring security risks since they can attack the IoT system. Therefore, it is challenging
    to create secure mechanisms that automatically register new devices to the fog
    node. E. Real-Time Analysis and Mist/Fog Resource Constrains Ensuring data trustworthiness
    in a fog-based IoT system means deploying mist and fog nodes responsible for mechanisms
    that support heterogeneity, resilience, data trust, data filtering, security,
    and data analysis for billions of sensors. However, these features in the mist/fog
    nodes need to deal with constrained memory capacity and CPU power. It is challenging
    to find a balance between these mechanisms’ computational costs and the mist/fog
    resource constraints. Another challenge is maintaining these mechanisms without
    changing the data analysis velocity, especially real-time data analysis. SECTION
    X. Conclusion and Future Work Trustworthiness (dependability) handles requirements
    and characteristics that provide system availability, reliability, scalability,
    maintainability, heterogeneity, data quality, hardware resources, security, response
    time agility, and network resilience to computer systems. This survey presents
    state-of-the-art concepts about trustworthiness in fog-based IoT systems, summarizing
    and discussing literature. We identified data trustworthiness gaps in dealing
    with the fog computing data flow. For that reason, we proposed the TW-IoT framework
    to ensure data trustworthiness for mist-fog-based IoT systems. The TW-IoT framework
    deploys mechanisms for a mist-fog-based IoT system to ensure trusted decisions
    and keep the data flow’s uninterrupted continuity through all IoT system stages.
    Also, we identify data trustworthiness trade-offs and challenges for fog-based
    IoT systems. As future work, we will evaluate the impact of each design view and
    mechanism of the TW-IoT framework for a real mist-fog-based IoT system, using
    pilots of the SWAMP project [6]. We intend to evaluate CPU and RAM usage for each
    IoT stage using our framework mechanisms. We aim to assess the data filtering
    mechanism combined with the data resilience view through the packet loss rate
    and network delay between IoT stages (thing, mist, fog, and cloud) in situations
    of network availability and unavailability. We plan to assess devices’ energy
    consumption and end-to-end network delay, varying distinct data formats for various
    packet technologies types (using synthetic and real data) to evaluate the data
    veracity, value, and homogeneity mechanisms. We will also analyze the data processing
    view changing the communication channel frequency, channel error, number of sensors,
    and the packet transmission rate. Finally, we will evaluate the security view
    measuring energy, processing, and memory usage of different security algorithms,
    combining them with mechanisms of data resilience, data trust, and heterogeneity

    \ and infrastructure-\nless wireless networks to monitor physical or environmental\
    \ conditions, such as \ntemperature, sound, vibration, pressure, motion or pollutants\
    \ and to cooperatively pass \ntheir data through the network to a main location\
    \ or sink where the data can be observed \nand analysed. A sink or base station\
    \ acts like an interface between users and the network. \nOne can retrieve required\
    \ information from the network by injecting queries and gathering \nresults from\
    \ the sink. Typically a wireless sensor network contains hundreds of thousands\
    \ \nof sensor nodes. The sensor nodes can communicate among themselves using radio\
    \ signals. \nA wireless sensor node is equipped with sensing and computing devices,\
    \ radio transceivers \nand power components. The individual nodes in a wireless\
    \ sensor network (WSN) are \ninherently resource constrained: they have limited\
    \ processing speed, storage capacity, and \ncommunication bandwidth. After the\
    \ sensor nodes are deployed, they are responsible for \nself-organizing an appropriate\
    \ network infrastructure often with multi-hop communication \nwith them. Then\
    \ the onboard sensors start collecting information of interest. Wireless sensor\
    \ \ndevices also respond to queries sent from a “control site” to perform specific\
    \ instructions or \nprovide sensing samples. The working mode of the sensor nodes\
    \ may be either continuous \nor event driven. Global Positioning System (GPS)\
    \ and local positioning algorithms can be \nused to obtain location and positioning\
    \ information. Wireless sensor devices can be \nequipped with actuators to “act”\
    \ upon certain conditions. These networks are sometimes \nmore specifically referred\
    \ as Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks as described in \n(Akkaya et al., 2005).\
    \ \nWireless sensor networks (WSNs) enable new applications and require non-conventional\
    \ \nparadigms for protocol design due to several constraints. Owing to the requirement\
    \ for low \ndevice complexity together with low energy consumption (i.e. long\
    \ network lifetime), a \nproper balance between communication and signal/data\
    \ processing capabilities must be \nfound. This motivates a huge effort in research\
    \ activities, standardization process, and \n \nWireless Sensor Networks – Technology\
    \ and Protocols \n4 \nindustrial investments on this field since the last decade\
    \ (Chiara et. al. 2009). At present \ntime, most of the research on WSNs has concentrated\
    \ on the design of energy- and \ncomputationally efficient algorithms and protocols,\
    \ and the application domain has been \nrestricted to simple data-oriented monitoring\
    \ and reporting applications (Labrador et. al. \n2009). The authors in (Chen et\
    \ al., 2011) propose a Cable Mode Transition (CMT) algorithm, \nwhich determines\
    \ the minimal number of active sensors to maintain K-coverage of a terrain \n\
    as well as K-connectivity of the network. Specifically, it allocates periods of\
    \ inactivity for \ncable sensors without affecting the coverage and connectivity\
    \ requirements of the network \nbased only on local information. In (Cheng et\
    \ al., 2011), a delay-aware data collection \nnetwork structure for wireless sensor\
    \ networks is proposed. The objective of the proposed \nnetwork structure is to\
    \ minimize delays in the data collection processes of wireless sensor \nnetworks\
    \ which extends the lifetime of the network. In (Matin et al., 2011), the authors\
    \ have \nconsidered relay nodes to mitigate the network geometric deficiencies\
    \ and used Particle \nSwarm Optimization (PSO) based algorithms to locate the\
    \ optimal sink location with respect \nto those relay nodes to overcome the lifetime\
    \ challenge. Energy efficient communication has \nalso been addressed in (Paul\
    \ et al., 2011; Fabbri et al. 2009). In (Paul et al., 2011), the authors \nproposed\
    \ a geometrical solution for locating the optimum sink placement for maximizing\
    \ \nthe network lifetime. Most of the time, the research on wireless sensor networks\
    \ have \nconsidered homogeneous sensor nodes. But nowadays researchers have focused\
    \ on \nheterogeneous sensor networks where the sensor nodes are unlike to each\
    \ other in terms of \ntheir energy. In (Han et al., 2010), the authors addresses\
    \ the problem of deploying relay \nnodes to provide fault tolerance with higher\
    \ network connectivity in heterogeneous wireless \nsensor networks, where sensor\
    \ nodes possess different transmission radii. New network \narchitectures with\
    \ heterogeneous devices and the recent advancement in this technology \neliminate\
    \ the current limitations and expand the spectrum of possible applications for\
    \ WSNs \nconsiderably and all these are changing very rapidly. \n \nFigure 1.\
    \ A typical Wireless Sensor Network \n2. Applications of wireless sensor network\
    \ \nWireless sensor networks have gained considerable popularity due to their\
    \ flexibility in \nsolving problems in different application domains and have\
    \ the potential to change our lives \n \nOverview of Wireless Sensor Network 5\
    \ \nin many different ways. WSNs have been successfully applied in various application\
    \ \ndomains (Akyildiz et al. 2002; Bharathidasan et al., 2001), (Yick et al.,\
    \ 2008; Boukerche, 2009), \n(Sohraby et al., 2007), and ( Chiara et al., 2009;Verdone\
    \ et al., 2008), such as: \nMilitary applications: Wireless sensor networks be\
    \ likely an integral part of military \ncommand, control, communications, computing,\
    \ intelligence, battlefield surveillance, \nreconnaissance and targeting systems.\
    \ \nArea monitoring: In area monitoring, the sensor nodes are deployed over a\
    \ region where \nsome phenomenon is to be monitored. When the sensors detect the\
    \ event being monitored \n(heat, pressure etc), the event is reported to one of\
    \ the base stations, which then takes \nappropriate action. \nTransportation:\
    \ Real-time traffic information is being collected by WSNs to later feed \ntransportation\
    \ models and alert drivers of congestion and traffic problems. \nHealth applications:\
    \ Some of the health applications for sensor networks are supporting \ninterfaces\
    \ for the disabled, integrated patient monitoring, diagnostics, and drug \nadministration\
    \ in hospitals, tele-monitoring of human physiological data, and tracking & \n\
    monitoring doctors or patients inside a hospital. \nEnvironmental sensing: The\
    \ term Environmental Sensor Networks has developed to cover \nmany applications\
    \ of WSNs to earth science research. This includes sensing volcanoes, \noceans,\
    \ glaciers, forests etc. Some other major areas are listed below: \n \nAir pollution\
    \ monitoring \n \nForest fires detection \n \nGreenhouse monitoring \n \nLandslide\
    \ detection \nStructural monitoring: Wireless sensors can be utilized to monitor\
    \ the movement within \nbuildings and infrastructure such as bridges, flyovers,\
    \ embankments, tunnels etc enabling \nEngineering practices to monitor assets\
    \ remotely with out the need for costly site visits. \nIndustrial monitoring:\
    \ Wireless sensor networks have been developed for machinery \ncondition-based\
    \ maintenance (CBM) as they offer significant cost savings and enable new \nfunctionalities.\
    \ In wired systems, the installation of enough sensors is often limited by the\
    \ \ncost of wiring. \nAgricultural sector: using a wireless network frees the\
    \ farmer from the maintenance of \nwiring in a difficult environment. Irrigation\
    \ automation enables more efficient water use \nand reduces waste. \n3. Design\
    \ issues of a wireless sensor network \nThere are a lot of challenges placed by\
    \ the deployment of sensor networks which are a \nsuperset of those found in wireless\
    \ ad hoc networks. Sensor nodes communicate over \nwireless, lossy lines with\
    \ no infrastructure. An additional challenge is related to the limited, \n \n\
    Wireless Sensor Networks – Technology and Protocols \n6 \nusually non-renewable\
    \ energy supply of the sensor nodes. In order to maximize the lifetime \nof the\
    \ network, the protocols need to be designed from the beginning with the objective\
    \ of \nefficient management of the energy resources (Akyildiz et al., 2002). Wireless\
    \ Sensor \nNetwork Design issues are mentioned in (Akkaya et al., 2005), (Akyildizet\
    \ al., 2002), \n(SensorSim; Tossim, Younis et al., 2004), (Pan et al., 2003) and\
    \ different possible platforms \nfor simulation and testing of routing protocols\
    \ for WSNs are discussed in ( NS-2, Zeng et al., \n1998, SensorSim, Tossiim ).\
    \ Let us now discuss the individual design issues in greater detail. \nFault Tolerance:\
    \ Sensor nodes are vulnerable and frequently deployed in dangerous \nenvironment.\
    \ Nodes can fail due to hardware problems or physical damage or by \nexhausting\
    \ their energy supply. We expect the node failures to be much higher than the\
    \ one \nnormally considered in wired or infrastructure-based wireless networks.\
    \ The protocols \ndeployed in a sensor network should be able to detect these\
    \ failures as soon as possible and \nbe robust enough to handle a relatively large\
    \ number of failures while maintaining the \noverall functionality of the network.\
    \ This is especially relevant to the routing protocol \ndesign, which has to ensure\
    \ that alternate paths are available for rerouting of the packets. \nDifferent\
    \ deployment environments pose different fault tolerance requirements.  \nScalability:\
    \ Sensor networks vary in scale from several nodes to potentially several hundred\
    \ \nthousand. In addition, the deployment density is also variable. For collecting\
    \ high-\nresolution data, the node density might reach the level where a node\
    \ has several thousand \nneighbours in their transmission range. The protocols\
    \ deployed in sensor networks need to \nbe scalable to these levels and be able\
    \ to maintain adequate performance.  \nProduction Costs: Because many deployment\
    \ models consider the sensor nodes to be \ndisposable devices, sensor networks\
    \ can compete with traditional information gathering \napproaches only if the\
    \ individual sensor nodes can be produced very cheaply. The target \nprice envisioned\
    \ for a sensor node should ideally be less than $1.  \nHardware Constraints: At\
    \ minimum, every sensor node needs to have a sensing unit, a \nprocessing unit,\
    \ a transmission unit, and a power supply. Optionally, the nodes may have \nseveral\
    \ built-in sensors or additional devices such as a localization system to enable\
    \ \nlocation-aware routing. However, every additional functionality comes with\
    \ additional cost \nand increases the power consumption and physical size of the\
    \ node. Thus, additional \nfunctionality needs to be always balanced against cost\
    \ and low-power requirements. \nSensor Network Topology: Although WSNs have evolved\
    \ in many aspects, they continue to \nbe networks with constrained resources in\
    \ terms of energy, computing power, memory, and \ncommunications capabilities.\
    \ Of these constraints, energy consumption is of paramount \nimportance, which\
    \ is demonstrated by the large number of algorithms, techniques, and \nprotocols\
    \ that have been developed to save energy, and thereby extend the lifetime of\
    \ the \nnetwork. Topology Maintenance is one of the most important issues researched\
    \ to reduce \nenergy consumption in wireless sensor networks. \nTransmission Media:\
    \ The communication between the nodes is normally implemented \nusing radio communication\
    \ over the popular ISM bands. However, some sensor networks \n \nOverview of Wireless\
    \ Sensor Network 7 \nuse optical or infrared communication, with the latter having\
    \ the advantage of being robust \nand virtually interference free. \nPower Consumption:\
    \ As we have already seen, many of the challenges of sensor networks \nrevolve\
    \ around the limited power resources. The size of the nodes limits the size of\
    \ the \nbattery. The software and hardware design needs to carefully consider\
    \ the issues of efficient \nenergy use. For instance, data compression might reduce\
    \ the amount of energy used for \nradio transmission, but uses additional energy\
    \ for computation and/or filtering. The energy \npolicy also depends on the application;\
    \ in some applications, it might be acceptable to turn \noff a subset of nodes\
    \ in order to conserve energy while other applications require all nodes \noperating\
    \ simultaneously. \n4. Structure of a wireless sensor network \nStructure of a\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network includes different topologies for radio \ncommunications\
    \ networks. A short discussion of the network topologies that apply to \nwireless\
    \ sensor networks are outlined below: \n4.1. Star network (single point-to-multipoint)\
    \ (Wilson, 2005) \nA star network is a communications topology where a single\
    \ base station can send and/or \nreceive a message to a number of remote nodes.\
    \ The remote nodes are not permitted to send \nmessages to each other. The advantage\
    \ of this type of network for wireless sensor networks \nincludes simplicity,\
    \ ability to keep the remote node’s power consumption to a minimum. It \nalso\
    \ allows low latency communications between the remote node and the base station.\
    \ The \ndisadvantage of such a network is that the base station must be within\
    \ radio transmission \nrange of all the individual nodes and is not as robust\
    \ as other networks due to its \ndependency on a single node to manage the network.\
    \ \n \nFigure 2. A Star network topology \n \nWireless Sensor Networks – Technology\
    \ and Protocols \n8 \n4.2. Mesh network (Wilson, 2005) \nA mesh network allows\
    \ transmitting data to one node to other node in the network that is \nwithin\
    \ its radio transmission range. This allows for what is known as multi-hop \n\
    communications, that is, if a node wants to send a message to another node that\
    \ is out of \nradio communications range, it can use an intermediate node to forward\
    \ the message to the \ndesired node. This network topology has the advantage of\
    \ redundancy and scalability. If an \nindividual node fails, a remote node still\
    \ can communicate to any other node in its range, \nwhich in turn, can forward\
    \ the message to the desired location. In addition, the range of the \nnetwork\
    \ is not necessarily limited by the range in between single nodes; it can simply\
    \ be \nextended by adding more nodes to the system. The disadvantage of this type\
    \ of network is \nin power consumption for the nodes that implement the multi-hop\
    \ communications are \ngenerally higher than for the nodes that don’t have this\
    \ capability, often limiting the battery \nlife. Additionally, as the number of\
    \ communication hops to a destination increases, the time \nto deliver the message\
    \ also increases, especially if low power operation of the nodes is a \nrequirement.\
    \ \n \nFigure 3. A Mesh network topology \n4.3. Hybrid star – Mesh network (Wilson,\
    \ 2005) \nA hybrid between the star and mesh network provides a robust and versatile\
    \ \ncommunications network, while maintaining the ability to keep the wireless\
    \ sensor nodes \npower consumption to a minimum. In this network topology, the\
    \ sensor nodes with lowest \npower are not enabled with the ability to forward\
    \ messages. This allows for minimal power \nconsumption to be maintained. However,\
    \ other nodes on the network are enabled with \nmulti-hop capability, allowing\
    \ them to forward messages from the low power nodes to \nother nodes on the network.\
    \ Generally, the nodes with the multi-hop capability are higher \npower, and if\
    \ possible, are often plugged into the electrical mains line. This is the topology\
    \ \nimplemented by the up and coming mesh networking standard known as ZigBee.\
    \ \n \nOverview of Wireless Sensor Network 9 \n \nFigure 4. A Hybrid Star – Mesh\
    \ network topology \n5. Structure of a wireless sensor node \nA sensor node is\
    \ made up of four basic components such as sensing unit, processing unit, \ntransceiver\
    \ unit and a power unit which is shown in Fig. 5. It also has application dependent\
    \ \nadditional components such as a location finding system, a power generator\
    \ and a \nmobilizer. Sensing units are usually composed of two subunits: sensors\
    \ and analogue to \ndigital converters (ADCs) (Akyildiz et al., 2002). The analogue\
    \ signals produced by the \nsensors are converted to digital signals by the ADC,\
    \ and then fed into the processing unit. \nThe processing unit is generally associated\
    \ with a small storage unit and it can manage \nthe procedures that make the sensor\
    \ node collaborate with the other nodes to carry out \nthe assigned sensing tasks.\
    \ A transceiver unit connects the node to the network. One of \nthe most important\
    \ components of a sensor node is the power unit. Power units can be \nsupported\
    \ by a power scavenging unit such as solar cells. The other subunits, of the node\
    \ \nare application dependent. \nA functional block diagram of a versatile wireless\
    \ sensing node is provided in Fig. 6. \nModular design approach provides a flexible\
    \ and versatile platform to address the needs of \na wide variety of applications.\
    \ For example, depending on the sensors to be deployed, the \nsignal conditioning\
    \ block can be re-programmed or replaced. This allows for a wide variety \n \n\
    Wireless Sensor Networks – Technology and Protocols \n10 \nof different sensors\
    \ to be used with the wireless sensing node. Similarly, the radio link may \n\
    be swapped out as required for a given applications’ wireless range requirement\
    \ and the \nneed for bidirectional communications. \n \nFigure 5. The components\
    \ of a sensor node \n \nFigure 6. Functional block diagram of a sensor node \n\
    Using flash memory, the remote nodes acquire data on command from a base station,\
    \ or by \nan event sensed by one or more inputs to the node. Moreover, the embedded\
    \ firmware can \nbe upgraded through the wireless network in the field. \nThe\
    \ microprocessor has a number of functions including: \n \nOverview of Wireless\
    \ Sensor Network 11 \n \nManaging data collection from the sensors \n \nperforming\
    \ power management functions \n \ninterfacing the sensor data to the physical\
    \ radio layer \n \nmanaging the radio network protocol \nA key aspect of any\
    \ wireless sensing node is to minimize the power consumed by the \nsystem. Usually,\
    \ the radio subsystem requires the largest amount of power. Therefore, data \n\
    is sent over the radio network only when it is required. An algorithm is to be\
    \ loaded into the \nnode to determine when to send data based on the sensed event.\
    \ Furthermore, it is \nimportant to minimize the power consumed by the sensor\
    \ itself. Therefore, the hardware \nshould be designed to allow the microprocessor\
    \ to judiciously control power to the radio, \nsensor, and sensor signal conditioner\
    \ (Akyildiz et al., 2002). \n6. Communication structure of a wireless sensor network\
    \ \nThe sensor nodes are usually scattered in a sensor field as shown in Fig.\
    \ 1. Each of these \nscattered sensor nodes has the capabilities to collect data\
    \ and route data back to the sink and \nthe end users. Data are routed back to\
    \ the end user by a multi-hop infrastructure-less \narchitecture through the sink\
    \ as shown in Fig. 1. The sink may communicate with the task \nmanager node via\
    \ Internet or Satellite.  \n \nFigure 7. Wireless Sensor Network protocol stack\
    \ \nThe protocol stack used by the sink and the sensor nodes is given in Fig.\
    \ 7. This protocol \nstack combines power and routing awareness, integrates data\
    \ with networking protocols, \ncommunicates power efficiently through the wireless\
    \ medium and promotes cooperative \nefforts of sensor nodes. The protocol stack\
    \ consists of the application layer, transport layer, \n \nWireless Sensor Networks\
    \ – Technology and Protocols \n12 \nnetwork layer, data link layer, physical layer,\
    \ power management plane, mobility \nmanagement plane, and task management plane\
    \ (Akyildiz et al., 2002). Different types of \napplication software can be built\
    \ and used on the application layer depending on the \nsensing tasks. This layer\
    \ makes hardware and software of the lowest layer transparent to the \nend-user.\
    \ The transport layer helps to maintain the flow of data if the sensor networks\
    \ \napplication requires it. The network layer takes care of routing the data\
    \ supplied by the \ntransport layer, specific multi-hop wireless routing protocols\
    \ between sensor nodes and \nsink. The data link layer is responsible for multiplexing\
    \ of data streams, frame detection, \nMedia Access Control (MAC) and error control.\
    \ Since the environment is noisy and sensor \nnodes can be mobile, the MAC protocol\
    \ must be power aware and able to minimize collision \nwith neighbours’ broadcast.\
    \ The physical layer addresses the needs of a simple but robust \nmodulation,\
    \ frequency selection, data encryption, transmission and receiving techniques.\
    \ \nIn addition, the power, mobility, and task management planes monitor the power,\
    \ \nmovement, and task distribution among the sensor nodes. These planes help\
    \ the sensor \nnodes coordinate the sensing task and lower the overall energy\
    \ consumption. \n7. Energy consumption issues in wireless sensor network \nEnergy\
    \ consumption is the most important factor to determine the life of a sensor network\
    \ \nbecause usually sensor nodes are driven by battery. Sometimes energy optimization\
    \ is more \ncomplicated in sensor networks because it involved not only reduction\
    \ of energy \nconsumption but also prolonging the life of the network as much\
    \ as possible. The \noptimization can be done by having energy awareness in every\
    \ aspect of design and \noperation. This ensures that energy awareness is also\
    \ incorporated into groups of \ncommunicating sensor nodes and the entire network\
    \ and not only in the individual nodes \n(Bharathidasan et al. 2001). \nA sensor\
    \ node usually consists of four sub-systems (Bharathidasan et al. 2001): \n \n\
    a computing subsystem : It consists of a microprocessor(microcontroller unit,\
    \ MCU) \nwhich is responsible for the control of the sensors and implementation\
    \ of \ncommunication protocols. MCUs usually operate under various modes for power\
    \ \nmanagement purposes. As these operating modes involves consumption of power,\
    \ the \nenergy consumption levels of the various modes should be considered while\
    \ looking at \nthe battery lifetime of each node. \n \na communication subsystem:\
    \ It consists of a short range radio which communicate with \nneighboring nodes\
    \ and the outside world. Radios can operate under the different \nmodes. It is\
    \ important to completely shut down the radio rather than putting it in the \n\
    Idle mode when it is not transmitting or receiving for saving power. \n \na sensing\
    \ subsystem : It consists of a group of sensors and actuators and link the node\
    \ \nto the outside world. Energy consumption can be reduced by using low power\
    \ \ncomponents and saving power at the cost of performance which is not required.\
    \ \n \nOverview of Wireless Sensor Network 13 \n \na power supply subsystem :\
    \ It consists of a battery which supplies power to the node. It \nshould be seen\
    \ that the amount of power drawn from a battery is checked because if \nhigh current\
    \ is drawn from a battery for a long time, the battery will die faster even \n\
    though it could have gone on for a longer time. Usually the rated current capacity\
    \ of a \nbattery being used for a sensor node is less than the minimum energy\
    \ consumption. \nThe lifetime of a battery can be increased by reducing the current\
    \ drastically or even \nturning it off often. \nTo minimize the overall energy\
    \ consumption of the sensor network, different types of \nprotocols and algorithms\
    \ have been studied so far all over the world. The lifetime of a \nsensor network\
    \ can be increased significantly if the operating system, the application layer\
    \ \nand the network protocols are designed to be energy aware. These protocols\
    \ and algorithms \nhave to be aware of the hardware and able to use special features\
    \ of the micro-processors \nand transceivers to minimize the sensor node’s energy\
    \ consumption. This may push toward \na custom solution for different types of\
    \ sensor node design. Different types of sensor nodes \ndeployed also lead to\
    \ different types of sensor networks. This may also lead to the different \ntypes\
    \ of collaborative algorithms in wireless sensor networks arena. \n8. Protocols\
    \ & algorithms of wireless sensor network \nIn WSN, the main task of a sensor\
    \ node is to sense data and sends it to the base station in \nmulti hop environment\
    \ for which routing path is essential. For computing the routing path \nfrom the\
    \ source node to the base station there is huge numbers of proposed routing \n\
    protocols exist (Sharma et al., 2011). The design of routing protocols for WSNs\
    \ must \nconsider the power and resource limitations of the network nodes, the\
    \ time-varying quality \nof the wireless channel, and the possibility for packet\
    \ loss and delay. To address these \ndesign requirements, several routing strategies\
    \ for WSNs have been proposed in (Labrador \net al., 2009), (Akkaya et al., 2005),\
    \ ( Akyildiz et al. 2002), (Boukerche, 2009, Al-karaki et al., \n2004, Pan et\
    \ al., 2003) and (Waharte et al., 2006). \nThe first class of routing protocols\
    \ adopts a flat network architecture in which all nodes are \nconsidered peers.\
    \ Flat network architecture has several advantages, including minimal \noverhead\
    \ to maintain the infrastructure and the potential for the discovery of multiple\
    \ \nroutes between communicating nodes for fault tolerance. \nA second class of\
    \ routing protocols imposes a structure on the network to achieve energy \nefficiency,\
    \ stability, and scalability. In this class of protocols, network nodes are organized\
    \ in \nclusters in which a node with higher residual energy, for example, assumes\
    \ the role of a \ncluster head. The cluster head is responsible for coordinating\
    \ activities within the cluster \nand forwarding information between clusters.\
    \ Clustering has potential to reduce energy \nconsumption and extend the lifetime\
    \ of the network. \nA third class of routing protocols uses a data-centric approach\
    \ to disseminate interest within \nthe network. The approach uses attribute-based\
    \ naming, whereby a source node queries an \nattribute for the phenomenon rather\
    \ than an individual sensor node. The interest \n \nWireless Sensor Networks –\
    \ Technology and Protocols \n14 \ndissemination is achieved by assigning tasks\
    \ to sensor nodes and expressing queries to \nrelative to specific attributes.\
    \ Different strategies can be used to communicate interests to the \nsensor nodes,\
    \ including broadcasting, attribute-based multicasting, geo-casting, and any \n\
    casting.  \nA fourth class of routing protocols uses location to address a sensor\
    \ node. Location-based \nrouting is useful in applications where the position\
    \ of the node within the geographical \ncoverage of the network is relevant to\
    \ the query issued by the source node. Such a query \nmay specify a specific area\
    \ where a phenomenon of interest may occur or the vicinity to a \nspecific point\
    \ in the network environment. \nIn the rest of this section we discuss some of\
    \ the major routing protocols and algorithms to \ndeal with the energy conservation\
    \ issue in the literatures. \n1. \nFlooding: Flooding is a common technique frequently\
    \ used for path discovery and \ninformation dissemination in wired and wireless\
    \ ad hoc networks which has been \ndiscussed in (Akyildiz et al., 2002). The routing\
    \ strategy of flooding is simple and does \nnot rely on costly network topology\
    \ maintenance and complex route discovery \nalgorithms. Flooding uses a reactive\
    \ approach whereby each node receiving a data or \ncontrol packet sends the packet\
    \ to all its neighbors. After transmission, a packet follows \nall possible paths.\
    \ Unless the network is disconnected, the packet will eventually reach \nits destination.\
    \ Furthermore, as the network topology changes, the packet transmitted \nfollows\
    \ the new routes. Fig. 8 illustrates the concept of flooding in data communications\
    \ \nnetwork. As shown in the figure, flooding in its simplest form may cause packets\
    \ to be \nreplicated indefinitely by network nodes.  \n \nFigure 8. Flooding in\
    \ data communication networks \n \nOverview of Wireless Sensor Network 15 \n1.\
    \ \nGossiping:  \nTo address the shortcomings of flooding, a derivative approach,\
    \ referred to as gossiping, has \nbeen proposed in ( Braginsky et al., 2002).\
    \ Similar to flooding, gossiping uses a simple \nforwarding rule and does not\
    \ require costly topology maintenance or complex route \ndiscovery algorithms.\
    \ Contrary to flooding, where a data packet is broadcast to all \nneighbors, gossiping\
    \ requires that each node sends the incoming packet to a randomly \nselected neighbor.\
    \ Upon receiving the packet, the neighbor selected randomly chooses one \nof its\
    \ own neighbors and forwards the packet to the neighbor chosen. This process continues\
    \ \niteratively until the packet reaches its intended destination or the maximum\
    \ hop count is \nexceeded. \n2. \nProtocols for Information via Negotiation (SPIN):\
    \ \nSensor protocols for information via negotiation (SPIN), is a data-centric\
    \ negotiation-based \nfamily of information dissemination protocols for WSNs (Kulik\
    \ et al., 2002). The main \nobjective of these protocols is to efficiently disseminate\
    \ observations gathered by individual \nsensor nodes to all the sensor nodes in\
    \ the network. Simple protocols such as flooding and \ngossiping are commonly\
    \ proposed to achieve information dissemination in WSNs. Flooding \nrequires that\
    \ each node sends a copy of the data packet to all its neighbors until the \n\
    information reaches all nodes in the network. Gossiping, on the other hand, uses\
    \ \nrandomization to reduce the number of duplicate packets and requires only\
    \ that a node \nreceiving a data packet forward it to a randomly selected neighbor.\
    \ \n \nFigure 9. SPIN basic protocol operation \n \nWireless Sensor Networks –\
    \ Technology and Protocols \n16 \n3. \nLow-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy\
    \ (LEACH) \nLow-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) is a routing algorithm\
    \ designed to \ncollect and deliver data to the data sink, typically a base station\
    \ (Heinzelman et. al. 2000). \nThe main objectives of LEACH are: \n \nExtension\
    \ of the network lifetime \n \nReduced energy consumption by each network sensor\
    \ node \n \nUse of data aggregation to reduce the number of communication messages\
    \ \nTo achieve these objectives, LEACH adopts a hierarchical approach to organize\
    \ the network \ninto a set of clusters. Each cluster is managed by a selected\
    \ cluster head. The cluster head \nassumes the responsibility to carry out multiple\
    \ tasks. The first task consists of periodic \ncollection of data from the members\
    \ of the cluster. Upon gathering the data, the cluster head \naggregates it in\
    \ an effort to remove redundancy among correlated values. The second main \ntask\
    \ of a cluster head is to transmit the aggregated data directly to the base station\
    \ over \nsingle hop. The third main task of the cluster head is to create a TDMA-based\
    \ schedule \nwhereby each node of the cluster is assigned a time slot that it\
    \ can use for transmission. The \ncluster head announces the schedule to its cluster\
    \ members through broadcasting. To reduce \nthe likelihood of collisions among\
    \ sensors within and outside the cluster, LEACH nodes use \na code-division multiple\
    \ access–based scheme for communication. \nThe basic operations of LEACH are organized\
    \ in two distinct phases. The first phase, the \nsetup phase, consists of two\
    \ steps, cluster-head selection and cluster formation. The second \nphase, the\
    \ steady-state phase, focuses on data collection, aggregation, and delivery to\
    \ the \nbase station. The duration of the setup is assumed to be relatively shorter\
    \ than the steady-\nstate phase to minimize the protocol overhead. \nAt the beginning\
    \ of the setup phase, a round of cluster-head selection starts. To decide \nwhether\
    \ a node to become cluster head or not a threshold T(s) is addressed in (Heinzelman\
    \ \net. al. 2000) which is as follows: \n \n,\n'\n1\n1\n.( .mod.\n)\n( )\n0,\n\
    opt\nopt\nopt\np\nifs\nG\np\nr\nT s\np\notherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\
    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n(1) \nWhere r is the current round number and G is the\
    \ set of nodes that have not become cluster \nhead within the last 1/popt rounds.\
    \ At the beginning of each round, each node which belongs \nto the set G selects\
    \ a random number 0 or 1. If the random number is less than the threshold \nT(s)\
    \ then the node becomes a cluster head in the current round. \n4. \nThreshold-sensitive\
    \ Energy Efficient Protocols (TEEN and APTEEN): \nTwo hierarchical routing protocols\
    \ called TEEN (Threshold-sensitive Energy Efficient sensor \nNetwork protocol),\
    \ and APTEEN (Adaptive Periodic Threshold-sensitive Energy Efficient \nsensor\
    \ Network protocol) are proposed in (Manjeshwar et al., 2001) and (Manjeshwar\
    \ et al., \n \nOverview of Wireless Sensor Network 17 \n2002) , respectively.\
    \ These protocols were proposed for time-critical applications. In \nTEEN, sensor\
    \ nodes sense the medium continuously, but the data transmission is done \nless\
    \ frequently. A cluster head sensor sends its members a hard threshold, which\
    \ is the \nthreshold value of the sensed attribute and a soft threshold, which\
    \ is a small change in the \nvalue of the sensed attribute that triggers the node\
    \ to switch on its transmitter and \ntransmit. Thus the hard threshold tries to\
    \ reduce the number of transmissions by allowing \nthe nodes to transmit only\
    \ when the sensed attribute is in the range of interest. The soft \nthreshold\
    \ further reduces the number of transmissions that might have otherwise \noccurred\
    \ when there is little or no change in the sensed attribute. A smaller value of\
    \ the \nsoft threshold gives a more accurate picture of the network, at the expense\
    \ of increased \nenergy consumption. Thus, the user can control the trade-off\
    \ between energy efficiency \nand data accuracy. When cluster-heads are to change,\
    \ new values for the above \nparameters are broadcast. The main drawback of this\
    \ scheme is that, if the thresholds are \nnot received, the nodes will never communicate,\
    \ and the user will not get any data from \nthe network at all. \n5. \nPower-Efficient\
    \ Gathering in Sensor Information Systems (PEGASIS): \nPower-efficient gathering\
    \ in sensor information systems (PEGASIS) (Lindsey et al., 2002) \nand its extension,\
    \ hierarchical PEGASIS, are a family of routing and information-gathering \nprotocols\
    \ for WSNs. The main objectives of PEGASIS are twofold. First, the protocol aims\
    \ at \nextending the lifetime of a network by achieving a high level of energy\
    \ efficiency and \nuniform energy consumption across all network nodes. Second,\
    \ the protocol strives to \nreduce the delay that data incur on their way to the\
    \ sink. \nThe network model considered by PEGASIS assumes a homogeneous set of\
    \ nodes deployed \nacross a geographical area. Nodes are assumed to have global\
    \ knowledge about other \nsensors’ positions. Furthermore, they have the ability\
    \ to control their power to cover \narbitrary ranges. The nodes may also be equipped\
    \ with CDMA-capable radio transceivers. \nThe nodes’ responsibility is to gather\
    \ and deliver data to a sink, typically a wireless base \nstation. The goal is\
    \ to develop a routing structure and an aggregation scheme to reduce \nenergy\
    \ consumption and deliver the aggregated data to the base station with minimal\
    \ delay \nwhile balancing energy consumption among the sensor nodes. Contrary\
    \ to other protocols, \nwhich rely on a tree structure or a cluster-based hierarchical\
    \ organization of the network for \ndata gathering and dissemination, PEGASIS\
    \ uses a chain structure.  \n6. \nDirected Diffusion: \nDirected diffusion (Intanagonwiwat\
    \ et al., 2000) is a data-centric routing protocol for \ninformation gathering\
    \ and dissemination in WSNs. The main objective of the protocol is to \nachieve\
    \ substantial energy savings in order to extend the lifetime of the network. To\
    \ achieve \nthis objective, directed diffusion keeps interactions between nodes,\
    \ in terms of message \nexchanges, localized within limited network vicinity.\
    \ Using localized interaction, direct \ndiffusion can still realize robust multi-path\
    \ delivery and adapt to a minimal subset of \nnetwork paths. This unique feature\
    \ of the protocol, combined with the ability of the nodes to \naggregate response\
    \ to queries, results into significant energy savings. \n \nWireless Sensor Networks\
    \ – Technology and Protocols \n18 \n \nFigure 10. Chain-based data gathering and\
    \ aggregation scheme \nThe main elements of direct diffusion include interests,\
    \ data messages, gradients, and \nreinforcements. Directed diffusion uses a publish-and-subscribe\
    \ information model in which \nan inquirer expresses an interest using attribute–value\
    \ pairs. An interest can be viewed as a \nquery or an interrogation that specifies\
    \ what the inquirer wants. \n7. \nGeographic Adaptive Fidelity (GAF): \nGAF (Xu\
    \ et al., 2001) is an energy-aware location-based routing algorithm designed mainly\
    \ \nfor mobile ad hoc networks, but may be applicable to sensor networks as well.\
    \ The network \narea is first divided into fixed zones and forms a virtual grid.\
    \ Inside each zone, nodes \ncollaborate with each other to play different roles.\
    \ For example, nodes will elect one sensor \nnode to stay awake for a certain\
    \ period of time and then they go to sleep. This node is \nresponsible for monitoring\
    \ and reporting data to the BS on behalf of the nodes in the zone. \nHence, GAF\
    \ conserves energy by turning off unnecessary nodes in the network without \n\
    affecting the level of routing fidelity. \n9. Security issues in wireless sensor\
    \ network \nSecurity issues in sensor networks depend on the need to know what\
    \ we are going to protect. \nIn (Zia et al., 2006), the authors defined four security\
    \ goals in sensor networks which are \nConfidentiality, Integrity, Authentication\
    \ and Availability. Another security goal in sensor \nnetwork is introduced in\
    \ (Sharma et al., 2011).Confidentiality is the ability to conceal message \nfrom\
    \ a passive attacker, where the message communicated on sensor networks remain\
    \ \nconfidential. Integrity refers to the ability to confirm the message has not\
    \ been tampered, \naltered or changed while it was on the network. Authentication\
    \ Need to know if the messages \nare from the node it claims to be from, determining\
    \ the reliability of message’s origin. \nAvailability is to determine if a node\
    \ has the ability to use the resources and the network is \navailable for the\
    \ messages to move on. Freshness implies that receiver receives the recent and\
    \ \nfresh data and ensures that no adversary can replay the old data. This requirement\
    \ is \n \nOverview of Wireless Sensor Network 19 \nespecially important when the\
    \ WSN nodes use shared-keys for message communication, \nwhere a potential adversary\
    \ can launch a replay attack using the old key as the new key is \nbeing refreshed\
    \ and propagated to all the nodes in the WSN ( Sen, 2009). To achieve the \nfreshness\
    \ the mechanism like nonce or time stamp should add to each data packet. \nHaving\
    \ built a foundation of security goals in sensor network, the major possible security\
    \ \nattacks in sensor networks are identified in (Undercoffer et al., 2002) .\
    \ Routing loops attacks \ntarget the information exchanged between nodes. False\
    \ error messages are generated when \nan attacker alters and replays the routing\
    \ information. Routing loops attract or repel the \nnetwork traffic and increases\
    \ node to node latency. Selective forwarding attack influences \nthe network traffic\
    \ by believing that all the participating nodes in network are reliable to \n\
    forward the message. In selective forwarding attack malicious nodes simply drop\
    \ certain \nmessages instead of forwarding every message. Once a malicious node\
    \ cherry picks on the \nmessages, it reduces the latency and deceives the neighboring\
    \ nodes that they are on a \nshorter route. Effectiveness of this attack depends\
    \ on two factors. First the location of the \nmalicious node, the closer it is\
    \ to the base stations the more traffic it will attract. Second is \nthe percentage\
    \ of messages it drops. When selective forwarder drops more messages and \nforwards\
    \ less, it retains its energy level thus remaining powerful to trick the neighboring\
    \ \nnodes. In sinkhole attacks, adversary attracts the traffic to a compromised\
    \ node. The \nsimplest way of creating sinkhole is to place a malicious node where\
    \ it can attract most of \nthe traffic, possibly closer to the base station or\
    \ malicious node itself deceiving as a base \nstation. One reason for sinkhole\
    \ attacks is to make selective forwarding possible to attract \nthe traffic towards\
    \ a compromised node. The nature of sensor networks where all the traffic \nflows\
    \ towards one base station makes this type of attacks more susceptible. Sybil\
    \ attacks are \na type of attacks where a node creates multiple illegitimate identities\
    \ in sensor networks \neither by fabricating or stealing the identities of legitimate\
    \ nodes. Sybil attacks can be used \nagainst routing algorithms and topology maintenance;\
    \ it reduces the effectiveness of fault \ntolerant schemes such as distributed\
    \ storage and disparity. Another malicious factor is \ngeographic routing where\
    \ a Sybil node can appear at more than one place simultaneously. \nIn wormhole\
    \ attacks an adversary positioned closer to the base station can completely \n\
    disrupt the traffic by tunneling messages over a low latency link. Here an adversary\
    \ \nconvinces the nodes which are multi hop away that they are closer to the base\
    \ station. This \ncreates a sinkhole because adversary on the other side of the\
    \ sinkhole provides a better route \nto the base station. In Hello flood attacks\
    \ a Broadcasted message with stronger transmission \npower is pretending that\
    \ the HELLO message is coming from the base station. Message \nreceiving nodes\
    \ assume that the HELLO message sending node is the closest one and they \ntry\
    \ to send all their messages through this node. In this type of attacks all nodes\
    \ will be \nresponding to HELLO floods and wasting the energies. The real base\
    \ station will also be \nbroadcasting the similar messages but will have only\
    \ few nodes responding to it. Denial of \nservice (DoS) attacks occur at physical\
    \ level causing radio jamming, interfering with the \nnetwork protocol, battery\
    \ exhaustion etc. An specific type of DoS attack, Denial-of-service \nattack has\
    \ been explored in (Raymond et al., 2009), in which a sensor node’s power supply\
    \ is \ntargeted. Attacks of this type can reduce the sensor lifetime from years\
    \ to days and have a \ndevastating impact on a sensor network. \n \nWireless Sensor\
    \ Networks – Technology and Protocols \n20 \n1. \nLayering based security approach:\
    \ \n \nApplication layer  \nData is collected and managed at application layer\
    \ therefore it is important to ensure the \nreliability of data. Wagner (Wanger,\
    \ 2004) has presented a resilient aggregation scheme \nwhich is applicable to\
    \ a cluster based network where a cluster leader acts as an aggregator \nin sensor\
    \ networks. However this technique is applicable if the aggregating node is in\
    \ the \nrange with all the source nodes and there is no intervening aggregator\
    \ between the \naggregator and source nodes. To prove the validity of the aggregation,\
    \ cluster leaders use \nthe cryptographic techniques to ensure the data reliability.\
    \ \n \nNetwork layer \nNetwork layer is responsible for routing of messages from\
    \ node to node, node to cluster \nleader, cluster leaders to cluster leaders,\
    \ cluster leaders to the base station and vice versa. \n \nData link layer \n\
    Data link layer does the error detection and correction, and encoding of data.\
    \ Link layer is \nvulnerable to jamming and DoS attacks. TinySec (Karlof et al.,\
    \ 2004) has introduced link \nlayer encryption which depends on a key management\
    \ scheme. However, an attacker \nhaving better energy efficiency can still rage\
    \ an attack. Protocols like LMAC (Hoesel et al., \n2004) have better anti-jamming\
    \ properties which are viable countermeasure at this layer.  \n \nPhysical Layer\
    \  \nThe physical layer emphasizes on the transmission media between sending and\
    \ receiving \nnodes, the data rate, signal strength, frequency types are also\
    \ addressed in this layer. Ideally \nFHSS frequency hopping spread spectrum is\
    \ used in sensor networks. \n10. Conclusion & future work \nThe aim of this chapter\
    \ is to discuss few important issues of WSNs, from the application, \ndesign and\
    \ technology points of view. For designing a WSN, we need to consider different\
    \ \nfactors such as the flexibility, energy efficiency, fault tolerance, high\
    \ sensing fidelity, low-\ncost and rapid deployment, above all the application\
    \ requirements. We hope the wide range \nof application areas will make sensor\
    \ networks an integral part of our lives in the future. \nHowever, realization\
    \ of sensor networks needs to satisfy several constraints such as \nscalability,\
    \ cost, hardware, topology change, environment and power consumption. Since \n\
    these constraints are highly tight and specific for sensor networks, new wireless\
    \ ad hoc \nnetworking protocols are required. To meet the requirements, many researchers\
    \ are \nengaged in developing the technologies needed for different layers of\
    \ the sensor networks \nprotocol stack. \nFuture research on WSN will be directed\
    \ towards maximizing area throughput in clustered \nWireless Sensor Networks designed\
    \ for temporal or spatial random process estimation, \naccounting for radio channel,\
    \ PHY, MAC and NET protocol layers and data aggregation \n \nOverview of Wireless\
    \ Sensor Network 21 \ntechniques, simulation and experimental verification of\
    \ lifetime-aware routing, sensing \nspatial coverage and the enhancement of the\
    \ desired sensing spatial coverage evaluation \nmethods with practical sensor\
    \ model. \nThe advances of wireless networking and sensor technology open up an\
    \ interesting \nopportunity to manage human activities in a smart home environment.\
    \ Real-life activities \nare often more complex than the case studies for both\
    \ single and multi-user. Investigating \nsuch complex cases can be very challenging\
    \ while we consider both single- and multi-user \nactivities at the same time.\
    \ Future work will focus on the fundamental problem of \nrecognizing activities\
    \ of multiple users using a wireless body sensor network.  \nWireless Sensor Networks\
    \ hold the promise of delivering a smart communication paradigm \nwhich enables\
    \ setting up an intelligent network capable of handling applications that evolve\
    \ \nfrom user requirements. We believe that in near future, WSN research will\
    \ put a great \nimpact on our daily life. For example, it will create a system\
    \ for continual observation of \nphysiological signals while the patients are\
    \ at their homes. It will lower the cost involved \nwith monitoring patients and\
    \ increase the efficient exploitation of physiological data and the \npatients\
    \ will have access to the highest quality medical care in their own homes. Thus,\
    \ it will \navoid the distress and disruption caused by a lengthy inpatient stay.\

    attenuated total reflection (ATR) FT mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy were used
    to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse Vitis vinifera L. cv Sauvignon blanc
    grape berries. FT-NIR and ATR FT-MIR spectroscopy, coupled with spectral preprocessing
    and multivariate data analysis (MVDA), provided reliable methods to qualitatively
    assess berry samples at five distinct developmental stages: green, pre-véraison,
    véraison, post-véraison and ripe (harvest), without any prior metabolite extraction.
    Compared to NIR spectra, MIR spectra provided more reliable discrimination between
    the berry samples from the different developmental stages. Interestingly, ATR
    FT-MIR spectra from fresh homogenized berry samples proved more discriminatory
    than spectra from frozen homogenized berry samples. Different developmental stages
    were discriminated by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial
    least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). In order to generate partial least
    squares (PLS) models from the MIR/NIR spectral datasets; the major sugars (glucose
    and fructose) and organic acids (malic acid, succinic acid and tartaric acid)
    were separated and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
    and the data used as a reference dataset. PLS regression was used to develop calibration
    models to predict the concentration of the major sugars and organic acids in the
    berry samples from different developmental stages. Our data show that infrared
    (IR) spectroscopy could provide a rapid, reproducible and cost-effective alternative
    to the chromatographic analysis of the sugar and organic acid composition of grape
    berries at various developmental stages, using small sample volumes and requiring
    limited sample preparation. This provides scope and support for the possible development
    of hand-held devices to assess quality parameters in field-settings in real-time
    and non-destructively using IR technologies. Previous article in issue Next article

    1. Introduction The grape berry has been described as a complex biochemical factory,
    that produces a diverse array of primary (e.g. sugars, organic acids) and secondary
    metabolites (e.g. phenolic and aromatic compounds) that can occur at various developmental
    and/or maturation stages (Coombe and McCarthy, 2000, Robinson and Davies, 2000).
    The metabolism of these compounds in the berries is typically used as indicator
    of the progression of development and ripening (Coombe, 1992). Since the concentration
    of the primary metabolites (i.e. sugars and organic acids) at ripeness contributes
    to the perceived quality of grapes and the subsequent wine (Rusjan, Korošec-Koruza,
    & Veberič, 2008), their relative abundance is typically used to direct operational
    decisions in the vineyard that include vineyard manipulation, harvest dates and
    the desired wine style(s). The study of these metabolites in field-grown grape
    berries is, however, complicated by the inherent heterogeneity found in vineyards
    (or any field-grown crop). Grape berry development and ripening has been shown
    to be asynchronous, with heterogeneity found on multiple levels: (1) between berries
    on a single bunch; (2) between bunches on a vine; (3) between vines in a vineyard;
    and (4) between vineyards in a region (Dal Santo et al., 2013, Jackson and Lombard,
    1993). To account for this heterogeneity, profiling and classification methods
    are typically employed to analyse the major grape berry metabolites (García de
    Cortázar-Atauri et al., 2009, Šuklje et al., 2012). It is clear that the existence
    of variability has a significant impact on grape berry sampling (and relevance
    of subsequent data generated), leading to the necessity for updated workflows
    and technologies to account for this variability (Alexandersson, Jacobson, Vivier,
    Weckwerth, & Andreasson, 2014). Classical analytical methods such as high performance
    liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC) and colorimetry are typically
    used for the quantitative analysis of grape berry composition. These “traditional”
    methods though lengthy and expensive still remain the workhorses of high end research
    applications (Herrera, Guesalaga, & Agosin, 2003), but do not satisfy the demands
    of the modern global grape and wine industries. The fresh fruit industry requires
    methods that allow rapid, reliable and relatively low-cost analyses and/or non-invasive
    techniques to estimate or profile key metabolites (biomarkers) (González-Caballero,
    Sánchez, López, & Pérez-Marín, 2010). Moreover, the prediction of metabolites
    such as sugars and organic acids can assist in the implementation of appropriate
    management strategies to control desired grape attributes (e.g. size, colour,
    acidity, chemical composition) (Ali et al., 2011). Spectroscopic techniques, such
    as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) in combination with multivariate
    data analysis (MVDA), have found increasing application in agriculture. NMR spectroscopy
    is a non-selective, simple and relative rapid technique ideal for the profiling
    of a broad range of metabolites such as those found in grape berries (Ali et al.,
    2011). It has been successfully applied for the estimation of sugars and some
    organic acids in berries in a number of Portuguese grape cultivars (Ali et al.,
    2011). NMR spectroscopy, however, requires sample preparation and use of deuterated
    solvents for analysis. IR spectroscopy is suitable for the determination of compounds
    containing polar functional groups such as –OH, C–O, and N–H (Blanco & Villarroya,
    2002) and offers an alternative to estimate sugars and organic acids (polar compounds)
    present in grape berries without prior analyte extraction. With short runtimes
    (seconds), IR spectroscopy is not only rapid, but has relatively low operational
    costs and since no chemical waste is generated, is comparatively environmentally
    friendly (González-Caballero et al., 2010, Nicolaï et al., 2007). Portable (hand-held)
    visible/NIR spectroscopic devices are currently commercially available and provide
    a relatively simple, non-destructive analysis and have been used to estimate,
    for example, berry ripeness in the Italian red grape cultivar Nebbiolo (Giovenzana,
    Beghi, Malegori, & Civelli, 2014). The development of FT-IR spectroscopy instrumentation
    combined with MVDA techniques has given impetus to the application of rapid methods
    for predicting the presence and/or concentration of specific chemical constituents
    in fruit and vegetable matrices (Nicolaï et al., 2007). IR spectroscopy in the
    NIR (12,000–4000 cm−1, 833–2500 nm) and the MIR (4000–400 cm−1, 2500–25,000 nm)
    spectral regions (Kelly, Downey, & Fourtier, 2004) has been extensively applied
    as alternative analytical tools in the food industry (Bauer et al., 2008). NIR
    spectroscopy is attractive due to the fact that it is rapid and non-destructive
    and it has the additional benefit of penetrating finite distances in fruit (Nicolaï
    et al., 2007). This versatility makes NIR spectroscopy an alternative to conventional
    extractive analyses to be used for the acquisition of surface and internal characteristics
    of foods (Nicolaï et al., 2007). In comparison to NIR spectroscopy, MIR spectroscopy
    provides spectral information that is easier to interpret due to the higher resolution
    of the fundamental MIR vibrational absorption bands compared to the overtone and
    combination NIR absorption bands (Kelly et al., 2004). NIR spectroscopy has been
    successfully implemented to monitor a number of metabolites in grape berries at
    post-véraison/ripe developmental stages that include: sugars (Giovenzana et al.,
    2014, Jarén et al., 2001), organic acids (González-Caballero et al., 2010) and
    anthocyanins (Cozzolino, Cynkar, Dambergs, Janik, & Gishen, 2005). MIR spectroscopy
    has been used to study phenolic compounds in post-véraison/ripe berries (Fragoso,
    Aceña, Guasch, Busto, & Mestres, 2011). Fruit quality, however, is dependent on
    the compositional changes occurring throughout development due to the cumulative
    effects of the environment (amongst other factors) on the fruit (Alexandersson
    et al., 2014). To our knowledge, there is no reported use of FT-NIR and FT-MIR
    spectroscopy in grape berry analyses over the entire developmental process. An
    approach that incorporates/utilizes the advantages of both NIR and MIR spectroscopic
    techniques could potentially provide novel insights into grape berry development
    and/or stage-specific grape berry responses. The ability to assess berry composition
    using high-throughput technologies would support the practical implementation
    of comprehensive analysis of developing and ripening berries to provide a qualitative
    and/or quantitative profile for a vineyard (Alexandersson et al., 2014, Rolle
    et al., 2012). In this study the potential of NIR and MIR spectroscopy to assess
    grape berry development qualitatively (via PCA and discriminant analysis) and
    quantitatively, (via PLS regression models derived from reference data sets),
    was investigated. The NIR and MIR spectra were collected from grape berries sampled
    at five distinct developmental stages: green, pre-véraison, véraison, post-véraison
    and ripe/harvest stages. Qualitative analysis was carried out using MVDA of the
    respective spectra. HPLC was used to generate reference analytical data for the
    major sugars (glucose and fructose) and organic acids (tartaric acid, malic acid,
    succinic acid) for quantitative analysis. The sugars and organic acids were selected
    as they are well described biomarkers of berry growth and development (Coombe,
    1992, Topalovic and Mikulic-Petkovsek, 2010). PLS regression analysis (Wold, Sjöström,
    & Eriksson, 2001; Wiklund et al., 2008) of the spectra was used to develop calibration
    models for the prediction of the concentrations of these metabolites in the grape
    berry at five distinct developmental stages. 2. Materials and methods High performance
    liquid chromatography (HPLC) and IR (NIR and MIR) spectroscopy were used in this
    study. Supplementary Fig. 1 provides a flow chart for an overview of the respective
    steps and how they are related: (1) sample collection, (2) sample processing,
    and (3) sample analysis, (4) data analysis, and (5) outputs derived from the data.
    Experimental details are provided in the relevant sections of the materials and
    methods. 2.1. Berry sampling and processing Grape berries from Vitis vinifera
    L. cv. Sauvignon blanc (clone 316 grafted to 101–14 Mgt), were established in
    the Elgin wine region (Overberg, coastal region of the Western Cape, South Africa:
    34° 9′52.19″S; 19° 0′57.48″E) in 2004. The vines have a NW-SE row orientation
    with 2.5 m × 1.8 m spacing. Shoots were positioned vertically (vertical shoot
    positioning trellis system) with two levels of movable wires and pruned using
    a double cordon system with two buds per spur. Irrigation was applied to avoid
    water constraints to the experimental vines. Two rows consisting of six panels
    (four vines per panel) were sampled at five developmental stages: green (Eichhorn-Lorenz
    (E-L) system stage 31–32), pre-véraison (E-L 33), véraison (E-L 34), post-véraison
    (E-L 35–36) and ripe (E-L 38) (Coombe, 1995) in two sequential years (vintages:
    2010/2011, 2011/2012). Berry samples (n = 48 berries per sample) were collected
    between 10h00–11h00 on sampling days (total samples for 2010–2012: n = 120) (Supplementary
    Table 1). Samples were flash frozen in liquid N2 in the field and stored at −80
    °C. Seeds were removed from the frozen berries and the tissue homogenised in liquid
    nitrogen using an oscillating MM 400 mill (Retsch GmbH, Germany) and stored at
    −80 °C until analysed. Fresh samples (n = 48) were collected in the 2012/2013
    season from each vine in the same two rows described above at green, pre-véraison,
    véraison and post-véraison stages (total samples for 2012/2013: n = 192). Ripe
    samples (E-L 38) could not be collected due to logistical problems. Fresh samples
    were maintained on ice and pips were removed before the berries were crushed into
    a slurry using a mortar and pestle. Spectral analysis was carried out on the same
    day. 2.2. Extraction and HPLC analysis of sugars and organic acids Sugars (glucose
    and fructose) and organic acids (malic acid, tartaric acid, and succinic acid)
    were extracted from 80 to 100 mg of frozen, ground berry tissue as described in
    Eyéghè-Bickong, Alexandersson, Gouws, Young, and Vivier (2012). Metabolite separation
    and analysis was carried out using an Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Agilent
    Technologies©, California) equipped with a diode array detector (DAD) coupled
    to a refractive index detector (RID). The separation was performed on an Aminex
    HPX-87H ion exchange column (300 mm × 7.78 mm) protected with a Bio-Rad guard
    cartridge (30 mm × 4.6 mm) using 5 mM sulfuric acid as a mobile phase. The flow
    rate was 0.5 mL/min and the column maintained at 55 °C. ChemStation Rev. A.10.02
    software (Agilent Technologies©) was used for data acquisition and the injection
    volume was 10 μL. The DAD was used to detect organic acids (210 nm) while the
    RID was used to detect sugars. The sugars and organic acids were quantified using
    external standard calibration based on standard curves constructed using the peak
    areas versus the concentration (g/L) of authentic standards. The standard concentrations
    ranged from 0.04 to 5 g/L for organic acids and 0.1 to 20 g/L for sugars. The
    resulting concentrations were normalised to the internal standard amount and divided
    by the sample weight (fresh weight, FW) to obtain the concentration in mg/g FW.
    One-way ANOVA was performed with Statistica 12 software (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa,
    USA) on the reference data to determine the significance of the changes in metabolite
    levels between the developmental stages. 2.3. Infrared spectroscopy of homogenized
    berry samples Sample preparation for IR analysis was adapted from a method described
    by Cozzolino, Cynkar, Dambergs, Mercurio, and Smith (2008). The IR spectra were
    generated from homogenates of frozen and fresh grape berry samples in reflectance
    mode. FT-NIR spectra were generated on the 2010/11 frozen samples using a Multi-Purpose
    Analyzer (MPA) FT-NIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany), fitted
    with an integrating rotating sphere. A minimum of 5 g sample for each frozen grape
    berry homogenate was transferred from the freezer to a 50 mL Falcon tube and allowed
    to thaw at room temperature (±23 °C). Approximately 2.5 g was transferred to the
    spectrometer sample cup with a quartz base (diameter 3 cm). Samples were scanned
    against air background spectra that were measured at regular intervals during
    sample spectra acquisition under the same instrumental and laboratory conditions.
    After each measurement, the scanned sample was returned to the original Falcon
    tube, the contents mixed and another 2.5 g portion sampled and scanned. This process
    was repeated till ten technical repeats were acquired (600 spectral measurements).
    The sample cup was cleaned with distilled water and dried with lens-cleaning tissue
    paper between measurements. Sample measurement time was 45 s using the following
    scanning parameters: 12,000–4000 cm−1 wavenumber range, 4 cm−1 resolution, 10
    kHz scanner velocity, with 32 background and samples scans. The instrumental control
    and initial spectral processing were carried out using OPUS software (OPUS v.
    7.0 for Microsoft, Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany). NIR spectra were corrected
    for baseline offset in OPUS and a mean sample spectrum was acquired from the respective
    technical repeats. ATR FT-MIR spectra were acquired at the same time as the NIR
    spectra. Approximately 45 mg of the same homogenate thawed for NIR analysis was
    scanned on an Alpha-P ATR FT-MIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany),
    fitted with a single bounce diamond crystal sample plate (area 2 mm2) maintained
    at 30 °C. After each measurement, the scanned material was discarded, the sample
    plate cleaned and a new sample scanned until ten technical repeats were acquired
    (1200 spectral measurements). MIR analysis was done under the following scanning
    parameters: 4000–400 cm−1 wavenumber range, 4 cm−1 resolution, 7.5 kHz scanner
    velocity, and 64 background and sample scans. Spectra were collected against a
    background of air as previously described. From each set of ten independent technical
    repeats; an average sample spectrum was generated in OPUS as previously described.
    No spectral pre-processing was applied. In order to assess the suitability of
    ATR FT-MIR spectroscopy for use on fresh grape berries, homogenates of 192 fresh
    grape samples from the 2012/13 season were used. Due to the high repeatability
    and reproducibility observed with the frozen berry ATR FT-MIR spectra, the number
    of technical repeats on fresh samples was reduced to three (576 spectral measurements)
    and the average spectra of each sample was generated as previously described.
    2.4. Multivariate data analysis of spectral data OPUS was used for spectral acquisition;
    data processing was performed using SIMCA 13.0 (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden). Different
    spectral filtering methods such as standard normal variate (SNV) correction, Savitzky–Golay
    transformation (first derivative and second derivatives, 15 points) and multiplicative
    scattering correction (MSC) were tested on the averaged baseline of the FT-NIR
    sample spectra in order to decide on the optimal pre-processing method. These
    methods have been described to remove unwanted variation in spectral data (Blanco
    and Villarroya, 2002, Shenk et al., 2008, Shiroma and Rodriguez-Saona, 2009).
    Qualitative analysis (modelling of developmental stage) was carried out using
    PCA and OPLS-DA and quantitative analysis (calibration models and prediction of
    metabolites) was carried out with PLS. The spectral data was used as the X matrix
    and the reference data served as the Y matrix. For model development, the X block
    was mean-centered for PCA and PLS and Pareto-scaled for OPLS-DA. The Y block was
    scaled to unit variance to address the differences in concentration ranges of
    the individual y-variables. This step is essential to prevent y variables with
    large standard deviations (SD) to dominate over others with smaller SD in the
    PLS model. 2.4.1. Unsupervised clustering (PCA) PCA in X was carried out to explore
    the possible clustering of samples and evaluate the influence of developmental
    stage. PCA is an unsupervised data compression technique that maximises the variation
    in X data and projects the main variation onto a few latent variables (Wold, Esbensen,
    & Geladi, 1987). Sample groupings, if present, are evident as clusters in PCA
    scores plots with the corresponding loadings plots showing the variables that
    contribute most to sample groupings (Wold et al., 1987). 2.4.2. Supervised clustering/discriminant
    analysis (OPLS-DA) OPLS-DA, a supervised classification technique that can isolate
    the predictive component from the orthogonal sources of variation in the datasets
    and the S-line plot which identifies the variables responsible for the between-stage
    and/or within stage discrimination were used to examine if sample classification
    could be improved in cases where PCA could not show clear clustering. OPLS-DA
    works through projection of X and is guided by known class information thus offering
    increased separation projection in comparison to PCA (Trygg et al., 2007, Wiklund
    et al., 2008). OPLS-DA models are easier to interpret than PLS-DA models, because
    their score plots are rotated so that between class variation is projected on
    the predictive component, while with-in class variation, is projected on the first
    y-orthogonal component (Wiklund et al., 2008, Boccard and Rutledge, 2013). Separate
    OPLS-DA models were built for each pair of two successive stages by using a dummy
    variable with a value of 1 assigned to samples that belonged to a specific stage
    and a value of 0 to samples that did not belong to that stage. Spectral data was
    Pareto-scaled and the dummy variables were scaled to unit variance for OPLS-DA.
    The S-line plot combines the modelled covariance and correlation in an OPLS-DA
    model and gives a visual image of the OPLS-DA loadings with high modelling and
    discriminatory power (Wiklund et al., 2008). The OPLS-DA models were constructed
    between each two successive berry development stages. 2.4.3. Regression analysis
    of spectral data (PLS) PLS regression analysis was carried out to construct calibration
    models for predicting the concentrations of organic acids (tartaric acid, malic
    acid, succinic acid), and sugars (glucose and fructose) in berry samples. PLS
    relates two data matrices X (wavenumbers) and Y (HPLC reference data) by a bilinear
    multivariate relationship (Wold et al., 2001). PLS regression analysis is a powerful
    tool for handling data with missing data in both X and Y, noise and collinearity
    between the variables, such as seen with spectroscopic data (Wold et al., 2001).
    The samples for the calibration and test sets were selected using multivariate
    sampling from PCA scores plots of MIR spectra and NIR spectra to get near equal
    representative samples from the four quadrants (Næs, Isaksson, Fearn, & Davies,
    2004). As is evident in Fig. 4, this selection resulted in a test set that covered
    the 5 developmental stages equally well (samples coloured according to stage.
    The 1st derivative Savitzky–Golay NIR spectra from the 2010/11 vintage were used
    to construct NIR calibration models. Due to the relatively small NIR sample size
    (n = 60), the calibrations were subjected to segmented cross-validation (seven
    samples per segment). The MIR calibration models were constructed using raw spectra
    of the combined 2010/11 and 2011/12 seasons (n = 105), using the 1495–947 cm−1
    range as described in Shiroma and Rodriguez-Saona (2009). Calibration and test
    sets were selected on a 2:1 split using multivariate sampling as previously described.
    The MIR calibration sets consisted of 73 samples and the test sets of 32 samples.
    The statistics to evaluate the calibration set were the root mean square error
    of cross validation (RMSECV) to evaluate error in calibration, the root mean square
    error of estimation (RMSEE, Eq. (1); and SSE, Eq. (2)) (Bruker Optik, 2006)) to
    test the predictive accuracy of the calibration models and the coefficient of
    determination for calibration (R2) to evaluate the fit of the models, the root
    mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was used in the cases of test set validation.
    The bias (systematic difference between the estimated and true values) and the
    ratio of prediction to deviation were used to evaluate the predictive ability
    of the models. Calibration models that gave RPD values > 2 were considered good
    for screening, whilst RPD > 3 was considered good for prediction, according to
    the interpretation by Versari, Parpinello, Mattioli, and Galassi (2008). (1) With
    M, the number of calibration samples; R, the rank; and SSE, the Sum of Squared
    Errors. (2) With Res, the residual (the difference between the true and the fitted
    value). 3. Results and discussion The overall aim of this study was to evaluate
    the suitability of FT-NIR and ATR FT-MIR spectroscopy to assess grape berry development
    qualitatively and quantitatively. Within this framework the objective was to develop
    simple, accurate (reliable/reproducible and preferably economical) protocols to
    determine quality-associated metabolites in grape berry samples. 3.1. Grape composition:
    HPLC analysis A summary of the reference data ranges (minimum, maximum and averages
    ± standard deviation) for the different berry developmental stages as determined
    by HPLC is provided in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2. The concentration of
    tartaric acid declined throughout the whole developmental cycle, from green (13.5
    mg/g FW) to pre-véraison (12 mg/g FW), to véraison (10.1 mg/g FW) and plateaued
    at the post-véraison stage (6.6 mg/g FW). The malic acid concentration doubled
    from green (7.7 mg/g FW) to pre-véraison (14.1 mg/g FW), before decreasing from
    véraison to ripe (Supplementary Table 2). Concentrations of succinic acid fluctuated
    within a narrow range (2.9–4.3 mg/g FW) between green and post-véraison samples
    and decreased at the ripe stage (1.3 mg/g FW). Fructose concentration was low
    at the green and pre-véraison stages (0.7–2.3 mg/g FW) and increased at véraison
    (31.3 mg/g FW) before stabilising at the post-véraison and ripe stages (64.3–78.5
    mg/g FW). The trend for glucose was similar to that of fructose. The observed
    sugar and organic acid profiles were consistent with literature reports at green,
    véraison, post-véraison and ripe stages (Ali et al., 2011, Coombe, 1992, Hunter
    et al., 1991). Table 1. Model evaluation statistics for calibration (R2, RMSECV

    of the IR (FT-NIR and ATR FT-MIR) spectral features from grape berry samples For
    each developmental stage, a mean baseline corrected NIR spectrum of the frozen
    samples was generated and the spectra at the five stages are shown in Fig. 1A.
    NIR spectra did not show obvious systematic differences that could be associated
    with the respective berry development stages. The NIR spectrum consists of overtones
    and combination bands of the fundamental vibrations observed in the MIR region
    (Shenk et al., 2008). Prominent NIR absorption peaks were observed at 10217, 8436,
    6978, 5643, and 5614 cm−1 (Fig. 1A). Peak assignment was done in accordance with
    the literature (Nicolaï et al., 2007, Shenk et al., 2008, Shiroma and Rodriguez-Saona,
    2009). Whereas many compounds absorb in the NIR bands highlighted here, contributions
    of the O–H overtone or combination in water were observed at 10217, 6978, 5643
    and 5614 cm−1. The C–H overtone and stretch in sugars and organic acids were observed
    at 8436 and 6978 cm−1 whilst the C–O stretch and overtone in sugars and organic
    acids were ascribed at 6978, 5643 and 5614 cm−1. Download : Download high-res

    correspond to the absorptions of water (3254 and 1607 cm−1) and fingerprint region
    (insert, 1495–947 cm−1). Wavenumber assignment is as described in the text. The
    colours represent different developmental stages: green (), pre-véraison (), véraison
    (), post-véraison () and ripe (). (For interpretation of the references to colour

    MIR spectra for both fresh and frozen berries were highly reproducible and had
    a distinct region of systematic variation related to developmental stage observed
    at 1495–947 cm−1 (Fig. 1B). The region of systematic variation (Fig. 1B, insert)
    was called the fingerprint region as previously reported by Shiroma & Rodriguez-Saona,
    2009 and is known to be associated with C–O and C–C stretches in sugars, esters
    and organic acids amongst other compounds. Further band assignment was done according
    to literature as follows: 3300–3200 and 1710–1590 cm−1 corresponding to the O–H
    stretch in water with prominent peaks observed at 3254 and 1607 cm−1; 1480–1390,
    1420–1320 and 1150–1060 cm−1 ascribed to C–H, O–H and C–O functional groups, respectively
    in organic acids; 1100–950 cm−1 due to the contribution of the C–O stretch related
    to carbohydrates with the most intense bands located at 1061 and 1033 cm−1 emanating
    from fructose and glucose respectively (Kelly et al., 2004; Moreira & Santos,
    2004; Shiroma & Rodriguez-Saona, 2009). The MIR spectra for fresh grape berries
    were visually very similar to the frozen samples when assessed at the same stage
    of development (data not shown). 3.3. Multivariate data analysis of IR spectral
    data from grape berries/samples 3.3.1. PCA For preliminary examination of both
    NIR and MIR spectra, PCA was performed to examine time-related changes that occurred
    during grape berry development. Scores plots from baseline corrected NIR spectra
    revealed no clear groupings according to developmental stage (Fig. 2A). Application
    of spectral filters Savitzky–Golay 1st derivative, SNV, MSC and OSC did not improve
    the stage discrimination as illustrated by the PCA scores plot of the Savitzky–Golay
    1st derivative spectra in Fig. 2B. Download : Download high-res image (303KB)

    (), véraison (), post-véraison () and ripe (). (For interpretation of the references
    to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
    this article.) PCA scores plots obtained from ATR FT-MIR spectra of frozen samples
    (Fig. 2C) showed a discernible pattern of increasing berry ripeness along PC 1.
    Pre-véraison samples co-clustered with green samples and post-véraison samples
    co-clustered with ripe samples. Examination of the PCA scores plot generated from
    fresh berries showed very well-defined sample clusters for each of the four stages
    tested as similar clustering patterns to those observed with frozen berries were
    observed on fresh berries with increasing ripeness across PC 1 (Fig. 2D). 3.3.2.
    OPLS-DA Using frozen samples only, OPLS-DA was capable of discriminating between
    any two successive stages of berry development with NIR spectroscopy (Supplementary
    Fig. 3). Interestingly, both reference datasets (Supplementary Fig. 2) and MIR
    (Supplementary Fig. 4) could discriminate between all the stages, except post-véraison
    and ripe (Fig. 3A–C). This observation showed that despite its simplified approach,
    IR spectroscopy is a powerful tool that can provide results than can be used to
    define berry growth and development without extensive sample preparation. Download

    OPLS-DA scores plots for post-véraison ()/ripe () with HPLC reference data (A),
    NIR baseline corrected spectra (B), and MIR spectra (C). The S-line plot (véraison/post
    véraison)-(D) showed the wavenumbers responsible for between stage discrimination
    (1104–1032 cm−1) in the MIR region. Despite similar ripening trajectories being
    observed on fresh and frozen samples by MIR, fresh berries showed more discrete
    clusters. Cold storage potentially causes structural and chemical changes in grapes
    as they undergo additional chemical changes from frozen to thawed states (Cozzolino
    et al., 2005). The purported structural and chemical distortions taking place
    between freezing and thawing were not apparent on the spectra and the nature or
    extent of such chemical changes was beyond the scope of this study. The ability
    to successfully discriminate the different developmental stages by both PCA and
    OPLS-DA using IR spectra could be taken as indicators that there are significant
    differences between stages that FT-NIR and ATR FT-MIR spectroscopy are both capable
    of elucidating. Furthermore, from pairwise OPLS-DA the S-line plot identified
    the MIR wavenumbers responsible for between stage discrimination and narrowed
    them to 1104–1032 cm−1 (Fig. 3C and D). These were the same wavenumbers associated
    with absorbance of molecules such as the C–O, O–H and C–C bond stretches of phenolics,
    organic acids and sugars as interpreted by Moreira and Santos (2004) and Shiroma
    and Rodriguez-Saona (2009). 3.3.3. PLS regression models The best NIR calibration
    models were developed using the 15 point Savitzky–Golay 1st derivative. NIR spectra
    were used for developing preliminary models only and additional work would be
    carried out to get more robust models. For MIR calibrations, the best models were
    constructed from the fingerprint region the region. The MIR calibration models
    for tartaric acid, malic acid, glucose and fructose are shown in Fig. 4. Download

    PLS regression models from MIR spectra for tartaric acid (A), malic acid (B),
    glucose (C), glucose + fructose (D) showing the development stages: green (),
    pre-véraison (), véraison (), post-véraison () and ripe (). (For interpretation
    of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) The statistical indicators for model fitness showed
    that both NIR and MIR spectra yielded relatively accurate calibration models.
    When compared to NIR models, the MIR models were more accurate (Table 1). R2 values
    were high for organic acids (>0.81 for malic and tartaric acids) and sugars (>0.98
    for fructose and glucose). RMSEP was 1.2 mg/g FW for organic acids, and 4.7 mg/g
    FW for sugars. RPD values were >3.0 for tartaric acid and >7.0 for glucose and
    fructose (Table 1). FT-NIR has been used to evaluate ripening of Sangiovese grapes
    and the authors reported high coefficients of determination for sugars (R2 = 0.92)
    and lower coefficients of determination for organic acids (R2 = 0.47) (Barnaba,
    Bellincontro, & Mencarelli, 2014). Similarly, ATR FT-MIR has been used to determine
    phenolics and tannins in grape berries and high coefficients of determination
    (R2 > 0.95) with high RPDs (>2.9) reported (Fragoso et al., 2011). The PLS model
    for fructose slightly deteriorated at green and pre-véraison stages. At these
    stages the fructose concentrations between 0.2 and 8.4 mg/g FW were generally
    below 0.3 mg/g FW at green and deviation exceeded 10% in some cases. The limit
    of quantitation provided by the reference method for fructose was 0.1 mg/g FW
    (RID) and 0.3 mg/g FW (DAD). FTIR spectroscopy is known to be insensitive to concentration
    levels below 200 ppm (0.2 mg/g) (Bauer et al., 2008). Thus at the green stage
    the deviations between the reference and predicted values were generally >10%
    as the sensitivity of the method edged towards its limits. However the prediction
    was very good at véraison, post-véraison and ripe stages with sugar levels >25
    mg/g FW (deviation < 10%). To explore the possibility of generating better prediction
    models for sugars, sectional calibration models were developed for glucose and
    fructose at green and pre-véraison stages on the one hand, and, véraison, post-véraison
    stages on the other, but this did not improve the model prediction (data not shown).
    This observation showed that the model could not be relied on to predict fructose
    at concentrations below 0.3 mg/g FW. However when glucose and fructose were calibrated
    together the prediction improved significantly at green and pre-véraison stages
    (prediction error < 10%) and from véraison to ripe the prediction error dropped
    to less than 7%. The sugar concentrations at post-véraison and ripe matched the
    values reported in the literature. Barnaba et al. (2014) reported 105.9 and 113.0
    mg/g FW for ripe Sangiovese grapes and González-Caballero et al. (2010) reported
    221.7 mg/g for reducing sugars in ripe berries from white and red cultivars whilst
    Fernández-Novales, López, Sánchez, Morales, and González-Caballero (2009) reported
    fructose concentrations of 136.1 mg/g in ripe red/white grapes. For malic and
    tartaric acids, prediction was quite good across the entire growth curve with
    prediction error from the reference data hardly ever exceeding 10%. The concentrations
    of tartaric and malic acids at post-véraison ripe grapes were in the same ranges
    as reported by González-Caballero et al. (2010) when they assessed the quality
    of ripening and ripe white and red grapes (tartaric acid: 6.0–12.2 mg/g, malic
    acid: 0.3–2.0 mg/g). Barnaba et al. (2014) reported similar organic acid concentrations
    in ripening Sangiovese grapes (tartaric acid: 7.3 mg/g, tartaric acid: 1.5 mg/g).
    Succinic acid (RPD < 1.6 and R2 < 0.75) though generally well predicted had the
    widest deviation range (6–32%). The fact that a relatively low abundance metabolite
    like succinic acid could be accurately predicted in over 70% of the cases showed
    that the results obtained here offer a promising starting point for the development
    of quantitative assessment techniques applicable to some of the less abundant
    grape berry metabolites. MIR was shown to be better suited for both qualitative
    and quantitative applications. This is most likely due to the fact that the fundamental
    vibrational absorption bands in MIR are better resolved and show better specificity
    and reproducibility than the combination and overtone bands of the NIR (Kelly
    et al., 2004). An additional advantage of the ATR FT-MIR spectroscopic method
    is the temperature controlled ATR crystal that reduces potential variation by
    maintaining constant sample temperature (Smyth & Cozzolino, 2011). 3.3.4. Prediction
    of metabolite concentrations The ultimate objective for constructing PLS regression
    models was to construct models that could be used to predict sugars and organic
    acid concentrations in grape berry samples during the entire growth cycle. It
    was observed that the predicted values for both the frozen and fresh samples were
    very close to those presented by the reference data with general deviation between
    reference and predicted values well below 10% (Table 1 and Supplementary Table
    3). Interestingly even succinic acid, which had the lowest R2 and RPD values,
    was well predicted for most of the samples. To evaluate the accuracy of the models,
    14 independent frozen samples with known reference values were tested. The prediction
    error of the predicted concentrations versus the analytical reference values ranged
    between 1.3% and 8.4% for all metabolites. Using the predicted results from the
    models it was observed that organic acid concentrations were highest at green
    and pre-véraison stages and gradually declined to a steady-state after véraison.
    Sugar concentrations were lowest at green and pre-véraison stages, but exponentially
    increased till the véraison stage. Sugar concentrations typically plateaued at
    the post-véraison stage remaining relatively constant till the ripe stage (Fig.
    5 and Supplementary Table 3). The predicted metabolite profiles were in agreement
    with the reported developmental profiles/trends of these metabolites in grape
    berries (Swanepoel, Du Toit, & Nieuwoudt, 2007; Topalovic & Mikulic-Petkovsek,
    2010). A diagrammatic depiction of grape berry metabolite growth curve based on
    averaged predicted values as well as the reference values is shown in Fig. 5.
    It is important to note that the objective was not to present a new calibration
    model, but rather cross-compare the model we could generate with the reference
    data to show “proof-of-principle” to embark on developing robust calibration models
    that could potentially complement/“replace” HPLC. Download : Download high-res

    represent curves constructed from predicted data. 4. Conclusion Classification
    of grape berries according to their respective developmental stage was possible
    using ATR FT-MIR. Interestingly the ATR FT-MIR spectra from fresh homogenised
    grape berry samples resulted in better developmental stage discrimination (by
    stage comparison) than the spectra from frozen homogenized samples using PCA,
    and the quantitative analytical reference data (HPLC). Although overall developmental
    progression between the respective stages were observable with MIR spectra (using
    PCA and OPLS-DA) and NIR spectra (using OPLS-DA); stage discrimination at the
    post-véraison/ripe stages was only possible with NIR spectra. Needless to say,
    the difficulty in separating the latter two stages highlights the rather obvious
    fact that changes during grape berry development involves more than a few selected
    compounds (e.g. sugars and organic acids). The measurement of additional contributing
    quality-associated metabolites such as the terpenoids (e.g. monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes
    and carotenoids) or phenolics (e.g. flavonols, anthocyanins, and tannins) will
    foreseeably improve the discrimination in the later developmental stages (Fragoso
    et al., 2011). It is evident that non-targeted analytical methods, such as IR
    spectroscopy, provide additional information for stage-specific discrimination.
    The identification of the compounds underlying this discrimination in the closely
    related stages will provide interesting information on berry development. Results
    for the OPLS-DA and S-line plot showed that the sugar/organic acid absorption
    band was key to between-stage variation. Grape berry composition is an objective
    indicator of the largely subjective concept of grape quality. The IR and MVDA
    technique described provide a fast method for the relatively high throughput qualitative
    and quantitative analysis of berry samples, without the need for metabolite extraction/purification.
    Both FT-NIR and ATR FT-MIR spectroscopy are demonstrated to be versatile techniques
    for qualitative and quantitative determination of the sugar and organic acids
    in grape berries. The approaches provide a powerful way to rapidly extract qualitative
    and quantitative information emanating from multiple spectral variables. Competing

    efficiency of spectrum acquisition and causes random errors in the process (Musingarabwi
    et al., 2016). In the acquisition process of FTIR-PAS and NIR spectroscopy, there
    is no need to pre-treat samples, the acquisition speed is faster, and the work
    efficiency is higher, but the number of samples required by PAS is less than that
    of NIR spectroscopy, which has more advantages in the application of large-scale

    of IEEE Publication Principles  After careful consideration by a duly constituted
    committee, an author of this article, Hamid Reza Karimi, was found to have acted
    in violation of the IEEE Principles of Ethical Publishing by artificially inflating
    the number of citations to this article. This paper addresses the problem of sliding
    mode control (SMC) for a type of uncertain time-delay nonlinear descriptor systems
    represented by T-S fuzzy models. One crucial contributing factor is to put forward
    a novel integral fuzzy switching manifold involved with time delay. Compared with
    previous results, the key benefit of the new manifold is that the input matrices
    via different subsystems are permitted to be diverse, and thus much more applicability
    will be achieved. By resorting to Frobenius'' theorem and double orthogonal complement,
    the existence condition of the fuzzy manifold is presented. The admissibility
    conditions of sliding motion with a strictly dissipative performance are further
    provided. Then, the desired fuzzy SMC controller is synthesized by analyzing the
    reachability of the manifold. Moreover, an adaptive fuzzy SMC controller is also
    proposed to adapt the input saturation and the matched uncertainty with unknown
    upper bounds. The feasibility and virtue of our theoretical findings are demonstrated
    by a fuzzy SMC controller implementation for a practical system about the pendulum.

    SECTION I. Introduction Descriptor systems, also known as singular systems or
    semistate systems, can naturally depict a variety of practical systems, including
    circuits systems, power systems, and economic systems [1]. Except for the finite
    dynamic modes existed in state-space systems, the descriptor systems also contain
    impulse modes and nondynamic modes, which make their analysis more complicated
    [2]. Due to their tighter expressions for representing actual independent parametric
    perturbation, descriptor systems have been adopted to design controllers and filters
    in various areas of research for theoretical development as well as for real applications
    (see [3]–[8]). It is worth mentioning that due to the difficulties in constructing
    appropriate Lyapunov functions and the high complexity in analyzing the existence
    and uniqueness of the solution, most of the existing theoretical results are only
    applicable to linear descriptor models, while most practical descriptor systems
    are highly complicated. A feasible idea to overcome this issue is to represent
    a highly nonlinear descriptor system by the T–S fuzzy descriptor model, which
    is composed of a group of linear descriptor submodels [9]. In this case, a highly
    nonlinear descriptor system can be analyzed by well-established linear descriptor
    system theory. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the T–S fuzzy descriptor model
    can effectively reduce the number of linear models in comparison with fuzzy model
    based on state-expression [10]–[19]. In view of these significant advantages,
    many researchers have been devoted to research on fuzzy descriptor systems (see
    [20]–[25]). For instance, Lin et al. [20] studied a class of time-delay fuzzy
    descriptor systems, and stability/stabilization conditions were offered by resorting
    to Lyapunov function. The problem about nonfragile stabilization with guaranteed
    cost performance was investigated in [22] for a type of uncertain nonlinear delayed
    descriptor systems depicted by T–S fuzzy models, and the desired fuzzy feedback
    controller was designed via parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. In
    [25], a systematic way to generalize the controller design for discrete-time T–S
    fuzzy descriptor models was provided by using delayed Lyapunov functions, and
    the well-known Finsler’s lemma was used to avoid the explicit substitution of
    the closed-loop dynamics. Sliding mode control (SMC) is well recognized as a famous
    nonlinear control strategy, which contains a variety of prominent superiorities
    such as fast responses and strong robustness [26]–[33]. Specially, it can compensate
    the matched uncertainty completely in case that the closed-loop system is driven
    into the sliding mode phase. During the past few decades, considerable research
    efforts have been devoted to SMC of descriptor systems. For instance, the problem
    of SMC with passivity of singular time-delay systems was studied in [34], where
    normal/adaptive SMC controllers were constructed to keep the system states onto
    the designed switching manifold within a limited time period. Ding et al. [35]
    considered the SMC problem of singular systems by designing a sliding mode controller
    such that the nonlinear singular system was exponentially stable and its trajectory
    can be forced into the prespecified sliding manifold in a limited time. It is
    noted that, however, these results are only applicable to descriptor linear models.
    From a practical point of view, it makes more sense to develop an appropriate
    SMC methodology for highly nonlinear descriptor systems, which can compensate
    the matched uncertainty effectively. Unfortunately, due to the difficulty in analysis,
    very few related results have been reported in this research area. As an alternative
    way, the development of SMC technique for fuzzy-model-based descriptor systems
    is feasible since the relatively mature theory for linear descriptor model can
    be used during sliding motion analysis. To date, a few results related to this
    topic have been reported in the literature. In [36], the fuzzy SMC design for
    a class of fuzzy-model-based descriptor models with state delay was investigated
    by resorting to an integral-type manifold function, and a suitable SMC controller
    was synthesized to force the states of the controlled system into the fuzzy manifold
    in a limited time. Based on the similar integral switching manifold, the fuzzy
    SMC design with dissipativity was further investigated in [37] for a type of time-delay
    T–S fuzzy singular systems, and a SMC law was proposed to guarantee the reachability
    of desired sliding motion. It should be pointed out there is an obvious limitation
    to the existing results on SMC of fuzzy descriptor systems for the reason that
    they rely on an assumption that all linear local models share a common input matrix,
    which seriously restricts their practical applications. For example, the well-known
    inverted pendulum system cannot meet this requirement. As such, we are motivated
    to put forward a new fuzzy SMC strategy that is free of the restrictive requirement,
    which is the main purpose for this paper. In this paper, we focus on the fuzzy
    SMC design for continuous-time fuzzy-model-based nonlinear descriptor systems
    with time-varying delay. To better adapt the model characteristics and circumvent
    the restrictive condition imposed on input matrices, an appropriate integral-type
    fuzzy switching manifold with time delay is designed, which is the crucial contribution
    of this paper. By resorting to Frobenius’ theorem and double orthogonal complement,
    the existence condition of the fuzzy manifold is presented. New conditions to
    guarantee the asymptotic admissibility of corresponding sliding motion are further
    established. By designing a suitable fuzzy SMC controller, the reachability of
    the sliding motion is guaranteed in the presence of matched uncertainty and disturbance
    signal. An adaptive fuzzy SMC controller is also proposed to adapt the matched
    uncertainty with unknown upper bounds and input saturation. There are several
    important features of the developed result that are worth mentioning. Input matrices
    via different subsystems are permitted to be diverse. Matched uncertainty is fully
    rejected and the disturbance signal is not enlarged in sliding mode phase. Input
    saturation is also considered since it often occurs in practical applications.
    Finally, the inverted pendulum system is adopted to verify the applicability and
    virtue of our theoretical findings. The remainder of this paper is structured
    as follows. Problems formulation and preliminaries are clarified in Section II.
    Details of fuzzy switching manifold and analysis of sliding motion are given in
    Section III. The problem of fuzzy SMC controller design is formulated in Section
    IV. Numerical example illustrating the applicability and virtue of the achieved
    fuzzy SMC methodology are offered in Section V. Section VI finally gives some

    the given matrix Q x ∈ R n×m with rank ( Q x )=l≤m , suppose that Q ¯ x ∈ R n×l
    is a full-column rank matrix formed by any l independent columns of Q x . If the

    /∂x)= T x Q T x , with T x ∈ R m×m being a nonsingular matrix. Proof:From Frobenius’
    theorem [39], since Δ x is involutive, there exist l independent functions g ¯
    i (x) such that [(∂ g ¯ x,p )/∂x] Q ¯ ⊥ x,q =0 , ∀1≤i≤l . Let [(∂ g ¯ x )/∂x]≜
    G ¯ x . Then, the equation span { G ¯ T x,p }=(span{ Q ¯ ⊥ x,p } ) ⊥ holds since
    the columns of G ¯ T x is full rank. The above equation is equivalent to span
    { G ¯ T x,p }=span{ Q ¯ x,p } by double orthogonal complement [40]. Therefore,
    the columns about matrices G ¯ T x and Q ¯ x constitute the bases for the same
    subspace, and G ¯ x = T ¯ x Q ¯ T x , with T ¯ T (x)∈ R l×l being the their transformation
    matrix. Since the matrices Q x and Q ¯ x are belong to the same subspace, there
    exists an invertable matrix T x ∈ R m×m such that T x Q T x =[ T ¯ x Q ¯ T x 0

    and Sliding Motion Analysis During this section, a new integral fuzzy switching
    manifold with time-varying delay will be designed and dissipativity-based admissibility
    conditions will be presented for sliding motion. For SMC design, the first important
    issue to be addressed is to propose a suitable switching manifold. For a descriptor
    system, the integral switching manifold containing the singular matrix is the
    most popular choice, which can avoid the difficulties yielded from singular matrix
    in deriving the sliding motion subsequently. In [36] and [37], the conventional
    integral switching manifolds proposed in [34] and [35] were extended to investigate
    the SMC design for fuzzy descriptor models. However, these results require that
    all the local input matrices B i are the same, which seriously restrict their
    practical applications. To better adapt the fuzzy descriptor models and remove
    the restrictive requirement, in this paper, we propose a distinguished interval
    fuzzy switching manifold as s(t)=  ∫ t 0 G x Edx− ∫ t 0 [ G x ∑ i=1 r μ i (ϑ(α))
    ∑ j=1 r μ j (ϑ(α))×( A i x(α)  + B i K j x(α)+ A di x(α−d(α)))]dα (7) View Source
    where G x = T x B T x with T x ∈ R m×m being nonsingular, ∑ r j=1 μ j (ϑ(t)) K
    j x(t) is used to stabilize the sliding motion and K j ∈ R m×n being the design
    parameters. Based on s ˙ (t)=0 , the corresponding fuzzy controller will be obtained
    as u eq (t)=  − ( G x B x ) −1 G x ∑ i=1 r μ i (ϑ(t)) B wi w(t) + ∑ j=1 r μ j
    (ϑ(t)) K j x(t)− f m (x(t),x(t−d(t))). (8) View Source Combined (8) with (4),

    x(t−d(t))+ G ¯ x B wi w(t)] y(t)= ∑ r i=1 μ i (ϑ(t))[ C i x(t)+ C di x(t−d(t))+
    D wi w(t)] (9) View Source with G ¯ x =I− B x ( G x B x ) −1 G x being the transition
    matrix for external disturbance signal. Remark 1:To adapt the features of fuzzy
    descriptor models, a distinguished interval fuzzy switching manifold (7) is designed
    by involving the singular and projection matrices simultaneously. The precondition
    for the establishment of the fuzzy manifold lies in the existence of the nonlinear
    vector function g x ∈ R m×1 satisfying ∂ g x /∂x= G x E . Assume that rank ( E
    T B x )=l and B ¯ x ∈ R n×l is a full column rank matrix composed of any l independent
    columns of E T B(x) . Then, by resorting to Lemma 1, the requirement can be satisfied
    if the distribution span { B ¯ ⊥ p } , p=1,2,…,n−l is involutive, with B ¯ ⊥ p
    representing the p th column about B ¯ ⊥ . In comparison with the previous manifolds
    adopted in [36] and [37], a significant advantage of our manifold is that the
    input matrices B i via different subsystems are permitted to be diverse. Moreover,
    it can be seen from (9) and Lemma 2 that the matched uncertainty is fully rejected
    and the disturbance signal is not enlarged during corresponding sliding motion.
    The following theorem is presented to ensure the asymptotic admissibility with
    (Z,Y,X)−γ -dissipative performance for sliding motion (9). Theorem 1:Given prespecified
    parameters μ>0 and γ>0 , symmetric matrices 0≥Z∈ R p×p and X∈ R q×q , and matrix

    we have A T 22i P ¯ 22 + P ¯ T 22 A 22i <0 , which implies A 22i is nonsingular
    and thus the pairs (E, A i ) are regular and impulse free. Therefore, fuzzy system
    (9) is admissible by virtue of Definition 1. In the following, we shall show system

    we shall construct a PDC-based fuzzy SMC controller to force the states of fuzzy
    descriptor system (4) onto the proposed fuzzy switching manifold (7) in the presence
    of matched uncertainty and disturbance signal. Moreover, an adaptive SMC controller
    is also provided to deal with the input saturation and uncertainty with unknown
    upper bounds. For fuzzy descriptor system (4), the fuzzy SMC controller for rule
    j is designed as Model Rule j : IF \vartheta _{1} (t) is \pi _{j1} and \cdots
    \vartheta _{p} (t) is \pi _{jp} , THEN \begin{equation} u(t)=K_{j} x(t)-\rho (t)\left
    ({{\it {\mathcal G}}_{x} {\it {\mathcal B}}_{x} }\right)^{-1} \frac {s(t)}{\left
    \|{ s(t)}\right \| }. \end{equation} View Source Thus, the overall fuzzy SMC controller
    is referred as \begin{equation} u(t)=\sum _{j=1}^{r}\mu _{j} \left ({\vartheta
    (t)}\right) K_{j} x(t)-\rho (t)\left ({{\it {\mathcal G}}_{x} {\it {\mathcal B}}_{x}
    }\right)^{-1} \frac {s(t)}{\left \|{ s(t)}\right \| } \end{equation} View Source
    where \begin{align*} \rho (t)=&~{\delta +\kappa _{1} \left \|{ {\it {\mathcal
    G}}_{x} {\it {\mathcal B}}_{x} }\right \| \left \|{ x(t)}\right \| +\kappa _{2}
    \left \|{ {\it {\mathcal G}}_{x} {\it {\mathcal B}}_{x} }\right \| \left \|{ x\left

    _{i} (\vartheta (t)) B_{wi} , and \delta >0 is a small scalar. Theorem 3:Consider
    the uncertain fuzzy descriptor system (4). Assume that the fuzzy switching manifold
    is given by (7) and conditions in Theorem 2 are feasible. Then, under the fuzzy
    SMC controller (24), the states of closed-loop system (4) can be forced onto the
    proposed fuzzy switching manifold s(t)=0 in spite of matched uncertainty and disturbance
    signal. Proof:Define a regular Lyapunov function as \begin{equation} V(t)=\frac
    {1}{2} s^{\mathrm{ T}} (t)s(t). \end{equation} View Source Taking the derivative
    of switching manifold (7) yields\begin{align} {\dot {s}(t)}=&~{\it {\mathcal G}}_{x}
    \sum _{i=1}^{r}\mu _{i} \left ({\vartheta (t)}\right) \sum _{j=1}^{r}\mu _{j}
    \left ({\vartheta (t)}\right)\notag \\&\times \left [{-B_{i} K_{j} x(t) +B_{i}
    \left ({u(t)+f_{m} \left ({x(t),x\left ({t-d(t)}\right)}\right)}\right)+B_{wi}

    \notag \\&\times \left \|{ {\it {\mathcal G}}_{x} B_{wi} }\right \| \left \|{
    w(t)}\right \| +s^{\mathrm{ T}} (t){\mathcal G}_{x} {\mathcal B}_{x} u(t)\notag
    \\&-\,\,{s^{\mathrm{ T}} (t){\mathcal G}}_{x} {\mathcal B}_{x} \sum _{j=1}^{r}\mu
    _{j} \left ({\vartheta (t)}\right) K_{j} x(t). \end{align} View Source Substituting
    (24) into (27), the following inequality holds:\begin{equation} \dot {V}(t)\le
    -\delta \left \|{ s(t)}\right \| \le 0 \end{equation} View Source which implies
    that \dot {V}(t)< 0 for all s(t)\ne 0 . By resorting to Barbalat’s lemma, the
    states of closed-loop system (4) will be forced onto the proposed fuzzy manifold
    s(t)=0 in presence of matched uncertainty and disturbance signal. The proof is
    completed. Remark 2:By analyzing the reachability of sliding motion, a fuzzy SMC
    controller is developed in (24). Since it is discontinuous due to the existence
    of term {s(t)/ \| s(t)\| } , solutions of the fuzzy descriptor system are understood
    in a Filippov [43] sense. Compared with previous results [36], [37], the key advantage
    of the developed fuzzy SMC controller is that the very restrictive requirement
    imposed on local input matrices has been removed, which is benefited from the
    new fuzzy manifold (7). Thus, the applicability has been significantly improved.
    Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the achieved fuzzy SMC strategy can be further
    extended to descriptor systems with state dependent uncertainties [44] and fuzzy
    Markovian jump descriptor models with incomplete transition rates [45], which
    is a topic worthy of future research. The unknown vector f_{m} (x(t),x(t-d(t)))
    may represent the unmodeled dynamics and increased bias force of a physical system,
    whose upper bounds are often unavailable. In addition, input saturation, which
    arises as a manifestation of the physical limitations of the control capacity,
    is unavoidable in most actuators and in enforced at all time. In the next, an
    adaptive SMC controller will be provided to ensure the reaching condition of sliding
    motion in the presence of input saturation and unknown upper bounds of uncertainty.
    Consider the fuzzy descriptor system (4) with input saturation\begin{align} {E\dot
    {x}(t)}=&~\sum _{i=1}^{r}\mu _{i} \left ({\vartheta (t)}\right)\Biggl [{\vphantom

    {sat}(u_{1})} & {\mathrm {sat}(u_{2})} & {\cdots } & {\mathrm {sat}(u_{m})} \end{array}}\right]^{\mathrm{

    be expressed as \begin{equation} {\mathrm{ sat}}(u)=\chi \left ({u(t)}\right)\cdot
    u(t) \end{equation} View Source where \chi (u(t))={\mathrm{ diag}}\{\chi _{1}
    (u(t)),\ldots,\chi _{m} (u(t))\} with \chi _{l} (u(t))\in [{0,1}] being the indicator
    for the saturation degree of the l th entry of the control vector. According to
    density property of a real number, there exists a scalar \sigma satisfying \begin{equation}
    0< \sigma \le \min \left ({\chi _{l} \left ({u(t)}\right)}\right)\le 1. \end{equation}

    \end{align} View Source which implies the system states can be forced onto the
    prespecified manifold s(t)=0 in the presence of matched uncertainty and disturbance
    signal. This completes the proof. Remark 3:An adaptive fuzzy SMC controller is
    further developed in (32), where the update laws are used to deal with input saturation
    and unknown upper bounds of matched uncertainty. It is worth mentioning that very
    few literatures have been published on SMC controller design for descriptor systems
    in the presence of input saturation. According to (38), all of the signals are
    bounded, and thus, u(t) is bounded, which implies the existence of \sigma since
    \chi _{l} (u(t)) will not converge to zero. Therefore, assumption (31) is reasonable.
    Also, it is clear from (30), (31), and (38) that the larger the u_{Ml} is, the
    bigger the \sigma becomes, and thus, the higher the converge rate of the state
    variables is. Remark 4:As in the existing results about SMC, the main drawback
    of the sliding mode controllers proposed in (24) and (32) is that they are discontinuous
    when crossing the fuzzy sliding manifold, which will cause control chattering
    involving high frequency dynamics. One common way to alleviate this issue is to
    replace the discontinuous term {s(t)/\| s(t)\| } by smooth term {s(t)/ (\| s(t)\|
    +\bar {\alpha })} , where \bar {\alpha } is a small positive parameter. As a result,
    the fuzzy manifold will not converge to zero accurately but vary within a small
    range. SECTION V. Simulation Example During this section, an inverted pendulum
    system will be adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness and virtue the of proposed
    fuzzy SMC scheme (see Fig. 1). The whole physical system is given by \begin{align}
    \begin{cases} {\dot {x}_{1} (t)=x_{2} (t)} \\ {\left [{(M+m)\left ({J+ml^{2} }\right)-m^{2}

    kg represents the mass for pendulum and the cart, respectively. J={ml^{2}/3} denotes
    moment of inertia. Fig. 1. Schematic of the inverted pendulum system. Show All
    It is assumed there are perturbed time delay terms in the system along values
    of the scalar \lambda \in [{0,1}] . By taking the matched uncertainty and disturbance

    fuzzy descriptor model are not the same. Thus, the fuzzy SMC approaches developed
    in [36] and [37] cannot be applicable in this situation. By contrast, benefited
    from the novel fuzzy manifold (7), the developed fuzzy SMC approach in this paper
    is not limited by this restriction. In this paper, we choose \lambda =0.9 , {\it
    {\mathcal Z}}=-1.5 , {\it {\mathcal Y}}=1.5 , {\it {\mathcal X}}=1.5 , \mu =1.0
    , and \gamma =0.5 . By solving the conditions in Theorem 2, and by (22), we obtain

    Source First, we make a comparison of the proposed SMC methodology with the conventional
    PDC-based fuzzy controller u_{n} (t) , which is formulated as \begin{equation}
    u_{n} (t)=\sum _{j=1}^{2}\mu _{j} \left ({x_{1} (t)}\right) K_{j} x(t). \end{equation}
    View Source Suppose the initial state x(0)\in \left [{\begin{array}{ccc} {0.5236}
    & {0} & {l/ 2} \end{array}}\right] , and the tuning scalars \delta =0.4 and \bar
    {\alpha }=0.01 . First, we assume that the matched uncertainty is small (m_{u}
    =3 ). In this case, the simulation results under the controllers formulated in
    (43) and (42) are depicted in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. From the figures, we
    can observe that both conventional fuzzy controller (43) and fuzzy SMC controller
    (42) can tolerate the small matched uncertainty. Second, we consider the case
    of the big matched uncertainty (m_{u} =10 ). Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate the simulation
    results for system (40) under controllers in (43) and (42), respectively. We can
    see from Fig. 4 that, despite the huge control efforts, the conventional fuzzy
    controller (43) cannot stabilize the closed-loop fuzzy descriptor system (40)
    in the presence of big matched uncertainty. While applying the fuzzy SMC controller
    (42), the system can be stabilized successfully, which verifies the advantage
    of the proposed control strategy. The reason lies in that the discontinuous part
    of fuzzy SMC law can drive the whole system toward a sliding motion that the matched
    uncertainty is completely rejected. Moreover, benefited from the introduction
    of the small scalar \bar {\alpha } into (42), the chattering is very small during
    the period of response. Fig. 2. Responses of system with small matched uncertainty

    Finally, we shall further show the effectiveness of proposed adaptive fuzzy SMC
    law in the presence of unknown upper bounds of matched uncertainty and input saturation.
    In this example, the adaptive SMC law (32) is given as \begin{equation} u(t)=-\rho

    upper bounds of f_{m} (x(t),x(t-d(t))) are unknown and the input are constrained
    by |u(t)|\le 9N . Given the design parameters p_{1} =p_{2} =1.1 , \nu =1.2 , and
    the initial set \hat {\kappa }_{1} (0)=\hat {\kappa }_{2} (0)=1.0 , and \hat {\sigma
    }(0)=0.5 , the simulation results under adaptive fuzzy SMC controller (44) are
    provided in Figs. 6 and 7, which show that the designed adaptive SMC controller
    can achieve asymptotic stability of the system despite unknown upper bounds of
    matched uncertainty and input saturation. Fig. 6. System responses under adaptive

    the fuzzy SMC design problem has been addressed for a type of uncertain fuzzy-model-based
    nonlinear descriptor systems with time-varying delay. A suitable integral fuzzy
    switching manifold with time delay has been proposed to adapt the system features.
    Criteria have been provided to ensure the asymptotic admissibility of sliding
    motion satisfying dissipative performance. A fuzzy SMC controller has been constructed
    to assure reaching condition. A modified adaptive fuzzy SMC controller has also
    been developed to adapt input saturation and matched uncertainty with unknown
    upper bounds. The applicability and virtue of our theoretical findings have been
    illustrated by numerical simulations for an inverted pendulum system. Authors

    \ range of wireless communication technologies. Low\nPower Consumption Embedded\
    \ Devices (LPCED), such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless\nSensor Networks,\
    \ make it possible to work over great distances at a reduced cost but with limited\n\
    transferable data volumes. However, data management (DM) in intelligent agriculture\
    \ is still not well\nunderstood due to the fact that there are not enough scientiﬁc\
    \ publications available on this. Though\ndata management (DM) beneﬁts are factual\
    \ and substantial, many challenges must be addressed in\norder to fully realize\
    \ the DM’s potential. The main difﬁculties are data integration complexities,\
    \ the\nlack of skilled personnel and sufﬁcient resources, inadequate infrastructure,\
    \ and insigniﬁcant data\nwarehouse architecture. This work proposes a comprehensive\
    \ architecture that includes big data\ntechnologies, IoT components, and knowledge-based\

    \ solution is built on a\npre-deﬁned big data architecture that includes an abstraction\
    \ layer of the data lake that handles data\nquality, following a data migration\
    \ strategy in order to ensure the data’s insights.\nKeywords: smart farming; Low\

    1. Introduction\nThe term “agriculture 4.0” was coined by analogy to the buzzword\
    \ “industry 4.0”.\nThe main features involved in the Industrial Revolution were\
    \ technological, socioeconomic,\nand cultural. In the 1880s, it was transformed\
    \ with the help of steam engines, which was\nindustry 1.0. The introduction of\
    \ electricity on assembly lines corresponds to industry 2.0.\nThe third phase\
    \ of the industrial transformation is characterized by informatics and the\nautomation\
    \ of processes on assembly lines. Industry 4.0 brings together the latest changes\n\
    made thanks to digital technology and the possibility of interacting and communicating\n\
    with different equipment. Agriculture has undergone the same changes [1,2].\n\
    Today all machine tools and the entire production chain environment can transmit\n\
    real-time information on their condition and performance. This information, centralized\
    \ in\nthe factory, makes it possible to control the various machines, considering\
    \ the other devices’\nconditions. In this way, it is possible to automate and\
    \ robotize a complete production\nchain comprising robots working on the same\
    \ product simultaneously and in a coordinated\nmanner, which saves time and, therefore,\
    \ increases productivity [3].\nAgriculture has encountered the same transformations\
    \ as other industries, with more\npowerful engines and machinery. Today, all agricultural\
    \ machinery integrates electronic\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 329. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12030329\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 329\n2 of 16\n\
    controls and has entered the digital air, allowing them to be informed of their\
    \ condition\nand performance.\nBesides, electronics have become more democratic,\
    \ with sensors and drones collecting\ndata on the weather, plots, animals, and\
    \ overall farm life. Currently, one can “take the\npulse” of any activity on the\
    \ farm and translate it into performance.\nThis trend is global and affects all\
    \ sectors. The development of electronics, software,\nand databases makes it possible\
    \ to process a lot of information quickly in order to assist a\ndecision-maker\
    \ in their choices.\nThis digitization helps us to understand a situation better\
    \ and to automate tasks\nthat are thankless or difﬁcult to perform because they\
    \ are exact, fast, or repetitive. It will\nbe possible, for example, to identify\
    \ a weed in the process of emerging and control a\nweed-killer robot working in\
    \ masked time 24 h a day so that it treats the seedling [4].\nThese advances will\
    \ facilitate the understanding of the various agricultural issues,\ndecision making,\
    \ and improved performance via robots, drones, or IoT sensors. Therefore,\nthe\
    \ farmer is free to use them according to their needs, or not.\nOnce the information\
    \ has been capitalized and understood, agriculture 4.0 will allow,\nfor example,\
    \ the provision of fertilizers in a localized manner or to ensure a geolocalized\n\
    treatment. In addition, it will determine the ideal time for harvest based on\
    \ the weather,\nagricultural market prices, and farm characteristics, thus optimizing\
    \ the selling prices.\nFurthermore, with agriculture 4.0, a variety of sensors\
    \ can be found in the barn, e.g., for\nanimal identiﬁcation, animal location,\
    \ heat detection, or barn climate [5,6].\nOf course, changes are underway, but\
    \ agriculture should beneﬁt. To convince ourselves\nof this, let’s go back to\
    \ agriculture 3.0, before the arrival of tractors and mechanization.\nAt that\
    \ time, our grandfathers saw this wave of modernity arrive, often with suspicion.\n\
    It has profoundly changed the farmer’s work, yet no one today would want to go\
    \ back,\neven those most resistant to modernity. Agriculture 4.0 opens a transition\
    \ of the same\nmagnitude [7].\nThe management of agricultural technologies has\
    \ an important impact in leading\nthe development of agriculture as a sector.\
    \ There are different technologies, but farmers’\nbehavior and data characteristics\
    \ are crucial to choosing suitable technology. Given this\nfact, the use of data\
    \ has become heavily required. If the needed information is acquired,\nit will\
    \ help to improve the production process. For example, agricultural management\n\
    can record a whole crop-growth process and monitor the weather, allowing an inclusive\n\
    intervention in order to manage the damage of the natural environment [8,9].\n\
    As big data evolves, organizations are trending toward having multiple data lakes\n\
    instead of one. These additional data lakes are built for several reasons. They\
    \ may serve as\nbackup or disaster-recovery purposes for an existing production\
    \ data lake, or perhaps they\nmay replicate the contents of one data lake to another\
    \ geographic location [10].\nThis paper will be organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 will focus on the literature review\nand architecture challenges. The importance\
    \ of data in agriculture is given in Section 3.\nSection 4 presents the technical\
    \ challenges and architectural requirements. An overview\nof the proposed solution\
    \ is given in Section 5. The data sources that should be considered\nin smart\
    \ farming are given in Section 6. Section 7 broaches the importance of data quality\n\
    and data governance. A description of the data generated by the machine is given\
    \ in\nSection 8. Section 9 explores the differences between the most important\
    \ data modeling\nmethodologies, as well as determining which one ﬁts better to\
    \ the smarting farming\nanalytics and in which cases. Section 10 demonstrates\
    \ the data science part and what we\npropose as algorithms for smart farming analysis\
    \ and predictive maintenance. Finally,\nSection 11 presents our conclusions.\n\
    2. Agriculture Challenges\nA modern concept of farming management has appeared.\
    \ Recently, precision agricul-\nture has been introduced in order to optimize\
    \ and monitor production processes [11].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 329\n3 of 16\n\
    The emergence of advanced data analytics and big data has offered new business\n\
    opportunities by breaking down borders and reshaping agricultural activities’\
    \ structure.\nThe beneﬁts to the farmer and the environment as a whole are enormous,\
    \ by mini-\nmizing the use of sprayers, fertilizers, wastewater, and, at the same\
    \ time, increasing crop\nyields. This saves time and money and is environmentally\
    \ friendly. Drones can be used in\nagriculture by integrating, for example, remote\
    \ sensing imaging technology with multi-\nspectral cameras. Spectral imaging also\
    \ allows the extraction of additional information\nthat the human eye cannot capture.\
    \ Invisible wavebands reveal the agronomic character-\nistics of the soil, plants,\
    \ and crops. This sensor technology can be used throughout the\ncrop cycle. Whether\
    \ used during planting, irrigation, fertilization, or harvesting, drones\nproviding\
    \ multi-spectral imaging can be used at every stage, allowing farmers to manage\n\
    their crops very efﬁciently in every season. The reﬂectance properties of the\
    \ vegetation\nare used to calculate vegetation indices. The most popular index\
    \ is the NDVI (normal-\nized difference vegetation index). The difference in reﬂectance\
    \ observed in the red and\nnear-infrared provide, in particular, information on\
    \ the vegetation cycle in poorly- or not\ninstrumented areas.\nThe IoT sensors,\
    \ local weather forecasts, and robotics (e.g., aerial imagery by drone)\nhave\
    \ been revealed in agriculture due to the consistency of the advanced analytics\
    \ and\nbig data to inspect the farming processes, farmers’ experiences, and farm\
    \ equipment\nbehaviors [12]. From this perspective, a promising opportunity for\
    \ agriculture has appeared.\nThe intelligent farming development focuses on using\
    \ communication and information\ntechnologies in the cyber-physical farm. While\
    \ precision farming (or precision agriculture)\nconsiders the variability in the\
    \ ﬁeld, smart farming goes further than that by basing\nmanagement tasks on the\
    \ data and not only on the location.\nThus, in order to strengthen and reinforce\
    \ agriculture, we have to focus on operations\nthat pursue resource consumption.\
    \ Technological innovation and agricultural-related\ntechniques lead to intensive\
    \ and sustainable development [13]. We must be aware of the\nchallenges and ﬁnd\
    \ the right and less costly procedures to remedy them.\nIn rural areas, the broader\
    \ employment sector is heavily represented by smallholder\nfarmers. Those farmers\
    \ are indispensable contributors and donors in global food produc-\ntion [14].\
    \ Family farms represent more than 90% of the world’s farms. They contribute to\n\
    over 80% of food production and operate 75% of the farmland [15,16].\nSmall farms\
    \ have less and less of a future in a market where competition is only based\n\
    on price. If the small businesses are as good as the big ones, there will be no\
    \ problems\ncontinuing into the next generation. However, the transfer could remain\
    \ problematic. They\nwill have to multiply the alliances that affect their daily\
    \ activities, such as machinery or\nlabor cooperatives, in order to stay competitive.\n\
    It was estimated that food production would have challenges in the future, as\
    \ shown\nin Figure 1, which focuses on the signiﬁcant challenges based on the\
    \ World Resources\nInstitute [16].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n\

    \ Ministry of Health regulations deﬁnes a safe maximum residue level\n(MRL) of\
    \ vegetables and fruits, guaranteeing acceptable agricultural practices in this\n\
    ﬁeld [12].\nThe ‘maximum residue level’(MRL) is deﬁned as the upper legal level\

    \ of Data in Agriculture\nThe IoT is based on the ubiquitous presence around people\
    \ and of objects that are\ncapable of measuring, understanding, and even modifying\
    \ their environment.\nThe main consequence of IoT is, without a doubt, its impact\
    \ on the daily life of\npotential users. IoT has remarkable effects both in the\
    \ home and in the workplace. It\nwill play a decisive role in the near future\
    \ (health, intelligent transport, home automation,\nassisted living, etc.). Businesses\
    \ also expect signiﬁcant beneﬁts (freight transport, security,\nlogistics, industrial\
    \ automation, etc.). Based on these considerations, the U.S. National\nIntelligence\
    \ Council has declared the IoT one of six technologies that will potentially impact\n\
    U.S. interests by 2025. In 2018, the number of interconnected devices was estimated\
    \ to be\n30 billion. Furthermore, this number is expected to reach the value of\
    \ 75 billion by 2025.\nThese numbers suggest that the IoT will be one of the signiﬁcant\
    \ sources of volumetric data.\nSensors and actuators form the key elements of\
    \ the Internet of Things. They track the\nstate of their environment, obtain information\
    \ about temperature, motion, position, etc.\nMoreover, they include a network\
    \ that is generally composed of a potentially large number\nof nodes. As a result,\
    \ these sensors face many communication issues, such as security\nand conﬁdentiality,\
    \ mobility, short-range reliability, robustness, scalability, and resources\n\
    (energy, limited storage, processing storage, processing capacity, bandwidth,\
    \ etc.).\nFor innovative agriculture applications, the IoT is used to monitor\
    \ the moisture and\ntemperature levels in the hay, straw, etc., to prevent fungus\
    \ and other microbial contam-\ninants and weather stations, which study the weather\
    \ conditions in the ﬁeld in order to\npredict ice formation, rain, drought, snow,\
    \ or changes in the weather.\nAgriculture is becoming increasingly complex and\
    \ interconnected. Onfarm applica-\ntion facilitates its management. Contextual\
    \ information, such as mapping, location, soil\nmoisture, telemetry, and weather,\
    \ are used for effective real-time decision making. For\nexample, the bumblebee\
    \ application monitors drone life by collecting and processing visual,\naudio,\
    \ light, weather, and temperature information. It automatically reports the current\n\
    status of the colony and its well-being.\nOn the other hand, an application, such\
    \ as Hydropoint, retrieves contextual informa-\ntion through meteorological stations.\
    \ It automatically schedules irrigation according to\nlocal weather conditions\
    \ and needs, thus reducing the water bill. Microstrain is a wireless\nenvironmental\
    \ sensing system that monitors key growth episodes in vineyards. Informa-\ntion,\
    \ such as soil and leaf moisture, solar radiation, and temperature, are collected\
    \ and\nmerged in order to monitor vineyards remotely and alert growers to critical\
    \ situations.\nThe technical aspect manifested in data analytics becomes an essential\
    \ factor to con-\nsider in smart farming [22–25]. The power of the data no longer\
    \ needs to be proven. Instead,\nit is the key technical aspect that we can take\
    \ advantage of to manage and operate the\nfarming processes and maintain the farm\
    \ equipment effectively and intelligently. Based on\nthe result, we can strategically\
    \ seek sustainable agriculture where the farms are operated\nand managed smartly,\
    \ mostly automatically, limiting the manual human intervention.\nFrom a technical\
    \ perspective, to remedy the agricultural challenges mentioned above,\nbig data\
    \ analytics remains the most promising technique (and approach) in the ﬁeld of\
    \ in-\ntelligent farming [26]. For this approach, and from a global perspective,\
    \ many applications\nexist that can improve.\nMaking subsidy schemes, intervention,\
    \ and appropriate legislation led by policymak-\ners to address farming processes\

    \ 2022, 12, 329\n6 of 16\nFarmers must regularly update themselves and vary their\
    \ sources of information.\nReading magazines outside of agriculture can help them\
    \ learn a lot about what people care\nabout when it comes to food. For example,\
    \ ﬁnding suitable ingredients can help ﬁnd new\nways of growing food. The Internet\
    \ provides an unimaginable mass of information.\nBig data analytics services are\
    \ potentially skillful at answering how to deal with\nobstructing constraints.\

    \ are potentially skillful at dealing with obstructing\nconstraints. Table 2 shows\
    \ how those services are represented.\nThus, our perspective in this research\
    \ is to deliver tailored, actionable farming-based\ninformation and services.\
    \ The proposed architecture uses a big data approach relevant to\nsmallholder\
    \ farmers. The architecture is especially suitable for developing countries to\
    \ pro-\nvide a solution that enables farmers to make different analytics. These\
    \ analyses are related\nto (1) spatial distribution, (2) water management, and\
    \ (3) mechanical system maintenance.\nIt also allows agronomists and bioinformatics\
    \ scientists to store and effectively handle their\ndata, based on a data-migration\
    \ strategy on top of a reﬁned data architecture dedicated to\nintelligent farming\
    \ analytics, the SFOBA [6].\n4. Technical Challenges and Architectural Requirements\n\
    The smart farm is supposed to explore intelligent agricultural processes and manage-\n\
    ments routines in order to handle the agricultural requirements. From a data analytics\n\
    perspective, the system is composed of the following three main components:\n\
    1.\nData sources: including databases and IoT and smart-devices [26];\n2.\nData\
    \ migration strategy: including data collection from the source, data ingestion\n\
    based on physical and business data models, and data architecture that meets all\n\
    smart-farming-analytics requirements [27];\n3.\nData wisdom: or the smart farm’s\
    \ servomotor. It will conduct all of the innovative\nfarming processes and management\
    \ based on the data analysis insights, predictions,\nand predictive maintenance\
    \ reporting.\nA farming process should include the following six intelligence\
    \ levels:\n1.\nReadjusting (e.g., a process);\n2.\nSensing (e.g., anomalies, equipment\
    \ behavior);\n3.\nInferring (e.g., the key performances);\n4.\nLearning (from\
    \ the data);\n5.\nAnticipating (e.g., predictive maintenance);\n6.\nSelf-organizing\
    \ (e.g., smart processes conducted by algorithms).\nThe incorporation of IoT technologies\
    \ and devices is increasing gradually so that\nthe number of devices should communicate\
    \ with the host. As a result, each become\nunpredictably huge [28,29].\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 329\n7 of 16\nWith these requirements, especially for smart farming,\
    \ the 5G may not provide highly\neffective connectivity of network that handles\
    \ the large number of users/farmers and\ndevices that results in the network congestion\
    \ [30].\nWith the integration of AI, the 6G is supposed to overcome the network’s\
    \ manual\nconﬁguration and optimization, enabling the smart farm to scale up to\
    \ an ultra-dense\nnetwork that will be “complicated” and dynamic [31].\nAlso,\
    \ Blockchain technologies have driven the development of performance-based com-\n\
    munication applications, such as software-defined networks and the Internet of\
    \ Vehicles (IoV).\nThe main constraints that 6G networks are supposed to handle\
    \ are as follows:\n1.\nSeamless connectivity;\n2.\nQuality-of-Services (QoS) requirements,\
    \ especially for large-scale devices (including IoT);\n3.\nMassive amount of data\
    \ produced by these devices should be collected and analyzed.\nThis research will\
    \ build an abstraction layer on top of a big data architecture (SFOB) to\nprocess\
    \ and analyze these collected data. By including AI techniques in the 6G system,\
    \ all\nof these challenges are solved using AI analysis, high learning, and classiﬁcation.\n\
    The 6G networks automatically implement processes for knowledge discovery through\n\
    complicated decision making.\nGiven the fact, and based on the above requirements,\
    \ it is essential to note that more\nIoT devices and data sources generate more\
    \ data, and more AI analysis has led to more data\nprocessing. Therefore, building\
    \ a sustainable smart-farming analytics system is signiﬁcant\nfor making a data\
    \ architecture that meets all of these requirements and technical constraints.\n\
    This comprehensive data architecture will have the following capabilities:\n•\n\
    Handling small ﬁles in the Hadoop environment;\n•\nHandling data compression and\
    \ archiving without impacting the computa\ntion performance;\n•\nDetermining the\
    \ suitable parameters and constraints that should be considered in\ndeveloping\
    \ job scheduling algorithms for the MapReduce framework;\n•\nHandling data quality;\n\
    •\nHandling security;\n•\nWhat suitable data modeling methodologies should be\
    \ followed (from a business\nintelligence perspective) and when;\n•\nFinding the\
    \ right technical components;\n•\nFinding the suitable data models (from a data\
    \ science perspective) and algorithms;\n•\nBuilding a data architecture (SFOBA)\
    \ that handles all of the above constraints\nand requirements.\n5. Overview of\
    \ the Proposed Solution\nIn order to tackle our research questions, we studied\
    \ literature considering research about\nbig data, machine learning, and IoT in\
    \ articles published from “Scopus” and “Web of Science.”\nIn addition, we focused\
    \ on studies related to intelligent farming (and agriculture in general).\nMany\
    \ research articles were considered to compare the solutions proposed for smart-farming\n\
    analytics and determine what is missing from a data management perspective. Finally,\
    \ we\nlisted the technical challenges in order to find an appropriate solution.\n\
    In order to analyze and visualize the bioinformatics data, the author of [32]\
    \ aimed to\nﬁnd an appropriate design to make biological data available in a single\
    \ repository to the\nspecialist, considering both primary-database and secondary-database\
    \ as data collected\nfrom the literature. Big data provide a framework for processing\
    \ and storing the data, and\na platform for bioinformatics analysis tools, as\
    \ shown in Figure 3.\nThe proposed solution was a high-level design that considers\
    \ the following three\nmajor segments:\n1.\nData sources;\n2.\nFiles system and\

    \ in order to find an appropri-\nate solution.  \nIn order to analyze and visualize\
    \ the bioinformatics data, the author of [32] aimed to \nfind an appropriate design\
    \ to make biological data available in a single repository to the \nspecialist,\
    \ considering both primary-database and secondary-database as data collected \n\
    from the literature. Big data provide a framework for processing and storing the\
    \ data, and \na platform for bioinformatics analysis tools, as shown in Figure\
    \ 3. \n \nFigure 3. Bioinformatics high-level design. \nThe proposed solution\
    \ was a high-level design that considers the following three ma-\njor segments:\

    \ different seasons. At the same time, \nFigure 3. Bioinformatics high-level design.\n\

    \ data sources with the Hadoop data\nrepository [34].\nOur research aims to propose\
    \ a framework that tackles all of the challenges and require-\nments mentioned\
    \ above, favoring the facilitation of agricultural practices. Our primary\npurpose\
    \ is to deliver the big data application to the end-user (i.e., the farmers).\
    \ These\noutcomes can be accessed via laptop, phone, tablet, or any smart device.\
    \ The information\nwill react based on the rules deﬁned by machine learning algorithms,\
    \ guaranteeing the\nsmart-farming analytics system’s sustainability.\n6. Data\
    \ Sources and Low Power Consumption Embedded Devices\nMany traditional farming\
    \ apps have been innovative by adding devices, tools, and\nresources. In general,\
    \ however, these added technologies require a wireless solution that\nallows a\
    \ much longer range since they must transmit the signal over the large distances\n\
    usually covered by farms or agricultural estates. In addition, given the remoteness\
    \ of\nthe sites where they are used, these long-range transmission devices are\
    \ often powered\nby battery or solar panels and therefore have to consume little\
    \ energy. Thus, the ideal\ntechnological solution for these intelligent farming\
    \ operations is to use an LPWAN (low-\npower wide-area network) and other Low\
    \ Power Consumption Embedded Devices.\nNowadays, IoT has become one of the most\
    \ promising technologies to deal with\nmodern “smart” life systems, organizations,\
    \ environments, industries, and farms [35]. IoT\nis heavily present in agriculture\
    \ management processes and is deployed to increase pro-\nductivity [36]. These\
    \ IoT applications generate massive datasets [37]. Thus, the importance\nof data\
    \ is gradually growing in IoT. As a result, a new concept has appeared called\
    \ “Data\nof Things (DoT),” which refers to any technique that manages data within\
    \ a process that\nis based on IoT technologies or includes one of the IoT technologies\
    \ [38]. This research\ndetermines some big data management techniques within agricultural\
    \ processes, including\nIoT technologies.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 329\n9 of 16\n\
    IoT technologies promote a way to deliver agriculture services at scale [39].\
    \ However,\nthe accuracy of these services’ insights, actionable information,\
    \ and content depends on\ntheir capacity and ability to aggregate different data\
    \ sources and process all of the insightful\ndata. From the same perspective,\
    \ Bill Gates, the former chairman and CEO of Microsoft,\nsaid, “More Data, Better\
    \ Farms.”\nData is a critical component that provides more support to farmers\
    \ and enables them to\naccess ﬁnancial, extension, and trade services. As shown\
    \ in Figure 3, from an administrative\npoint of view, these services can improve\
    \ the handling of personal, geographical, ﬁnancial,\nproduction, business, farms-details,\
    \ and ﬁeld information data, then driving insights\nand decisions.\nRecently,\
    \ data in agriculture has signiﬁcantly increased, and the data has become\nmore\
    \ and more available. Governments strongly advocate open data to authorize farmers\n\
    and scientists to beneﬁt from these massive generated data and the desire to be\
    \ more\ntransparent. The private sector and the research institutions generate\
    \ a critical amount of\ndata, and they are ready to share it as a standard beneﬁt.\
    \ The practical part of this research\nis based on open data, mostly from governmental\
    \ websites.\nGenerally, there are three types of data generated in agriculture,\
    \ as follows:\n1.\nData Mediated by Process (DMP);\n2.\nData Generated by Machine\
    \ (DGM);\n3.\nData from Human Origin (DHO).\nThis section below will deﬁne each\
    \ type of generated agriculture data, and we will\nalso describe the data used\
    \ in this research.\n7. Data Mediated by Process (DMP)\nThe DMP is the data generated\
    \ during agriculture, such as applying fertilizers, cus-\ntomer complaint submissions,\
    \ etc. and it is stored automatically in an information system\n(IS) or manually\
    \ in ﬁles (e.g., Excel ﬁles). This data is mainly generated from IS, e.g., CRM,\n\
    ERP, Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). The data could be stored\
    \ in a\nrelational database system. The relational database concept links two-dimensional\
    \ tables\ncontaining columns and rows, as shown in Figure 4 (example from India).\

    \ farm’s\nenvironment using networking protocols and standards, such as RFID,\
    \ 4G/5G, LoWPAN,\nIEEE 802.15.x, and the future 6G [45–52].\nThe main objective\
    \ behind using IoT in intelligent farming is interconnecting common\nphysical\
    \ objects and devices through the internet. Several IoT devices can be used for\n\
    water management and intelligent irrigation analytics [53]. For example, we can\
    \ cite pH\nsensors that measure the soil’s nutrient content, moisture sensors\
    \ that measure the ground’s\ndielectric constant, and temperature sensors that\
    \ measure both farm and equipment tem-\nperature [54,55]. Internet-experts predicted\
    \ that IoT’s extension and growth would be\nrecorded around 50 billion physical\
    \ objects and more by 2025.\n9. Data Modeling\nThe success of data-driven analytics\
    \ for smart farming is related to how organized\nthe data management is. Therefore,\
    \ we should develop actions, policies, and architectures\nto manage the fundamental\
    \ requirements of the data life cycle of the farm properly. The\ndevelopment of\
    \ data architecture for smart farming involves accurate rules (for governing\n\
    the data collection), data models, data storage, data processing, and integration.\
    \ Therefore, a\nwell-designed data model should be built in order to achieve efficient\
    \ smart-farming analytics.\nFor example, the relation between the various data\
    \ should be well deﬁned. Therefore,\nthe farm databases/sources (DMP, DGM, and\
    \ DHO) should be well integrated.\nOnce the data has been gathered and prepared\
    \ for analysis, various data science and\nadvanced analytics disciplines can be\
    \ applied for smart-farming analytics.\nWhen it comes to big-data modeling, other\
    \ criteria should be considered. For example,\nintegrating the existing farming\
    \ data with the new data, on top of a Hadoop architecture,\ncan be completed while\
    \ considering the different types of data formats. In addition, other\nfeatures,\
    \ such as data compression, capacity, availability, reliability, data integrity,\
    \ and data\nsecurity, are all critical features that should be considered.\nIt\
    \ is necessary to remember that the farm’s data is available in different sources\
    \ (mostly\nRDBMS, IoT, and Excel ﬁles) and is probably stored with or without\
    \ schema. Additionally,\nfor smart farming analytics, we need to model the farm’s\
    \ data so that it will be stored in\none “source of truth,” which can be considered\
    \ a centralized data warehouse of the farm\ninside the data lake.\nAs we described\
    \ in the previous section (i.e., Data sources), the relational data model\nwas\
    \ proposed by IBM to represent data in the form of tables in order to reduce the\
    \ com-\nplexity of the “previous” hierarchical-model and deliver an understandable\
    \ overview of\nthe data. In the same context, the transactional data model can\
    \ be built to store discrete\ndata of the “farm” business transactions, such as\
    \ inventory, purchase orders, sales, etc. It\nis mainly how the DMP are modeled\
    \ in their source system, throughout the procedure\nof normalizing the large raw\
    \ tables and splitting them into smaller ones, then creating\nrelationships between\
    \ these tables using reference integrity constraints and respecting the\nthree\
    \ normal forms (3NF).\nThe problem with this approach in smart-farming analytics\
    \ is area/business-speciﬁc.\nEach database stores only the data related to a particular\
    \ functional area (e.g., the produc-\ntivity database stores only production-\
    \ and productivity-related data).\nOn the other hand, smart-farming analytics\
    \ necessitates storing transactional data for\nmultiple areas, such as spatial\
    \ distribution (including climate, productivity, and global-\nissues data), water\
    \ management, and mechanical system maintenance, in a single “target”\nsource\
    \ (data lake). The second problem is that transactional databases use primary\
    \ key.\nStill, many critical DGM and DHO for farming business logic come without\
    \ a primary\nkey in smart farming. As a result, we will have duplicates in our\
    \ tables, signiﬁcantly\nimpacting the analytics and decisions.\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 329\n13 of 16\nThe third problem is, retrieving data from a normalized database\
    \ will involve several joins\nacross these many split tables where various pieces\
    \ of the farm data are stored. But for smart\nfarming, the analysis and the analytics\
    \ should be conducted and refreshed continuously. Thus,\ndenormalizing the tables\
    \ will significantly enhance the data retrieval by adding redundancy\n(copying\
    \ values between tables) to the farm’s data lake and reducing the number of joins\
    \ on\nthe queries. This denormalization will also provide aggregation and calculation\
    \ capabilities\nto the analysis and help to extend the calculated values for smart-farming\
    \ analytics, which\nrequires a lot of time and slowing-down of the query’s execution,\
    \ calculating them on the fly\nin a normalized database that does not contain\
    \ these values.\n10. Data Science for Smart Farming\nData science is the study\
    \ of large quantities of disparate data and extracting insights\nand knowledge\
    \ to aid the organization in making tactical, strategic, timely, and correct\n\
    decisions. This process involves statistical analysis, mathematics, machine learning,\
    \ data\nvisualization, etc.\nIn agriculture, farmers have always been collecting\
    \ (manually or automatically) a\nmassive amount of data for each agriculture season,\
    \ e.g., applied inputs, harvested crops,\nplanted deeds, etc.\nThe growth of new\
    \ digital technologies (satellites, remote-sensors, and drones) has\ncaused the\
    \ rise of digital farming, including temperature, utilization of nitrogen, and\
    \ soil\nconditions [56,57].\nHere, data science can help farmers to personalize\
    \ their decisions regarding each\nfarming process, using AI tools to speed up\
    \ analyzing data and bringing back valuable\ninsights to farmers. Data science\
    \ is a generic term that includes the complete data processing\nmethodology, where\
    \ AI encompasses each tool that enables computers to learn problem-\nsolving and\
    \ decision-making skills.\nMachine learning is a subset of AI that makes accurate\
    \ decisions, uses algorithms to\nanalyze the data, and learns from this process\
    \ without programming it explicitly. Machine-\nlearning models use large datasets\
    \ for training and learning as things progress from these\nexamples, but not from\
    \ deﬁned rules (unlike the rule-based algorithms).\nThese techniques can be used\
    \ for predictive analysis, fraud detection, market basket\nanalysis, recommendations,\
    \ etc. in order to deﬁne a decision rule from which the strategic\ndecisions will\
    \ be conducted.\n11. Conclusions and Perspectives\nThe digitalization of agriculture\
    \ is based on developing and introducing new tools\nand machines in production.\n\
    The future smart farming revolution (or agriculture 4.0) will use advanced data-\n\
    acquisition technologies combined with network-communication technologies.\nSmart\
    \ farming will also incorporate intelligent processing technologies. All of these\n\
    outlooks involve data management in a certain way. As we described in this research,\n\
    smart-data management can provide a wave of solutions to facilitate the farmers’\
    \ pain\nwhen dealing with their daily processes by employing one. We proposed\
    \ a Smart Farming\nOriented Big-Data Architecture that provides a platform for\
    \ all of the intelligent data\nmanagement requirements and manages data processes\
    \ in different layers that execute the\ntasks accordingly, allowing for more ﬂexibility\
    \ and agility.\nIn this research, we have proposed some of the main technical\
    \ constraints, a data-\nquality process, to model the farm’s data based on business\
    \ logic and compare machine-\nlearning algorithms. Our future perspective is to\
    \ build an abstraction layer on top of the\nSFOBA that automatically handles them\

    High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is becoming the state-of-the-art technology for
    typing

    of microbial isolates, especially in clinical samples. Yet, its application is
    still in its infancy

    for monitoring and outbreak investigations of foods. Here we review the published

    literature, covering not only bacterial but also viral and Eukaryote food pathogens,

    to assess the status and potential of HTS implementation to inform stakeholders,

    improve food safety and reduce outbreak impacts. The developments in sequencing

    technology and bioinformatics have outpaced the capacity to analyze and interpret

    the sequence data. The inﬂuence of sample processing, nucleic acid extraction
    and

    puriﬁcation, harmonized protocols for generation and interpretation of data, and
    properly

    annotated and curated reference databases including non-pathogenic “natural” strains

    are other major obstacles to the realization of the full potential of HTS in analytical

    food surveillance, epidemiological and outbreak investigations, and in complementing

    preventive approaches for the control and management of foodborne pathogens.

    Despite signiﬁcant obstacles, the achieved progress in capacity and broadening
    of

    the application range over the last decade is impressive and unprecedented, as

    illustrated with the chosen examples from the literature. Large consortia, often
    with

    broad international participation, are making coordinated efforts to cope with
    many of

    the mentioned obstacles. Further rapid progress can therefore be prospected for
    the

    next decade.

    INTRODUCTION

    Foodborne Pathogens and Their Impact

    Foodborne pathogens (FBPs) cause foodborne diseases (FBDs) either directly (by
    infectious agents)

    or indirectly (by toxic metabolites, i.e., bacterial toxins and mycotoxins; EMAN,
    2015; Martinovic

    et al., 2016) and can have devastating health and economic consequences in both
    developed and

    developing countries (Pires et al., 2012; EFSA, 2014; ECDC, 2015a; Henao et al.,
    2015). A major

    fraction of FBDs are diarrheal diseases, with particularly high impact on children
    (Pires et al., 2015).

    Typical FBPs are bacteria and several viruses, but also parasites and some fungi
    can cause FBDs.

    Sekse et al.

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    Conventional Microbiological Food

    Analyses

    Microbiological analyses of foods are carried out for veriﬁcation

    and control, surveillance, investigation of disease outbreaks

    or sporadic cases, or for research (Figure 1). Time and labor

    consuming culture dependent methods, including enrichment

    and/or selective steps, are often used. Selective enrichment may

    be crucial to capture the species of interest. Isolation of the

    pathogen of interest is an optimal starting point for further

    characterization and research, and contributes to ensure that

    public health agencies can perform their basic mandate of FBD

    surveillance and response (Forbes et al., 2017). Over the last

    decades traditional culture dependent methods have gradually

    been complemented with molecular analytical methods. Speed

    and costs are the main drivers of this development. Concerns

    about the possible lack of necessary sensitivity, speciﬁcity or

    correspondence between molecular ﬁndings and presence or

    absence of viable, pathogenic microorganisms are among factors

    restraining this development. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

    analysis of enriched samples from food is established for a

    range of FBPs improving the eﬃciency of screening of samples,

    but viable microorganisms are, in most cases, still required for

    deﬁnitive conﬁrmation of positive samples. High throughput

    sequencing (HTS) based workﬂows now gradually emerge as

    options also for routine applications to FBP detection and

    characterization (Figure 1; Table 1).

    High Throughput Sequencing

    HTS can generate thousands to millions of sequence reads,

    and up to several hundred billion base pairs (bp) of sequence

    information per sample. The read length, error rate and number

    of reads and sequenced bases vary substantially. Selective

    ampliﬁcation (targeted) and non-selective, random (shotgun)

    approaches exist. The number of high quality genomes for the

    most important food pathogens is already high and rapidly

    growing, in part beneﬁting from the relatively small genome

    sizes of most microorganisms (≤100 Mbp). In cases where a

    sequenced reference genome is unavailable it is necessary to

    perform de novo sequencing and genome assembly (Figures 2, 3).

    De novo assembly to obtain a draft quality genome based on high

    quality, short-read (<250 bp) sequence data from single, cultured

    isolates is complex, but can be (semi-)automated (Emond-

    Rheault et al., 2017). Closing a genome often requires highly

    skilled bioinformaticians and long sequence reads (up to several

    kbp) or PCR and Sanger sequencing of the unknown gaps in

    scaﬀolds (Goodwin et al., 2015; Loman et al., 2015; Rhoads

    and Au, 2015). Even this can sometimes be (semi-)automated

    (Emond-Rheault et al., 2017). Analysis of re-sequencing data

    employing a mapping strategy (Figures 2, 3) is less complex,

    and can be (semi-)automated. It is, however, time and computer

    intensive and interpretation of the mapped data can be quite

    challenging (Goodwin et al., 2015; Loman et al., 2015; Rhoads and

    Au, 2015). Alignment-independent comparisons using statistic

    (probabilistic) approaches (k-mers; Figures 2, 3) can be much

    faster and automated and emerge as an attractive option at the

    cost of detailed resolution (Ondov et al., 2016). The optimal

    FIGURE 1 | Four sectors are considered here as potential users of high

    throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies for detection and characterization

    of foodborne pathogens (FBPs). Research (upper left) is a knowledge driver

    providing exploitable reference data and detection methods among others to

    the other three sectors (green arrows), and receives valuable data and material

    back from the other sectors (yellow arrows). The food industry (upper right) is

    legally obliged to take preventive measures and to monitor its products and

    production systems to prevent contamination with FBPs, with economy as a

    main priority driver. Documentation of the systematic efforts to maintain low

    risk (goal = pathogen free) products must be available for inspection. The

    health sector (lower left) treats patients and is usually the ﬁrst to isolate
    and

    characterize outbreak-associated strains, thereby providing key information

    necessary for the other sectors to investigate and minimize the impact of

    outbreaks. The competent authorities (lower right) enforce the food law and

    surveil the food industry and products, but also coordinate the outbreak

    investigations based on data provided by the other sectors. Epidemiological

    data, legal acts and quality control documents are the main information

    sources used and shared by the competent authorities (blue arrows). Outbreak

    investigations have a strong focus on speciﬁc source tracking (red arrow).

    HTS strategy is therefore purpose dependent. Large sequence

    databases including thousands of completely sequenced genomes

    are now available, facilitating identiﬁcation of common as well

    as rare but potentially important genes by mapping of sequence

    reads to the database sequences. Low error rate, long reads

    and high coverage facilitate sequence assembly (Figures 2, 3).

    Altogether, this has expanded our ability to gain a more

    comprehensive insight into the genetics of individual strains or

    species, and the microbiota (microbial species composition) and

    microbiome (functional gene pool of microbiota) of a very broad

    spectrum of sample types, including environmental, food and

    clinical samples.

    Tremendous progress in HTS technology developments has

    been made during the recent decade and this review will not

    discuss per se the sequencing technologies, because several

    excellent reviews are available (Loman and Pallen, 2015; Goodwin

    however, help readers to better understand the choices made in

    the following cited examples.

    Illumina

    sequencing

    is

    currently

    the

    prevailing

    HTS

    technology and also oﬀers the highest ﬁdelity. It provides very

    large data sets of relatively short reads (100–300 bp) at an error

    rate per sequenced base of approximately 1%. Roche 454 (phased

    out in 2016) was the previously dominating technology and

    provided smaller data sets of longer reads (≤700 bp) with higher

    error rates. Much of the initial HTS literature reports on Roche

    454 data (Liu et al., 2012; Mayo et al., 2014; van Dijk et al., 2014).

    Long read sequences, up to several kbp, can be obtained using

    other platforms (see below) but the error rates are high (5–40%).

    All HTS technologies allow for assembly of good quality draft

    bacterial genomes with up to 100 contigs. A fully closed genome

    sequence is usually obtained through application of diﬀerent

    technologies combining the accuracy of short reads with the

    ability of long reads to span gaps in assembly scaﬀolds (Tallon

    et al., 2014). Due to the capacity of the Single Molecule Real

    Time sequencing technology of Paciﬁc Biosciences to provide

    reads of 1–10 kbp, this technology has recently been popular for

    de novo assembly of completely closed genomes, long repetitive

    sequences, plasmids and bacteriophages (Rhoads and Au, 2015).

    The Oxford Nanopore MinION has competitive potential, as it

    is claimed to be able to provide even longer reads in real-time at

    low costs (Goodwin et al., 2015; Loman et al., 2015; Quick et al.,

    2015). The short read technologies generally provide signiﬁcantly

    higher coverage than the long read technologies, at much lower

    costs per sequenced base.

    HTS Based Microbiological Analyses

    Foods, feeds, clinical and environmental samples harbor complex

    and diverse microbial communities. We use the expression

    “metagenomics” for analysis of such samples by HTS. For

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    FIGURE 2 | Metagenomics data analysis. At least three different approaches

    for analysis of HTS sequence reads can be selected, but combinations are

    often preferred. (A) Assembly of sequences (e.g., reads) into contigs

    (consensus sequences) requires mapping. Sets of contigs are often further

    assembled into scaffolds (not shown), where the relative position of contigs is

    known but gaps of ± known size between the contigs remain to be closed.

    The example shows that four of the six reads can be assembled into a

    consensus contig while the two remaining reads cannot be assembled with

    any of the others. (B) Mapping of sequences (e.g., reads) to other sequences

    (e.g., in database) also requires mapping. The example shows one perfect and

    one partial match between two query sequences (e.g., reads) and a reference

    sequence. The mismatch in the partial match is shown in red. (C) Any

    sequence larger than one nucleotide can be divided into subsequences of

    length k ≥ 1. The size of k will affect the likelihood of any random k-mer being

    unique to a data set. A small k will reduce the number of unique k-mers. This
    is

    demonstrated in the example, as for the given reference sequence two k-mers

    will not be unique with k = 3, while with k = 5 all k-mers are unique. Rare

    k-mers or k-mer frequencies can be used to estimate relationships between

    two sets of sequences (e.g., two shotgun metagenomes or a sequence isolate

    and a reference genome).

    further distinction we use the term “shotgun metagenomics” for

    whole genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-sample-DNA based

    metagenomics (Figure 4). Targeted amplicon analysis of various

    ribosomal RNA coding DNA (rDNA) and other conserved

    markers is, as suggested by Marchesi and Ravel (2015), denoted

    “metataxonomics” throughout this review. “Metabarcoding” is

    a related term sometimes used in the literature (e.g., Jones

    et al., 2013; Staats et al., 2016). Shotgun metagenomics,

    and “metatranscriptomics” (i.e., shotgun sequencing of RNA

    transcripts) enables full genome or transcriptome sequencing,

    respectively,

    in

    a

    complex

    sample.

    RNA

    based

    shotgun

    metagenomics (i.e., sequencing of all RNA in the sample) and

    metatranscriptomics are often combined into a single approach

    “RNAseq”. We therefore only refer to metatranscriptomics or

    RNA based shotgun metagenomics when we need to distinguish

    from RNAseq.

    FIGURE 3 | Approaches to HTS sequence read analysis and their

    dependence on alignment, time and coverage. At least three different

    approaches for analysis of HTS sequence reads can be selected, but

    combinations are often preferred. Top right: Assembly of sequences into

    contigs (see also Figure 2), scaffolds and complete genome assemblies is

    alignment dependent, time consuming and the success probability is usually

    correlated with the coverage. This approach is typically taken when time is not

    the limiting factor and a complete assembly is desired for successive analysis

    and reference applications. Bottom: Mapping (see also Figure 2) of reads to

    existing assembly/assemblies is also alignment dependent and time

    consuming but can also be performed successfully at low coverage (a single

    read can be mapped to a reference assembly). The size of the reference (e.g.,

    database or genome) and the degree to which mismatches are accepted will

    have a signiﬁcant impact on the time required for data analysis (olive arrows).

    This approach is typically taken to determine functional aspects of

    metagenome and transcriptome sequences and in metataxonomics. Top left:

    K-mer analysis (see also Figure 2) is a fast, alignment independent,

    statistical (probabilistic) approach to investigate properties of a sequenced

    genome such as its similarity and relationship to other (reference) genomes. It

    is typically used to screen sequenced genomes to identify genomes of

    particular interest for more comprehensive analysis.

    Metataxonomics is generally more sensitive than shotgun

    metagenomics, due to enrichment of targets by ampliﬁcation.

    Metataxonomics is, due to the targeted enrichment, prone

    to bias and may fail to detect novel variants of relevant

    targets, e.g., 16S rDNA with mismatches in the PCR primer

    binding motifs or genes involved in previously unknown but

    relevant biosynthetic pathways. Shotgun metagenomics on the

    other hand presumably has a low bias, is independent of

    a priori knowledge of target sequences, and can be used

    to monitor alterations in the microbiome that may not be

    evident from the composition of the microbiota. RNAseq

    is biased by the reverse transcription used to synthesize

    cDNA prior to sequencing, possibly aﬀecting detectability of

    RNA viruses. Metatranscriptomics is further biased by RNA

    transcription rates. RNAseq is otherwise comparable to shotgun

    metagenomics. The main drawbacks of shotgun metagenomics

    sequencing. (A) Six different genomes (1–6) shown in different

    colors with ﬁve of the six (1 and 3–6) containing a shared genomic region. The
    shared genomic region in all ﬁve has a conserved motif on the left side (red circle
    =

    forward primer binding site), but one of them has a signiﬁcant change in the conserved
    motif on the right side (yellow circle = reverse primer binding site) resulting
    in

    primer mismatch (black circle). (B) The sequenced fragments with shotgun metagenomics
    are random motifs from the six different genomes, and only one of the

    conserved (primer binding) motifs will exceptionally be included. (C) The sequenced
    fragments with amplicon sequencing are only those delimited both by a

    conserved left and right motif (red and yellow circles). The difference in mean
    coverage per nucleotide is signiﬁcant. Assuming that each genome has the same
    length

    (e.g., 108 bp) and is present in equal concentration in the original sample, a
    read length of 200 bp, and an invariant length of the shared genomic region delimited
    by

    the primer sites of 250 bp, the mean coverage per nucleotide of the targets will
    be: (B) R × L/N × G = 106 × 200 bp/6 × 108 bp = 1/3 where R = number of reads,

    L = read length, N = number of genomes and G = genome size. (C) R × L/A × D =
    106 × 200 bp/4 × 250 bp = 2 × 105 where R and L are the same as for B,

    while A = number of genomes ﬂanked both by conserved forward and reverse primer
    sites, and D = the length of the shared genomic region delimited by the primer

    sites. In this example C is 6 × 105 times more sensitive than B. Shotgun reads
    may be analyzed applying all bioinformatics approaches (assembly, mapping and

    k-mer analysis, alignment dependent and alignment free; cf. Figures 2, 3). Amplicon
    reads are usually analyzed by mapping, clustering and phylogenetic approaches,

    while assembly is only exceptionally applied.

    of the sample’s microbiota and/or the causative agent is typically

    not well known in advance (limiting the possibility to apply

    targeted approaches such as metataxonomics), and relevant

    reference sequences may be lacking from public databases

    (limiting the possibility to perform mapping and assign function

    to sequences).

    SELECTED, ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES OF

    APPROACHES FOR SPECIFIC PATHOGEN

    TAXA AND APPLICATIONS

    FBDs are caused by bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic pathogens

    entering the body via contaminated foods and have entered the

    food chain at some point from farm to fork. Bacteria and viruses

    are the most commonly reported sources of disease. Bacteria

    are more easily identiﬁed than viruses because the former can

    often be cultured. The vast majority of published HTS based FBP

    studies have focused on particular taxa, mainly bacterial, and

    speciﬁc applications, e.g., outbreak investigation starting with a

    clinical isolate. The organization of the following sub-chapters

    reﬂects this. Future advancements, with some included pioneer

    examples, are expected to allow for simultaneous detection of

    multiple higher and lower level taxa.

    Bacterial Foodborne Pathogens

    Many FBPs are well-studied and the use of genomic data

    and large scale WGS have become important for studies

    in

    epidemiology,

    evolution,

    surveillance

    and

    investigations. On August 16th 2017, there were 104,667

    new insights into these aspects and the possible relevance of

    phages to FBDs (Nieuwenhuijse and Koopmans, 2017).

    Bacterial FBPs are often present in foods in low numbers

    heterogeneously spread in the product. Consequently, ability

    to detect very low levels of FBPs in various food sources is

    important. Current detection methods normally involve one or

    more enrichment steps, screening (e.g., by PCR), followed by

    an isolation step. Isolation of a FBP from a food matrix may

    be challenging due to low recovery of isolates;—a sample can

    be positive with PCR screening, yet isolation of a corresponding

    bacterial strain may not be achieved. Some of the most important

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    bacterial FBPs are Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes and Shiga

    toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) causing many outbreaks and

    sporadic cases with severe or fatal outcome (Crim et al., 2014;

    Astridge et al., 2015; EFSA, 2015b). These three FBPs are

    used in the following as illustrative examples. For Salmonella

    infections contaminated food sources typically include poultry,

    eggs, swine and ready-to-eat foods, and aﬀect people at all

    ages (EFSA, 2015b). L. monocytogenes is commonly detected in

    ready-to-eat foods such as smoked ﬁsh and soft cheeses and

    often aﬀect elderly, immunocompromised patients, pregnant

    women and have high mortality rate (EFSA, 2015b). The main

    food vehicles of STEC infections are bovine meat followed

    by vegetables and juice (EFSA, 2013, 2015b). STEC can cause

    severe complications like acute kidney failure (hemolytic uremic

    syndrome) and often aﬀects children under the age of ﬁve, elderly

    and immunocompromised people (Davis et al., 2014).

    For outbreak investigation the pathogen must be linked to

    the correct food product (source of infection). Food producers

    on the other hand, need to determine if their products or

    production line is contaminated, how an unwanted pathogen

    entered their production facilities, and/or if it is a persistent

    household strain (Figure 1; Table 1). Several strategies can

    be applied for comparison of isolates, e.g., pulsed-ﬁeld gel

    electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus variable number of tandem

    repeats analysis (MLVA) and multi-locus sequence typing

    (MLST). For many FBPs the traditional typing or subtyping oﬀers

    too low (phylogenetic) resolution to distinguish closely related

    but distinct strains. High resolution is required to discriminate

    parallel outbreaks or to separate sporadic cases from an outbreak,

    but also to assess if a reemerging contamination problem is

    caused by a persistent strain or reintroduction of similar strains.

    WGS will provide highly discriminatory data for subtyping

    of strains by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis

    or extended (core genome or whole genome) MLST (cgMLST,

    wgMLST) for strain comparison for outbreak investigations and

    surveillance purposes. Among possibilities beyond traditional

    molecular ﬁngerprinting is the reanalysis of complete genome

    sequences when subsets (e.g., MLST) provide insuﬃcient

    information/resolution. Polymorphisms can be investigated

    with or without mapping of the HTS data to a reference

    genome (Figures 2, 3). WGS-based analyses can also aid in the

    identiﬁcation of other relevant factors such as virulence and

    antibiotic resistance genes (Joensen et al., 2014; Holmes et al.,

    2015; Octavia et al., 2015; Forbes et al., 2017). By standardizing

    the workﬂow of the actual HTS and bioinformatics analysis,

    this can take only a few days. However, comparable data

    and standardized protocols and pipelines are required, a topic

    discussed in further detail below.

    Bacterial Genomic (Isolate and Strain

    Typing) Approaches

    Outbreak Investigations

    The starting points for outbreak investigations with strain typing

    are access to clinical isolates. WGS has been used many times in

    recent years for comparison of isolates in outbreak investigations.

    Most published studies were retrospective, but a few were

    performed in real-time. A selection of examples is summarized

    in Table 2. In an early prospective study (2009) isolates from

    human patients and animals associated with an STEC O157:H7

    outbreak were selected for WGS for comparison of isolates

    and source identiﬁcation (Underwood et al., 2013; Table 2).

    A combination of Roche 454 and Illumina data were used to

    generate a reference assembly from the strain with best quality

    data. The hybrid assembly resulted in 463 contigs with average

    size of 12,028 bp and served as a reference genome for the

    successive analysis. Shotgun metagenome reads from 16 isolates

    associated with the outbreak were mapped and examined for

    SNPs over the entire genome. Based on the SNP results ﬁve

    subtypes of the outbreak strain were identiﬁed, providing for

    design of assays for detection of six speciﬁc SNPs. These assays

    were used to follow the outbreak, including analysis of 106

    additional isolates obtained from the outbreak, demonstrating

    that the ﬁve subtypes were widely distributed on the involved

    farm prior to the ﬁrst human clinical case (Underwood et al.,

    2013). Variable number of tandem repeats and PFGE typing

    indicated that there were two diﬀerent strains in the sample

    collection, but the data from each typing method did not overlap

    and were therefore inconclusive. The HTS data on the other hand

    documented that the outbreak was caused by a strain diﬀering in

    four SNPs from the hypervirulent O157:H7 ST11 clade 8. This

    early study demonstrated that HTS can provide better resolution

    (ﬁve subtypes vs. two subtypes) and therefore can be superior

    to more traditional characterization methods. HTS in addition

    provided data suitable for design of speciﬁc diagnostic assays that

    improved the monitoring of the outbreak.

    Speciﬁc diagnostic sequence motifs are not always available

    or known, and a speciﬁc pathogenic agent may exhibit new and

    unexpected combinations of involved virulence genes for which

    current tests are not optimally designed. This was for example

    the case in the large STEC O104:H4 outbreak in Germany and

    other European countries in 2011 (Scheutz et al., 2011). In mid-

    May the public health authority in Germany was informed about

    a cluster of three cases with hemolytic uremic syndrome and raw

    WGS data from a patient derived isolate were already on June the

    2nd published by Beijing Genome Institute (NCBI accession no.

    SRX067313; Kupferschmidt, 2011). Public release of these data

    incited a huge joint eﬀort from bioinformaticians and researchers

    around the world, very quickly resulting in in-depth knowledge

    of the strain. This also facilitated design of speciﬁc diagnostic

    tools for further investigation of the outbreak (Struelens et al.,

    2011).

    A complex outbreak investigation in the UK identiﬁed

    watercress as the source of STEC O157 in two simultaneous

    outbreaks with diﬀerent sources of contamination (Jenkins et al.,

    2015; Table 2). SNP positions of high quality in all genomes

    of the Public Health England STEC O157 database were then

    extracted. Pseudo sequences of polymorphic positions were used

    to create maximum-likelihood trees and compared to the WGS

    data of additional strains held in the database. Phylogenetic

    analysis supported a foreign source for the outbreak, but no

    microbiological link to a speciﬁc country of origin was identiﬁed.

    Only one isolate was identiﬁed from the irrigation water from the

    implicated watercress, indicating a low level of contamination.

    This isolate was compared to the human isolates, and a maximum

    of 3 SNP diﬀerences were reported for the second outbreak,

    conﬁrming the source of this outbreak (Jenkins et al., 2015).

    One of the ﬁrst published studies using WGS in outbreak

    investigations concerned a large L. monocytogenes outbreak in

    Canada in 2008 (Gilmour et al., 2010; Table 2). Two clinical

    isolates with similar but distinct PFGE patterns were subjected to

    WGS to assess the genetic diversity of these isolates. Altogether 28

    SNPs and three indels, including a 33-kbp motif corresponding

    to presence/absence of a prophage were observed. The additional

    information obtained with WGS compared to PFGE indicated

    that not one, but three distinct, yet closely related strains were

    possibly involved in the outbreak.

    Investigations of an Australian hospital outbreak of L.

    monocytogenes in 2013 identiﬁed a chocolate proﬁterole from a

    speciﬁc food manufacturer as the common food consumed by the

    patients. A follow-up WGS study identiﬁed more SNP diﬀerences

    in the environmental isolates from the food manufacturing

    facility than the patients’ isolates from the outbreak (Wang

    et al., 2015b; Table 2). However, the ﬁve outbreak isolates shared

    multiple distinctive genetic features including ﬁve prophage

    insertions. Wang et al. (2015b) suggested that the human isolates

    were less divergent because of successful adaptation to the

    relatively stable human environment while the environmental

    strains (19–20 SNP diﬀerences from human isolates) were under

    increased survival pressure due to less favorable conditions.

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    Schmid et al. (2014; Table 2) investigated a cluster of

    listeriosis in Austria and Germany by WGS where the human

    isolates shared PFGE and ﬂuorescent ampliﬁed fragment length

    polymorphism proﬁles. Gene-by-gene comparison or cgMLST

    based on 2,298 genes revealed that four of the human isolates

    belonged to a single cluster diﬀering by ≤6 alleles (genes).

    This cluster was distinct from but related to food isolates

    from two Austrian producers (diﬀering by ≤8 and ≤19 alleles,

    respectively). The study did not explain if the allelic diﬀerences

    corresponded to SNPs or were more substantial. The other three

    human isolates were more distinct and unrelated to the outbreak

    cluster.

    Octavia et al. (2015) used SNP analysis in an attempt to deﬁne

    whether an isolate was part of an outbreak or not and identify

    whether one or more strains were implicated in an outbreak

    (Figure 5). They modeled the mutation rate in S. typhimurium

    using 250 bp paired-end reads and estimated a cutoﬀ value for

    the intra-strain number of SNPs the bacteria could have. When

    using a high or low substitution rate, and including a time limit

    of an outbreak from less than a month to up to 3 months the

    number of SNPs was estimated to diﬀer from 2 to 9. Other

    studies have identiﬁed variable numbers of SNPs in Salmonella

    outbreaks. Several studies have reported 0–3 SNP diﬀerences in

    one outbreak (Ashton et al., 2015; Taylor et al., 2015; Wuyts et al.,

    2015). However, some outbreaks have reported to have larger

    SNP variation based on the core genome (Leekitcharoenphon

    et al., 2014). In concordance with many of the Salmonella reports,

    a low intra-strain number of SNPs (0–7) have been reported from

    epidemiologically linked cases of STEC O157:H7 (Turabelidze

    et al., 2013; Underwood et al., 2013; Joensen et al., 2014; Holmes

    et al., 2015; Jenkins et al., 2015; Figure 5).

    Applications of Strain and Isolate Typing To

    Surveillance and Control

    Surveillance of speciﬁc FBPs has been ongoing in public health

    laboratories for a long time, and can beneﬁt from access to clinical

    and/or food derived isolates. A few countries and laboratories

    have implemented WGS as a routine typing tool for public health

    surveillance (i.e., on clinical isolates) for selected FBPs (Joensen

    et al., 2014; Ashton et al., 2016; Chattaway et al., 2016; Lindsey

    et al., 2016). Implementation of WGS as a standard typing tool for

    isolates from foods as well, is still in a start-up phase and routinely

    done in very few countries.

    Denmark has implemented WGS typing of L. monocytogenes

    isolates from patients and the food surveillance program. Two

    unexpected genetic clusters, as classiﬁed by MLST type, were

    identiﬁed through the WGS analysis during 2013–2015 and

    further analyzed for SNP diﬀerences by mapping to a reference

    genome of the same MLST sequence type (Lassen et al., 2016).

    Another study on L. monocytogenes has developed a gene-

    by-gene (cgMLST) method based on 1,748 loci among 957

    genomes (Moura et al., 2016). High robustness was shown as

    diﬀerent DNA extraction methods, library preparations and

    sequencing instruments were used as well as assembly-free

    and de novo assembly-based methods to ensure that the allelic

    proﬁles generated were the same despite diﬀerences in the WGS

    methodology.

    FIGURE 5 | Isogenic or non-isogenic isolates? The distance or number of

    observed differences between isolates, usually measured as single nucleotide

    polymorphisms (SNPs) in HTS studies, can provide clues to determine if

    isolates belong to the same strain, i.e., whether they are isogenic or not. This

    is important for outbreak investigations, epidemiology and to assess if a

    persistent strain is present in a food production system. Fewer than ten SNPs

    is often interpreted as evidence of an isogenic origin of bacterial isolates (see

    examples and discussion in the main text of this paper). Practice is currently

    not harmonized and also depends on the taxon in question, how SNPs or

    other differences are calculated, and which part of the genome the study

    covers (e.g., core or whole genome). An inferred phylogenetic relationship

    between nine isolates (A–I; terminal nodes) is shown. For each isolate, a blue

    letter (a–i) indicates the number of unique SNPs associated with each

    individual isolate. Internal nodes labeled X–Z connect three clusters of isolates,

    while internode N connects all isolates. Brown letters (x–z) indicate the number

    of shared SNPs separating each individual cluster of isolates from the others.

    The distance (1) between any pair of isolates is the sum of SNPs (i.e., blue

    and brown letters) separating them, e.g., if a = 3, d = 2, x = 2 and y = 4 then

    1AD = 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 11. The following two examples serve to illustrate the

    difference between putatively isogenic and non-isogenic clusters of isolates

    (with a threshold of 9 for isogenics): If a = b = c = d = e = f = 2, g = h = i
    =

    3, x = 2, and y = z = 3 then all the isolates A–F might be considered isogenic

    (internal distance between any pair of isolates 1max ≤ 9), as might G-I (1max

    = 6), whereas A–F might not be considered isogenic with G–I (internal

    distance between any members from two different clusters 1min ≥10).

    Similarly, if a = b = c = d = e = f = 6, g = h = i = 1, x = 1, and y = z = 3

    then only isolates G–I (1max = 2) might be considered isogenic (any other pair

    of isolates would yield 1min ≥11).

    associated environments (Stasiewicz et al., 2015). The PFGE

    patterns suggested reintroduction due to observed diﬀerences.

    Patterns unique to single retailers or single states supported

    persistence or clonal spread. However, the WGS analysis revealed

    that the observed PFGE diﬀerences were caused by a single

    mobile element, suggesting persistent contamination. Identifying

    Sekse et al.

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    clonal isolates from diﬀerent food-associated environments

    emphasize the importance of strong epidemiological data in

    traceback of foodborne outbreaks.

    Both SNP-based approaches and cgMLST yield a high

    discriminatory power and are reproducible for comparison of

    isolates. A prerequisite for detailed typing methods is a clear

    understanding of what makes two bacteria isogenic (belong to the

    same strain or clonal lineage; Figure 5). Lack of harmonization

    complicates the conclusive linking of clinical and food isolates,

    epidemiology and tracing and tracking of contamination in food

    processing facilities. Expert opinions will depend on the bacterial

    species and how SNPs are calculated (whole, core or extended

    genome). A prerequisite when performing reference-based SNP

    analysis is the availability of good quality reference genomes from

    strains closely related to the target strain(s). Unfortunately, in

    case of outbreaks due to rare variants of the causative agent, such

    reference genomes are not always available. This is true even

    for some variants of pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella spp. and L.

    monocytogenes.

    Metagenomics for Typing of Bacterial

    Communities and FBPs

    Isolates are often unavailable and may be diﬃcult to obtain. Most

    foods harbor complex and composite microbial communities.

    Contaminating pathogens are often heterogeneously dispersed

    and represent a minority of the microorganisms present in

    the sometimes complex food sample. Metagenomics approaches

    oﬀer the opportunity to investigate the composition of microbes

    in food matrices in toto without selective isolation, including the

    detection of non-viable and “viable but not cultivable” microbes

    (Bergholz et al., 2014), and will capture a broader range of

    the microbial community than classical microbiology. Most of

    the numerous HTS metagenomics studies report on 16S rDNA

    analysis, i.e., what we refer to as metataxonomics. This approach

    has proven useful for identiﬁcation of bacteria, phylogenetic

    studies and characterization of bacterial communities in diﬀerent

    foods, water and other environments (Mayo et al., 2014;

    Kergourlay et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2015). However, the 16S

    rDNA has limited resolution power and cannot be used to detect

    non-bacterial taxa. Reliable 16S rDNA based classiﬁcation of

    bacteria rarely extends beyond phylum, group or genus level

    (Livezey et al., 2013). A few FBPs can be identiﬁed by 16S rDNA

    sequencing, but only exceptionally at the species level and never

    to pathotype. All Salmonella species are considered as pathogens

    (Jarvis et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015), but only two of the Listeria

    species known so far are pathogenic, i.e., L. monocytogenes and

    L. ivanovii. These species are partly distinguishable based on

    16S rDNA sequence. In contrast, 16S rDNA sequences cannot

    distinguish STEC from non-diarrheagenic or commensal E. coli.

    For identiﬁcation of STEC, detection of virulence-associated

    genes including the Shiga toxin- and intimin-encoding stx and

    eae genes will be essential for meaningful strain typing. Database

    limitations (not all relevant taxa and haplotypes represented +

    possible erroneous sequences and taxonomic annotations) and

    the common use of only a subsection of the 16S rDNA (missing or

    covering only some of the inter-strain variation) further reduces

    the ﬁtness of metataxonomics for FBP detection (Adeolu et al.,

    2016; Singer et al., 2016).

    Shotgun metagenomics of the entire DNA present in a sample

    oﬀers a more comprehensive insight into the microbial diversity

    of a sample with regard to the richness of microbial taxa at

    all levels, or with regard to the presence of gene families or

    biomarkers in general (Ferri et al., 2015; Blagden et al., 2016;

    Ranjan et al., 2016). Shotgun metagenomic approaches used

    for improved FBP detection have been tested in a few studies.

    Bioinformatics methods to distinguish two genomes of the same

    species in a complex sample are needed, but it seems possible to

    determine whether one or more FBP strains is involved (Leonard

    et al., 2016). In investigations where it is essential to detect a

    speciﬁc organism assumed present in low numbers in a complex

    matrix, culture-based bacterial enrichment is still necessary.

    Then, inevitably, an enrichment bias of the composition of the

    When screening of food products and even in outbreak

    investigations, the genome sequence of the speciﬁc FBP

    strain/strains is usually not available. HTS technology may be

    used to identify the genome sequence of the causative agent of the

    outbreak by de novo assembly of sequence reads from complex

    samples with high prevalence of the agent, e.g., clinical specimens

    or food samples (Figures 6, 7). Theoretically, the approach

    shown in Figure 6 can also be applied to control of food products

    by the manufacturers or enforcement authorities. However, the

    current costs and other resource requirements (skills, lack of

    standardized data analyses, time) prevent justiﬁcation of the

    approach for routine controls.

    In a retrospective study of the German/European STEC

    O104:H4 outbreak in 2011 it was demonstrated that such an

    approach could be used to identify the infectious agent in

    human fecal samples (Loman et al., 2013; Table 2). Forty-

    ﬁve fecal samples from patients were sequenced by shotgun

    metagenomics. Human DNA was subtracted in silico and

    assembly was performed to create environmental gene tags

    (EGTs). EGTs found in more than 20 of the fecal samples were

    selected for further analysis. The total outbreak metagenome was

    screened for sequence reads from healthy humans and matching

    EGTs were subtracted. A set of 450 outbreak-speciﬁc EGTs were

    then subjected to taxonomic analysis and almost 65% were

    assigned to the Enterobacteriales. The original metagenomics

    data sets were then used in an attempt to reconstruct the E. coli

    outbreak strain genome. Functional annotation conﬁrmed the

    presence of important strain-speciﬁc and virulence-associated

    genes, and ten samples had more than 10× coverage of reads

    mapped to the reference genome of the speciﬁc outbreak strain.

    The coverage was > 1 in 26 samples and Shiga toxin genes

    were detected in 27 of 40 STEC-positive samples. In some of

    the individual samples sequences from other human pathogens

    such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Clostridium diﬃcile were

    also identiﬁed. This study indicates the potential of shotgun

    metagenomic analyses for the culture-independent identiﬁcation

    of bacterial pathogens in samples with complex microbial

    composition.

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    FIGURE 6 | Reference guided metagenome sequencing based approach for

    identiﬁcation and characterization of pathogenic and outbreak associated

    strain(s). In case of an outbreak, fecal samples from patients are subjected to

    culturing, in order to isolate the outbreak strain. Patients are also interviewed
    in

    order to try to identify food products that may be the source(s) of infection.
    The

    metagenomes of stool samples, food products and cultured strains can then

    be amplicon sequenced (metataxonomics) or shotgun sequenced

    (metagenomics) and the data mapped to reference databases for identiﬁcation

    of virulence markers. Shotgun reads can also be assembled into larger contigs

    or genomes for identiﬁcation of pathogenic strains. The latter is facilitated
    if the

    sequence data are derived from single isolates. Black arrows indicate forward

    ﬂow direction of the analysis, while gray arrows indicate feedback changing

    the premises for earlier steps. Feedback from the sequencing analysis can be

    used to reﬁne and narrow the search for a speciﬁc FBP. If successful, the

    outbreak will be terminated. This review includes multiple examples of the

    application of the described approach to outbreak investigations.

    Shotgun Metagenomics for Food Surveillance and

    Control

    A selection of studies is described below and details are presented

    in Table 3. Tomatoes have been implicated in Salmonella

    outbreaks several times, but isolation of Salmonella from

    tomatoes has only been successful a few times. Ottesen et al.

    (2013) used shotgun metagenomics to describe taxa associated

    with pre-enrichment and throughout the enrichment steps of

    a protocol for Salmonella detection in environmental tomato

    samples (Table 3). DNA was extracted prior to enrichment

    and the remaining tomato samples were enriched overnight

    in a universal pre-enrichment broth and aliquots successively

    added to two diﬀerent growth media. The sequencing depth

    was insuﬃcient to capture the majority of the diversity within

    the samples. To achieve about 1× coverage of all genomes

    Ottesen et al. (2013) estimated that they would have needed

    approximately 250× more sequence data. Variation among

    samples suggested diﬀerences in the microbial community in

    the starting material of the samples. An important biological

    FIGURE 7 | Reference independent shotgun metagenome sequencing based

    approach for identiﬁcation and characterization of outbreak strain(s). In case
    of

    smaller outbreaks the possibility to compare metagenomes from affected

    people (patients) and healthy controls is limited. In these cases the availability

    of clinical isolates may be required to avoid exhaustive open ended

    bioinformatics (in silico) analyses, as exempliﬁed by Brzuszkiewicz et al. (2011)

    and Rasko et al. (2011). Environmental gene tags (EGTs) from metagenomes

    of people affected by the outbreak and controls (people not affected) can be

    compared in case of a larger outbreak, as exempliﬁed by Loman et al. (2013).

    In that study, EGTs present only in affected patients were characteristic of the

    outbreak strain and provided sufﬁcient information to near complete

    characterization of its genome. Scaffolds and in particular assembled

    genomes may and should be uploaded to reference database(s), for

    successive use in analytical approaches like those described in Figure 6.

    ﬁnding was the signiﬁcant enrichment of Paenibacillus sp.

    from uncultured to cultured samples. This taxon is known to

    inhibit and kill Salmonella. The study also identiﬁed a number

    of sequences as Salmonella-speciﬁc despite negative PCR and

    culture results when those samples were tested for Salmonella.

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    approaches showed that increased read length, contrary to what

    might be expected, reduced the ability to assign taxonomy.

    Others have made similar observations (Luo et al., 2012). It is not

    clear if this phenomenon is associated with database limitations.

    Jarvis et al. (2015) aimed to characterize the microbiota

    in cilantro (coriander leaves), and simultaneously identify

    Salmonella from the samples (Table 3). Metataxonomics based

    on sequencing of the 16S rDNA from 91 samples was

    complemented with shotgun metagenomics. Gram-negative

    Proteobacteria dominated in the cilantro samples before

    enrichment. After 24 h of enrichment the microbial composition

    had shifted to mainly Gram-positive Firmicutes, as described

    above for tomato (Ottesen et al., 2013). These ﬁndings suggest

    that the culture-based method should be optimized for the

    detection of the organisms of interest. Low detection of

    Salmonella by metataxonomics was thought to be due to low

    sequencing depth and/or reduced ampliﬁcation eﬃciency caused

    by imperfect match in one of the primers. Shotgun metagenomics

    was performed on six cilantro samples culture-positive for

    Salmonella (enriched samples), and variable levels of Salmonella

    were identiﬁed. The genomes of the Salmonella isolates from

    these samples were already fully sequenced and were therefore

    included in the reference database used in the similarity analysis.

    The variable levels of Salmonella detected after 24 h enrichment

    illustrate the challenge of detecting Salmonella in matrices with

    a complex microbial background. Again, the sequencing depth

    of the analysis and levels of contamination were reported to

    inﬂuence the ability to detect the suspected agent.

    Similarly,

    other

    species

    monocytogenes was observed until the end of the enrichment

    procedure (after 40 h) in a study on L. monocytogenes and

    associated microbiota in naturally contaminated ice cream

    (Ottesen et al., 2016; Table 3).

    Leonard et al. (2015) applied shotgun metagenomics to

    detection of STEC in bagged spinach (Table 3). Spiked samples

    with known concentrations of a STEC O157:H7 were sequenced

    and suﬃcient coverage of the genome required spiking with at

    least 10,000 colony forming units (CFU) of STEC per 100 g

    spinach followed by enrichment for 5 h to enable full pathogen

    characterization. However, enrichment for 23 h allowed the full

    pathogen characterization by shotgun metagenomics from as

    little as 10 CFU of STEC spiked into 100 g of spinach. Then,

    the sequencing coverage of the STEC strain was 184× and the

    consensus sequence after reference-based assembly covered the

    whole reference genome with only six gaps. However, reliable

    detection to low levels like 10 CFU of STEC per 100 g of spinach,

    required enrichment for at least 8 h. Then, approximately 2.9%

    of the reads could be mapped to the reference genome with

    coverage of approximately 10×. Leonard et al. (2015) concluded

    that this should be suﬃcient to enable DNA sequence-based

    determination of the serotype and essential virulence genes of the

    contaminating pathogen.

    The same team demonstrated the possibility to detect and

    identify STEC down to strain-level in spinach samples spiked at

    10 CFU/100 g of spinach using a variety of STEC strains (Leonard

    et al., 2016; Table 3). A shotgun metagenomics approach as

    described in the abovementioned study (Leonard et al., 2015)

    was applied. For microbial community analysis a database of

    unique 25-mers for species identiﬁcation was used. This k-mer

    approach could also diﬀerentiate between E. coli phylogroups

    and demonstrated presence of more than one E. coli phylogroup

    in some of the samples. Conserved chromosomal E. coli genes

    (2,542) were extracted from WGS data from the STEC strains

    used in the spiking experiment as well as the metagenomic

    assemblies for whole genome phylogeny and SNP analysis. When

    the metagenomic assemblies only included the spiked STEC

    strain or the abundance of other E. coli was much lower than the

    spiked strain, the number of mismatches from the SNP analysis

    was less than 20, i.e., at or close to the intra-strain SNP-variability

    level (Figure 5).

    The above-mentioned studies indicate that at present, it is

    diﬃcult to achieve the large number of reads required for ≥1×

    coverage. These studies also showed how enrichment will bias the

    microbial composition, potentially favoring other taxa or strains

    than those intended for enrichment. Since multiple samples

    often need to be analyzed, it would be cost-eﬃcient if <1×

    coverage would be suﬃcient for most samples. K-mer approaches

    to screen samples after a minimum of enrichment (see e.g.,

    Ondov et al., 2016) to classify samples according to risk of

    presence of FBP, could be used to reduce the number of samples

    for which more in-depth sequencing and analysis is needed.

    Signiﬁcant correspondence between a mapped read and FBP

    speciﬁc reference sequences may also provide enough evidence

    even at <1× coverage (Spilsberg et al., 2017). Better sample

    preparation and enrichment protocols could also contribute.

    Results from metataxonomics and shotgun metagenomics could

    aid in optimization of such protocols.

    Viral Food Pathogens

    Complete genome assemblies for 7,409 viruses were available

    from NCBI on August 16th 2017 (an increase of nearly 500

    in 7 months). Viruses lack the genes necessary to transcribe

    protein-coding genes and replicate and reproduce, and therefore

    depend completely on the biological machinery of their host

    cells (Moreira and Lopez-Garcia, 2009). They are highly diverse

    and lack a common genetic constitution such as genes coding

    for ribosomal RNAs (Moreira and Lopez-Garcia, 2009), limiting

    the metataxonomic options. Some viruses can be cultured, but

    cultivation require advanced protocols, suitable host cells for

    propagation, and is time-consuming (Rodríguez-Lazaro et al.,

    2012). Viruses play a dual role in food pathogenesis. Some viruses

    like bacteriophages can aﬀect the virulence and population

    structure of microorganisms (Hayes et al., 2017). Other viruses

    can be FBPs themselves (Newell et al., 2010; EFSA, 2011). For

    a virus to be transmissible through foods, it must have some

    environmental stability and remain infectious for some time on

    or in a food matrix. As viruses are unable to replicate in the

    food matrix they must have a low infectious dose. Foodborne

    viruses are commonly shed in large amounts by a fecal route

    and viral contamination of foods is primarily via human fecal

    material (Rodríguez-Lazaro et al., 2012). Normal cooking or

    frying inactivates viruses. Food sources of infections are typically

    raw foods like fresh produce, soft berry fruits, herbs, shellﬁsh,

    ready-to-eat products in general and undercooked meat or foods

    served cold that are contaminated by an infected food-handler

    post cooking (Halliday et al., 1991; Hedberg and Osterholm,

    1993; de Wit et al., 2003; Fiore, 2004; EFSA, 2011, 2015a). Most

    viruses that can infect through a foodborne route can also utilize

    a person-to-person infectious route. Many outbreaks, potentially

    the majority, are simultaneously propagated via combined

    person-to-person and foodborne infectious routes. Food and

    water associated transmission is also suspected to enhance

    the spread of zoonotic viruses and facilitates the occurrence

    of zoonotic events, e.g., through the handling of bushmeats

    (Nieuwenhuijse and Koopmans, 2017 and refs. therein). The viral

    FBP load is often low and heterogeneously dispersed in the food

    matrix while it is high in clinical patients. It is not trivial to

    distinguish between foodborne and person-to-person infections,

    unless initial cases are identiﬁed and analyzed. The reporting

    and surveillance of foodborne viruses is limited, and disease

    symptoms can be very similar for some viruses and for other

    viruses diﬀer substantially between infected individuals. All this

    results in low documentation of the real impact and diversity of

    foodborne viruses (Nieuwenhuijse and Koopmans, 2017).

    The most notable FBP viruses are norovirus (NoV), hepatitis

    A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) which are all positive-

    sense, single-stranded, non-enveloped RNA viruses, and the

    double-stranded RNA rotavirus (RV) (Newell et al., 2010; EFSA,

    2011). Severe acute and Middle East respiratory syndrome (SARS

    and MERS) and Ebola viruses are examples of other (zoonotic)

    RNA viruses suspected to be transmissible via food (Newell et al.,

    2010; Nieuwenhuijse and Koopmans, 2017 and refs. therein).

    Most FBP viruses are RNA viruses and require special sample

    processing and nucleic acid extraction methods in contrast to the

    vast majority of bacteriophages, which are double-stranded DNA

    viruses.

    Viruses, and in particular RNA viruses, evolve rapidly, both

    via genetic drift and in response to active selection pressures

    (Holland et al., 1982). Detection and genotyping with PCR

    approaches, including metataxonomic HTS approaches, can

    therefore fail. Particular sample processing steps can signiﬁcantly

    improve the probability of detection, e.g., by concentration of

    the viruses and/or removal of interfering substances [reviewed

    in Hartmann and Halden (2012); see also (EFSA, 2011)].

    Detailed understanding of virus stability, inactivation times and

    temperatures is lacking due to limitations in model systems

    (Cook, 2013).

    Outbreak Investigations

    Isolates of viruses are rare in clinical settings, but clinical samples

    from viral outbreaks can contain high titers of the causative

    virus strain(s). The starting points for outbreak investigations

    are therefore availability of clinically derived samples. Due to

    the relative heterogeneity of samples compared to isolates, the

    analytical approaches derive from metagenomics approaches.

    The small genome size and high mean coverage per nucleotide,

    however, usually allows for characterization at strain level.

    The severity of HAV infection varies strongly with age.

    HAV is endemic in regions with inadequate sanitation and

    limited access to clean water, creating population wide immunity.

    Contrastingly, regions with high quality sanitation and water

    supply can experience outbreaks of hepatitis A unless broad

    scale vaccination has been performed. Nearly 300,000 persons

    were infected in a clam-related epidemic of HAV in Shanghai

    in 1988 (Halliday et al., 1991) while 1,589 were reported

    infected, including 2 casualties, in a recent outbreak in Europe

    associated with frozen berries (Severi et al., 2015). In a recent

    epidemiological case study, a single food product was associated

    with a HAV outbreak (Collier et al., 2014; Table 2). HAV was

    extracted from serum and fecal samples from 120 patients.

    Metataxonomics targeting a 315 bp HAV fragment yielded

    117 (98%) positive for HAV genotype IB. Of these, 99 (85%)

    were identical in the 315 bp sequenced segment. Attempts to

    isolate HAV from the food product (frozen pomegranate arils

    imported from Turkey) were unsuccessful. This demonstrates

    the challenge of establishing etiologies. Chiapponi et al. (2014)

    analyzed two samples of frozen berries from two apparently

    unrelated HAV outbreaks in Italy, and successfully detected

    HAV by reverse transcription, quantitative PCR (Table 2). RNA

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    was then extracted from the two samples and complete sub-

    genotype IA HAV genomes of 7,398 and 7,393 nucleotides,

    respectively, were obtained by a combined RNAseq and amplicon

    HTS strategy. Chiapponi et al. were able to link the two outbreaks

    and also link the food derived sequences to an existing patient

    derived sequence by ≥99.9% nucleotide identities.

    RV primarily infects children, is the most common source

    of gastroenteritis among infants (Desselberger, 2014) and is

    estimated to cause approximately 5% of total child deaths

    worldwide. An outbreak of foodborne gastroenteritis in Japan in

    2012 caused by RV was probably associated with consumption

    of raw sliced cabbage (Mizukoshi et al., 2014; Table 2). Samples

    from patients and food handlers were positive for RV. The study

    combined a broad spectrum of tests. One clinical, fecal sample

    was subjected to RNAseq. Sequences of all 11 segments of the

    viral genome, suﬃcient to determine the speciﬁc viral strain,

    were identiﬁed. No food, however, was assessed for presence of

    pathogens.

    HTS has accelerated the study of viral genetics, the assembly

    of novel viral genomes, and molecular epidemiology of viral

    outbreaks (Finkbeiner et al., 2009; Kundu et al., 2013; Wong et al.,

    2013; Smits et al., 2014; Ganova-Raeva et al., 2015). Studies of

    virus variants and quasispecies, analyses of vaccine escapes and

    drug resistance and viral evolution are now almost exclusively

    performed with HTS (Barzon et al., 2011).

    The etiology of virus-associated outbreaks will often remain

    unknown, for various reasons. Finding and characterizing the

    causative virus may not be included among the analytical

    objectives, or the applied method is not always suﬃciently

    sensitive. Other reasons for failure can be genetic drift in

    the virus, or an outbreak caused by a novel virus. Discovery

    of pathogens almost exclusively starts with samples from a

    diseased hosts and not a food matrix. There are many examples

    of investigations unraveling the etiology of viral outbreaks,

    but very few where the source of infection is identiﬁed or a

    speciﬁc food suspected and tested. It is diﬃcult to establish

    if an outbreak started as a food contamination event, and it

    is reasonable to assume that these events are underreported.

    The small genome sizes of viruses may partly explain why

    the massive capacity of HTS is rarely used in viral FBP

    outbreak investigations, as may the limited availability of eﬀective

    enrichment methods. The potency of new HTS platforms to

    provide valuable epidemiological information to large viral

    outbreaks was recently demonstrated by Quick et al. (2016),

    although on clinical isolates. A similar approach could be applied

    to epidemiological monitoring and source identiﬁcation in case

    of a foodborne outbreak.

    Surveillance and Control Purposes

    The viral titers in food products are commonly much lower

    than in clinical samples, and isolates are not available. As for

    outbreak investigations the approaches applied for surveillance

    and control are metagenomics derived while the end-point is

    strain characterization.

    Aw et al. (2016) used assembly of RNAseq and shotgun

    metagenomics reads (mean contig size 680 bp) and mapping

    to a database of viral reference genomes on samples from ﬁeld

    grown and retail lettuce (Table 3). A small fraction of the reads

    corresponded to RV and other viruses that infect humans. In the

    study, 16S rDNA metataxonomic screening was used to verify

    absence of contaminating bacterial DNA.

    Fernandez-Cassi et al. (2017) used RNAseq and mapping to

    examine the viral contamination of fresh parsley plants irrigated

    with fecally tainted river water (Table 3). A small fraction (<1%)

    of the reads was related to FBPs, including among others HEV

    and NoV.

    NoV is extremely contagious, and can cause large outbreaks

    of gastroenteritis (de Wit et al., 2003). NoV is the no. 1 cause of

    diarrheal disease and mortalities in the world (Pires et al., 2015)

    and the leading source of foodborne illness in the USA (Scallan

    et al., 2011). The etiology is reviewed elsewhere (Moore et al.,

    2015). Imamura et al. (2016b) used HTS to characterize NoV

    diversity in shellﬁsh from two commercial producers in Japan,

    using a combination of RNAseq on virus suspensions and PCR

    enriched targeted sequencing (genotyping approach similar to

    metataxonomics; Table 3). NoV genotypes GI.3 and GI.4 were

    most prevalent and identiﬁed in a surprisingly high proportion

    of 20–25% of the samples. This proof of concept study could

    not actually address the diversity of NoV in single shellﬁsh as 3

    individuals were pooled to one sample prior to analysis to obtain

    suﬃcient starting material. The same genotyping approach

    was applied to a study of the eﬃciency of removing NoV

    from shellﬁsh by depuration (Imamura et al., 2016a; Table 3).

    Depuration is used to decontaminate commercial shellﬁsh. The

    study demonstrated that depuration is insuﬃcient with respect

    to NoV.

    Fungal Food Pathogens

    On August 16th 2017, there were 2,515 genome assemblies

    and 29 complete fungal genomes available from NCBI. So far,

    there are very few examples of application of HTS to studies

    of epidemiology and virulence of fungal FBPs (Billmyre et al.,

    2014; Lee et al., 2014; Litvintseva et al., 2014, 2015; Vaux et al.,

    2014). Only two published studies relate to speciﬁc cases of fungal

    food pathogenesis (Lee et al., 2014; Vaux et al., 2014). Molecular

    typing of fungal isolates and mycobiotas in relation to FBD is

    almost exclusively metataxonomic, but usually limited to PCR

    ampliﬁcation of one or a few genetic loci followed by Sanger

    sequencing with exceptional examples of MLST analysis in the

    published literature (e.g., Byrnes et al., 2010; Desnos-Ollivier

    et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015c). The relevance of fungi as FBPs

    is debated, signiﬁcantly lower than that of bacteria and viruses,

    but possibly also understudied.

    Plants are commonly infected in the ﬁeld by “ﬁeld fungi.”

    Some of these produce toxic metabolites and may consequently

    cause disease when plant derived products are consumed (Lee

    et al., 2015; Stoev, 2015). Typical examples are Fusarium

    spp. on cereal grains, producing zearalenone, fumonisins and

    trichothecenes (e.g., deoxynivalenol, T-2 and HT-2 toxin), and

    Penicillium spp. on fruits, producing patulin. Other fungi

    infect a broad range of food and feed products during

    storage (“post-harvest fungi”). Typical examples are Aspergillus

    spp. and Penicillium spp., producing acute or chronically

    toxic compounds such as aﬂatoxins, ochratoxins and citrinin,

    Sekse et al.

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    and multiple antimicrobials with indirect health eﬀects via

    modulation of the gut microbiota (Gillings et al., 2015; Stoev,

    2015). Some mycotoxins are persistent to food processing

    (EMAN, 2015). They can exacerbate the infections with a wide

    range of non-fungal and fungal pathogens (Antonissen et al.,

    2014; Stoev, 2015), and it is hypothesized that mycotoxins may

    contribute to fungal infections (mycoses; Withlow and Hagler,

    2016).

    Several fungi are opportunistic, infective FBPs (Clemons et al.,

    2010; Iriart et al., 2010; Gurgui et al., 2011; Kazan et al., 2011;

    Benedict et al., 2016). Invasive fungal infections are primarily

    a problem in immunocompromised people (Brown et al., 2012;

    Bitar et al., 2014; Benedict et al., 2016). Reported examples of

    veriﬁed foodborne fungal infections are sparse (Benedict et al.,

    2016), and the problem is perhaps under-investigated. Hitherto,

    there is only one example of the use of HTS to investigate a fungal

    FBP outbreak. We suspect that the investigation of several other

    outbreaks or sporadic cases of fungus associated FBD reported in

    the literature (Benedict et al., 2016) could have beneﬁted from

    application of HTS approaches similar to those described for

    other FBP taxa in this review.

    Outbreak Investigation

    As with bacteria the starting points for fungal foodborne

    outbreak investigations are usually clinically derived isolates.

    Both strain characterization and metagenomics approaches can

    be used and are described in the literature, but only one published

    example applied HTS.

    Mucoralean fungi cause mucormycosis (zygomycosis), fatal

    fungal infections in humans whose incidence has been increasing

    lately (Roden et al., 2005; Spellberg, 2012). Gastrointestinal

    mucormycosis is rare and thought to be secondary to ingestion of

    fungi (Roden et al., 2005). In 2013 a strain of Mucor circinelloides

    f. circinelloides, the most virulent subspecies of M. circinelloides,

    was found as a contaminant in a batch of yogurt in the USA

    (FDA, 2013). More than 200 consumers became ill, although no

    fatalities were recorded (Lee et al., 2014). The aﬀected consumers

    were immunocompetent. An isolate obtained from a yogurt

    container was subjected to WGS in order to characterize its

    genetic potential to cause signiﬁcant infections, and to establish

    its genetic relationship to other strains of M. circinelloides (Lee

    et al., 2014; Table 2). A reference genome assembly was obtained

    from a strain of M. circinelloides isolated from human skin

    (Findley et al., 2013). Reads from the yogurt isolate were mapped

    to the reference genome for SNPs analysis. Comparison with a

    third isolate of a Mucor sp. using whole-genome alignments, and

    pathogenicity studies in murine models contributed to verify the

    pathogenicity of the yogurt strain. No clinical isolate from the

    outbreak was included in this study.

    Parasitic Food Pathogens

    Parasites are a diverse (polyphyletic) group of small animals or

    animal-like Eukaryotes, and their pathogenic potential is less

    frequently linked with metabolites and more frequently with their

    energy consumption and predation on host tissues than bacteria

    and fungi. World-wide, more than 100 species of foodborne

    parasites cause disease in humans (Orlandi et al., 2002). Complete

    or draft genome assemblies were available from NCBI for at

    least 40 of these species on August 16th 2017. Globalization, i.e.,

    the movement of people, animals and food and feed increases

    the risk of moving and spreading parasites that are originally

    endemic, to new countries and hosts (Robertson et al., 2014). The

    lack of suitable enrichment methods for parasites, as opposed

    to most of the known bacterial and fungal FBPs, means that

    recovery/isolation steps are particularly important (Robertson

    et al., 2014). This also suggests that molecular detection can

    be useful to monitor presence, distribution and epidemiology,

    as well as the eﬃciency of clinical treatments after parasite

    infections.

    Published studies applying HTS technologies to parasites are

    with few exceptions limited to characterization of genomes and

    transcriptomes, a topic not covered here. These studies, however,

    provide for detailed insight into the genetics of adaptations to

    specialized parasitism, and provide urgently needed reference

    sequence data for detection and identiﬁcation purposes and clues

    to possible target/drug combinations (e.g., Tsai et al., 2013; Foth

    et al., 2014; Young et al., 2014; Barratt et al., 2015).

    The presence of a multitude of other taxa and the frequently

    low abundance of parasites or derived DNA in clinical fecal

    samples challenge the detectability and may prevent eﬀective

    sampling and puriﬁcation of DNA for detection of parasites.

    Specialized protocols may be required to purify and enrich

    the parasite relative to a background matrix such as food or

    feces. Improved sample preparation and enrichment methods are

    discussed later.

    Parasites are Eukaryotes with substantially more genetic

    similarity to their human and animal hosts than Bacteria. The

    size of parasite genomes (10–1,000 Mbp) ranges from 10× the

    size of bacterial genomes and up to nearly the size of the human

    genome. New databases are in development, collecting genomic

    information for various parasites (Martin et al., 2015). The lack

    of annotated genomes and transcriptomes has been a major

    obstacle to the eﬀective use of HTS for detection of parasites.

    Molecular discrimination is dependent on detailed knowledge of

    genomes and genetic variation. However, many of the parasites

    are detectable by visual, macro- or microscopic inspection, and

    this is likely to be a more cost-eﬃcient approach in many

    instances.

    Outbreak Investigation

    The intraspeciﬁc variation in virulence among foodborne

    parasites is, to our knowledge, not reported to be high or

    signiﬁcant. Combined with the large genome size of Eukaryotes,

    this suggests that metataxonomic approaches can be suﬃcient for

    detection and outbreak investigations.

    More than 200 seafood poisoning cases of unknown etiology

    were reported in Japan from 2008 to 2010. Victims commonly

    reported to have ingested raw Paralichthys olivaceus (a ﬂounder).

    Kawai et al. (2012) therefore extracted total DNA or RNA from

    frozen P. olivaceus ﬁlets for shotgun metagenomics and RNAseq

    (Table 2). In parallel, muscle tissue was sieved to recover spores

    from suspected parasite infections. The presence of spores and

    18S rDNA from Kudoa septempunctata in the ﬁsh samples was

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    observed. The pathogenicity of this myxosporean was conﬁrmed

    in suckling mice and house musk shrews.

    Vectors of Foodborne Pathogens

    In addition to pathogens naturally associated with the food

    producing organisms such as gut microbes, dermal yeasts and

    bacteria, plant pathogenic fungi, etc. many of the most severe

    food pathogeneses are caused by incidental transfer from animal

    vectors (pests; Olsen et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2013). The Food

    and Drug Administration has identiﬁed the 22 most common

    pests contributing to the spread of FBD in the USA (Olsen et al.,

    2001). Four of these are rodents (mouse and rat species), while

    the remaining 18 are insects (cockroaches, ants and ﬂies). The

    traditional approach to detect and identify these is microscopy.

    Recently it was proposed to use metataxonomics by sequencing

    of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) as a

    faster, more reliable, sensitive and cost-eﬃcient approach (Jones

    et al., 2013). COI metataxonomics can be performed using HTS

    (see Figure 4) and may therefore suit as an attractive approach

    to screen routinely for presence of these vectors in raw materials

    for food production, to reduce the risk of introducing pathogens

    in the production. Vectors other than, or in addition to the 22

    identiﬁed by Olsen et al. (2001) may be identiﬁed as particularly

    relevant, e.g., in other parts of the world. The introduction of

    additional sequence targets in an HTS based metataxonomic

    screening should be feasible (Lammers et al., 2014; Leray and

    Knowlton, 2015; Arulandhu et al., 2017) despite the limitations

    of COI and metataxonomic approaches in general (Deagle et al.,

    2014; Staats et al., 2016; Arulandhu et al., 2017).

    Other Applications of HTS with Potential

    Relevance to FBPs

    The discovery and characterization of biosynthetic gene clusters

    in microorganisms is radically facilitated with the availability

    of HTS (Cacho et al., 2015). Secondary metabolites are often

    toxic, and many of the microorganisms producing them are FBPs.

    Characterization of the biosynthetic pathways provides a basis for

    faster detection of agents producing the metabolites, as well as

    for interception of undesirable biological eﬀects and exploitation

    of the biosynthetic pathways for production of new bioactive

    compounds.

    Direct shotgun metagenomics on DNA puriﬁed from

    microorganisms isolated without enrichment culturing is an

    attractive approach. Such an approach applied to clinical,

    polymicrobial urine samples was found to have comparable

    identiﬁability of bacteria as more conventional and much

    more time consuming approaches (Hasman et al., 2014). The

    complexity of such urine samples may be comparable to that

    of some food matrixes. Several approaches to data analysis

    were taken. First: identiﬁcation of microorganisms by presence

    of speciﬁc k-mer motifs identiﬁed in a database of complete

    bacterial genomes. Secondly: alignment based subtraction of

    host-DNA derived reads and estimation of relative bacterial

    species distribution. Third: mapping of reads against a larger

    database of complete and draft bacterial, archaeal, fungal,

    protozoan and viral genomes. Finally, MLST and resistance gene

    identiﬁcation performed against relevant databases. In a follow

    up study, direct shotgun metagenomics on toilet waste samples

    from long-distance ﬂights was used to identify bacteria and

    antimicrobial resistance genes (Petersen et al., 2015) by mapping

    of reads to the abovementioned databases.

    Host-speciﬁc genetic markers may be present in strains of

    pathogenic and non-pathogenic taxa, and then hold potential for

    source tracking (Gomi et al., 2014). See also Franz et al. (2016) for

    a more detailed discussion on source attribution.

    DISCUSSION

    Acknowledging the Importance of Sample

    Preparation

    A major challenge for detection of FBPs in complex matrixes is

    the recovery of the organism or its genes. Foods are physically

    and chemically complex matrices hosting complex microbial

    communities. The extraction and puriﬁcation of DNA from the

    samples is of major importance as the presence of inhibitors

    may hamper the analysis further down the line (Ceuppens et al.,

    2014; Moore et al., 2015). The sample storage conditions and

    preparation steps can introduce taxonomic biases linked to

    recovery (Ceuppens et al., 2015; Menke et al., 2017). Similar or

    even stronger eﬀects on the microbiome and RNA population

    of samples are predictable, as also the intraspeciﬁc diversity and

    gene expression can be aﬀected. The size of isolated/puriﬁed

    nucleic acid fragments is also relevant. Longer fragments are

    usually superior and complementary to shorter fragments for

    genome assembly. The purity and relative concentration of target

    isolated nucleic acids aﬀect their detectability and certainly their

    quantiﬁability (Holst-Jensen et al., 2003). Diﬀerent taxa and life

    stages of potential pathogens require diﬀerent treatments for

    detachment from substrates and complex structures, recovery

    and lysis. Protocols required for extraction and puriﬁcation of

    DNA from strongly attaching, bioﬁlm-forming taxa with tough

    cell walls can cause shearing of nucleic acids of other relevant

    taxa, yielding undesirably short fragments or totally degraded

    RNA/DNA. The stability of nucleic acids is a critical parameter,

    and this topic is reviewed by Ceuppens et al. (2014). Enrichment

    processes required to achieve the necessary target concentration

    can also bias the post-enrichment microbial composition in

    undesirable ways, as illustrated with Salmonella spp. in examples

    discussed earlier (Ottesen et al., 2013; Jarvis et al., 2015).

    Examples of non-culturing based enrichment of particular

    organisms include size based ﬁltering, buoyancy, aﬃnity based

    columns or immuno-magnetic separation (Hadﬁeld et al.,

    2015). Molecular enrichment can be achieved by subtraction

    hybridization (Galbraith et al., 2004) and various combinations of

    digestion with restriction enzymes, adapter ligation and sequence

    speciﬁc ampliﬁcation (Leichty and Brisson, 2014; Arulandhu

    et al., 2016).

    Speciﬁc Challenges Related to Molecular

    Analyses

    Ability to discriminate viable/infective agents from dead/non-

    infective agents and to obtain isolates of the agent(s) from food

    samples for comparison purposes is often important (Ceuppens

    Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org

    17

    October 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 2029

    Sekse et al.

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    et al., 2014; Forbes et al., 2017). Molecular analytical methods

    can potentially circumvent need for enrichment culturing and

    further selective steps for the detection of many of the most

    important FBPs, but the issues of viability, recovery and LOD

    remain critical. Transcriptomics or use of propidium monoazide

    prior to sequencing are options to discriminate living from

    dead cells (Weinmaier et al., 2015). There is no harmonized

    requirement for detection and/or identiﬁcation of an FBP by

    HTS, neither with respect to the number of reads, coverage of a

    speciﬁc diagnostic target motif, minimum length of (assembled)

    contig or maximum number of mismatches. Depending on

    the choice of actual minimum performance parameters and

    associated acceptance values it is possible to calculate the

    probability of detection (POD) of relevant target(s) and perform

    a statistical comparison of the POD to the actual observations

    (Holst-Jensen et al., 2016; Spilsberg et al., 2017). This would

    provide clues to the probability and reliability of ﬁndings. POD

    calculations performed prior to analyses can be useful to assess

    the cost-eﬃciency of alternative approaches. HTS is generally

    not quantitative, and complementary tools are needed to verify

    the LOD and recovery. Direct sequencing of nucleic acids from

    a clinical or food derived sample can be faster than culture-

    dependent analytical approaches. However, successive analysis

    of HTS data, necessary for interpretation, may be too time-

    consuming to render HTS really competitive in many cases. For

    bacteria in particular, the combination of limited enrichment

    culturing and fast HTS with (semi-)automated bioinformatics

    is currently the most optimal, realistic option that can provide

    very detailed information while simultaneously oﬀering suﬃcient

    sensitivity and speed. For those FBPs that cannot be enriched

    by culturing, future pipeline developments may improve the

    situation, at least for certain types of matrixes and scenarios.

    Harmonization and Validation of HTS

    Approaches

    The use of diﬀerent technologies and methods negatively aﬀect

    the comparability of results (Junemann et al., 2013), as does lack

    of harmonized terminology and data interpretation (Lambert

    et al., 2017; Taboada et al., 2017). Recent studies have tried to

    overcome this variability in end-point results by establishing

    standard WGS data sets from outbreaks with Salmonella, STEC

    and L. monocytogenes (Timme et al., 2015) and a benchmarking

    dataset consisting of 101 whole genome sequences from one

    E. coli hypermutator strain (Ahrenfeldt et al., 2017). Use of

    these data sets is proposed to facilitate standardization and

    harmonization of bioinformatics pipelines (Timme et al., 2015;

    Ahrenfeldt et al., 2017).

    Traditional approaches to standardization and validation

    cannot be directly applied to HTS approaches. There is for

    example no common cognition as to what is required for

    “identiﬁcation” of a FBP, such as the number of organism-

    speciﬁc reads (positive calls), sequence depth (conﬁdence), LOD,

    etc. for each platform and protocol, or number of diﬀerences

    distinguishing isogenic from non-isogenic isolates (Figure 5).

    There are, however, several eﬀorts to improve the situation.

    Guidelines for harmonization of clinical testing by application

    of HTS have been published and may provide useful guidance

    also to other sectors including FBP detection (Gargis et al.,

    2012, 2015; Weiss et al., 2013; Aziz et al., 2015). The Global

    Microbial Identiﬁer (GMI) was initiated in 2011 (GMI, 2011;

    Aarestrup et al., 2012). The background for this initiative

    was the high number of microbiological isolates that are

    characterized annually with very diverse and expensive typing

    systems, the increasing number of infectious diseases with global

    epidemiology requiring rapid detection and identiﬁcation of

    microbial agents, the likelihood that microbiological laboratories

    (primarily clinical) will have DNA sequencers available in the

    foreseeable future, and that the likely future limiting factor is not

    the HTS cost but the assembly, processing and data handling

    in a standardized way to make the information useful (GMI,

    2011). In 2015 the GMI launched the ﬁrst HTS proﬁciency testing

    scheme in this respect (GMI, 2015; Moran-Gilad et al., 2015).

    Recent progress by GMI is reported by Taboada et al. (2017). The

    World Organization for Animal Health also recently launched

    its ﬁrst standards for HTS, bioinformatics and computational

    genomics (OIE, 2017). Two other examples are the International

    Organization for Standardization’s initiative to standardize WGS

    for typing and genomic characterization (ISO/TC 34/SC 9/WG

    25) and the initiative to standardize the format of HTS derived

    SNP data (in a cancer context; Pipan and Kunaj, 2015),

    respectively.

    Results Interpretation

    HTS can generate a vast amount of data describing the microbial

    community of foods. When technical issues such as speed and

    standardization of laboratory and bioinformatics methods are

    improved, HTS and especially shotgun metagenomics may ﬁnd

    applications in routine analysis of food, also for control purposes,

    as it has already done in clinical settings. Interpretation of the

    results is an important issue, for both the agri-food industry and

    the competent authorities, but also how to act on the results

    (Lambert et al., 2017; Taboada et al., 2017).

    In the quality control of products and production lines,

    the detection of a pathogen, a genus that includes pathogenic

    species, and/or speciﬁc virulence genes/factors may, but will not

    necessarily lead to withdrawal of the product or lead to decisions

    to decontaminate the entire production line. The decision will

    depend on the speciﬁc context, i.e., the speciﬁc combination of

    pathogen marker, how well characterized the pathogen is, the

    type of product and the intended use. Quantitative data may

    also play a role, but sometimes are not or cannot be made

    available. Legal requirements can direct the decision processes. In

    the European Union (EU), both food safety criteria and process

    hygiene criteria are listed with details on sampling plans, limits,

    analytical reference methods and stage where the criterion applies

    (European Commission, 2005). Similarly, the safety of the food

    supply chain in the USA is regulated (FDA, 2011).

    The application of WGS in microbiological risk assessments

    of foods is largely unexplored and faces important challenges.

    The number of hazards increase exponentially when zooming

    from serovars or serotypes to genotypes. The translation of

    multidimensional genotypic data into reduced information on

    phenotypes to ultimately generate a measure of risk that matches

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    the requirements of food safety authorities and policy makers is

    therefore necessary (Franz et al., 2016). The presence or absence

    of speciﬁc genetic markers in a bacterial isolate or in a sample

    can direct the acceptance or rejection of a particular product.

    Furthermore, speciﬁc detection of FBP-markers may only be

    required within a narrow concentration range. For example, the

    observed presence of the STEC-associated virulence genes stx1 or

    stx2 in ground beef can lead to rejection or at least to particular

    caution and further examination to preclude the presence of

    STEC. We suggest that the observed background level of E. coli

    can provide a basis for decision in the case of STEC. The presence

    of E. coli itself is undesirable and un-tolerable background levels

    of E. coli, e.g., ≥ 104 CFU g−1 should lead to rejection. Thus,

    we believe it is most critical to ensure that the POD for STEC

    (markers) is acceptable within the entire range of concentrations

    at tolerable background levels, e.g., POD ≥ 99% at < 104 CFU

    E. coli g−1. We suggest that such an approximation can be used

    to guide both method developments and the enrichment eﬀorts

    needed to obtain conclusive data. The infectious dose of FBPs

    vary, and for some FBPs it can be < 100 cells (Tilden et al., 1996;

    Tuttle et al., 1999; Hall, 2012) and must be considered for this

    type of calculation.

    Recently, it has been questioned if all protists and helminths,

    historically thought of as “parasites” are indeed parasites (Lukes

    et al., 2015). Growing evidence of the diverse functional roles

    that speciﬁc bacteria can take on in humans, has forced us to

    acknowledge that beneﬁcial and pathogenic may be two sides of

    the same organism, and that it must be understood in the broader

    contexts of ecology, symbiosis and diversity, among others.

    Collecting data on the entire microbial communities associated

    with their hosts may provide for better understanding of the

    functional interplay between hosts and hosted microorganisms,

    though so far no clear trend is emerging (Martin et al., 2015).

    In the future, perhaps, by learning more aided by HTS studies,

    it will be possible to stimulate beneﬁcial and prevent pathogenic

    behavior by microorganisms with broad phenotypic potentials.

    Capacity Challenges

    Low Sequencing Costs, but High Costs Overall

    HTS has profound impacts on both academic research and

    practical diagnostic and clinical surveillance. Despite this, there

    are several obstacles to its full adaptation in the routine

    detection of FBPs. The ideal HTS solution for the detection

    of FBPs should be rapid, accurate, operable, and economic.

    Obstacles include the purchase and implementation of the HTS

    platforms, but perhaps more importantly the subsequent data

    analysis and results interpretation (Loman et al., 2013; ECDC,

    2015b). Sequencing costs have declined exponentially in the

    past decade, a development expected to continue. However,

    also costs associated with sample collection and preparation,

    nucleic acid extraction and puriﬁcation, as well as any other

    steps in the preparation of sequencing libraries, sequencing,

    data management and downstream analyses must be considered

    (Sboner et al., 2011). As long as the rapid decline in the

    cost of data generation is not matched by a corresponding

    reduction in data storage, maintenance and processing costs,

    there will remain a substantial economic barrier preventing the

    full implementation of HTS in research and routine for FBP

    identiﬁcation.

    Computational Capacity is a Major Hurdle

    HTS requires large computational capacities, i.e., various tools

    for data storage and data analysis, including data management,

    quality control, mapping and alignment, de novo assembly,

    scaﬀolding, gene annotation, metagenomics and biological

    signiﬁcance interpretation (Cuccuru et al., 2014; Mayo et al.,

    2014). These bioinformatics tools, particularly their proper usage

    and output interpretation appear as an impenetrable barrier

    facing almost all scientists in either ﬁelds of food science and

    microbiology lacking or having weak bioinformatics background.

    A substantial eﬀort will therefore be required to train relevant

    staﬀ in use of these tools (Taboada et al., 2017). The application

    of HTS in FBP research and surveillance is also impeded or

    slowed down by the complexity of diﬀerent formats of diverse

    software tools and limitations of computational capacities (Li

    et al., 2012; Xia et al., 2012; Cuccuru et al., 2014; Mayo et al.,

    2014). Several integrative frameworks consisting of publicly

    available research software and speciﬁcally designed pipelines

    are available for visualizing, querying and downloading the data

    released, and for HTS data processing and analysis for diverse

    microorganisms (Li et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012; Cuccuru

    et al., 2014; Taboada et al., 2017). We believe it is essential

    that a corresponding user friendly web-based framework for

    FBPs detection using HTS is created. To fulﬁll this purpose, a

    close and eﬀective collaboration between diﬀerent scientists from

    related ﬁelds is urgently needed (Stapleton, 2014). These should

    jointly develop more automatic and reliable bioinformatics tools

    for sequencing reads’ quality control (Edgar and Flyvbjerg,

    2015), data compression and extraction (Wang and Zhang, 2011;

    Lassmann, 2015), data analysis on cloud computation (Kwon

    et al., 2015), and downstream analysis (Davis et al., 2015; Gweon

    et al., 2015; Müenz et al., 2015; Ratan et al., 2015; Wang et al.,

    2015a).

    Database Limitations on Access and Contents

    The establishment of a reference database for each major

    FBP species or subspecies poses yet another challenge. An

    accurate and complete reference database for all major FBPs

    is fundamental to epidemiological investigations and design

    of pathogen detection assays. The genome sequence is the

    prerequisite for understanding the molecular basis of a given

    phenotype of a FBP. Thus, genome sequencing is invaluable

    in advancing our understanding of virulence mechanisms

    and epidemiology of FBPs. Many complete or draft genome

    assemblies of the most common FBPs have been released

    (Mellmann et al., 2011; Timme et al., 2012; Schmitz-Esser

    and Wagner, 2014; Quick et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015). This

    development is rapidly progressing and open data sharing

    including uploading of sequence data to public high-quality

    databases should be encouraged by all stakeholders. The

    availability of reference genomes is expected to speed up

    diagnosis and shorten FBD outbreaks, thus promoting public

    health. Additional complementary eﬀorts are needed for more

    endemic FBPs.

    High Throughput Sequencing of Foodborne Pathogens

    Cost-Efﬁciency of Data Generation

    The massive capacity of HTS can be utilized to ﬁnd a

    causative agent or other target of relevance by unbiased ultra-

    deep sequencing, but this “brute force” approach will generate

    massive non-target data and, with current sequence pricing,

    is only applicable to research applications. Late availability of

    interpretable data can be a drawback of HTS, depending on

    the protocols used (Loman et al., 2012; Reuter et al., 2013;

    Quick et al., 2015). Quick et al. (2015) demonstrated (on

    Salmonella) that the time to answer in a hospital outbreak can

    be reduced signiﬁcantly without impact on the results using draft

    shotgun metagenomics by rapid MiSeq sequencing, compared

    to standard protocols for MiSeq and HiSeq. The same study

    also demonstrated that samples could be assigned to species

    level within 20 min, serotype within 40 min and whether the

    isolate was part of the outbreak in less than an hour using the

    MinION sequencing technology and a mapping approach. With

    alignment-free bioinformatics the speed of analysis is further

    improved (Ondov et al., 2016). Third generation sequencing

    platforms can report sequences in real-time and this opens

    the possibility to selectively sequence only the nucleic acid of

    interest (Loose et al., 2016). That could permit more cost-eﬃcient

    use of the sequencing capacity. These examples illustrate some

    recent improvements to the potential of HTS in management of

    outbreaks.

    Global Imbalance in Capacity vs. Needs

    The populations in developing countries and rural areas are more

    commonly struggling with FBPs than the inhabitants of major

    cities in developed, Western countries. The access to advanced

    analytical technologies is inversely distributed. HTS technologies

    are only exceptionally developed for point-of-care and in-ﬁeld

    applications, but recent examples of outbreak investigations of

    Ebola and Zika viruses using the MinION (Quick et al., 2016,

    2017) indicate that more robust and portable platforms may be

    available in the foreseeable future. However, even with access to

    the sequencers, the access to necessary consumables, computer

    capacities including databases, and competent manpower will

    likely remain obstacles to the implementation of HTS based

    analytical methods for many years. This is a serious challenge

    that must be solved in order to ensure that initiatives to build up

    global, collaborative networks and systems to cope with emerging

    FBPs are successful.

    CONCLUSION

    Despite

    the

    obvious

    beneﬁts

    associated

    with

    potential

    independence from culturing, and the broad spectrum and

    level of detailed characterization of targets that can be detected

    simultaneously, we believe that in a short perspective HTS

    is unlikely to ﬁnd application outside the most advanced

    laboratories. The reductionist tradition prevails in many

    laboratories, i.e., of testing analytically for single agents,

    in particular in the food sector. Detailed sequencing based

    characterization of reference strains and representative clinical,

    food and environmental samples is still in its relative infancy,

    with many FBP species still practically missing in the databases,

    and few species where the range of genetic diversity is close to

    completely characterized. However, as HTS studies accumulate

    so does the data pool and the appreciation of the potentials of the

    technology. Third generation HTS technology, as exempliﬁed

    with the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer promise to

    permit on-site, long-read, real-time sequencing (Mikheyev and

    Tin, 2014; Greninger et al., 2015; Quick et al., 2015), but still

    struggles with laborious sample preparation requirements and

    high error rates. As these obstacles are mitigated, this type

    of technology will inevitably lead to a paradigm shift in FBP

    detection.

    \ considered an important ﬁeld with a signiﬁcant economic impact in several\n\
    countries. Due to the substantial population growth, meeting people’s dietary\
    \ needs has become a\nrelevant concern. The transition to smart agriculture has\
    \ become inevitable to achieve these food\nsecurity goals. In recent years, deep\
    \ learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks\n(CNN) and recurrent\
    \ neural networks (RNN), have been intensely researched and applied in various\n\
    ﬁelds, including agriculture. This study analyzed the recent research articles\
    \ on deep learning\ntechniques in agriculture over the previous ﬁve years and\
    \ discussed the most important contributions\nand the challenges that have been\
    \ solved. Furthermore, we investigated the agriculture parameters\nbeing monitored\
    \ by the internet of things and used them to feed the deep learning algorithm\
    \ for\nanalysis. Additionally, we compared different studies regarding focused\
    \ agriculture area, problems\nsolved, the dataset used, the deep learning model\
    \ used, the framework used, data preprocessing\nand augmentation method, and results\
    \ with accuracy. We concluded in this survey that although\nCNN provides better\
    \ results, it lacks in early detection of plant diseases. To cope with this issue,\
    \ we\nproposed an intelligent agriculture system based on a hybrid model of CNN\
    \ and SVM, capable of\ndetecting and classifying plant leaves disease early.\n\
    Keywords: precision agriculture; smart farming; deep learning; CNN; RNN; SVM\n\
    1. Introduction\nSmart agriculture refers to the broad application of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI), which\ninvolves big data, the internet of things (IoT), deep\
    \ learning, and many other digital tech-\nnologies [1]. As the world population\
    \ grows [2], a signiﬁcant increase in food production\nmust be realized [3]. Ensuring\
    \ the constant and consistent availability and quality of\nfood globally without\
    \ affecting natural ecosystems is challenging for modern technologies.\nDeep learning\
    \ is a new cutting-edge technology for image processing and data analysis. It\n\
    has yielded promising results, possesses enormous potential, and has been successfully\n\
    employed in various ﬁelds, including agriculture [4].\nIn recent years, deep learning-based\
    \ agricultural applications (smart agriculture) have\nachieved tremendous success;\
    \ this concerns managing different agrarian activities using\ndata acquired from\
    \ diverse sources. Various intelligent systems based on AI differ in their\nability\
    \ to record and interpret data and assist the farmers in making the right decisions\
    \ at the\nright time. Data can be recorded using installed IoT nodes (sensors),\
    \ processed by any deep\nlearning method, and imposed decisions on operational\
    \ areas through actuators. Other\nstate-of-the-art technologies, such as remote\
    \ sensing geographic information, global satellite\npositioning, and automated\
    \ computer control, augment the AI system in monitoring and\nmanaging agriculture\
    \ in real-time.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 5919. https://doi.org/10.3390/app12125919\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 5919\n2 of 20\nFurthermore,\
    \ AI-based smart agriculture can be utilized to schedule optimum re-\nsources\
    \ such as fertilizer, pesticides, and water, thereby minimizing pollution and\
    \ opera-\ntional/ production costs and maximizing production. As AI can assist\
    \ in the early detection\nand prevention of plant diseases, halting their spread\
    \ would require the application of\nfewer medications; this reduces environmental\
    \ contamination signiﬁcantly [5]. The contin-\nuous provision of agronomic inputs,\
    \ such as water, nutrients, and fertilizers, is critical for\nplant health, growth,\
    \ and yield [6]. The absence of any of these inputs may cause biotic and\nabiotic\
    \ stress. The decision to apply the right amount of a particular resource at the\
    \ right\ntime by considering the current situation and future predictions is possible\
    \ only through AI.\nThis research studied the utilization of AI and deep learning\
    \ in agriculture and its future\npotential. We also investigated the agricultural\
    \ parameters monitored by IoTs and used\nthem to feed the deep learning algorithms\
    \ for further processing.\nThis paper presents a survey of newly developed systems\
    \ in smart agriculture using\ndeep learning techniques. The motivation for preparing\
    \ this survey stems from the impor-\ntance of deep learning applications and innovative\
    \ solutions that deep learning techniques\ncan provide in solving agricultural\
    \ problems. The use of deep learning techniques in smart\nagriculture is relatively\
    \ recent and in the process of progress and continuously gaining\npopularity in\
    \ recent publications. Therefore, we have highlighted the contributions made\n\
    by deep learning techniques to address the problems of smart agriculture in data\
    \ processing\nand decision making. One of the main issues we found while surveying\
    \ the recent research\nstudies is the lack of early detection and classiﬁcation\
    \ of plant leaf diseases. We present\na proposed system for solving this issue\
    \ using a hybrid deep learning model based on a\nconvolutional neural network\
    \ and a support vector machine.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows.\
    \ The research methodology is explained\nin Section 2, and Section 3 brieﬂy introduces\
    \ the deep learning technology, and its applica-\ntions are discussed in Section\
    \ 4. Units 5 provides the technical analysis of studied papers,\nwhile detailed\
    \ discussions are given in Section 6. The shortcomings found in this survey\n\
    are mitigated by proposing a new hybrid system provided in Section 7. Finally,\
    \ this article\nis concluded in Section 8.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn recent\
    \ years, smart agriculture has ﬂourished in several areas. Furthermore, deep\n\
    learning applications in smart agriculture have spread widely and yielded advanced,\
    \ satis-\nfactory results. This paper intends to survey and analyze deep learning\
    \ techniques and their\napplications in agriculture to be a modern and comprehensive\
    \ reference for researchers.\nThis survey work is conducted in three steps. The\
    \ ﬁrst step involved collecting\nrelevant research by searching keywords (agriculture,\
    \ deep learning, convolutional neural\nnetworks, recurrent neural networks, crop\
    \ monitoring, disease detection, and irrigation\nsystems). Keyword-based searches\
    \ were performed for journal and conference papers from\nthe IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect\
    \ scientiﬁc databases and the Web of Science and Google\nScholar scientiﬁc indexing\
    \ services. A total of 70 articles were collected that were later\nreduced to\
    \ 60, which presented some deep learning models. We studied these papers and\n\
    further narrowed the numbers to 40 papers that conducted deep learning experiments\
    \ and\nprovided some results. In the second step, the selected scientiﬁc papers\
    \ were analyzed and\ncompared in terms of:\n•\nThe areas of smart agriculture\
    \ that were focused on.\n•\nThe problems that they tried to solve.\n•\nThe deep\
    \ learning techniques and models used.\n•\nThe dataset used.\n•\nThe data preprocessing\
    \ and data augmentation methods that were used.\n•\nThe results in terms of accuracy\
    \ or precision.\nIn the third and last stage, we found that some weaknesses and\
    \ shortcomings existed\nin surveyed papers, and we tried to suggest some improvements\
    \ to overcome these issues.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 5919\n3 of 20\nAs an output\
    \ of this survey, we proposed a hybrid deep learning model consisting of CNN\n\
    and SVM that is expected to improve existing models’ performance and working range.\n\
    3. Deep Learning\nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning and AI, and is\
    \ essentially a neural\nnetwork with three or more layers. These neural networks\
    \ aim to mimic the activity of\nthe human brain; however, they fall far short\
    \ of the human brain’s ability to learn from\nlarge amounts of data. While a single-layer\
    \ neural network can provide approximate\npredictions, additional hidden layers\
    \ can aid in optimizing and reﬁning the accuracy.\nMachine learning is a subﬁeld\
    \ of AI that allows the system to learn from concepts and\nknowledge without being\
    \ explicitly programmed. It begins with observations, such as face-\nto-face interactions,\
    \ to prepare for data features and trends and improve future results and\njudgments.\
    \ Deep learning is built on a combination of machine learning algorithms that\n\
    use multiple nonlinear transformations to model high-level abstractions in data\
    \ [7]. Feature\nlearning, or the automatic extraction of features from raw data,\
    \ is a signiﬁcant advantage\nof deep learning. Features from higher hierarchy\
    \ levels are produced by the composition of\nlower-level components [8]. Recurrent\
    \ neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) are two standard\
    \ deep learning networks used in agriculture.\n3.1. Convolutional Neural Network\
    \ (CNN)\nA CNN is a deep learning algorithm composed of multiple convolutional\

    \ \n3. Deep Learning \nDeep learning is a subset of machine learning and AI, and\
    \ is essentially a neu\nwork with three or more layers. These neural networks\
    \ aim to mimic the activit\nhuman brain; however, they fall far short of the human\
    \ brain’s ability to learn fro\namounts of data. While a single-layer neural network\
    \ can provide approximate\ntions, additional hidden layers can aid in optimizing\
    \ and refining the accuracy. M\nlearning is a subfield of AI that allows the system\
    \ to learn from concepts and kno\nwithout being explicitly programmed. It begins\
    \ with observations, such as face\ninteractions, to prepare for data features\
    \ and trends and improve future results an\nments. Deep learning is built on a\
    \ combination of machine learning algorithms \nmultiple nonlinear transformations\
    \ to model high-level abstractions in data [7]. \nlearning, or the automatic extraction\
    \ of features from raw data, is a significant ad\nof deep learning. Features from\
    \ higher hierarchy levels are produced by the comp\nof lower-level components\
    \ [8]. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutiona\nnetwork (CNN) are two\
    \ standard deep learning networks used in agriculture. \n3.1. Convolutional Neural\
    \ Network (CNN) \nA CNN is a deep learning algorithm composed of multiple convolutional\n\
    pooling layers, and fully connected layers [9]. It is a multi-layer neural network\
    \ b\nthe animal visual cortex [10]. CNNs are mainly used for image processing\
    \ and ha\nten character recognition. In several computer vision studies, CNNs\
    \ have been u\nimage classification, object detection, fragmentation of images,\
    \ voice recognition, \nvideo processing, and medical image analysis, among other\
    \ functions. A CNN a\nture typically consists of convolutional, pooling, and fully\
    \ connected layers [11]. F\nillustrates the architecture of CNNs, and the layers\
    \ are explained briefly: \n \nFigure 1. CNN architecture. \n3.1.1. Convolutional\

    \ in a features d\nmatrix, and various image variants are created by employing\
    \ different feature d\nlevels. The convoluted model is also trained with backpropagation\
    \ to achieve the\npossible error in each layer. The depth and padding are determined\
    \ by the error \nthe fewest errors [11]. The convolutional layer is responsible\
    \ for extracting visual f\nFigure 1. CNN architecture.\n3.1.1. Convolutional Layer\n\
    The convolutional layer is the most basic and the most signiﬁcant in a CNN. The\n\
    resulting pixel matrix for the supplied picture or object is twisted or multiplied\
    \ to build\nan activation map for the given image. The activation map’s main advantage\
    \ is that it\nstores all of the distinguishing qualities of a given image while\
    \ limiting the amount of\ndata that must be processed simultaneously. The data\
    \ is combined in a features detector\nmatrix, and various image variants are created\
    \ by employing different feature detector\nlevels. The convoluted model is also\
    \ trained with backpropagation to achieve the lowest\npossible error in each layer.\
    \ The depth and padding are determined by the error set with\nthe fewest errors\
    \ [11]. The convolutional layer is responsible for extracting visual features.\n\
    3.1.2. Pooling Layer\nIt is a crucial phase that attempts to minimize the dimensions\
    \ of the activation map\nfurther while simultaneously maintaining only the essential\
    \ features and minimizing the\nremarkable invariance. It, in turn, reduces the\
    \ number of learnable features in the model,\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 5919\n4 of\
    \ 20\nthereby contributing to addressing the overﬁtting issue. Pooling allows\
    \ a CNN to aggregate\nall the various dimensions of an image to recognize the\
    \ supplied object even if the form\nis warped or at a different angle. Pooling\
    \ can be carried out in multiple ways, including\nmax pooling, average pooling,\
    \ stochastic pooling, and spatial pyramid. The most frequent\nmethod used is max\
    \ pooling [11].\n3.1.3. Fully Connected Layer\nThis is the ﬁnal layer where the\
    \ neural network is fed. In general, the matrix is\nﬂattened before being handed\
    \ over to the neurons. Data are difﬁcult to follow after this\npoint due to numerous\
    \ hidden layers with changing weights for each neuron’s output. All\ndata reasoning\
    \ and computing occur here [11].\n3.2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nAn RNN\
    \ is a neural sequence model that performs exceptionally well on crucial tasks\n\
    such as language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation [12]. RNNs,\n\
    as opposed to traditional neural networks, take advantage of the network’s sequential\n\
    information; this attribute is critical in many applications where the structure\
    \ inherent in\nthe data sequence contains valuable information. For instance,\
    \ to understand a word in\na sentence, you must ﬁrst understand the context. Hence,\
    \ an RNN can be considered a\nshort-term memory unit that consists of the input\
    \ layer x, the hidden (state) layer s, and\nthe output layer y [10]. Figure 2\
    \ depicts the generic structure of an RNN. Long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) is an\
    \ RNN architecture built to simulate temporal sequences and their\nlong-term relationships\
    \ with more precision than ordinary RNNs [13]. Figure 3 depicts the\nLSTM architecture.\n\

    \ learning algorithms are being used in smart agriculture to monitor various\n\
    related parameters and observe them from anywhere in the world. We have found\
    \ in\nrecent surveys that mainly they studied the beneﬁt of deep learning in any\
    \ one of the\nagricultural applications. In this survey, we have given an overview\
    \ of the contributions\nof deep learning in the different known applications of\
    \ smart agriculture. We tried to\nanalyze which deep learning model is suitable\
    \ for which applications and which one is\nmore efﬁcient and effective, among\
    \ others. We have noticed that researchers’ interest\nis increasing in using the\
    \ CNN algorithm in plant disease detection and classiﬁcation\napplications, and\
    \ it has given tremendous results.\nWeather forecasting applications also use\
    \ the CNN algorithm very frequently because\nit is based on time series and offers\
    \ effective results. We investigated the different areas of\nsmart agriculture\
    \ and the applications in which deep learning is applied. Our ﬁndings are\nsummarized\
    \ in Table 1.\n4.1. Identiﬁcation/Classiﬁcation of Plant Disease\nDisease fungus,\
    \ microbes, and bacteria obtain energy from the plants on which they\ndwell, affecting\
    \ crop productivity. If not diagnosed in time, this can cause signiﬁcant\neconomic\
    \ losses for farmers. Pesticides used to remove pathogens and restore crop func-\n\
    tionality impose substantial ﬁnancial pressures on farmers. Excessive pesticide\
    \ usage\nalso results in environmental degradation and affects agricultural areas’\
    \ water and soil\ncycle [14]. Moreover, plant diseases impact the growth of particular\
    \ species; hence, early\ndetection of such stress is critical. Many deep learning\
    \ models (DL) have been deployed\nto identify and classify plant diseases. Deep\
    \ learning appears to possess considerable\npotential in terms of its increasing\
    \ accuracy over time. Many new DL architectures and\nimprovements/modiﬁcations\
    \ to existing ones are proposed. Various modern visualization\ntechniques are\
    \ being used to identify and classify the symptoms of plant illnesses [15].\n\
    In [16], the author provided a method for identifying and classifying banana diseases\n\
    based on the CNN model. It can assist the farmers in detecting the attacking illness\
    \ in\na timely, affordable, and swift manner. This system could detect two banana\
    \ diseases,\nSigatoka and speckle, by capturing a photo of an affected leaf and\
    \ using a deep neural\nnetworks model. The authors of [17] used another deep learning\
    \ model (AlexNet) to\nclassify the type of disease in plants through the leaves\
    \ pictures with high accuracy of\nresults. A deep learning hybrid model is presented\
    \ in [18] to classify the sunﬂower illnesses,\nincluding Alternaria leaf rot,\
    \ Downy mildew, phoma rot, and verticillium wilt. The author\nutilized the stacking\
    \ ensemble learning technique to develop a hybrid model of H.VGG-16\nand MobileNet.\
    \ They built their dataset using google photos, and their proposed model\nprovided\
    \ an accuracy of 89.2%, which they claimed was better than other models.\nThe\
    \ research presented in [19] studied and compared the results of ﬁve different\
    \ deep\nlearning models, including H. Vgg16, Vgg19, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, and\
    \ ResNet101V2,\nusing both simulated data and images obtained from rice ﬁelds\
    \ in the city of Gujranwala\nlocated in Pakistan. The ResNet50 model used an artiﬁcial\
    \ dataset and was given accuracy\nof 75 %, while the ResNet101V2 model had an\
    \ accuracy of 86.799 on the actual dataset.\nThe author of [20] developed a machine\
    \ learning-enabled mobile device for automating\nthe diagnosis of plant leaf diseases.\
    \ The developed system can classify 38 different types\nof illness using CNNs\
    \ as the underlying deep learning engine. The researchers gathered\nan image dataset\
    \ containing 96,206 photos of plant leaves from healthy and sick plants for\n\
    the CNN model’s training, validation, and testing. The user interface was created\
    \ as an\nAndroid mobile application that farmers could use to photograph sick\
    \ plant leaves. The\ndisease category was then displayed, along with the 90 %\
    \ conﬁdence. This technique is\nmeant to provide farmers with greater chances\
    \ of keeping their crops healthy and avoiding\nthe excessive use of fertilizers\
    \ that are harmful to the crops.\nIn paper [21], a transfer learning pre-trained\
    \ deep neural network model was used\nfor crop disease prediction to learn essential\
    \ functions such as leaf characteristics directly\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 5919\n\
    6 of 20\nfrom the input data. They investigated various CNN topologies (ResNet,\
    \ MobileNet, Wide\nResNet, and DenseNet) and deep learning methodologies. The\
    \ results revealed that the\nsuggested method outperforms earlier methods in terms\
    \ of memory and precision.\nAnother CNN technique to detect, classify and identify\
    \ plant disease is presented\nin [22]. It has proved output result accuracy ranging\
    \ from 91 to 98 % and an average\nperformance of 96.3% for thirteen different\
    \ plant diseases. It can also differentiate between\nhealthy and unhealthy leaves\
    \ and distinguish them from their backgrounds. The author\nof [23] used a CNN\
    \ model in agriculture to recognize and classify plant images and achieved\nthe\
    \ highest accuracy of 99.58 %. They employed off-the-shelf ConvNet representations\
    \ to\nevaluate the plant growth of a maize crop.\nSVM classiﬁer is proposed in\
    \ [24], which involves an autonomous plant disease\nidentiﬁcation using image\
    \ analysis with a 94 % accuracy. The experiment was carried out\nwith a dataset\
    \ of 500 plant leaf images taken from thirty different native plant species.\n\
    The other deep learning studies such as [25–35] developed automatic plant detection\n\
    and recognition systems to classify nine different diseases by deﬁning a single\
    \ healthy class.\nAll these studies employed the PlanVillage dataset for training\
    \ and testing purposes and\nachieved an accuracy of >91%.\n4.2. Crop Identiﬁcation/Classiﬁcation\n\
    Once a crop is properly cured of all kid of illness and stress, the next critical\
    \ step for\nthe former is to harvest it at the proper time and market demand.\
    \ Deep learning can also\nplay an essential role in making a harvesting plan by\
    \ considering different parameters such\nas soil type/quality/pH, weather forecast\
    \ (including temperature, precipitation, humidity,\nand hours of sunlight), and\
    \ fertilizers schedule. A research paper [36] is one of this kind.\nA multi-layer\
    \ DL architecture was proposed in [37]. It can classify different crop species\n\
    in a land-covered area by taking satellite imagery from numerous sources. An ensemble\n\
    of 1-D and 2-D CNNs beat the RF classiﬁer and a chorus of MLPs, facilitating a\
    \ more\naccurate classiﬁcation of summer crops, mainly maize and soybeans. CNN\
    \ models offer\nmore than 85% classiﬁcation accuracy for main crops (wheat, corn,\
    \ sunﬂower, soybeans,\nand sugar beets).\nThe authors in [38] suggested a deep\
    \ residual CNN (ResNet-18) for weed and crop\ndetection using unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicle (UAV) photos. The goal was to obtain appropriate\nperformance on an\
    \ embedded device while retaining the same ResNet-18 model features\nas the basis\
    \ for quick UAV mapping. This model enabled the detection and mapping of\nweeds\
    \ during UAV ﬂight operations and attained an overall accuracy of 94% [38].\n\
    In [39], the authors provided a deep learning classiﬁcation system for various\
    \ plants\nusing the Seed-lings dataset, which contains photos of approximately\
    \ 960 different plants\nfrom 12 species at various stages of growth. Three pre-trained\
    \ models, InceptionV3, VGG16,\nand Xceptionare were used for the said purpose,\
    \ but Xception was proven to be the best\nclassiﬁer with an accuracy score of\
    \ 86.21%.\nA prototype for the CNN model was developed in a study [40] to classify\
    \ different\nﬂowers. It used the transfer learning technique, VGG16, MobileNet2,\
    \ and Resnet50 archi-\ntectures to classify publicly available ﬂower datasets,\
    \ and it produced good results and\nacceptable accuracy. A hybrid MLR-ANN model\
    \ for effective agricultural yield forecasting\nwas proposed in [41]. It takes\
    \ input from MLR intercept and coefﬁcients as weights and\nbias. A feed-forward\
    \ artiﬁcial neural network with a backpropagation training technique\nestimates\
    \ the yield of rice crops. The obtained results showed that the hybrid MLR-ANN\n\
    model outperforms the traditional models in terms of accuracy.\nAnother deep kind\
    \ of learning algorithm for classifying plant images to identify\nplant species\
    \ based on leaf photos was presented in [42]. CNN and transfer learning both\n\
    were used as classiﬁcation techniques. The experimental ﬁndings demonstrated that\
    \ the\nsuggested model effectively extracted and classiﬁed characteristics from\
    \ images. The article\nreferenced [43,44] presented EVI time series to categorize\
    \ summertime crops using deep\nneural networks. Two new DL models were developed\
    \ called Landsat enhanced vegetation\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 5919\n7 of 20\nindex\
    \ (EVI) time series and long short-term memory (LSTM). Three gradients boosting\n\
    machines were used as a classiﬁer, including random forest (RF), XGBoost, and\
    \ support\nvector machine (SVM). This model claimed to outclass performance in\
    \ terms of overall\naccuracy and ability to identify different crop kinds.\nA\
    \ study [45] developed a novel crop-classiﬁcation method by combining optimal\n\
    feature selection and the hybrid CNN-RF networks using multi-temporal Sentinel-2\
    \ images\nto classify summer crops. In this study, optimal features were selected\
    \ using the OFSM\nmodel, and both temporal and spatial dimensions were used to\
    \ get satisfactory classiﬁcation\nresults in terms of the overall accuracy up\
    \ to 94.27%.\nAnother interesting paper [46] developed a deep neural network using\
    \ the R-CNN\nconcept and was able to identify the fruit type and can classify\
    \ healthy and unhealthy fruits.\nThe model achieved the optimum result with a\
    \ grading accuracy of over 99% and 97.86%\nusing CNN and R-CNN methods.\nIn [47],\
    \ the faster region-based convolutional neural network (FRCNN) framework\nwas\
    \ designed to produce a plant detection model and estimate plant densities across\
    \ a UAV\northomosaic. The results show that accurate two-dimensional maps of plant\
    \ density can be\nconstructed from UAV imagery highly correlated to essential\
    \ yield components.\n4.3. Identiﬁcation of Weeds\nIdentifying all the weeds on\
    \ a farm is difﬁcult and typically unnecessary. However,\naccurately recognizing\
    \ enormous weeds can be a critical ﬁrst step in effective control. At\ncertain\
    \ phases of growth, different weed species may appear remarkably similar. Still,\n\
    they differ considerably in their life cycle, mode of reproduction, effects on\
    \ plants, and\nresponsiveness to control tactics. In [48], an RGB + NIR camera\
    \ created a CNN-based\nclassiﬁcation system to detect and distinguish sugar beet\
    \ plants from weeds over natural\nﬁelds using an RGB + NIR camera. The system\
    \ gave good accuracy in seeing sugar beet\nplants among the weeds.\nThe work [49]\
    \ proposes a classiﬁcation vision system to classify individual plants from\n\
    multi-plant images captured in natural corn ﬁeld environments. Therefore, a dataset\
    \ of\n15,240 images that contains nine plant species, grouped into the classes\
    \ Crop, NLW, and\nBLW, was generated. Images were captured under these natural\
    \ cornﬁeld environments,\nand plants were of different growth stages. A classical\
    \ approach to CNN carried out the\nclassiﬁcation of the plants in the dataset.\n\
    4.4. Identiﬁcation of Water Stress\nAgricultural production is heavily dependent\
    \ on water and is also increasingly ex-\nposed to water risks. Furthermore, it\
    \ is the most water-consuming sector, and a signiﬁcant\nwater polluter as spraying\
    \ pesticides and applying fertilizers can pollute both underground\nand surface\
    \ water resources. Therefore, improving water management in agriculture is\nessential\
    \ for ensuring the agricultural sectors are sustainable and productive. In this\
    \ regard,\narticle [6] proposed a convolutional neural networks model to identify\
    \ the water-stressed\nand typical areas in the maize crop ﬁeld. The performance\
    \ of the proposed framework has\nbeen compared with ResNet50, VGG-19, and Inception-v3,\
    \ and the results show that the\nproposed model gave better output with an accuracy\
    \ of 93%. While paper [50] developed\nand tested a novel deep learning-based pipeline\
    \ model for detecting phenotyping plant\nwater stress areas using pictures of\
    \ chickpea plant shoots.\nIn [51], a deep learning technique was proposed to recognize\
    \ water requirements from\naerial pictures of irrigation systems. This automatic\
    \ detection could aid in the management\nof the irrigation system, which reduces\
    \ the maintenance time and expense of the system.\nUsing the Mask R-CNN neural\
    \ network, the initial results suggested that it is possible to\nrecognize water\
    \ from images taken by a UAV. The goal was to ﬁnd and avoid malfunction-\ning\
    \ irrigation that could cause under or over-watering by the proper implementation\
    \ of\nirrigation plans.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 5919\n8 of 20\n4.5. Weather Forecasting\n\
    Weather information is becoming increasingly crucial in the emerging agriculture\n\
    sector, emphasizing accuracy and control while cultivating crops. The use of information\n\
    technology, which includes weather forecasts and other features such as satellite\
    \ and aerial\nimaging, GPS guidance, sensors, drones, variable fertilizer application,\
    \ and plant health\nindicators, is a crucial component of this technique.\nAuthors\
    \ [52,53] developed LSTM deep learning models to predict frost in plants by\n\
    measuring low temperatures. Despite the high computational cost of LSTM models,\
    \ they\nprovided excellent time-series prediction results to ﬁnd/expect ice in\
    \ the plants.\n4.6. Fruit Counting\nThe difﬁculty of identifying and counting\
    \ the fruits on trees is crucial in crop yield\nestimation in agriculture. Manual\
    \ counting is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The\nautomated crop counting\
    \ approach can help project yields and organize harvesting plans to\nincrease\
    \ productivity and proﬁt margin. In [54], a simulated model of a deep convolutional\n\
    neural network for yield estimation is developed and tested to know the exact\
    \ number\nof fruits. It used a modiﬁed version of Inception-ResNet architecture,\
    \ and experimental\nresults showed an average test accuracy of 91%. A comparison\
    \ of different research studies\nin terms of the study area, experiment conducted,\

    The agriculture sector needs to be modernized with state-of-the-art technologies\
    \ to feed\nthe rapidly increasing world population with bio food. Given the increasing\
    \ environmental\nproblems that negatively affect this sector, it was necessary\
    \ to move to the use of modern\ntechnologies to meet these challenges and issues\
    \ with high efﬁciency. Smart agriculture\nis a vast ﬁeld that includes a variety\
    \ of topics such as sensor development, parameter\nmonitoring, data collection,\
    \ network convergence and maintenance, sensor nodes cluster\nformation, cluster\
    \ head selection, data compression, and aggregation, security and integrity,\n\
    design and development of the expert system, artiﬁcial intelligence-based decision\
    \ making\nand many more.\nThe development of artiﬁcial intelligence and deep learning\
    \ in the past two decades\nhas dramatically increased the number of projects in\
    \ the ﬁeld of agriculture. The analysis\nhas shown that deep learning techniques\
    \ offer superior performance in most related work\nand yield better results than\
    \ traditional methods in this sector.\nSome critical factors that were ignored\
    \ can exert considerable inﬂuence on the decisions\nmade by any AI or deep learning\
    \ algorithm. We observed that crop, soil, environment, and\npest-related information\
    \ is collected using ﬁeld sensors before applying a deep learning\nalgorithm to\
    \ obtain the next course of action; however, other parameters, such as weather\n\
    forecasts, crop standard procedures, historical crop data, farmer input, and government\n\
    policies, are not taken into account while decisions are made.\nAppl. Sci. 2022,\
    \ 12, 5919\n16 of 20\n6.1. Advantages and Disadvantages of Deep Learning\nThe\
    \ advantage of deep learning is that features are automatically deduced and opti-\n\
    mally tuned for the desired outcome. Another beneﬁt is that the same neural network-based\n\
    approach can be applied to several different applications and data types. Furthermore,\
    \ the\ndeep learning architecture is ﬂexible and can be adapted to new problems\
    \ in the future.\nDeep learning also offers good generalization performance. While\
    \ it takes more time to\ntrain deep learning models than other traditional approaches,\
    \ its efﬁciency in testing is\nquite fast. One of the notable drawbacks of deep\
    \ learning is that it requires many datasets\nto give better performance, even\
    \ if data augmentation techniques are used. Few publicly\navailable datasets exist\
    \ in agriculture, and researchers need to develop their own sets of\nimages in\
    \ many cases. This can take many hours or days of work.\n6.2. Future of Deep Learning\
    \ in Agriculture\nAgriculture is one of the complex areas of application, as each\
    \ region has its climatic\nconditions, nature, and features that differ from the\
    \ other areas. Therefore, there is an\nurgent need for technology to distinguish\
    \ the elements of interest and analyze the collected\ndata. This requires a considerable\
    \ amount of data to explore, considering changes in real-\ntime. Therefore, in\
    \ this regard, deep learning is one of the most important technologies\nthat can\
    \ carry out these functions using appropriate algorithms such as CNN and RNN.\n\
    When an algorithm is fed with ﬁeld data, including climate parameters, soil types,\
    \ weather\npatterns, and other factors, it builds a probabilistic model before\
    \ making any decision.\nEarly and accurate identiﬁcation is essential in tracking\
    \ different diseases before bearing\nfood or ﬁnancial losses. After sorting through\
    \ images of sick plants spanning a decade, this\nalgorithm can determine the type\
    \ and severity of the disease. The same applies to the course\nof the weather.\
    \ The main advantage of a deep learning model is that the software creates\nthe\
    \ selected feature on its own without provision. Unsupervised learning makes us\
    \ better\nequipped and informed to work in the unpredictable and constantly changing\
    \ real-time\nenvironment. It is essential because the signiﬁcance of the IoT continues\
    \ to grow, and most\nof the data generated by humans and machines are unstructured\
    \ and unclassiﬁed. Deep\nlearning outperforms traditional methods, such as ANN,\
    \ SVM, RF, etc. Automatic feature\nextraction with deep learning models is more\
    \ efﬁcient than conventional feature extraction.\n7. Proposed System Architecture\n\
    The survey concluded that research involved in detecting and classifying plant\
    \ diseases\nused convolutional neural network models and object detection techniques\
    \ to detect and\nclassify plant diseases. Although these models give us high accuracy\
    \ results, there is a\ntendency for further improvement. Furthermore, these models\
    \ are lacking in the early\ndetection of diseases which requires more advancement\
    \ and hybridization to improve this\ndetection time, accuracy, performance, detection\
    \ time, and range of conditions. Hence, we\nproposed a hybrid model (CNN-SVM)\
    \ for the early detection of plant leaf diseases where\nmany drones captured images\
    \ will be used as the data set. Then this proposed hybrid\nmodel will process\
    \ the data and generate early decisions. Our model consists of three main\nparts\
    \ a CNN model with an attention mechanism applied and an SVM classiﬁer, as shown\n\
    in Figure 9.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 5919\n17 of 20\ndetection time, accuracy, performance,\

    \ main \nparts a CNN model with an attention mechanism applied and an SVM classifier,\
    \ as shown \nin Figure 9. \n \nFigure 9. The proposed system. \n7.1. The CNN Model\
    \ \nWe chose the ResNet50 to be the backbone of our CNN model. The model takes\
    \ a 256 \n 256 image as input and produces a vector of features. The proposed\
    \ deep learning \nmodel consists of four stages in all the surveyed articles,\
    \ each containing multiple residual \nblocks to increase the network’s performance.\
    \ They primarily use identity connections to \nprotect the network from vanishing\
    \ gradient problems. While the ResNet-50 model uti-\nlizes batch normalization\
    \ (BN) layers that help prevent overfitting. Each residual block \ncontains a\
    \ weight layer followed by a batch normalization layer and a “ReLU” activation\
    \ \nlayer, then another weight layer followed by another batch normalization layer.\
    \ Then we \nare planning to add the input x of the residual block, and then the\
    \ output of these layers \nf(x), the final output of the block will come after\
    \ a “ReLU” activation Layer as per Equation \n(1). \n\U0001D454ሺ\U0001D465ሻ ൌ\

    \ we know, \nSVM offers efficient results in high dimensional spaces and is effective\
    \ in cases where the \ntotal number of dimensions is larger than the total number\
    \ of samples. In addition, SVM \nFigure 9. The proposed system.\n7.1. The CNN\

    Support Vector Machine (SVM) will be our choice to replace the fully connected\
    \ layers\nin the proposed model. The ResNet50 model will be connected with the\
    \ SVM classiﬁer as\nthe feature vector from the CNN model will be the SVM model’s\
    \ input. As we know, SVM\noffers efﬁcient results in high dimensional spaces and\
    \ is effective in cases where the total\nnumber of dimensions is larger than the\
    \ total number of samples. In addition, SVM will be\nintensively employed in image\
    \ classiﬁcation scenarios and will achieve high classiﬁcation\naccuracy. SVM constructs\
    \ a hyperplane in multidimensional space in the proposed system\nto differentiate\
    \ varying classes.\n7.3. The Residual Attention Network\nThe residual attention\
    \ network will be constructed into a stack of multiple attention\nmodules in the\
    \ proposed system. Each attention module will be divided into the mask and\ntrunk\
    \ branches. The trunk branch will perform feature processing which any state-of-the-art\n\
    network structure can adapt. Attention modules will be used to make CNN learn\
    \ and focus\nmore on the critical information rather than on learning useless\
    \ background information.\n8. Conclusions\nIn this work, we analyzed recent research\
    \ efforts related to the use of deep learning\ntechniques in agriculture over\
    \ the past ﬁve years. The published important contributions,\nas well as the resolved\
    \ issues, were discussed. During this survey, we considered technical\ndetails\
    \ applied from the datasets used, deep learning models, work environment, data\n\
    preprocessing, data augmentation techniques, and results presented in the reference\
    \ ar-\nticles. Our ﬁndings indicate that deep learning performs better than other\
    \ typical image\nprocessing techniques but can improve considerably if speciﬁc\
    \ other parameters are con-\nsidered. Moreover, deep learning offers a high level\
    \ of accuracy and outperforms existing,\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 5919\n18 of 20\n\
    commonly used image processing techniques. In addition, we proposed a hybrid model\n\
    for the early detection of plant leaf diseases using deep learning techniques.\n\
    This work is helpful for researchers trying to experiment with deep learning and\
    \ apply\nit for solving various agricultural problems involving classiﬁcation\
    \ or prediction and those\nrelated to computer vision and image analysis and data\
    \ analysis in general. Furthermore,\nthis technique has yielded promising results\
    \ in its application in agriculture, leading to\nsmart and more effective solutions\
    \ for making agriculture more efﬁcient and sustainable.\nIn the future, we are\
    \ planning to develop the proposed hybrid deep learning system and\nevaluate its\
    \ performance in terms of accuracy.\nAuthor Contributions: Collecting and reading\

    \ Non-destructive and timely determination of leaf nitrogen (N) concentration\
    \ is urgently\nneeded for N management in pear orchards.\nA two-year ﬁeld experiment\
    \ was conducted in\na commercial pear orchard with ﬁve N application rates: 0\
    \ (N0), 165 (N1), 330 (N2), 660 (N3),\nand 990 (N4) kg·N·ha−1. The mid-portion\
    \ leaves on the year’s shoot were selected for the spectral\nmeasurement ﬁrst\
    \ and then N concentration determination in the laboratory at 50 and 80 days\n\
    after full bloom (DAB). Three methods of in-ﬁeld spectral measurement (25◦ bare\
    \ ﬁbre under solar\nconditions, black background attached to plant probe, and\
    \ white background attached to plant probe)\nwere compared. We also investigated\
    \ the modelling performances of four chemometric techniques\n(principal components\
    \ regression, PCR; partial least squares regression, PLSR; stepwise multiple\n\
    linear regression, SMLR; and back propagation neural network, BPNN) and three\
    \ vegetation indices\n(difference spectral index, normalized difference spectral\
    \ index, and ratio spectral index). Due to\nthe low correlation of reﬂectance\
    \ obtained by the 25◦ ﬁeld of view method, all of the modelling\nwas performed\
    \ on two spectral datasets—both acquired by a plant probe. Results showed that\
    \ the\nbest modelling and prediction accuracy were found in the model established\
    \ by PLSR and spectra\nmeasured with a black background. The randomly-separated\
    \ subsets of calibration (n = 1000) and\nvalidation (n = 420) of this model resulted\
    \ in high R2 values of 0.86 and 0.85, respectively, as well\nas a low mean relative\
    \ error (<6%). Furthermore, a higher coefﬁcient of determination between\nthe\
    \ leaf N concentration and fruit yield was found at 50 DAB samplings in both 2015\
    \ (R2 = 0.77)\nand 2014 (R2 = 0.59). Thus, the leaf N concentration was suggested\
    \ to be determined at 50 DAB by\nvisible/near-infrared spectroscopy and the threshold\
    \ should be 24–27 g/kg.\nKeywords: non-destructive; visible/near-infrared spectroscopy;\

    \ of the most effective ways to increase fruit yield and improve its\nquality.\
    \ Among the 17 essential nutrients required by plants, nitrogen (N) is one of\
    \ the key elements\nfor pear tree growth, fruit yield, and quality. Generally,\
    \ the N demand is relatively large compared\nwith that of other elements. However,\
    \ the positive response of tree vegetative and reproductive organs\nto added N\
    \ triggered a higher application of N fertilizer without paying more attention\
    \ to actual N\nrequirement of trees, which might lead to an excessive N status\
    \ in pear trees. The over-application of N\nnot only results in vigorous vegetative\
    \ growth and decreased sugar-to-acid ratio [1], but also increases\nSensors 2017,\
    \ 17, 538; doi:10.3390/s17030538\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017,\
    \ 17, 538\n2 of 15\nthe risk of nitrate leaching from soil, which contributes\
    \ to the eutrophication of surface waters and\ndegradation of drinking water quality.\
    \ An excessive soil N availability in summer may delay fruit\nmaturation, negatively\
    \ impact the total soluble solids (major component is soluble carbohydrate) in\n\
    fruit, and decrease plant tolerance to pests and diseases, such as psylla (Cacopsylla\
    \ pyri L.) on “Bartlett”\nand post-harvest blue mould (Penicillium expansum) on\
    \ “Conference” pears [2]. Synchronizing N\navailability with fruit N requirements\
    \ offers the potential to protect the environment without sacriﬁcing\nproduction\
    \ [3].\nTissue testing is one tool that can aid in fertilizer management by evaluating\
    \ N status and\nidentifying fruit requirements for additional N. The measurement\
    \ of traditional nutrient status by\ntissue testing was based on the destructive\
    \ sampling of leaves, branches and fruits, sometimes even full\ntree excavation\
    \ [4,5]. The determination of N concentration is labour-intensive and time-consuming\n\
    in addition to being cost prohibitive (elemental analyser method) and requiring\
    \ dangerous chemical\nreagents (Kjeldahl method) which may cause environmental\
    \ contamination. Recently, with the\nrapid development and improvement of spectroscopy\
    \ techniques, monitoring leaf reﬂectance or the\ntransmittance of radiant energy\
    \ can be considered a form of rapid, non-destructive tissue testing [6,7].\nVisible\
    \ near-infrared spectral reﬂectance data can be used to evaluate the leaf N concentration\
    \ and\nchlorophyll content of cucumber [8], tomato [9], oilseed rape [10] and\
    \ pear tree [11] using a speciﬁc\nregression method. However, these studies were\
    \ generally performed on detached leaves under\nlaboratory conditions without\
    \ considering variable leaf N status, threshold and diagnosis time,\nand rarely\
    \ considering about different models. Moreover, in-ﬁeld estimating leaf nitrogen\
    \ using\nhyperspectral data at canopy scale were mainly found on the trees or\
    \ crops [12,13]. Hence, research is\nrequired on developing a similar technology\
    \ for in-ﬁeld, non-destructive leaf hyperspectral sensing of\npear trees.\nUnder\
    \ steady laboratory conditions, spectral measurements are often conducted with\
    \ integrating\nsphere because both reﬂectance and transmittance of leaves can\
    \ be obtained at the same time. However,\nit’s too time-costing for the in-ﬁeld\
    \ measurement of leaf spectra. For an in-ﬁeld spectral measurement,\nmethod of\
    \ 25◦ bare optic ﬁbre was usually used in the situation of whole plant level/the\
    \ canopy\nmeasurement under the solar condition. If the leaf spectra were measured\
    \ with a plant probe,\nthe black background and the white background were found\
    \ to be both used and reputable in\nmany studies [14,15]. These in-ﬁeld measurements\
    \ mentioned above have their own advantages\nand disadvantages.\nFor one thing,\
    \ the solar condition is widely used for the in-ﬁeld spectral\nmeasurement owing\
    \ to the simple measuring device component but the light intensity is always\n\
    changeful; while an internal and calibrated light of the plant probe is considered\
    \ to be a steady\nlight source but the measuring time is limited by the battery\
    \ capacity during the ﬁeld operation.\nFor another, we are unable to remove the\
    \ dust on the adaxial surface and the underside of leaves,\nso that the spectra\
    \ obtained by using the leaf clip with black and white backgrounds should be\n\
    compared to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of spectral data. Besides, suitable\
    \ techniques should\nbe used to make use of hyperspectral data. The techniques\
    \ must deal efﬁciently with the strong\nmulti-collinearity present in the spectral\
    \ data and should not be too sensitive to sensor noise [16].\nThe methods such\
    \ as principal components regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR),\n\
    stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), and back propagation neural network\
    \ (BPNN) are found\nto be good chemometrics methods to dealing with the spectral\
    \ data [17,18]. In addition to these\nchemometric techniques, the remote sensing\
    \ community developed over the past four decades a wide\nrange of spectral indicators\
    \ (e.g., vegetation indices, red-edge indices), responding strongly to the main\n\
    vegetation biophysical variables, such as leaf area index and leaf pigmentation\
    \ [19–23]. A number\nof spectrometric studies have been undertaken on plant N\
    \ content monitoring using the vegetation\nindices and the red-edge [24–26]. However,\
    \ the four chemometric techniques (PCR, SMLR, PLSR and\nBPNN) and vegetation indices\
    \ for modelling the N concentration of pear leaves from spectrometer\ndata collected\
    \ in the ﬁeld have not been tested so far.\nSensors 2017, 17, 538\n3 of 15\nA\
    \ non-destructive estimate of yield was mainly conducted by collecting canopy\
    \ spectra of a\nsatellite platform and airborne hyperspectral scanners. Examples\
    \ included the prediction of biomass\nand yield of winter wheat under different\
    \ nitrogen supplies using spectral indices [27] and the grain\nyield prediction\
    \ using reﬂectance spectra of canopy [28]. However, there is a lack of sensors\
    \ on satellite\nplatforms with optimal spatial resolution to monitor orchard crops\
    \ at the tree scale [29]. Therefore, the\nestimation of fruit yield by the canopy\
    \ spectra in the orchard often had a low R2, for example 0.33 in\npeach [29] and\
    \ 0.58 in citrus [30].\nIn the present study, the best method to non-destructively\
    \ evaluate the leaf nitrogen concentration\nby in-ﬁeld visible/near infrared spectroscopy\
    \ will be established. In addition, the right time for yield\nestimation by the\
    \ leaf N status and the reference threshold of leaf N status for fertilization\
    \ decisions\nwill be ﬁnd out.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Plant Material and\
    \ Treatments\nA two-year ﬁeld experiment was conducted from 2014 to 2015 in a\
    \ commercial pear orchard in\nGaochun (Jiangsu Province, China; 32◦03′ N, 118◦46′\
    \ E). The experimental site has an annual mean\ntemperature of 15.9 ◦C and receives\
    \ 1157 mm of precipitation. The soil has a clay-loamy texture\nwith 69 mg·kg−1\
    \ alkali-hydrolysable nitrogen [31], 43 mg·kg−1 available phosphate by the method\
    \ of\nOlsen [32], 146 mg·kg−1 available potassium by the method of Sommers [33],\
    \ 17 g·kg−1 organic matter,\nand a pH 6.8 in water. Pear trees (Pyrus communis\
    \ L.) that had been managed by trellis cultivation\nin a 3 m × 5 m frame for 12\
    \ years were used in the ﬁeld experiment during the growing period\n(May to June).\
    \ Referring to common N fertilization amounts in the region (660 kg·N·ha−1), six\
    \ N\nfertilization treatments consisting of 0 (N0), 165 (N1), 330 (N2), 660 (N3),\
    \ and 990 (N4) kg·N·ha−1 as\nurea (46% N) were separately split-applied four times\
    \ (post-harvest, late autumn, pre-bloom stage and\nexpansion stage) at 20%, 40%,\
    \ 20%, and 20% of the total amount, respectively. Calcium superphosphate\n(12%\
    \ P2O5) was applied at 528 kg·ha−1 only in late autumn as base fertilizer. In\
    \ addition, for the\nquality of pear fruit, 990 kg·ha−1 of potassium sulphate\
    \ (45% K2O) was applied three times (late\nautumn, pre-bloom stage, and expansion\
    \ stage) at 40%, 20%, and 40% of the total amount, respectively.\nIn a completely\
    \ randomized block design, three replicates of three trees each were arranged\
    \ in\nthree alternate tree rows. The control comprised of ﬁve trees. From late\
    \ autumn 2013 to the post-harvest\nstage of 2015, fertilizer was applied to six\
    \ holes (30 cm wide × 30 cm deep) in a circle around each tree.\nThe standard\
    \ cultural practices used in local commercial production, including pruning, irrigation,\
    \ and\npest control were employed. Every season, the fruit crop load was manually\
    \ adjusted by large-scale\nthinning to ensure high commercial quality.\n2.2. Spectra\
    \ Collection\nAs reported by Tagliavini et al., the remobilization of nitrogen\
    \ ceased between petal fall and the\nbeginning of pear fruit development [34].\
    \ Nitrogen was transported into shoot leaves several weeks\nafter bloom; shoot\
    \ leaves are more dependent than spur leaves on spring N uptake. Therefore, the\n\
    N concentration in new shoot leaves is sensitive to the N supply and can be used\
    \ to evaluate the N\nstatus of the whole tree. The middle leaves of the year’s\
    \ spring ﬂush from the external side (east, south,\nwest, and north) of the canopy\
    \ were collected at 50 days (May) and 80 days after full bloom (80 DAB,\nJune)\
    \ for the spectral measurement. Eight or twelve leaves facing four directions\
    \ from each tree were\nmeasured to represent the N status of the whole tree. In-ﬁeld\
    \ spectral measurements were achieved\nusing a portable ﬁeld spectrometer FieldSpec\
    \ 3 (Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder, CO, USA).\nThe instrument covered wavelengths\
    \ of 350–1000 nm (with a sampling interval of 1.4 nm and a spectral\nresolution\
    \ of 3 nm) and 1000–2500 nm (with a sampling interval of 2 nm and a spectral resolution\
    \ of\n10 nm). The output spectral band number was 2151, and the interval of re-sampling\
    \ was 1 nm. Before\nmeasuring each tree, Teﬂon white standard (Spectralon, Labsphere\
    \ Inc., North Dutton, NH, USA) was\nSensors 2017, 17, 538\n4 of 15\nused to set\
    \ up the maximum reﬂectance (99.9%) conditions. The reﬂectance of each leaf was\
    \ determined\nfrom the measurement of leaf radiance divided by the radiance of\
    \ the reﬂective white standard. Three\nspectral measurement methods were compared:\
    \ (1) 25◦ bare ﬁbre under solar conditions, which was\nrestricted by weather (sunny,\
    \ cloudless days only, from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.); (2) a leaf-clip assembly\n\
    attached to a plant probe with an internal, calibrated light source (the transﬂectance\
    \ of each leaf was\ndetermined using the white background of the leaf-clip); and\
    \ (3) the black background of leaf-clip\nto determine absolute reﬂectance of each\
    \ leaf (Figure 1). Two central symmetrical points on the leaf\nadaxial surface\
    \ were designated as the measurement points on all leaves. The scan number at\
    \ a given\nposition was set to ﬁve, and the average value of 10 spectra was used\
    \ as the ﬁnal reﬂectance of the leaf.\nSensors 2017, 17, 538 \n4 of 15 \ntransflectance\
    \ of each leaf was determined using the white background of the leaf-clip); and\
    \ (3) the \nblack background of leaf-clip to determine absolute reflectance of\
    \ each leaf (Figure 1). Two central \nsymmetrical points on the leaf adaxial surface\
    \ were designated as the measurement points on all \nleaves. The scan number at\
    \ a given position was set to five, and the average value of 10 spectra was \n\
    used as the final reflectance of the leaf. \n \nFigure 1. The schematic diagram\
    \ of spectral acquisition by two methods. The reflectance measured \nwith the\
    \ black background (a); and the transflectance measured with the white background\
    \ (b). \n2.3. Modelling Methods \nBefore modelling, preprocessing methods were\
    \ used on the raw spectra. Wavelengths with very \nlarge atmospheric influence\
    \ were removed for the 25° field of view measurements under solar \nconditions.\
    \ Normalization was used on the raw spectra collected by the probe attached with\
    \ \nbackgrounds using Unscrambler X 10.3 (Camo Software AS, Oslo, Norway). Using\
    \ the spectral data \nand N concentration, we investigated the predictive power\
    \ of principal component regression (PCR), \nstepwise multiple linear regression\
    \ (SMLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), back propagation \nneural network\
    \ (BPNN), and vegetation indices (difference vegetation index, ratio vegetation\
    \ index, \nand normalized differential vegetation index). Full-spectrum methods\
    \ as PCR, PLSR, and BPNN use \nall available wavelengths simultaneously [16].\
    \ In contrast, SMLR selects useful wavelengths from the \navailable spectrum and\
    \ ignores the remaining wavebands during model application. \nThe PCR and PLSR\
    \ methods were analysed comparatively using Unscrambler X 10.3. The model \nobtained\
    \ the optimal number of factors by leave-one-out cross-validation and the mean\
    \ square error \nin calibration.  \nThe data compression stage of the SMLR consists\
    \ of selecting a combination of a few spectral \nbands as regression factors.\
    \ The regression factor matrix is then used to calculate the biophysical \nloadings\
    \ by ordinary least square. In the present study, the wavelengths were first regressed\
    \ \nsequentially against the biophysical variables. The wavelength with the highest\
    \ explained variance \nwas then chosen as the first regression factor. With this\
    \ first regression factor fixed, the next \nwavelength was chosen, and so on.\
    \ Forward and backward elimination were not investigated. SMLR \nwas calculated\
    \ by SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). \nThe back propagation neural network\
    \ (BPNN), based on principal component analysis (PCA), \nwas used to develop the\
    \ models for predicting the leaf N concentration. For the PCA-BPNN models, \n\
    PCA was performed first to extract information from the whole spectral regions,\
    \ and some principal \ncomponents which carried over 80% information of the original\
    \ dataset were used as the neurons of \nthe network input layer. Several network\
    \ architectures were tested by varying the number of neurons \nin the hidden layer\
    \ with different initial weights (at least 10 times). The optimal parameters of\
    \ the \ntarget error, the training rate, and the iteration were determined by\
    \ the least prediction error [35]. \nAs a baseline method, linear regression models\
    \ between N concentration and vegetation indices \n(DVI RVI and NDVI) were analysed\
    \ For the fast analysis and feature extraction from the observed\nFigure 1. The\
    \ schematic diagram of spectral acquisition by two methods. The reﬂectance measured\n\

    \ on the raw spectra. Wavelengths with\nvery large atmospheric inﬂuence were removed\
    \ for the 25◦ ﬁeld of view measurements under\nsolar conditions. Normalization\
    \ was used on the raw spectra collected by the probe attached with\nbackgrounds\
    \ using Unscrambler X 10.3 (Camo Software AS, Oslo, Norway). Using the spectral\
    \ data\nand N concentration, we investigated the predictive power of principal\
    \ component regression (PCR),\nstepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), partial\
    \ least squares regression (PLSR), back propagation\nneural network (BPNN), and\
    \ vegetation indices (difference vegetation index, ratio vegetation index,\nand\
    \ normalized differential vegetation index). Full-spectrum methods as PCR, PLSR,\
    \ and BPNN use\nall available wavelengths simultaneously [16]. In contrast, SMLR\

    \ the present study, the wavelengths were ﬁrst regressed sequentially against\n\
    the biophysical variables. The wavelength with the highest explained variance\
    \ was then chosen as\nthe ﬁrst regression factor. With this ﬁrst regression factor\
    \ ﬁxed, the next wavelength was chosen, and\nso on. Forward and backward elimination\
    \ were not investigated. SMLR was calculated by SPSS 20.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago,\

    \ and vegetation indices\n(DVI, RVI, and NDVI) were analysed. For the fast analysis\
    \ and feature extraction from the observed\ndatasets, we used the report by Yao\
    \ [36]. The reduced sampling method was used to construct a\ndifference spectral\
    \ index (DSI), normalized difference spectral index (NDSI), and ratio spectral\
    \ index\n(RSI). In this procedure, the spectral reﬂectance data were read at intervals\
    \ of 10 nm within the range\nof 350–2500 nm. With the duo matrix formulation,\
    \ all of the possible DSI, NDSI, and RSI based on\nany two individual bands at\
    \ the interval of 10 nm from 350–2500 nm were regressed against an N\nconcentration\
    \ linear equation. According to the changing coefﬁcients of determination (R2),\
    \ a contour\nmap of R2 was plotted. From this map, a sensitive spectral range\
    \ with a relatively high R2 was\nidentiﬁed. The vegetation index and BPNN were\
    \ calculated in MATLAB R2012b (MathWorks, Natick,\nMA, USA).\nThe quality of the\
    \ calibration model was evaluated using the following statistical parameters:\n\
    coefﬁcient of determination between predicted and measured N concentrations (R2),\
    \ root mean square\nerror in calibration (RMSEC), and root mean square error in\
    \ validation (RMSEV). As mentioned by\nSaeys [37], a calibration model with an\
    \ R2 value greater than 0.91 is considered to be excellent, whereas\nR2 between\
    \ 0.82 and 0.90 represents good prediction. A small difference between the RMSEC\
    \ and\nRMSEV values is also important to avoid ‘over-ﬁtting’ in the calibration\
    \ and validation phase [38].\n2.4. Data Pre-Treatment\nNo attempts were made to\
    \ reduce the number of input variables through feature selection in\norder to\
    \ compare the modelling accuracy of the seven methods. Before modelling, PCA was\
    \ used to\neliminate the outliers based on the spectral principal component analysis\
    \ of 720 samples [11]. We found\na large deviation in the spectra of most samples.\
    \ After elimination, 710 samples were divided into the\ncalibration set and the\
    \ validation set using a randomly-selected collection for analysis (Table 1).\n\

    \ Leaf Nitrogen Concentration and Yield Estimation\nThe total N concentration\
    \ of the leaf samples was measured analytically as a reference for the\nspectral\
    \ prediction models. After spectral measurements were taken, the leaves were picked\
    \ off the\ntree, sealed in valve bags, and taken to the laboratory for analysis.\
    \ All of the leaves were ﬁrst placed in\na forced-air oven at 105 ◦C for 30 min\
    \ and then dried to a constant weight at 70 ◦C for 48 h. The samples\nwere ﬁnely\
    \ ground (100 mesh) and analysed for the total nitrogen concentration using an\
    \ Elementar\nVario Macro CHN analyser (Elementar Analysensyteme GmbH, Hanau, Germany).\
    \ A standard citrus\nleaf sample (GBW10020) was included to ensure accuracy of\
    \ N concentration measurements.\nThe fruit number per tree was counted at both\
    \ the fruit expansion stage and the maturity stage\nto ensure the reliability\
    \ of fruit number. Sixteen pear fruits were collected per tree at maturity and\n\
    weighed to estimate the average single fruit weight per tree. The yield was calculated\
    \ by multiplying\nthe single fruit weight by the fruit number as kg per tree.\
    \ N concentration of each treatment was\nSensors 2017, 17, 538\n6 of 15\nobtained\
    \ by an average of three replications’ leaf N concentration. Moreover, we performed\
    \ polynomial\ncurve ﬁtting between the chemically-measured leaf N concentration\
    \ and the yield to ﬁnd the better\ntime estimating the yield.\n3. Results\n3.1.\
    \ Establishment of the Non-Destructive Measurement\nThe characteristics of the\

    of the spectra obtained using different methods followed roughly the same trend.\
    \ However, the spectra\nmeasured by the 25◦ ﬁeld of view method showed a low signal-to-noise\
    \ ratio, especially in the two\nwater band noise regions of 1440 nm and 1900 nm.\
    \ Moreover, the reﬂectance at 2000–2500 nm had\nabnormally low reﬂectivity compared\
    \ to the other two methods (Figure 2a). Spectra measured by\nusing a leaf clip\
    \ with black and white backgrounds represented absolute reﬂectance and transﬂectance,\n\
    respectively. Due to the additional transmittance, reﬂectance measured with the\
    \ white background\nwas generally higher than that measured by the black one,\
    \ especially in the regions of 800 to 1300 nm,\n1550 to 1850 nm, and 2200 nm (Figure\

    \ was highly correlated with the reflectance regions of 500–640 nm and 690–1380\
    \ \nnm. In the visible and near-infrared band (350–1100 nm), the correlation between\
    \ the reflectance and \nN concentration of the methods with white and black backgrounds\
    \ was similar, whereas the spectral \nreflectance measured by the black background\
    \ better reflected the correlation with the leaf N \nconcentration than that measured\
    \ by the white background in the short-wave infrared band (1500–\n2500 nm).  \n\
    3.2. Performances of Four Chemometrics  \nDue to the low correlation of reflectance\
    \ obtained by the 25° field of view method (Figure 3), all \nof the modelling\
    \ was performed on two spectral datasets—both acquired by a plant probe. From\
    \ \nTable 2, the reflectance spectra with the black background were better at\
    \ both modelling and \npredicting than the transflectance measured with the white\
    \ background (R2 was higher, and RMSE \nwas lower). Comparing the results of the\
    \ four chemometric methods, the modelling accuracy of PCA \nwas significantly\
    \ lower (R2 = 0.40 to 0.42) than that of SMLR, PLSR, and BPNN (R2 = 0.76 to 0.89).\
    \ In \ncontrast, the prediction accuracy of BPNN (R2 = 0.67) decreased significantly\
    \ compared to its \nmodelling accuracy (R2 = 0.89). The modelling accuracy of\
    \ BPNN could be improved by increasing \nthe principal components and the number\
    \ of iterations. However, the prediction accuracy did not \nincrease with the\
    \ increasing of principal components and number of iteration in the validation\
    \ \nprocess. In this situation, the BPNN modelling method easily over-fitted the\
    \ dataset. SMLR and PLSR \nshowed good modelling and prediction accuracy. In conclusion,\

    \ produced the best modelling accuracy. The \nFigure 2. The characteristics of\

    \ 25◦ ﬁeld of view method (Figure 3), all of\nthe modelling was performed on two\
    \ spectral datasets—both acquired by a plant probe. From Table 2,\nthe reﬂectance\
    \ spectra with the black background were better at both modelling and predicting\
    \ than the\ntransﬂectance measured with the white background (R2 was higher, and\
    \ RMSE was lower). Comparing\nthe results of the four chemometric methods, the\
    \ modelling accuracy of PCA was signiﬁcantly lower\n(R2 = 0.40 to 0.42) than that\
    \ of SMLR, PLSR, and BPNN (R2 = 0.76 to 0.89). In contrast, the prediction\naccuracy\
    \ of BPNN (R2 = 0.67) decreased signiﬁcantly compared to its modelling accuracy\
    \ (R2 = 0.89).\nThe modelling accuracy of BPNN could be improved by increasing\
    \ the principal components and\nthe number of iterations. However, the prediction\
    \ accuracy did not increase with the increasing of\nprincipal components and number\
    \ of iteration in the validation process. In this situation, the BPNN\nmodelling\
    \ method easily over-ﬁtted the dataset. SMLR and PLSR showed good modelling and\n\
    prediction accuracy. In conclusion, PLSR, combined with the spectral reﬂectance\
    \ as measured with\nthe black background, produced the best modelling accuracy.\
    \ The optimal number of factors by\nleave-one-out cross validation is ﬁfteen.\n\

    \ the N concentration in pear leaves and the three indices\n(R2 ranged from 0.39\
    \ to 0.44 with the black or white background). As seen from the wavelength of\n\
    the max R2 with spectra measured by the white background, the R2 values were greater\
    \ than those\nwith the black background, according to the linear regression based\
    \ on RSI and NDSI of 2150 nm\nand 2170 nm, respectively (Table 3). In contrast,\

    It is necessary to establish a non-destructive, real-time leaf N determination\
    \ method to predict\nthe N status to better manage N nutrition and gain higher\
    \ yields and fruit quality in pear orchards.\nThe results of this work showed\
    \ that leaf N status can be well predicted in the ﬁeld, using a leaf-clip\nwith\
    \ a black background attached to a plant probe based on single-leaf spectral reﬂectance.\
    \ Compared\nto the other two spectral measurements tested in this study, the leaf\
    \ N concentration was more closely\nrelated to the leaf spectral reﬂectance measured\
    \ by the black background based on the correlation\ncoefﬁcient and modelling accuracy.\
    \ This result might be related to the lack of leaf dust removal in\nthe real-time\
    \ spectral measurement of pear leaves. The underside of the leaf retains dust\
    \ more than\nthe leaf surface, which might have resulted in relatively low signal-to-noise\
    \ spectra when measured\nwith the white background, especially in the short-wave\
    \ infrared region. Light reﬂected by vegetation\nin the VIS region of the spectrum\
    \ (350–750 nm) in remote sensing experiments is predominantly\ninﬂuenced by chlorophyll\
    \ pigments in the leaf tissues [39]. However, the short-wave infrared region\n\
    was highly correlated with material absorption especially some structural leaf\
    \ compounds, such as\ncell walls, cellulose, and lignin [40,41], leaf cellular\
    \ structure, such as the volume of the air spaces,\nand the direction of incoming\
    \ light [42]. Spectral measurement using the black background can\nminimize the\
    \ inﬂuence of dust on the underside of leaves, and was found to be more related\
    \ to the leaf\nnitrogen concentration.\nSensors 2017, 17, 538\n12 of 15\n4.2.\
    \ Comparison of Modelling Methods\nIt is inevitable that spectra are collected\
    \ that contain not only information related to leaf N\nconcentration, but also\
    \ information in response to the sample state (especially the water deﬁcit and\n\
    physiological activities) because this is an in-ﬁeld measurement of fresh leaves\
    \ on a tree growing in a\ncomplex environment. It is more difﬁcult to extract\
    \ characteristic wavelengths in the ﬁeld compared\nto the steady conditions in\
    \ the lab as done in previous studies [11,43]. Due to the low correlation\nof\
    \ reﬂectance obtained by the 25◦ ﬁeld of view method, all of the modelling was\
    \ performed on two\nspectral datasets—both acquired by a plant probe. Our results\
    \ showed that the “full-spectra” method\nof PLSR was better than the SMLR and\
    \ vegetation indices, which were consistent with Nguyen and\nLee [44] that the\
    \ PLSR can alleviate the problem of high dimensionality by seeking a parsimonious\n\
    number of factors through a linear projection of original bands. Although the\
    \ R2 is relatively low\nand the wavelengths were probably highly correlated, Figures\
    \ 4 and 5 showed the importance of the\nred-edge region for N estimating. Nevertheless,\
    \ vegetation indices, such as the RVI and NDVI, are still\nwidely used mainly\
    \ because of their simplicity and high correlation to the pigment [45–47].\nAmong\
    \ the three “full-band” modelling methods, PLSR (R2 = 0.81) was superior to PCR\
    \ (R2 = 0.41)\nand BPNN (R2 = 0.67) in prediction accuracy. PCR accounts for only\
    \ the variance of explanatory\nvariables (e.g., band reﬂectance) without considering\
    \ any response variable (e.g., biochemical\nconcentration), whereas PLSR accounts\
    \ for both [17,18]. BPNN performed well in modelling the\nsoluble solid content\
    \ of navel orange fruit in the spectral measurements in the lab [35]. However,\
    \ in the\npresent study with the complex in-ﬁeld measurements, the ﬁrst step by\
    \ PCA was not that useful for\nﬁtting the leaf N concentration to the variable\
    \ input in the BPNN. Further research should insist on\nconquering the limitations\
    \ using a support vector machine or genetic algorithm with the BPNN [48].\nConsidering\
    \ the calibration and validation, the PLSR provided the most accurate performance\
    \ in the\nreal-time spectral measurements to determine leaf N concentration in\
    \ pear trees among the seven\nmodelling methods with the best accuracies (R2 >\
    \ 0.85 and mean relative error <6%). The best\nregression line in the calibration\
    \ set showed a deviation from the target line, which may be the\ncorrection of\
    \ systematic error in the modelling procedure. The best regression line and the\
    \ target line\nin the validation set almost showed superposition, which illustrated\
    \ the good predictive ability of\nthis model.\n4.3. Threshold of Leaf N Concentration\
    \ and Right Diagnostic Time\nDecisions about when to apply N and the proper N\
    \ application rate were needed for the practical\nmanagement of pear orchards.\
    \ With fruit development, the leaf N concentration changed in both\nyears. Especially\
    \ in 2015, leaf N concentration was found to increase with the increased N application\n\
    rate. As woody plants, pear trees use two main sources of N to sustain vegetative\
    \ and reproductive\ngrowth: N remobilization from storage and root N uptake [5].\
    \ In 2014, at the time of leaf collection,\nN remobilization of the last year\
    \ was the predominant source of spur leaves and ﬂowers [5,49], which\nleads to\
    \ an N concentration almost independent from the treatment. Furthermore, the N\
    \ concentration\nwas higher in May than in June sampling due to progression from\
    \ the vegetative to reproductive\nstages. This period is a key period in fruit\
    \ growth, and non-destructive diagnosis of the N status is\nimportant for timely\
    \ fertilizer application for fruit quality and yield. Previous studies [5,34]\
    \ have\nsuggested that, after bloom, the earlier the leaf N level was diagnosed\
    \ the better so that an increasing\nnumber of methods can be adopted to increase\
    \ or decrease the leaf N concentration as soon as possible.\nIn the present study,\
    \ a closer relationship was found between the N concentration and fruit yield\
    \ in\nthe May sampling (both in 2014 and 2015) than in the June sampling (Figure\
    \ 10).\nFruit yield did not signiﬁcantly increase with the increased N application\
    \ rate beyond the N2\nrate (Figures 7 and 8). This “excess applied N” may be used\
    \ in the extra vegetative growth of trees,\nsuch as trunk enlargement or increased\
    \ elongation of shoots that easily grow on pear trees managed\nby trellis cultivation,\
    \ leading to additional work during the annual winter pruning. Considering the\n\
    management practices regarding tree nutrient loss (especially in annual winter\
    \ pruning), the optimum\nSensors 2017, 17, 538\n13 of 15\nN application rate should\
    \ range from N2 (330 kg·N·ha−1) to N3 (660 kg·N·ha−1), which was a decrease\n\
    by 50% compared to the local N application ratio. The best diagnosis time of the\
    \ N status should be\nthe early fruit expansion stage (May), and the reference\
    \ threshold of the leaf N concentrations should\nbe 24–27 g/kg in the tested orchard.\n\
    Compared to other research on the leaf N determination by spectral measurement\
    \ [9,50] or\nthe relatively low accuracy of yield estimation by hyperspectral\
    \ measurements [29,30], our method\nprovides an easy and ﬂexible way to not only\
    \ guide N fertilization, but also estimate the current yield.\nHowever, this experiment\
    \ was performed with variable N applications, potash and phosphate fertilizer,\n\
    not allowing an assessment of tree responses to a variety of nutrient deﬁciencies\
    \ or excesses. To allow\nthe large-scale application of the method, it is essential\
    \ (i) to establish the reliability of this method\nunder a variety of conditions,\
    \ such as water and/or nutrient deﬁcits, growth regulator application,\ndifferent\
    \ cultivars, etc.; and (ii) to establish a robust leaf N concentration threshold,\
    \ below which\nyield is expected to decrease. Once these requirements are met,\
    \ the method could be safely used\nfor on-the-spot decision-making regarding the\
    \ N fertilization of pear trees to prevent excessive N\napplication for an increased\
    \ beneﬁt/cost ratio and the protection of the environment. Further work\nshould\
    \ also include testing of other methods (such as support vector machines and genetic\
    \ algorithms)\nto extract the characteristic wavelengths while reducing the redundancy\
    \ in computation.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this study, the utilization of in-ﬁeld visible/near-infrared\
    \ spectral measurements realized the\nnon-destructive nitrogen determination of\
    \ pear leaves. Spectra collected by the plant probe with the\nblack background\
    \ were found to provide the highest signal-to-noise ratio. The model established\n\
    by the partial least squares regression resulted in high modelling and prediction\
    \ accuracy. A higher\ncoefﬁcient of determination between the leaf N concentration\
    \ and fruit yield was found at 50 days\nafter full bloom.\nAcknowledgments: This\

    \ wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in modern precision agriculture to monitor\n\
    climate conditions and to provide agriculturalists with a considerable amount\
    \ of useful information\nis currently being widely considered. However, WSNs exhibit\
    \ several limitations when deployed\nin real-world applications. One of the challenges\
    \ faced by WSNs is prolonging the life of sensor\nnodes. This challenge is the\
    \ primary motivation for this work, in which we aim to further minimize\nthe energy\
    \ consumption of a wireless agriculture system (WAS), which includes air temperature,\n\
    air humidity, and soil moisture. Two power reduction schemes are proposed to decrease\
    \ the power\nconsumption of the sensor and router nodes. First, a sleep/wake scheme\
    \ based on duty cycling\nis presented. Second, the sleep/wake scheme is merged\
    \ with redundant data about soil moisture,\nthereby resulting in a new algorithm\
    \ called sleep/wake on redundant data (SWORD). SWORD can\nminimize the power consumption\
    \ and data communication of the sensor node. A 12 V/5 W solar cell\nis embedded\
    \ into the WAS to sustain its operation. Results show that the power consumption\
    \ of the\nsensor and router nodes is minimized and power savings are improved\
    \ by the sleep/wake scheme.\nThe power consumption of the sensor and router nodes\
    \ is improved by 99.48% relative to that in\ntraditional operation when the SWORD\
    \ algorithm is applied. In addition, data communication in the\nSWORD algorithm\
    \ is minimized by 86.45% relative to that in the sleep/wake scheme. The comparison\n\
    results indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform power reduction techniques\
    \ proposed in\nother studies. The average current consumptions of the sensor nodes\
    \ in the sleep/wake scheme and\nthe SWORD algorithm are 0.731 mA and 0.1 mA, respectively.\n\

    \ (PA) is a supervision procedure that uses information technology to improve\n\
    crop production and quality. The use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in agriculture\
    \ to monitor\nclimate conditions and to provide farmers with a considerable amount\
    \ of information has been\nSensors 2018, 18, 3450 ; doi:10.3390/s18103450\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 3450\n2 of 26\nconsidered. WSNs cannot be deployed easily because\
    \ they represent the security and economy\nof countries. The potential applications\
    \ of WSNs in the civilian domain include agricultural [1],\nindustrial [2], healthcare\
    \ [3], natural disaster [4], and monitoring uses. In recent years, WSNs have\n\
    been extensively used in various monitoring applications for PA. WSN technology\
    \ presents many\nadvantages, such as low cost, scalability, reliability, accuracy,\
    \ ﬂexibility, low power requirement,\nand easy deployment, which enable its use\
    \ in diverse applications [5–7]. PA is a control scheme\nthat utilizes information\
    \ technology to improve crop quality and production. It is an advanced\ntechnology\
    \ for enhancing crop production in different types of farm. PA is widely adopted\
    \ to minimize\ndiseases and pests, and consequently, reduce the use of pesticides,\
    \ thereby leading to efﬁcient and\nenvironmentally acceptable agriculture [7,8].\
    \ Having a similar routine and yield regardless of locations,\nconditions, and\
    \ labor intensity can be avoided through PA control. The most important applications\
    \ of\nPA in agriculture are in the monitoring of air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ soil moisture, and vapor\npressure deﬁcit to reduce production risks prior to\
    \ the cultivation of a speciﬁc crop [9,10].\nThe advancement of WSNs has produced\
    \ new research approaches in agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe development of microelectromechanical\
    \ technologies has resulted in the manufacture of small\nand low-cost sensors.\
    \ The extensive use of microcontrollers and microprocessors, which involve\nsmall,\
    \ self-modiﬁable sensor nodes, low-cost tools, and scalability, indicates that\
    \ WSNs can be used in\nagriculture computerization [5]. However, a number of limitations\
    \ and challenges must be addressed\nbefore WSNs can be utilized to monitor diverse\
    \ agricultural environments. The primary limitations and\nchallenges in current\
    \ PA applications that rely on WSNs have been highlighted. Moreover, proposals\n\
    on how to address them have been provided.\nThe ﬁrst challenge is extending the\
    \ battery life and reducing the power consumption of sensor\nnodes. Reducing the\
    \ power consumption of radio frequency (RF) modules considerably minimizes the\n\
    power consumption of sensor nodes because RF modules use considerable power [11].\
    \ The power\nconsumption problem can be resolved by adopting a speciﬁc power reduction\
    \ technique or algorithm.\nAn energy-harvesting technique can also be combined\
    \ with the selected power reduction technique.\nThe second challenge is communication\
    \ distance. WSNs suffer from the effects of harsh ecological\nenvironments due\
    \ to their wide communication area in agricultural ﬁelds [12].\nConsequently,\n\
    data packets are lost in the transmitting and receiving processes [6,13]. In agricultural\
    \ applications,\nhowever, when distance increases between nodes in the network\
    \ due to the large width of agriculture\nﬁelds, the communication range can be\
    \ lengthened by considering different network topologies,\nsuch as mesh networks.\
    \ Mobile router nodes, such as unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, can also be\n\
    utilized. Drones can be used to pass data from sensor nodes to the coordinator\
    \ node via a multihop\nprocess. However, using drones results in other limitations.\n\
    The third challenge is the consideration of cattle tracking and localization in\
    \ smart farms based\non WSNs [14]. WSNs are used to monitor animal behavior and\
    \ positions, such as standing, walking,\ngrazing, and lying down [15,16]. In this\
    \ context, several problems, such as animal situation and\nmobility, radio interference,\
    \ changes in network topology, height of animal collar, signal penetration\ndepth\
    \ over the animal body, and antennas of access points, can arise and must be considered\
    \ [17].\nRobust tracking and localization techniques, such as smart tracking and\
    \ localization that rely on\nintelligent techniques or optimization algorithms,\
    \ can be adopted to overcome these challenges.\nThe fourth challenge is propagation\
    \ losses. When WSNs are used in agricultural applications,\nthey must operate\
    \ in different environments and climate conditions, such as bare land, ground,\n\
    greenhouses, orchards, complex topography, and farms. These surroundings affect\
    \ radio propagation\nperformance. Consequently, simple or complex communication\
    \ topologies in WSNs suffer from\nserious challenges. Transmission from one sensor\
    \ node to another in agricultural application requires\ncrossing over dense crops,\
    \ where the clearance communication channel cannot be ensured. Therefore,\ncommunication\
    \ link quality must be guaranteed when deploying WSNs. The performance of WSNs\
    \ is\nassociated with the working environment. Hence, an accurate modeling of\
    \ wireless communication\nchannel path loss must be established to represent propagation\
    \ features. A path loss model can provide\nSensors 2018, 18, 3450\n3 of 26\nprecise\
    \ optimization and performance evaluation of a network during the distribution\
    \ design process\nto improve the power consumption of nodes [18] and enhance localization\
    \ and target detection [16],\nthereby ensuring the quality of services and minimizing\
    \ the number of retransmission events in a\nnetwork [19]. Reference [13] provided\
    \ abundant information on the challenges and limitations of WSN\ndeployment in\
    \ agricultural application.\nThe ﬁrst challenge, namely, reducing the power consumption\
    \ and extending the battery\nlifetime of sensor and router nodes in agricultural\
    \ application, is addressed in the current study.\nSeveral energy-efﬁcient methods\
    \ and solutions, such as power reduction and energy-harvesting\ntechniques, have\
    \ been presented in the previous literature to solve the power consumption problem\
    \ of\nsensor nodes. Among these solutions, the sleep/wake scheme and the combination\
    \ of sleep/wake\nand data mitigation (redundant data) described as the sleep/wake\
    \ on redundant data (SWORD)\nalgorithm in this study are considered to minimize\
    \ energy consumption and increase the lifetime of\nnodes in WSNs. Battery-operated\
    \ radio modules consume the most power in sensor and router nodes.\nTherefore,\
    \ the energy consumed by sensor nodes can be improved. Furthermore, battery life\
    \ can be\nextended by reducing the amount of communication and minimizing redundant\
    \ data in a network via\nthe SWORD algorithm. Accordingly, the deployed nodes\
    \ are expected to work for months or years [20].\nIn addition, WSNs can be equipped\
    \ with solar energy (based on a solar cell) to supply nodes with\nenergy and to\
    \ charge their batteries.\nThe novelty of this study lies in the merging of the\
    \ sleep/wake scheme with the redundant data\non soil moisture, thereby resulting\
    \ in a new algorithm, namely, SWORD. The SWORD algorithm\ncan considerably minimize\
    \ the power consumption and data communication of a sensor node\nto 0.1 mA and\
    \ 86.45%, respectively, relative to traditional operation. In addition, based\
    \ on our\nliterature review published previously in [13], we discovered that each\
    \ power reduction techniques\nused in agricultural applications only relies on\
    \ one method such as cluster a head, sleep/wake,\ndata mitigation, transmission\
    \ power control, data compression, data driven, routing protocol, and sink\nmobility\
    \ schemes. A small number of these methods are merged into two or more power reduction\n\
    techniques [21–24] to further reduce the power consumption and extend the battery\
    \ life of sensor\nnodes. However, none of these studies has focused on an approach\
    \ similar to SWORD, particularly in\nthe case of PA. The other contributions of\
    \ this work are summarized as follows.\n(i)\nThe power consumption of the sensor\
    \ and router nodes of a wireless agriculture system (WAS)\nis modeled.\n(ii)\n\
    The power consumption and data communication of the adopted WAS are minimized,\
    \ and battery\nlife is prolonged using two power reduction techniques, namely,\
    \ the sleep/wake scheme and\nthe SWORD algorithm. Considerable power saving is\
    \ achieved by the WAS when the proposed\nSWORD algorithm is used.\n(iii)\nOur\
    \ results are compared with those of similar studies in terms of power consumption\
    \ to verify\nthe performance and efﬁciency of the proposed sleep/wake scheme and\
    \ SWORD algorithm.\n2. Related Studies\nResearchers have developed several power\
    \ reduction techniques in their search for an inﬁnite\npower source for sensor\
    \ nodes to achieve a limitless life span. This section presents several WSN power\n\
    reduction methods that can be used in PA. Early studies on energy-efﬁcient PA\
    \ can be traced back to\nZhu et al. [6], who developed a WSN based on an agricultural\
    \ monitoring system. They discovered that\nthe effective communication distance\
    \ between nodes is more than 200 m in an open-ﬁeld environment\nand the average\
    \ packet loss rate is 7.6%. These authors adopted a sleep/wake algorithm to reduce\n\
    the power consumption of the WSN. The received power became attenuated and sinusoidal\
    \ when\nthe distance between a transmitter and a receiver was increased. The sensor\
    \ node woke up for 30 s\nevery 4.5 min. The power consumption of the sensor node\
    \ relative to that in traditional operation\n(i.e., 80 mA) was 53 mA. A power\
    \ saving of 33.75% was achieved. Zou et al. [25] proposed methods to\noptimize\
    \ data transmission and to extend network life by using a prediction algorithm\
    \ for the energy\nSensors 2018, 18, 3450\n4 of 26\nharvested from a solar cell\
    \ via environmental shadow detection. The mechanisms sustained network\nactivities\
    \ in an uninterrupted and efﬁcient manner in the experimental study. However,\
    \ a solar cell\nsystem is generally irregular and extensively inﬂuenced by weather\
    \ changes. The power consumption\nof a sensor node in conventional operation is\
    \ 80 mA, whereas power consumption is minimized based\non the duty cycle (DC),\
    \ which is set to a ﬁxed value. The peak current consumption of the sensor\nnode\
    \ is 4.5, 18, and 20 mA, which corresponds to 10% DC in empty mode, 30% DC in\
    \ lacking mode,\nand 100% DC in sufﬁcient mode, respectively. Srbinovska et al.\
    \ [20] collected environmental parameter\ndata from distributed WSNs. They adopted\
    \ a sleep/wake strategy to reduce the power consumption\nof the sensor node in\
    \ a WSN. The current consumption of the sensor node is minimized to 142 µA\nrelative\
    \ to that in traditional operation, which consumes 24 mA, by switching between\
    \ sleep and active\nmodes in low DC.\nNguyen et al. [26] observed the impacts\
    \ of climate change on crop ﬁelds by using WSNs.\nThe authors adopted a sleep/wake\
    \ algorithm to reduce the power consumption of WSNs. The data\ncollection method\
    \ improved the power consumption of the network. The advantages are low cost\n\
    and ubiquitous monitoring. Moreover, the system can be widely applied to agriculture\
    \ in developing\ncountries. The Zigbee wireless protocol was conﬁgured to operate\
    \ for 30 s every 15 min (i.e., DC equal\nto 3.3%). Therefore, the 129 mA power\
    \ consumption of the sensor node in traditional operation is\nreduced to 17.25\
    \ mA when the DC strategy is adopted. Eto et al. [27] charged batteries via solar\n\
    energy generation to solve the problem of covering an agricultural ﬁeld with mobile\
    \ sensor nodes.\nThe results exhibited a 4% reduction in the number of nodes and\
    \ a 10% extension of operation\nlifetime compared with the conventional method.\
    \ The selection of the leader node was performed by\ncalculating residual energy.\
    \ In this case, the power consumption of the node can be extended to 90\nworking\
    \ days (i.e., consumes 11.11 mA at a battery capacity of 1000 mAh). Fourie et\
    \ al. [28] designed a\nﬁsh pond management system for ﬁsh conservation by using\
    \ an autonomous solar-powered system.\nZigbee can enter into sleep mode to improve\
    \ the power consumption of WSNs. The results indicated\nthat the system can successfully\
    \ control the pond’s temperature and dissolved oxygen level. The use\nof a maximum\
    \ power point tracking (MPPT) charging controller allows the platform to utilize\
    \ energy\nhigher than 8 W. However, the components of the system, including a\
    \ solenoid valve, a stepper motor,\nand a sensor node hardware, consume a high\
    \ amount of power, i.e., approximately 4 W. Meanwhile,\nthe sensor node components\
    \ (i.e., sensor, processor, and RF module) exhibit a low power consumption\nof\
    \ approximately 207 mW relative to the total consumption. Therefore, the current\
    \ consumption of\nthe sensor node is 81.5 mA. When a solar cell with DC charging\
    \ is adopted, the power efﬁciency is\nimproved by 31%. However, power efﬁciency\
    \ increases to 98% when MPPT is used.\nBapat et al. [29] developed a WSN application\
    \ for crop protection from animal intrusion in a\nfarming ﬁeld. A sleep/wake scheme\
    \ was adopted to conserve the power of the WSN. Successful results\nwere obtained\
    \ from laboratory-level trials of the systems. However, the authors discovered\
    \ a few\ntechnical faults in the circuit components. The power consumption of\
    \ the system was 27 W/h, but the\ncalculations of the current consumption of the\
    \ nodes in the WSN were not considered in their study.\nVillarrubia et al. [30]\
    \ constructed practical organizations of agents that can connect with one another\n\
    while observing crop irrigation. Fuzzy logic was adopted to accurately control\
    \ watering quantities.\nThe major ﬁnding of this research was that heterogeneous\
    \ data from the surrounding can be merged\nvia sensor node measurements. The proposed\
    \ system based on fuzzy logic consumes 4.5 L of water per\nday relative to traditional\
    \ operation, which consumes 7.3 L a day. Thus, 37% water saving is achieved\n\
    over 30 days. The use of a solar cell also allows the continuous charging of the\
    \ sensor node battery.\nNavarro-Hellín et al. [31] monitored soil water status\
    \ and irrigation water by developing a practical\napplication to optimize water\
    \ resources in irrigated agriculture. They adopted a sleep/wake scheme\nto reduce\
    \ the power consumption of the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) node. The sending\
    \ and\nsampling rates in the achieved tests were adjusted to 30 min and 15 min,\
    \ respectively. The disadvantage\nof this system is its short life span of 13.35\
    \ days. However, the average current consumption of the\nSensors 2018, 18, 3450\n\
    5 of 26\nentire GPRS node is 5.93 mA relative to that in traditional operation,\
    \ where the GPRS modem alone\nconsumes 400 mA during data transmission.\nDe la\
    \ Concepción et al. [24] presented an efﬁcient WSN platform that is appropriate\
    \ for agricultural\napplications and can be used in remote areas. A sleep/wake\
    \ algorithm was proposed to limit the\nenergy consumption of the WSN platform.\
    \ The results showed that the nodes are autonomous, scalable,\nand easy to locate\
    \ and relocate. However, the proposed system has a limited communication range\n\
    because the transceiver uses an omnidirectional antenna. Nevertheless, the sensor\
    \ node captures and\ntransmits an image for 6 min and then sleeps for 54 min,\
    \ with a low power consumption of 0.8 µA.\nSubsequently, sensor node life is extended\
    \ to 8 days. Moreover, current consumption is improved\nto 4.427 mA compared with\
    \ that in conventional operation, where the current consumption of the\ncamera\
    \ and CC1110 is 270 mA and 31 mA, respectively, in the transmission mode. Cambra\
    \ et al. [32]\ndiscovered, examined, and auto-calibrated imbalances in the pH\
    \ levels of the nutrient solution used in\nhydroponic agriculture. The results\
    \ indicated that the design of the system improved water quality\nin hydroponic\
    \ agriculture by implementing and testing a smart system for bicarbonate control\
    \ in\nirrigation. The advantages include low power consumption, low cost due to\
    \ the use of a low-power\nwireless protocol (i.e., nRF24L01) while ensuring the\
    \ adopted coverage area, and the provision of\nmultimedia services because of\
    \ the adoption of mobile devices or computers. However, the number of\nnodes in\
    \ the network is limited to ﬁve. Each node wakes up for 15 s to transmit their\
    \ data and then\nreturns to sleep for 255 s (i.e., DC is equal to 15/270 = 5.555%).\
    \ Accordingly, the power consumption\nof the sensor node is reduced from 49 mA\
    \ (in traditional operation) to 2.807 mA (with the sleep/wake\nstrategy).\nIlie-Ablachim\
    \ et al. [33] monitored environmental parameters for greenhouse applications.\n\
    They used the MoniSen module to introduce a new granularity level for PA monitoring\
    \ applications.\nThey adopted a distributed sensor architecture for large-scale\
    \ applications by developing fully\nfunctional software and hardware.\nThe sleep/wake\
    \ algorithm was applied to reduce power\nconsumption. Moreover, the sensor node\
    \ in the system was conﬁgured to transmit data for 48 s\nevery 24 h (i.e., DC\
    \ is equal to 3.3%). Consequently, battery life is prolonged to 4408 h. The total\
    \ current\nconsumption of the system is 0.544 mA relative to that in traditional\
    \ operation, where the sensor node\nconsumes 46.145 mA with a power efﬁciency\
    \ of more than 90%. Zaier et al. [34] tested and developed\na smart irrigation\
    \ system based on WSN and solenoid electrovalves. The smart irrigation system\n\
    was implemented in 14 farms. The power consumption of the WSN was improved by\
    \ the proposed\nsleep/wake strategy by using periodic sleeping cycles. The power\
    \ consumption of the system is\nextremely low in sleep mode. The power consumption\
    \ of the XBee Pro S2 module of the sensor node\nis 177 mA in active mode, 3.5\
    \ µA in sleep mode, and 7 mA in active mode for the soil moisture sensor.\nPower\
    \ consumption is improved and battery life is extended through the power-down\
    \ mode of XBee.\nAll the aforementioned studies are summarized in Table 1. The\
    \ table highlights the improved\npower consumption and the related power reduction\

    \ work, we aim to reduce unnecessary energy consumption and to prolong the battery\
    \ life of\nthe network, along with the sensor and router nodes that are distributed\
    \ across a farm ﬁeld. Figure 1\nshows the proposed topology of the wireless nodes\
    \ in the farm ﬁeld with a layout of 200 × 200 m2,\nwhich represents the available\
    \ tested area in this study. This area can be potentially extended to actual\n\
    medium-size commercial crop farm areas. The farm ﬁeld consists of 16 sensor nodes,\
    \ four router nodes,\nthe main router node, and the coordinator node. Each sensor\
    \ node is responsible for collecting climate\nconditions, such as air temperature,\
    \ air humidity, and soil moisture, from a square area of 50 × 50 m2.\nThe sensor\
    \ node is located at the center of the square area. Four sensor nodes communicate\
    \ wirelessly\nto one of the router nodes. The collected data (i.e., climate conditions)\
    \ from the sensor nodes are\ntransmitted wirelessly to the central router via\
    \ the router nodes.\nSensors 2018, 18, x  \n7 of 25 \n \nThe main router node\
    \ passes the climate conditions to the coordinator node, which is located at \n\
    the base station (farmhouse). Our proposed topology considers only fixed router\
    \ nodes for \ncommunication between sensor nodes and the coordinator node. In\
    \ addition, the changing roles of \nthe router nodes are not considered, as shown\
    \ in Figure 1, because the focus of this study is the \nphysical layer approach\
    \ for achieving energy efficiency, whereas changing roles involve higher \nlayers,\
    \ such as media access control (MAC) and network. Thus, the changing roles can\
    \ provide a \nfuture opportunity to continue the current study to further understand\
    \ the benefits of energy savings \nbased on cross-layer dimensions. \nThe distance\
    \ between the farmhouse and the crop field is approximately 200 m. Therefore,\
    \ an \nappropriate wireless communication protocol, such as Zigbee (XBee S2C),\
    \ must be used to ensure \ndata delivery. This module can theoretically guarantee\
    \ 1.2 km in outdoor environments [38], low \npower consumption, low cost, and\
    \ battery operation in WSNs. In terms of power consumption, \nZigbee (XBee S2C),\
    \ which consumes 36.9 mW as reported in [13], is better than LoRa, SigFox, WiFi,\
    \ \nand GPRS, which consume 100, 122, 835, and 560 mW, respectively. Nevertheless,\
    \ the current work \ncan be extended to cater to future wireless technologies,\

    \ nodes to be deployed in the field. Table 2 presents the hardware for the sensor\
    \ node \nof the proposed WAS. Figure 2 shows the hardware of the sensor, router,\
    \ and coordinator nodes. It \npresents a simple hardware implementation of the\
    \ WAS, which involves minimal interface and \nconnection between sensors to the\
    \ microcontroller and the wireless links. The digital humidity–\ntemperature (DHT11)\
    \ sensor and the soil moisture sensor require only three wires for a physical\
    \ \ninterface with the microcontrollers: (i) supply voltage, (ii) ground, and\
    \ (iii) output data. The first two \nwires are used to power the sensors by +5\
    \ V, whereas the third wire is the analog and digital serial \noutput signals\
    \ for the soil moisture sensor and DHT11, respectively. The microcontroller of\
    \ the sensor \nand router nodes communicates with the Zigbee wireless protocol\
    \ through a single-wire data bus. \nThe sensor and router nodes are fixed on a\
    \ surface that is 1.5 m above the ground (Figure 3), \nwhich is the recommended\
    \ height in [39], to avoid the effect of the Fresnel zone or signal reflection.\
    \ \nThe sensor and router nodes in the tested area are powered by a battery. The\
    \ coordinator node is \nconnected to a laptop/PC in the base station. Therefore,\
    \ this node is unaware of the energy supply. \nThe PC is equipped with graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) software to monitor the climate conditions in \nthe farm\
    \ field. The sensor and router node structures are designed to work day and night.\
    \ At daytime, \nthe components, sensors, microcontroller, and XBee S2C are powered\
    \ by solar energy. Furthermore, \na solar cell provides energy to charge the batteries\
    \ of the sensor and router nodes. The solar panel is \npositioned in front of\
    \ the sensor node box at a low inclination angle (20°–30°) to orient the solar\
    \ cell \npanel relative to the sun. In addition, two power reduction algorithms\
    \ (i.e., sleep/wake and SWORD) \nare adopted to further reduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor and router nodes. At nighttime, \nthe components only use battery\
    \ energy as supported by the two power reduction algorithms. For \nWSN simplicity\

    \ of XBee S2C includes a maximum of 127 bytes (31 bytes overhead and 96\nbytes\
    \ payload) [45]. Therefore, the adopted Zigbee wireless protocol using XBee S2C\
    \ is adequate to\nachieve the proposed WSN topology in the current work, as presented\
    \ in Figure 1. The maximum data\npacket length of 95 bytes is used to monitor\
    \ the climate conditions of the agricultural ﬁeld.\nDelay in WSNs denotes the\
    \ difference between the time when the information is produced in\nthe sensor\
    \ node and the time when the information arrives at the sink node. Being delay-sensitive\n\
    poses a challenge to WSNs, particularly with multihop counts [46]. Most information\
    \ is delay-tolerant\nin the majority of agriculture applications [47,48]. In addition,\
    \ a small proportion of delay-sensitive\ninformation exists. Being delay-sensitive\
    \ is essential when multihops are used in WSNs and the data is\nrequired to be\
    \ monitored in real time. In our application, however, climate conditions (i.e.,\
    \ temperature,\nhumidity, and soil moisture) are delay-insensitive because the\
    \ data are collected and transmitted from\nthe sensor node to the coordinator\
    \ node through a single router node. Evidently, delay is not a major\nconcern\
    \ in such PA case. Therefore, delay is not considered in the current study.\n\
    6. SWORD Algorithm\nThe SWORD algorithm (Figure 5) is designed and implemented\
    \ in the microcontroller Atmega\n328p of the sensor node to reduce power consumption.\
    \ The SWORD algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.\nThe microcontroller Atmega 328p\
    \ initially wakes up from sleep mode.\n2.\nAll the components of the sensor node\
    \ (i.e., sensors, microcontroller, and XBee S2C) are supplied\nwith energy from\
    \ a solar cell (12 V/5 W) at daytime to charge their batteries. The batteries\
    \ are\nused to supply power to the sensor node at nighttime.\n3.\nThe microcontroller\
    \ measures the climate conditions (i.e., air temperature, air humidity, and soil\n\
    moisture).\n4.\nThe microcontroller measures the difference between the previous\
    \ and subsequent soil moisture\nvalues (soil moisture difference = |previous value\
    \ − subsequent value|) to check whether\nredundant data exist.\n5.\nWhen the difference\
    \ between the two values is zero or less than or equal to 5% (threshold level),\n\
    the sensors and the XBee S2C module enter sleep mode. Furthermore, the microcontroller\
    \ goes\nto power-saving mode to save the energy of the sensor node. In such case,\
    \ the soil is wet\nand no data are transmitted from the sensor node to the router\
    \ node. In addition, irrigating\nthe soil is unnecessary, thereby leading to water\
    \ saving. The components of the sensor node\nremain in sleep mode until the threshold\
    \ level is exceeded. A slight difference in value of\n5% is selected to obtain\
    \ a precise decision. In agriculture, irrigation systems depend on soil\nmoisture\
    \ measurements, wherein soil is considered a crucial part of planning tools for\
    \ conducting\nirrigation [49,50]. When soil is dry, the irrigation system is operating;\
    \ otherwise, the irrigation\nsystem is off (i.e., wet soil). Therefore, the SWORD\
    \ algorithm is determined on the basis of soil\nmoisture measurement in the current\
    \ study. By using soil moisture, irrigation is scheduled to\nsustain soil moisture\
    \ conditions equivalent or close to the ﬁeld capacity to satisfy the required\n\
    crop water requirements. In addition, several sensors are being considered for\
    \ future work to\ncapture relevant parameters related to agriculture, such as\
    \ soil temperature, soil conductivity,\nsalinity, leaf wetness, and rainfall sensors.\n\
    6.\nBy contrast, all the components of the sensor node remain awake when the difference\
    \ between\nthe two values is greater than 5%. Therefore, the measured data in\
    \ Step 3 are transmitted from\nthe sensor node to the coordinator node via the\
    \ router nodes. After the transmission process is\ncompleted, the sensors and\
    \ XBee S2C module enter sleep mode. Furthermore, the microcontroller\ngoes to\
    \ power-saving mode to save the energy of the sensor node. The sensor node transmits\n\
    the measured data about climate conditions every 15 min (900 s) for 2 s (i.e.,\
    \ extremely low\nDC 2/900 = 2.222 × 10−3). The sensors require 1 s to measure\
    \ the data on climate conditions.\nIn addition, another second is required to\
    \ transmit the data to the related router node, including\nSensors 2018, 18, 3450\n\
    11 of 26\nthe active transmission time of XBee S2C (i.e., 11.32 ms, as shown in\
    \ the previous section) and the\nmicrocontroller. This situation indicates that\
    \ 2 s are consumed by each sensor node to measure\nand transmit climate conditions\
    \ to the related router node, as shown in the timing diagram in\nFigure 6. Consequently,\
    \ each sensor node wakes up for 2 s and sleeps for 898 s.\n7.\nThe four sensor\
    \ nodes communicate using one router node (Figure 1). Therefore, the allocated\n\
    time for each router node is 16 s. From the 16 s, 8 s is for the four sensor nodes,\
    \ whereas 8 s\nis for the guard time (2 s after data transmission of each sensor\
    \ node to avoid data collision),\nas shown in Figure 6. The router nodes, such\
    \ as RN1, RN2, RN3, and RN4, collect and transmit\nthe data of the four sensor\
    \ nodes to the main router node within 16 s and then enter sleep mode.\nConsequently,\
    \ each router node wakes up for 16 s and sleeps for 884 s (i.e., extremely low\
    \ DC\n1.778 × 10−2), as shown in Figure 6.\n8.\nThe main router node gathers the\
    \ collected data of the four router nodes and transmits these data\nto the coordinator\
    \ node within 64 s. The main router node then enters sleep mode for 836 s after\n\
    data transmission (i.e., DC is 7.111 × 10−2), as shown in Figure 6.\nSensors 2018,\

    \ Sensor Node Power Consumption Model \nThe life span of sensor nodes is the time\
    \ that lapsed from the first transmission until the sensor \nnodes lose their\
    \ sensing capability. The life span of a WSN relies on the current consumed by\
    \ each \nnode in the network. The power consumption of sensor nodes depends on\
    \ the number of \ncomponents. In this study, the sensor nodes include air temperature\
    \ and humidity sensors embedded \ninto the DHT11 sensor, a soil moisture sensor,\
    \ the Atmega 328p microcontroller as a standalone \nsystem for reducing power\
    \ consumption, and the XBee S2C wireless protocol. Among the sensor \nnodes, XBee\
    \ S2C is considered the main power consumer [51]. When the consumption values\
    \ of these \ncomponents are added, the total current consumption of the sensor\
    \ node can be expressed as \nEquation (2): \n\U0001D43C\U0001D446\U0001D441 =\

    \ such as thermal, solar, vibration, and wind. Energy harvesting approaches are\
    \ effective\nin improving network life span [52]. Among various forms of environmental\
    \ energy, solar cell energy\nis selected in the current work to supply power to\

    \ is cyclically recharged to preserve the life span of nodes that continuously\
    \ operate\nin the network rather than focusing on reducing energy depletion. However,\
    \ an energy-harvesting\nplatform must be incorporated into the network to efﬁciently\
    \ use the harvested energy.\nThe current consumption of the sensor nodes from\
    \ the battery depends on the type of\napplication [53]. In our work, the solar\
    \ panel is positioned in front of the sensor node box. The solar\ncell angle is\
    \ oriented toward the sun with an incident angle of 20◦–30◦ relative to the ground\
    \ [8].\nKINGRO-004V solar cell (KINGRO, Shaoxing, China), which is a ﬁrst-generation\
    \ polycrystalline solar\ncell (12 V/5 W) that delivers a maximum current of 416\
    \ mA, is selected (Figure 3). Table 3 provides the\ncharacteristics of the adopted\

    Figure 7 shows the connection of the soil moisture sensor to the microcontroller\
    \ (connected to\nPin ANo). The soil moisture sensor is connected to a 10 KΩ resistance\
    \ as a voltage divider, as shown\nin Figure 7. The middle point (i.e., Vout) between\
    \ the soil moisture sensor and the resistor is used\nfor sensing variations in\
    \ output voltage from the changes in moisture value. The output voltage\n(Vout)\
    \ is altered between 5 and 0 depending on the moisture of soil. The moisture corresponds\
    \ to\nthe analog-to-digital converter of the Arduino microcontroller 0–1023 (10\
    \ bit resolution). The output\nvoltage of the voltage divider can be translated\
    \ into moisture in percentage through the microcontroller\nalgorithm. The resistance\
    \ of the soil moisture value decreases with increasing soil moisture. Therefore,\n\
    the output voltage decreases. By contrast, the resistance of the soil moisture\
    \ value increases when soil\nis dry, thereby increasing output voltage. The soil\
    \ moisture sensor is calibrated in-ﬁeld, as shown in\nFigure 8. The calibration\
    \ of the soil moisture sensor (Figure 8) is achieved through an experimental test\n\
    of three cases: (i) wet soil, (ii) ﬁeld capacity soil moisture, and (iii) dry\
    \ soil for soil mixture (clay and\nsandy soil). This calibration can be used in\
    \ all seasons. The ﬁgure shows that the output voltage values\nof the soil moisture\
    \ sensor are plotted on the left y-axis, whereas the moisture values in percentage\
    \ are\nSensors 2018, 18, 3450\n15 of 26\nplotted on the right y-axis with respect\
    \ to the depth of the soil moisture sensor. However, the values\nof the moisture\
    \ percentages that are presented in Figure 8 are used in the microcontroller algorithm\n\
    to determine the threshold level between dry soil and wet soil. From these values,\
    \ the soil moisture\nsensor achieves self-calibration before each new measure\
    \ based on the stored data in the algorithm of\nthe microcontroller to reduce\
    \ measurement errors.\nThe temperature and humidity sensor (i.e., DHT11) was calibrated\
    \ to be extremely precise\nby the manufacturer in a laboratory [54]. The calibration\
    \ coefﬁcients of the sensor are stored as a\nprogram in the one-time programmable\
    \ (OTP) memory. When the OTP memory is programmed,\nthe contents cannot be changed\
    \ and are retained after power is turned off. This sensor contains a\nnegative\
    \ temperature coefﬁcient component for temperature measurement and a resistive\
    \ component\nfor humidity measurement. DHT11 is a digital sensor that can be connected\
    \ to an 8 bit microcontroller\nusing a single wire serial interface. It provides\
    \ fast response, and exhibits high-quality, cost-effective,\nand anti-interference\
    \ ability. Consequently, the DHT11 sensor does not require a calibration process\n\

    \ of the sensor node (i.e., 7.4/2600 mAh). The battery life for a\nparticular\
    \ energy of the battery at the current usage of the sensor node is estimated in\
    \ the relationship\nshown in Figure 17. The ﬁgure indicates that the power savings\
    \ of the sensor node based on the\nSWORD algorithm considerably improve battery\
    \ life to 86.45% and 99.48% relative to the sleep/wake\nscheme and traditional\
    \ operation, respectively. However, these percentages may increase or decrease\n\
    depending on the weather, soil conditions, and farm location. As weather temperature\
    \ increases,\nsoil condition changes rapidly from moisturized to dehydrated, thereby\
    \ remarkably changing soil\nmoisture measurements. Data transmission can occur,\
    \ and power consumption increases. By contrast,\ndata transmission and power consumption\
    \ are considerably minimized when soil moisture is constant\nunder good weather\
    \ or rainfall conditions. During rainfall condition, the microcontroller measures\
    \ soil\nmoisture based on the soil humidity sensor to control the operation of\
    \ the SWORD algorithm. In case\nof rainfall, the soil is wet, irrigation is unnecessary,\
    \ and no data transmission occurs from the sensor\nnode to the router node. Consequently,\
    \ the sensors and XBee module of the sensor node enter sleep\nmode to conserve\
    \ energy. In addition, power consumption and data transmission vary from summer\n\
    to winter. However, soil moisture changes according to temperature and humidity.\
    \ In our work,\nwe set the constant value of the soil moisture (i.e., threshold)\
    \ to trigger the sensor to alert the users if\nintervention is necessary, such\
    \ as a switch on the water irrigation system or based on an automated\nirrigation\
    \ system. The percentage values of 40–50% are considered acceptable soil moisture\
    \ values in\nplant growing environments as proven in [58].\nSensors 2018, 18,\

    \ of 40–50% are considered \nacceptable soil moisture values in plant growing\
    \ environments as proven in [58].  \nThe output power of the solar panel is adequate\
    \ to supply the sensor node because the power \nconsumption of the sensor node\
    \ varies from 0.75 (SWORD algorithm) and 5.409 (sleep/wake scheme) \nto 143.19\
    \ mW (traditional operation). This result is based on the recommendation in [26],\
    \ which \nindicates that the capacity of a solar cell should be at least six times\

    \ and main router nodes is 7.155 mW and 13.764 mW \nfor the sleep/wake scheme,\

    \ 2.\nAlthough the previous works are based on energy efﬁcient approaches, however,\
    \ it is important\nto acknowledge that the measurement taken from this study might\

    \ scheme adopting DC and the second is SWORD algorithm. The current\nconsumption\
    \ of the sensor node (0.731 mA), router node (0.967 mA), and main router node\
    \ (1.86 mA)\nare achieved based on sleep/wake scheme using low DC. We observe\
    \ that the current consumption\nof the proposed WAS using the SWORD algorithm\
    \ is approximately similar to the performance of\nthe approaches in [35–37], which\
    \ have achieved a current consumption of 0.1 (based on sleep/wake),\n0.118 (based\
    \ on sleep/wake), and 0.227 mA (based on DC), respectively.\nThe average current\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 3450\n23 of 26\nconsumption of our proposed WAS is 0.1 mA and\
    \ 0.731 mA for the SWORD algorithm and the\nsleep/wake scheme, respectively, as\
    \ shown in Figure 18.\n11. Conclusions\nWe propose an energy-efﬁcient scheme known\
    \ as the WAS for agricultural application. The system\nis designed and practically\
    \ implemented to monitor the climate conditions of crops, including air\ntemperature,\
    \ air humidity, and soil moisture.\nSystem hardware is carefully selected based\
    \ on\nenergy-efﬁcient criteria to minimize the power consumption of different\
    \ nodes in the WSN, such as\nthe low-power Zigbee wireless protocol (i.e., XBee\
    \ S2C), the standalone Atmega 328p microcontroller,\nand low-power sensors. In\
    \ addition, two power reduction techniques are proposed to further improve\nthe\
    \ power consumption of the sensor, router, and main router nodes. These two schemes\
    \ are the\nsleep/wake scheme and the SWORD algorithm. The sleep/wake scheme is\
    \ achieved based on different\nDCs of the nodes in the WAS (i.e., 0.222% for the\
    \ sensor node, 1.778% for the router node, and 7.111% for\nthe main router node).\
    \ The SWORD algorithm combines the sleep/wake scheme and the minimization\nof\
    \ redundant data from sensor node packets. The power consumption of the sensor,\
    \ router, and main\nrouter nodes is considerably improved when the two proposed\
    \ methods are used.\nThe power saving and data communication achieved by applying\
    \ the SWORD algorithm may\nbe increased or decreased depending on the redundant\
    \ data from soil moisture measurements,\nwhich depend on the soil condition (wet\
    \ or dry). The power savings in the current work are improved\nby 86.45% and 99.48%\
    \ relative to the sleep/wake scheme and traditional operation, respectively.\n\
    In addition, data communication is minimized by 86.45%. The results of current\
    \ consumption\nare compared with those in previous studies to validate the performance\
    \ of the proposed system.\nThe proposed WAS allows data collection for decision\
    \ support in farming ﬁelds and can assist users in\nautomating irrigation systems\
    \ in agricultural ﬁelds in the future. The use of an energy-efﬁcient and\nadvanced\
    \ WSN technology can achieve highly productive and sustainable precision farming.\n\

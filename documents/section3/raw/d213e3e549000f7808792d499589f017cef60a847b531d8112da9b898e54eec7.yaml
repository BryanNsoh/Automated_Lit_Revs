    Using the IoT, physical objects can be empowered to create, receive, and exchange
    data in a seamless manner. Various IoT applications focus on automating different
    tasks and are trying to empower the inanimate physical objects to act without
    any human intervention. The existing and upcoming IoT applications are highly
    promising to increase the level of comfort, efficiency, and automation for the
    users. To be able to implement such a world in an ever-growing fashion requires
    high security, privacy, authentication, and recovery from attacks. In this regard,
    it is imperative to make the required changes in the architecture of the IoT applications
    for achieving end-to-end secure IoT environments. In this paper, a detailed review
    of the security-related challenges and sources of threat in the IoT applications
    is presented. After discussing the security issues, various emerging and existing
    technologies focused on achieving a high degree of trust in the IoT applications
    are discussed. Four different technologies, blockchain, fog computing, edge computing,
    and machine learning, to increase the level of security in IoT are discussed.
    This paper presents a detailed survey of IoT security. First of all the security
    critical IoT applications are discussed. Next, the security threats at different

    \ growing demand for food in terms of quality and quantity has increased the need\n\
    for industrialization and intensiﬁcation in the agriculture ﬁeld. Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) is a highly\npromising technology that is oﬀering many innovative\
    \ solutions to modernize the agriculture sector.\nResearch institutions and scientiﬁc\
    \ groups are continuously working to deliver solutions and products\nusing IoT\
    \ to address diﬀerent domains of agriculture. This paper presents a systematic\
    \ literature\nreview (SLR) by conducting a survey of IoT technologies and their\
    \ current utilization in diﬀerent\napplication domains of the agriculture sector.\
    \ The underlying SLR has been compiled by reviewing\nresearch articles published\
    \ in well-reputed venues between 2006 and 2019. A total of 67 papers were\ncarefully\
    \ selected through a systematic process and classiﬁed accordingly. The primary\
    \ objective\nof this systematic study is the collection of all relevant research\
    \ on IoT agricultural applications,\nsensors/devices, communication protocols,\
    \ and network types. Furthermore, it also discusses the\nmain issues and challenges\
    \ that are being investigated in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Moreover, an\nIoT agriculture\
    \ framework has been presented that contextualizes the representation of a wide\
    \ range\nof current solutions in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Similarly, country policies\
    \ for IoT-based agriculture\nhave also been presented. Lastly, open issues and\
    \ challenges have been presented to provide the\nresearchers promising future\
    \ directions in the domain of IoT agriculture.\nKeywords:internetofthings;agriculture;devices/sensors;agriculturalapplications;communicationprotocols\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe widespread of the internet from the last two decades has\
    \ brought unlimited beneﬁts for\norganizations and citizens over the globe. The\
    \ major beneﬁt of this innovation was the capability\nto producer and consumer\
    \ services in real time. Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) is promising\nto provide\
    \ the same beneﬁt through its innovative technologies and giving a way to enhance\
    \ the\nuser’s perception and ability by modifying the working environment. IoT\
    \ oﬀers multiple solutions in\ndiﬀerent domains such as healthcare, retail, traﬃc,\
    \ security, smart homes, smart cities, and agriculture.\nIoT deployment in agriculture\
    \ is considered the ideal solution because in this area there is a need for\n\
    continuous monitoring and controlling. In the ﬁeld of agriculture, IoT is used\
    \ at diﬀerent levels in the\nagriculture industrial production chain [1]. The\
    \ main applications of IoT in agriculture are Precision\nFarming, Livestock, and\
    \ Greenhouses, which are grouped into diﬀerent monitoring domains. All these\n\
    applications are monitored with the help of diﬀerent IoT-based sensors/devices\
    \ by using wireless\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319; doi:10.3390/electronics9020319\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/electronics\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n2 of 41\nsensor networks\
    \ (WSNs) that helps the farmers collect relevant data through sensing devices.\
    \ Some\nIoT-based setups analyze and process the remote data by applying cloud\
    \ services, which helps the\nresearchers and agriculturists make better decisions.\
    \ Nowadays, with the advancement of current\ntechnology, environment monitoring\
    \ solutions oﬀer additional facilities in terms of management\nand decision making.\
    \ A custom-made landslide risk monitoring system has been developed that\nallows\
    \ quick implementations in hostile environments without user intervention [2].\
    \ What is more\ninteresting about the developed system is that it deals with node\
    \ failures and reorganizes the poor\nquality communication links on the network\
    \ by itself. An IoT management is proposed in [3] that\nmonitors the elements\
    \ such as wind, soil, atmosphere, and water over a large area. Moreover, IoT-based\n\
    agricultural monitoring solutions have been identiﬁed based on the sub-domains\
    \ to which they\nbelong. The identiﬁed sub-domains are soil monitoring, air monitoring,\
    \ temperature monitoring,\nwater monitoring, disease monitoring, location monitoring,\
    \ environmental conditions monitoring,\npest monitoring, and fertilization monitoring.\
    \ Further, the IoT paradigm improves human interaction\nin the physical world\
    \ through low-cost electronic devices and communication protocols. IoT also\n\
    monitors diﬀerent environmental conditions to create dense and real-time maps\
    \ of noise level, air,\nwater pollution, temperature, and damaging radiations\
    \ [4,5]. Besides, data collected about diﬀerent\nenvironmental parameters is transmitted\
    \ to the user by trigger alerts or sending recommendations to\nauthorities via\
    \ messages [6].\nIn the last few decades, a large number of studies have been\
    \ presented in the IoT-based agriculture\ndomain. Therefore, it is important to\
    \ collect, summarize, analyze, and classify the state-of-the-art\nresearch in\
    \ this area. The purpose of this research is to present a comprehensive systematic\
    \ literature\nreview in the ﬁeld of IoT agriculture. The contributions of this\
    \ paper related to the IoT agriculture\ndomain are as follows. In Section 2, we\
    \ present a background of IoT agriculture technology. In Section 3,\nwe present\
    \ the research methodology by deﬁning research questions, inclusion/exclusion\
    \ criteria, and\nsearch string to collect eﬀective studies relevant to the IoT\
    \ agriculture domain and focused on diﬀerent\npublication channels. In Section\
    \ 4, we present the research results in the form of tables by synthesizing\nthe\
    \ selected papers. Besides, some IoT-based agricultural applications, sensors/devices,\
    \ communication\nprotocols, and country policies are also presented in this section.\
    \ In Section 5, we present a summary\nof our ﬁndings through a research hierarchy\
    \ and designed an IoT-based smart farming framework.\nIn Section 6, open issues\
    \ and challenges in IoT agriculture have been discussed from many diﬀerent\nperspectives.\
    \ Moreover, research validity threats are presented in Section 8. Section 9 presents\
    \ the\nconclusions of the article.\n2. Background\nResearchers have proposed diﬀerent\
    \ IoT-based technologies in the agriculture ﬁeld that are\nincreasing the production\
    \ with less workforce eﬀort. Researchers have also worked on diﬀerent\nIoT-based\
    \ agriculture projects to improve the quality and increase agricultural productivity.\
    \ Some\nIoT-based agricultural techniques have been identiﬁed from the literature,\
    \ which have been summarized\nin this section.\nCarnegie Melon University has\
    \ worked on a plant nursery by using wireless\nsensors technology [7]. In [8],\
    \ a WSN-based polyhouse monitoring system has been presented\nthat makes use of\
    \ carbon dioxide, humidity, temperature and light detection modules. By using\
    \ GPS\ntechnology and ZigBee protocol a WSN-based system has been proposed that\
    \ monitors diﬀerent\nagricultural parameters [9]. A real-time rice crop monitoring\
    \ system has been designed to increase\nthe productivity [10]. The crop monitoring\
    \ system has been presented in [11], which collects the\ninformation of rainfall\
    \ and temperature and analyzes it to mitigate the risk of crop loss and enhance\n\
    crop productivity. A low-cost Bluetooth-based system has been proposed in [12]\
    \ for monitoring various\nagricultural variables such as temperature by using\
    \ a microcontroller that works as a weather station.\nThe proposed system is best\
    \ for monitoring real-time ﬁeld data. Moreover, the disadvantage of this\nsystem\
    \ is its limited communication range and required Bluetooth conﬁguration with\
    \ smartphones\nfor continuous monitoring. A smart sensing platform based on ZigBee\
    \ has developed by [13] for\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n3 of 41\nmonitoring diﬀerent\
    \ environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, sunlight, and pressure.\n\
    The developed platform provides a fast data rate, low-cost hardware, and an accurate\
    \ sensor working\non mesh network so that each node can communicate with each\
    \ other eﬀectively. A Global System for\nMobile Communications (GSM) based irrigation\
    \ monitoring system has been developed that uses an\nandroid app for measuring\
    \ diﬀerent environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, and\ncontrol\
    \ of the water level. The basic purpose of this system is to develop a low-cost\
    \ wireless system,\nwhereas the negative aspect of the system is to know the operating\
    \ command to actuate the ﬁeld\nmotor and agriculture parameters [14]. To measure\
    \ the greenhouse parameters such as humidity and\ntemperature, a system has been\
    \ proposed on the basis of GSM and Field Programmable Gate Array\n(FPGA). The\
    \ proposed system provides cost-eﬀective and timely monitoring solutions to monitor\
    \ crop\nand soil conditions [15]. In [16], a simple, ﬂexible networking low-cost\
    \ system has been proposed that\nuses a fuzzy control system to monitor diﬀerent\
    \ greenhouse parameters. The operation and design\nmethodologies for WSN have\
    \ been proposed in [17] for a more advanced monitoring and controlling\nsystem\
    \ in the greenhouse. Multiple environmental problems related to greenhouses have\
    \ also been\naddressed such as WSN components standardization, wireless node packaging,\
    \ and electromagnetic\nﬁeld interference. In [18], a system has been proposed\
    \ that monitors the animal’s health as well as\nidentiﬁes the widespread diseases,\
    \ whether it originates from biological attacks or natural causes.\nA low-cost\
    \ animal health monitoring system is presented in [19] that measures the heart\
    \ rate, postures,\nand body temperature.\n3. Research Methodology\nA systematic\
    \ literature review (SLR) is selected as the research methodology for this paper.\
    \ The goal\nof this research is to investigate and provide a review of existing\
    \ IoT-based agricultural monitoring\napplications, sensors/devices, and communication\
    \ protocols. We have followed the methodology\nproposed by [20] to make research\
    \ impartial in the context of information selection and results in\nrepresentations.\
    \ The research methodology for this systematic mapping study has been illustrated\
    \ in\nFigure 1.\nElectronics 2020, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n3 of 41 \nsensor working\
    \ on mesh network so that each node can communicate with each other effectively.\
    \ A \nGlobal System for Mobile Communications (GSM) based irrigation monitoring\
    \ system has been \ndeveloped that uses an android app for measuring different\
    \ environmental conditions such as \nhumidity, temperature, and control of the\
    \ water level. The basic purpose of this system is to develop \na low-cost wireless\
    \ system, whereas the negative aspect of the system is to know the operating \n\
    command to actuate the field motor and agriculture parameters [14]. To measure\
    \ the greenhouse \nparameters such as humidity and temperature, a system has been\
    \ proposed on the basis of GSM and \nField Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The\
    \ proposed system provides cost-effective and timely \nmonitoring solutions to\
    \ monitor crop and soil conditions [15]. In [16], a simple, flexible networking\
    \ \nlow-cost system has been proposed that uses a fuzzy control system to monitor\
    \ different greenhouse \nparameters. The operation and design methodologies for\
    \ WSN have been proposed in [17] for a more \nadvanced monitoring and controlling\
    \ system in the greenhouse. Multiple environmental problems \nrelated to greenhouses\
    \ have also been addressed such as WSN components standardization, wireless \n\
    node packaging, and electromagnetic field interference. In [18], a system has\
    \ been proposed that \nmonitors the animal’s health as well as identifies the\
    \ widespread diseases, whether it originates from \nbiological attacks or natural\
    \ causes. A low-cost animal health monitoring system is presented in [19] \nthat\
    \ measures the heart rate, postures, and body temperature. \n3. Research Methodology\
    \ \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is selected as the research methodology\
    \ for this paper. The \ngoal of this research is to investigate and provide a\
    \ review of existing IoT-based agricultural \nmonitoring applications, sensors/devices,\
    \ and communication protocols. We have followed the \nmethodology proposed by\
    \ [20] to make research impartial in the context of information selection and\
    \ \nresults in representations. The research methodology for this systematic mapping\
    \ study has been \nillustrated in Figure 1. \n \nFigure 1. Research methodology.\

    \ ﬁrst step of this SLR is the deﬁnition of research questions and provision of\
    \ the current\nresearch status on IoT-based agriculture. This SLR addresses eight\
    \ research questions with their\ncorresponding motivation represented in Table\
    \ 1.\nTable 1. Research questions. IoT: Internet of Things.\nNo\nResearch Question\n\
    Main Motivation\nRQ1\nWhat are the major targeted primary publication\nchannels\
    \ for IoT agricultural research?\nIn order to identify where IoT agricultural\n\
    research can be found as well as good\npublication sources for future studies.\n\
    RQ2\nHow has the frequency of approaches been\nchanged related to IoT agriculture\
    \ over time?\nIdentify the publication with the time related to\nIoT in agriculture.\n\
    RQ3\nWhat approaches are used to address problems\nrelated IoT agriculture?\n\
    To ﬁnd out existing IoT agriculture approaches\nreported in the existing IoT agriculture\
    \ literature.\nRQ4\nWhat are the main application domains of IoT in\nagriculture?\n\
    Identify the main areas of agriculture where\nIoT technology is being utilized\
    \ for monitoring,\ncontrolling, and tracking purposes.\nRQ5\nWhat are the primary\
    \ focuses of the selected\nstudies?\nTo identify the signiﬁcant proposed solutions.\n\
    RQ6\nWhat type of IoT devices/sensors have been\nused in agriculture?\nTo identify\

    \ protocols.\nRQ8\nWhich IoT agricultural policy have been\nimplemented in diﬀerent\
    \ countries?\nTo measure the potential of IoT in the agriculture\nﬁeld in the\
    \ diﬀerent countries.\n3.3. Search String\nThe second phase of SLR is to search\
    \ for relevant studies on the research topics. A search string\nhas been deﬁned\
    \ that is used to gather published articles related to the research topics. We\
    \ conducted\na pilot search based on the speciﬁc keywords, and we decided to use\
    \ only IoT applications in the\nagriculture search string. However, in the pilot\
    \ search, we have also used IoT sensors/devices and\ncommunication protocols in\
    \ agriculture. Internet research has been performed by using multiple search\n\
    engines and digital libraries to collect information. The obtained results were\
    \ compiled manually\nto get the best sources for information to answer the deﬁned\
    \ research questions. Selected search\nengines and digital libraries have been\
    \ chosen based on their scientiﬁc contents and closely related\nto the objective\
    \ of this paper. The chosen databases were Springer, Elsevier, IEEE, MDPI, and\
    \ IGI\nGlobal. The next step is to identify the consistent procedures and search\
    \ terms to seek out technical\nand scientiﬁc documentation in search engines and\
    \ digital libraries. The set of keywords selected to\ndeﬁne the search string\
    \ from the research questions is given in Table 2.\nTable 2. Search string.\n\
    Sources\nSearch String\nContext\nIEEE Xplore, Science\nDirect, Springer Link,\n\
    MDPI, and IGI Global\n(“Internet of Things” OR “IoT”) AND (“IoT agricultural\n\
    Applications” OR “Devices/Sensors” OR “IoT agricultural\ndevices/sensors”) OR\
    \ (“IoT agricultural protocols” OR\n“IoT Communication Protocols”)\nAgriculture\n\
    3.4. Screening of Relevant Papers\nAll the papers in the search were not precisely\
    \ relevant to research questions; therefore, they\nneeded to be assessed according\
    \ to the actual relevancy. For this purpose, we used the search process\nElectronics\
    \ 2020, 9, 319\n5 of 41\ndeﬁned by Dybå and Dingsøyr [21] for the screening of\
    \ relevant papers. In the ﬁrst screening phase,\npapers were selected based on\
    \ their titles, and we excluded those studies that were irrelevant to the\nresearch\
    \ area. For example, the keyword protocol returns articles relevant to IoT in\
    \ other ﬁelds that\nhave diﬀerent meanings than the IoT technology used in agriculture.\
    \ These papers were totally out of\nscope, so we excluded them. In the second\
    \ phase of screening, we read the abstract of each article that\nwas selected\
    \ in the ﬁrst screening phase. Furthermore, inclusion and exclusion criteria also\
    \ used to\nscreen papers.\nWe decided to exclude the following types of papers:\n\
    •\nArticles not presenting new and emerging ideas.\n•\nPapers published other\
    \ than conferences, journals, patents, and technical reports.\n•\nArticles without\
    \ deﬁning data sources or where the data collection procedure was unclear.\n•\n\
    Articles not published in the English language.\n•\nPapers published before 2006.\n\
    •\nPapers that are not relevant to the search string.\nPapers have been selected\
    \ on the basis of the given exclusion criteria and after examining the\nabstract\
    \ of selected studies, we have decided to include it in the next screening phase.\n\
    3.5. Keywording Using Abstract\nTo ﬁnd the relevant papers through keywording\
    \ by using the abstract, we used a process deﬁned\nby Petersen et al. [22]. Keywording\
    \ has been done in two phases. In the ﬁrst phase, we have examined\nthe abstract\
    \ and identiﬁed the concepts and keywords that reﬂected the contribution of the\
    \ studies.\nIn the second phase, a higher level of understanding is developed\
    \ on the basis of these keywords. For\nthe mapping of reviews, we have used keywords\
    \ to form and cluster the categories.\n3.6. Quality Assessment\nIn an SLR, generally,\
    \ quality assessment (QA) is carried out to assess the quality of selected papers.\n\
    In this SLR, a questionnaire has been designed to measure the quality of the selected\

    \ Process\nThe selection and search processes results are presented in Table 4.\
    \ Initially, 3179 papers were\nselected when the search protocol was applied on\
    \ the selected repositories. A screening process\nhas been applied on the basis\
    \ of the exclusion criteria, keywords, titles, abstracts, and full articles\n\
    of retrieved papers. One author retrieved all these papers; then, two authors\
    \ examined the papers,\nwhich led to the selection of a total 240 papers. After\
    \ that, we eliminated the duplicate titles and the\ntitles that were not relevant\
    \ to the review. For example, most of the excluded papers were related to\ngeneral\
    \ IoT such as privacy, security, healthcare, retail, and smart cities. To determine\
    \ the assessment\nagreement between two authors, a Cohen’s kappa coeﬃcient of\
    \ 0.91 was used, which indicates that\nthe evaluation made by authors is a perfect\
    \ measurement [24]. Furthermore, after reading the full\nabstracts of the selected\
    \ 171 papers in the duplication phase, we have selected 104 papers on the basis\n\
    of their abstracts. In the end, 67 studies were selected out of 3179.\nTable 4.\

    \ is to evaluate and determine the air condition in order to prevent \nfrom damaging\
    \ effects. In [25] an IoT-based agricultural air, humidity, and temperature monitoring\
    \ \nsystem has been proposed. This system offers a real-time microclimate monitoring\
    \ solution that is \nbased on WSNs. The system consists of a temperature and humidity\
    \ sensor that is supported by a \ncommunication technology called ZigBee and powered\
    \ by solar panels. \nFigure 5. IoT agriculture applications.\nElectronics 2020,\
    \ 9, 319\n20 of 41\nAir Monitoring\nThe aim of this sub-domain is to evaluate\
    \ and determine the air condition in order to prevent\nfrom damaging eﬀects. In\
    \ [25] an IoT-based agricultural air, humidity, and temperature monitoring\nsystem\
    \ has been proposed. This system oﬀers a real-time microclimate monitoring solution\
    \ that is\nbased on WSNs. The system consists of a temperature and humidity sensor\
    \ that is supported by a\ncommunication technology called ZigBee and powered by\
    \ solar panels.\nSoil Monitoring\nPaper categorized in this sub-domain [26] proposed\
    \ solutions for soil moisture and temperature\nmonitoring in the ﬁelds using WSN.\
    \ Both of these systems are maintained through multiple\ncommunication technologies\
    \ such as GPRS, ZigBee, and the internet, where the user interacts with the\n\
    system through web applications [63,85].\nWater Monitoring\nThe studies that have\
    \ been categorized in this sub-domain intend to monitor water quality or\nwater\
    \ pollution by sensing PH, temperature, and chemicals, which can change the normal\
    \ conditions\nof water. In [27], an IoT-based solution has been presented to monitor\
    \ the water quality by measuring\ntemperature, conductivity, and turbidity. This\
    \ solution based on WSN combines sensing devices and\nmonitors the multiple parameters\
    \ of water in urban areas. Moreover, [28] developed a WSN-based\nsystem to monitor\
    \ the rainfall and water level in irrigation systems. A web-based decision support\n\
    system has been proposed in [29] that use sensors to measure temperature, solar\
    \ radiations, humidity,\nand rainfall for irrigation monitoring in olive ﬁelds.\n\
    Disease Monitoring\nThe LOFAR-agro Project is the best example for crop or plant\
    \ monitoring [30]. This project protects\nthe potato crop by monitoring diﬀerent\
    \ climate conditions such as temperature and humidity through\nWSN. The proposed\
    \ system protects the crop by analyzing the collected data from fungal diseases.\n\
    Environmental Condition Monitoring\nAn environmental condition monitoring system\
    \ is proposed in [34] that measures the spatial\nsampling of humidity sensors\
    \ using WSN. To determine the behavior of 2D correlation, a historical\ndatabase\
    \ is being used in the proposed system. Moreover, another environmental conditions\
    \ monitoring\nsystem is proposed in [35] that integrates forecasting and drought\
    \ monitoring musing IoT.\nCrop and Plant Growth Monitoring\nIn this sub-domain,\
    \ farmlands have been analyzed by using the mobile sensors presented in [94].\n\
    The essential purpose of this proposed system is to monitor the growth of grapes\
    \ and control plans\nfor viticulture activities. To monitor apple orchards, researchers\
    \ proposed an eﬃcient and intelligent\nmonitoring system that provides suggestions\
    \ based on the sensed data [95]. The basic purpose of this\nproposed system is\
    \ to decrease the management costs, improve the quality of apples, and protect\
    \ from\npest attacks. It is a WSN-based system that is designed by using ZigBee\
    \ and GPRS to monitor the\ngrowth of apples.\nTemperature Monitoring\nSoil temperature\
    \ plays a vital role in crop productivity. In [96], a system has been proposed\n\
    to monitor the amount of nutrients between surface and ground water. To measure\
    \ the quantity of\nnutrients in soil, electrochemical impedance was applied. Soil\
    \ test results are monitored through\nan inductance (L), capacitance (C), and\
    \ resistance (R) (LCR) meter, and the results are calculated via\nstandard library\
    \ measurements.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n21 of 41\nHumidity Monitoring\nThe\
    \ humidity level is measured in air by using multiple humidity sensors. An inappropriate\n\
    amount of humidity leaves a negative impact on plants regarding cell growth [36].\n\
    Monitoring Gases in Greenhouse\nAgriculture and greenhouse gases are related to\
    \ each other. The excessive amount of gases in a\ngreenhouse increases the temperature,\
    \ which directly impacts the agriculture productivity. To monitor\nthe greenhouse\
    \ gases and CH4, a WSN and solar powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system\n\
    has been presented [37].\nFertilization and Pest Control\nIn this domain, an IoT\
    \ solution provides conservation approaches to improve the quality of the\ncrops\
    \ and amount of nutrients usage. An online climate monitoring system has been\
    \ presented for\ngreenhouses to monitor pests, irrigation, fertilization, and\
    \ climate [33]. The system use WSN to gather\nand analyze sensed data for eﬃcient\
    \ analysis.\nGreenhouse Illumination Control\nAn automated agriculture system\
    \ is developed to monitor the growth of cabbages and melons in\ngreenhouses [38].\
    \ The designed system monitors the crop growing process and controls the greenhouse\n\
    environmental conditions such as temperature, ambient light, and humidity.\nLocation\
    \ Tracking\nThis sub-domain referred to the tracking and tracing of animal locations\
    \ and any unwanted\nmovement all over the ﬁeld. Diﬀerent monitoring devices and\
    \ sensors have been deployed in the\nﬁeld to save the crop from theft and wild\
    \ attacks. For agriculture, an intrusion detection solution is\npresented in [31]\
    \ that generates an alarm and sends a text message to the farmer’s mobile when\
    \ an\nunwanted movement happens in the crop ﬁeld. Moreover, for livestock, diﬀerent\
    \ monitoring devices\nare implemented to track the animals’ locations and monitor\
    \ their activities. In [32], an IoT-based\nanimal monitoring solution is presented\
    \ that monitors the behavior of swamp deer. Moreover, a herd\nof cattle grazing\
    \ in the ﬁeld can be monitored and tracked by using RFID and WSN [97]. In this\
    \ way\nranchers can get real time monitoring of cattle’s.\n4.1.6. Assessment of\
    \ RQ6: What Is the Role of IoT-Based Devices/Sensors in Agriculture\nMultiple\
    \ organizations and industries are using diﬀerent kinds of devices/sensors for\
    \ a long time,\nbut an invention of IoT has taken advancements of devices/sensors\
    \ totally at a diﬀerent level. An\nIoT device consists of an embedded system that\
    \ interacts with actuators, sensors, and the required WSN.\nEmbedded systems consist\
    \ of a microprocessor, memory, communication modules, and input/output\ncomponents.\
    \ Sensors monitor the diﬀerent environmental parameters and farm variables in\
    \ the ﬁeld\nof agriculture and dynamic data that is obtained through facilities\
    \ intervention.\nCommonly used sensors are temperature sensors, humidity sensor,\
    \ soil pattern monitoring sensor,\nairﬂow sensor, a location sensor, CO2 sensor,\
    \ pressure sensor and moisture sensor. The signiﬁcant\ncharacteristics of IoT\
    \ devices/sensors that make them suitable for agriculture are their (1) portability;\n\
    (2) reliability; (3) memory; (4) durability; (5) power and computational eﬃciency;\
    \ and (6) coverage.\nThis systematic study shows that many researchers have been\
    \ focused on temperature monitoring\n(19%), humidity (17%), and soil moisture\
    \ (14%). Twenty types of data have been collected through\ndiﬀerent monitoring\
    \ and sensing devices, as shown in Figure 6.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n22 of\
    \ 41\n \nportability; (2) reliability; (3) memory; (4) durability; (5) power and\
    \ computational efficiency; and (6) \ncoverage. This systematic study shows that\
    \ many researchers have been focused on temperature \nmonitoring (19%), humidity\
    \ (17%), and soil moisture (14%). Twenty types of data have been collected \n\
    through different monitoring and sensing devices, as shown in Figure 6. \nTemperature,\
    \ humidity, and soil moisture are considered the most critical variables for smart\
    \ \nfarming, as shown in Figure 6. Meanwhile, Table 7 represents the operations\

    \ this sensor measures the exact amount of toxic gases in livestock \nand greenhouses\

    \ 6. Meanwhile, Table 7 represents the operations of diﬀerent sensors and\ndevices\
    \ in the ﬁeld of IoT agriculture.\nTable 7. Sensor/devices operation.\nInﬁrmity\n\
    Sensor/Devices Operations\nPH Sensor\nTo monitor the exact amount of nutrients\
    \ in soil, PH sensors are used, which is eﬃcient for\nthe healthy growth of plants\
    \ and crops [98].\nGas Sensor\nThrough the observation of infrared radiations\
    \ this sensor measures the exact amount of\ntoxic gases in livestock and greenhouses\
    \ [99]. A sensor node called Waspmote Plug &\nSense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme\
    \ has been designed to monitor the gas level water content\nin the soil.\nMotion\
    \ Detector\nSensor\nThe sensor is used to track/trace the location of animals\
    \ and ﬁeld, moreover it also detect\nthe motion of an unwanted object in the ﬁeld\
    \ or farm and generate alerts to farmer for\ntimely action and preventing crop\
    \ loss [100].\nUltra Violet\nSensor and\nPassive Infrared\n(PIR) Sensors\nAn ultra\
    \ violet sensor monitors the UV rays for the eﬀective growth of crops [101]. In\
    \ the\nPIR sensor, a motion detector is ﬁxed that traces the range of a person’s\
    \ movement in the\nﬁeld. The sensor also has a light detection property: while\
    \ tracking an object, it changes\nthe rising temperature into voltage for analyzing\
    \ crop growth [102].\nSoil Moisture\nSensor\nThe soil sensor measures the quantity\
    \ of water and level of moisture all over the ﬁeld [103].\nIn [104], a wireless\
    \ moisture sensor has been implemented to monitor the greenhouse\nirrigation system.\
    \ CropX Starter Kit–Soil Temperature 24/7 is cellular connection sensor\nthat\
    \ is used to monitor the multiple soil conditions [105].\nTemperature\nSensor\n\
    Changes in the soil temperature aﬀect the absorption soil nutrients and moisture.\
    \ A novel\nsensing approach has been presented to map the exact amount of nutrients\
    \ in soil and the\nwater surface [12]. A 3D crop sensor Array with Photosynthetically\
    \ Active Radiation (PAR)\ntechnology can be deployed at any location of ﬁeld to\
    \ monitor the temperature, CO2, and\nhumidity [106].\nHumidity\nSensor\nHumidity\
    \ leaves a negative impact on the growth of plant leaves, photosynthesis, and\n\
    pollination. Therefore, to sense the level of humidity in air, this sensor directly\
    \ measures\nthe temperature and moisture content in the air [107]. Groﬁt provides\
    \ diﬀerent climate\nmonitoring devices that can monitor the air temperature, air\
    \ humidity, and sun radiation.\nThe data transmission range of the device is up\
    \ to 200 m and stores the measurement for a\nmaximum of 30 days [108].\nElectronics\

    implementation costs and improve the soil quality by providing guidance to the\
    \ famer regarding how\nto save the water and power by utilizing IoT technology\
    \ [92]. The farming community enthusiastically\nfollowed these guidelines and\
    \ obtained results that were very encouraging and positive. Companies\nsaved approximately\
    \ 8700 euro, 21% savings were achieved in pasture management; there was also a\n\
    10% reduction in greenhouses gas emission and 47% savings in soil fertility. To\

    \ Plan [119].\nThe project has started in eight provinces of China to collect\
    \ data from diﬀerent sources such as national\ndata centers. Furthermore, the\
    \ Huawei Company in China developed an NB-IoT app to transform the\nagriculture\
    \ ﬁeld in a more innovative way. NB-IoT provides excellent agricultural solutions\
    \ at low cost\nwithout any gateway implementation as compared to other cellular\
    \ networks. NB-IoT provides a wide\nrange of coverage with a large number of connections\
    \ to resolve the issues of the scattered agricultural\ndata [120].\nMalaysia\n\

    \ in cohesive manners. The developed framework utilizes the WSN and\nMicro Electro\
    \ Mechanical System (MEMS) technologies to gather environmental data [121].\n\
    USA\nIn order to fulﬁll the basic requirements of food and energy, the USA government\
    \ has initiated\nmany research and development projects related to agricultural\
    \ technologies. The National Institute of\nFood and Agriculture is working on\
    \ a project called the Internet-of-Ag-Things and developed sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ for agricultural practices. The major aim of the project is to provide precision\
    \ farming\ntechniques to increase the agricultural productivity and make better\

    \ and\nother resources.\nMoreover, it also provides data support for new operations\
    \ and performs multiple processing\ntechniques such as image processing, statistical\
    \ analysis, simulation, prediction, early warning, and\nmodeling [93]. Cloud Computing\
    \ provides software services, hardware services, infrastructure services,\nand\
    \ platform services to diﬀerent IoT agricultural applications. The cloud platform\
    \ oﬀers cheap\ndata storage services to the farmers such as image, text, videos,\
    \ and other agricultural data, which\nfacilitates the agricultural enterprises\
    \ by reducing storage cost [42]. Moreover, it is a diﬃcult task to\nmake the direct\
    \ use of raw agricultural data for decision making on the basis of farmers’ technical\n\
    expertise. In contrast, agricultural experts can also give suggestions and make\
    \ accurate judgments\nbased on quantitative analysis. Therefore, only cloud computing\
    \ provides an intelligent and secure\nplatform for monitoring crop [128] Although\
    \ the cloud platform helps the farmer through its advance\ntechniques, still,\
    \ there are some limitations due to which farmers face technology losses related\
    \ to\ninternet connectivity and low power. Edge computing is one of the new computing\
    \ models that\nperform the calculations at the edge of the network. This platform\
    \ also reduces the computational\nload by improving data transmission speed and\
    \ protects agricultural data because processing in edge\ncomputing occurs more\
    \ compared to cloud computing [76,129].\nData processing consists of audio, video,\
    \ text image processing, and many other processing\ntechniques. These features\
    \ may be added or removed according to the system requirements.\nData visualization\
    \ is one of the most visible components in the IoT agricultural ﬁeld, which consists\n\
    of monitoring, controlling, and tracking/tracing. The monitoring function includes\
    \ environmental\nconditions monitoring, crop and plants growth monitoring, disease\
    \ monitoring, soil monitoring, and\nanimal health monitoring. The controlling\
    \ function controls the diﬀerent agricultural parameters such as\npest, fertilization,\
    \ and greenhouse illumination control. Moreover the tracking/tracing sub-component\n\
    tracks the animals and ﬁeld location. The whole monitoring, controlling, and tracking\
    \ process is\ncontrolled is through a controller and managed through the system\
    \ management component.\nThe system management component includes various kinds\
    \ of actuators, sensors, microcontrollers,\nand drone controllers. The most commonly\
    \ used sensors/devices are environmental conditions\nmonitoring sensors, crop/plant\
    \ monitoring sensors, and animal health monitoring sensors/devices.\nThese sensors\

    \ information\nis processed through embedded devices to make the proper analysis\
    \ for smart farming.\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n30 of 41\n5.3. State-of-the-Art\
    \ IoT Agricultural Solutions in the Market\nAccording to the report of Finistere\
    \ Ventures, more than 2 billion dollars have been invested\naround the globe in\
    \ AgTech, which is expected to increase in the coming years [130]. As IoT is gaining\n\
    is importance in diﬀerent applications of smart farming, almost all of the top\
    \ technology ﬁrms are\ninvesting and supporting this technology in their own way\
    \ to develop innovation in the agriculture\nﬁeld. Table 10 represents the diﬀerent\
    \ IoT agricultural solutions proposed by the top technologies ﬁrms.\nTable 10.\
    \ Available solutions and initiatives regarding IoT in agriculture.\nIndustries\n\
    Initiatives and Solutions\nSamsung\nSamsung takes the initiative in the ﬁeld of\
    \ IoT by providing its Samsung Data Systems\n(SDS) IoT Platform, which connects\
    \ the multiple IoT devices and communication protocols\nsuch as Modbus, Zigbee,\
    \ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), MQTT, and LoRaWAN [131].\nAeroFarms\nAeroFarms provides\
    \ indoor farming solutions by analyzing data related to plants into data\nthrough\
    \ big data, imaging, and artiﬁcial intelligence technologies [132].\nMicrosoft\n\
    Microsoft also works on data-driven farming techniques by resolving the issues\
    \ from cloud\nto sensor [133]. The Bosch technology ﬁrm provides diﬀerent sensors\
    \ analytics techniques\nand IoT-based data management techniques to monitor the\
    \ crop productivity and\ndiseases [134].\nR- Style Lab\nR- Style Lab is the top\
    \ IoT software-providing company that oﬀers multiple software\nsolutions such\
    \ as predictive maintenance, drone’s inspections, and crop/animal monitoring\n\
    solutions, and it provides some embedded software that can easily be integrated\
    \ into\nportable trackers [135,136].\nIBM\nIBM has provide an AI-based service\
    \ called Watson Decision, which is best solution to\nimprove the sustainability,\
    \ harvesting, and quality of smart farming by using IoT and AI\ntechnologies [137].\n\
    Intel\nIntel has been developed an IoT-based platform Inﬁswift, which helps increase\
    \ the\neﬃciency of agricultural solutions through advanced connected services\
    \ [138].\nGoogle\nGoogle has suggested a vision for advanced agricultural solutions\
    \ by joining the MIT\nMedia Lab Open Agriculture Initiative to provide a healthier\
    \ food system [139].\n6. Open Issues and Challenges\nThere are many open issues\
    \ and challenges that are associated with the implementation of\nIoT applications.\
    \ Some of the challenges that are identiﬁed from the literature have been discussed\
    \ in\nthis section.\n6.1. Security\nSecurity issues arise at a diﬀerent level\
    \ of IoT-based agricultural systems, which need to be\naddressed. Due to low security,\
    \ users face many diﬃculties such as loss of data and other on-ﬁeld\nparameters.\
    \ IoT privacy and security issues have been discussed in [140–142] broadly. In\
    \ the agriculture\nﬁeld, IoT devices are at risk due to physical interference\
    \ such as attack by animals and predators or\nmodiﬁcation in physical address\
    \ [142,143]. Moreover, due to low energy consumption and limited\nmemory, it is\
    \ hard to implement sophisticated and complex algorithms. The precision farming\
    \ services\nsuch as IoT-enabled location information and location-based services\
    \ are exposed to hackers that\nmay use this information for device capturing [141,142,144].\
    \ Attackers attack the IoT device and\ntake out cryptographic implementations.\
    \ Other communication layers also undergo some vulnerable\ndenial-of-service (DoS)\
    \ attacks and wireless signal blocking [142]. Major security threats to the cloud\n\
    infrastructure are hijacking attacks, session hijacking, database issues, and\
    \ denial of service attack [142].\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n31 of 41\n6.2. Cost\n\
    While deploying IoT in agriculture, several cost-related issues arise such as\
    \ setup and running\ncosts. The setup costs consist of hardware costs such as\
    \ IoT devices/sensors, base station infrastructure,\nand gateways. Moreover, running\
    \ costs includes an uninterrupted subscription for the management of\nIoT devices,\
    \ the exchange of information among other services, and centralized services that\
    \ provide\ninformation/data collection [47].\n6.3. Lack Knowledge of Technology\n\
    Poor understanding of technology is the main barrier among the farmers who are\
    \ living in rural\nareas. This problem is common in developing countries, where\
    \ most farmers are uneducated [145].\nThe implementation of IoT in agriculture\
    \ is a big challenge, because a lot of investment is required in\nfarmer’s training\
    \ before deploying IoT infrastructure.\n6.4. Reliability\nIn the ﬁeld of agriculture,\
    \ IoT devices are deployed in an open environment due to which harsh\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions may cause communication failure and the humiliation of deployed sensors.\n\
    Therefore, it is important to ensure the physical safety of deployed IoT devices/sensors\
    \ to protect them\nfrom severe climate conditions [146].\n6.5. Scalability\nA\
    \ large number of IoT devices and sensors are deployed in the agriculture ﬁeld,\
    \ due to which an\nintelligent IoT management system is required for the identiﬁcation\
    \ and controlling of each node [147].\n6.6. Localization\nThere are many factors\
    \ that need to be considered while deploying devices/sensors. Such devices\nshould\
    \ have the ability to provide functionality and support to the rest of the world\
    \ without deploying\nadditional devices with overhead conﬁguration [148].\nMoreover,\
    \ it is important to select the\nbest deployment position so that devices can\
    \ communicate and exchange information without\nany interference.\n6.7. Interoperability\n\
    There are billions of IoT devices, standards, and protocols that are needed to\
    \ interoperate.\nInteroperability involves semantic, syntactic, technical, and\
    \ organizational policy. Semantic interoperability\nis the ability to deal with\
    \ the interpretation of content exchanged among humans. Syntactical interoperability\n\
    is related to data formats, such as java script object notation (JSON), data interchanged\
    \ electronically,\nextensible markup language (XML), and variables separated by\
    \ a comma. Technical interoperability\nis associated with the development of infrastructure,\
    \ protocols, and hardware/software components\nthat enable the IoT devices’ communication.\
    \ Organizational interoperability is related to policies for\ncommunicating and\
    \ transferring data effectively across the different geographic regions and infrastructure.\n\
    Whereas, in [149], three methods have been proposed through which interoperability\
    \ can also be obtained,\nwhich are (i) two standards open and close, (ii) partnership\
    \ among services and product developers, and\n(iii) mediator and adaptors services.\
    \ More research work is expected to obtain a high interoperability\namong multiple\
    \ IoT devices.\n7. Integration Challenges of IoT and Cloud Computing in Agriculture\n\
    The aim of the cloud-based IoT paradigm is to analyze and integrate the data that\
    \ is coming from\nthe real world into IoT objects. This paradigm requires interacting\
    \ with millions of end devices that\nare thoroughly distributed [110]. Although\
    \ the cloud platform helps the farmer through its advance\ntechniques, still,\
    \ there are some limitations due to which farmers face technology loss related\
    \ to internet\nElectronics 2020, 9, 319\n32 of 41\nconnectivity, low-power communication\
    \ devices, and many other integration challenges. Moreover,\nthe monitoring and\
    \ controlling processes have made the data sharing of IoT devices more diﬃcult,\n\
    because IoT communication devices face connectivity issues and latency problems\
    \ [111]. Some of the\nnetworking challenges that users face while assessing and\
    \ uploading the information on cloud are\ngiven in Table 11.\nTable 11. Mapping\
    \ problems and solutions regarding IoT and cloud computing integration.\nYear\n\
    Reference\nProblems\nSolutions\n2016\n[150]\nIt has become very diﬃcult to handle\
    \ the\ndata-generating devices and\npower-constrained sensors, in order to\nobtain\
    \ the more valuable services.\nThe cloud of things (CoTs) solution has been\n\
    presented to handle the increasing demand of\ndata-generating devices and other\n\
    communication resources underlying the\nWSNs.\n2016\n[151]\nIoT consist of millions\
    \ of interconnected\ndevices such as WSAN, RFID etc. in\norder to exchange the\
    \ agricultural\ninformation; therefore, cloud computing\ntechnology is necessary\
    \ due to the\nconnectivity limitations in this ﬁeld.\nAuthors presented a survey\
    \ on cloud\ninfrastructures, cloud platforms, and\nIoT middleware for the integration\
    \ of devices\nand communication protocols.\n2013\n[152]\nDue to the adaptation\
    \ of a large number\nof wireless technologies, IoT has stepped\nout to create\
    \ a fully integrated future\nnetwork.\nImplemented cloud solutions by using Aneka,\n\
    which is a centric vision for the convergence\nof internet, WSN, and distributed\
    \ computing.\n2013\n[153]\nThe integration of IoT and cloud\ncomputing has become\
    \ a primary need\nover the last few years to manage\ndiﬀerent power connectivity\
    \ issues.\nThe author designed a framework to procure\ndata from decentralized,\
    \ heterogeneous,\nhighly distributed, and virtual devices that\ncan be controlled,\
    \ analyzed, and managed\nautomatically.\n2014\n[154]\nThe IoT has become more\
    \ persistent due\nto which its integration with cloud\ncomputing is very important.\n\
    The integration of both technologies is not\nsimple, because diﬀerent key issues\
    \ occur\nthat people face while accessing the\ncommunication network to retrieve\
    \ or upload\ninformation to the cloud. A survey has been\npresented that highlights\
    \ the main challenges\nand provides their respective solutions.\n8. Threats to\
    \ Validity\nThere have been four kinds of threats to validity identiﬁed in this\
    \ section.\n8.1. Construct Validity\nIn the SLR, construct validity threats are\
    \ relevant to the classiﬁcation of selected studies [147,148].\nSearch keywords\
    \ have been proposed and identiﬁed by two authors, and seven terms related to\n\
    IoT agriculture have been used in the search string. However, the list is not\
    \ complete; some alternative\nand additional terms may alter the list of ﬁnal\
    \ selected papers [84]. A search string was performed\nby using IEEE Xplore, Science\
    \ Direct, Springer, MDPI, and IGI Global. According to the statistics\nof the\
    \ search engines, we have found most of the research papers related to IoT agriculture\
    \ in these\nelectronics libraries. To mitigate the risk of missing essential and\
    \ related publications, we have sought\nout the related papers in major IoT agriculture\
    \ research venues. Although the standard of the primary\nstudies decreased by\
    \ including publications that are not from top journals and conferences, it indicates\n\
    that the studies relevant to IoT have increased.\n8.2. Internal Validity\nThis\
    \ type of validity handles the extraction data analysis process, in which two\
    \ authors have\nidentiﬁed the classiﬁcation of selected papers and the data extraction\
    \ process, whereas one author\nreviewed the ﬁnal results. Data collection and\
    \ paper classiﬁcation have been made on the judgment of\nElectronics 2020, 9,\
    \ 319\n33 of 41\ntwo authors. The kappa coeﬃcient value was 0.91, which indicates\
    \ that there has been a high level of\nagreement among the authors and reduces\
    \ the dissimilarity threats signiﬁcantly by showing a similar\nunderstanding of\
    \ relevance.\n8.3. External Validity\nExternal validity is related to the generalization\
    \ of this study. The mapping results have been\nconsidered regarding the IoT domain,\
    \ and the validity of the results presented in this paper concerns\nonly the IoT\
    \ agriculture domain. The classiﬁcation of the papers and search string presented\
    \ in this\nresearch may help the practitioners as a starting point for IoT agriculture\
    \ research, and researchers can\ncategorize the addition studies accordingly.\n\
    8.4. Conclusion Validity\nThe conclusion validity threat is related to the identiﬁcation\
    \ of improper relationships that may\ngenerate an incorrect conclusion. In the\
    \ mapping study, a conclusion validity threat refers to the\ndiﬀerent elements\
    \ such as incorrect data extraction and missing studies. To decrease this threat,\
    \ the\ndata extraction and selection process have been clearly deﬁned in the previous\
    \ paragraph on internal\nvalidity. The traceability among the extracted data and\
    \ the conclusion has been strengthened through\nthe direct generation of frequency\
    \ plots and bubble plots generated from the collected data by applying\nstatistical\
    \ analysis.\n9. Conclusions\nThis article has presented a systematic literature\
    \ review that presents a discussion on selective\nhigh-quality research articles\
    \ published in the domain of IoT-based agriculture. The survey has\nbeen conducted\
    \ by employing a systematic methodology to select 67 studies. Thereafter, an analysis\n\
    of diﬀerent IoT agriculture applications, sensors/devices, and communication protocols\
    \ has been\npresented. The most promising fact is that this area of research is\
    \ being patronized by the governments\nof various countries, and many countries\
    \ have their IoT agriculture policies. Apart from this, all\nthe major components\
    \ of IoT-based agriculture have been contextualized in a framework. Lastly,\n\
    the promising future directions have been discussed for the researchers working\
    \ in the domain of\nIoT-based agriculture.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    With the deep combination of both modern information technology and traditional
    agriculture, the era of agriculture 4.0, which takes the form of smart agriculture,
    has come. Smart agriculture provides solutions for agricultural intelligence and
    automation. However, information security issues cannot be ignored with the development
    of agriculture brought by modern information technology. In this paper, three
    typical development modes of smart agriculture (precision agriculture, facility
    agriculture, and order agriculture) are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and
    11 key applications are derived from the above modes. Based on the above technologies
    and applications, 6 security and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access
    control, privacy-preserving, blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography
    and key management, physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems)
    are summarized and discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture
    are analyzed and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2)
    information technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural
    equipment as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments
    based on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate
    that agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more
    technologies (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable
    energy management system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented
    reality, and cyber security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the
    future research directions of smart agriculture. Published in: IEEE/CAA Journal

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: I. Introduction Agriculture is the primary industry
    in the world, and it plays an important role in social stability and economic
    development [1]. Overcoming the contradiction between the population explosion
    and the limited grain yield is a challenge that motivates an increasing number
    of studies on smart agriculture. The development of agriculture is based on both
    the improvement in productivity and the restrictions of the era, and the progress
    of science and technology drives the revolution of agriculture [2]. Fig. 1 is
    used to help readers understand the characteristics and confronted issues of agriculture
    development (from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0). • Agriculture 1.0: the
    traditional agricultural era (between 1784 and around 1870) dominated by human
    and animal resources, the main issue of agriculture was the low efficiency of
    operation. • Agriculture 2.0: the era of mechanized agriculture (in the 20th century),
    the main issue was the inefficient use of resources. • Agriculture 3.0: the era
    of high-speed development of automatic agriculture (between 1992 to 2017), the
    main issue was the low level of intelligence. • Agriculture 4.0: the era of smart
    agriculture (which is characterized by unmanned operations, begin at 2017) is
    mainly marked by the use of modern information technology to both serve agriculture
    and develop it intelligently. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    Get rights and content Highlights • First literature review paper of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. • Four applications of blockchain
    technology are identified. • Six challenges for applying blockchain technology
    are identified. • Research gaps and future research directions are proposed. Abstract
    Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing
    sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers,
    it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully
    by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital
    technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity
    and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance,
    immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction
    records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature
    network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including
    its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges
    from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together
    with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things
    have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four
    main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable
    water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity
    and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature,
    research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding
    the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field
    of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain
    technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements
    such as food safety, food quality and food traceability. Previous article in issue

    1. Introduction The agri-food value chain is a complex system responsible for
    the circulation of agri-food products from the initial stage of production to
    the final stage of consumption. In the circulation process, value chain members
    play a critical role in meeting the consumers’ demand for agri-food products and
    maintaining the quality and safety of products [1]. Simultaneously, with the rapid
    development of internet technologies in the value chain area, a large number of
    emerging technologies such as advanced information and communication technology
    (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been applied to the agri-food value
    chain [46]. However, almost all the systems applied to the agri-food value chain
    are centralised, monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque, and may result in serious
    trust problem. Therefore, consumers’ confidence towards food safety has been broken
    after a series of food safety risk incidents and scandals over the last decades
    [46], such as mad cow disease, horsemeat scandal [2], toxic milk powder, genetically
    modified food and trench oil [3]. Consequently, detailed information of agri-food
    products from farm to fork is increasingly requested by consumers. Furthermore,
    how to build fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability
    of agri-food value chain [4], regulations and customers’ expectations towards
    food quality and food safety [5], the complexity of agri-food value chain [6],
    and the current applications of technologies and their potential issues/pitfalls
    [7] have attracted increasing attention from academics and practitioners. A potential
    solution to alleviate the above issues and concerns is usage of blockchain technology,
    which is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0
    to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and any single point failure.
    Four special elements - decentralised, immutable, consensus, and democratic that
    are unique to blockchain networks that make the technology more attractive in
    promoting trust and transparency in the agri-food value chain fraught with errors,
    duplication and redundancies [68]. Crosby et al. [8] underlines that blockchain
    is essentially a distributed database system that records transactional data or
    other digital events that have been executed and shared among value chain participants.
    It enables agri-food value chain participants to establish a decentralized consensus
    on the sequence of events and the current status of the transaction [9]. Blockchain
    technology uses a combination of different technologies that have been applied
    in computer science such as public/private key cryptography, cryptographic hash
    functions and database technologies [10], which provides an innovative solution
    to achieve food traceability, transparency, safety and security [11]. Two prominent
    benefits of blockchain technology are that it provides a permanent transaction
    records which are grouped into individual blocks and cannot be tampered with;
    and it can replace those traditional paper tracking systems and manual monitoring
    systems, so as to prevent the traditional way of the value chain from suffering
    the inaccurate impact [39]. The academic interest in investigating the application
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management has been progressively
    expanded, with a rapid increase in the contributions of academic experts covering
    this aspect [[11], [12], [13],38]. Moreover, blockchain technology used in the
    agri-food value chain seems to be a promising research stream for future research,
    especially in the era of Industry 4.0 [14,83]. However, only a limited number
    of studies analyse the current applications and future research directions of
    blockchain technology in different industries. We found three reviews concerned
    with the blockchain technology and its impact on the social and economy, drawn
    up, respectively, by Anascavage and Davis [15], who identified 16 areas that blockchain
    technology could be applied to, including food security; Tama et al. [16] acknowledge
    four areas that blockchain technology has been applied to and considers that blockchain
    technology plays an important role in guaranteeing the traceability of the agri-food
    value chain; and finally Yli-Huumo et al. [17] conducted a systematic literature
    review (SLR) on current research of blockchain technology including security,
    wasted resources, usability and privacy. These reviews are, however, relatively
    general, and given the current research and applications of blockchain technology,
    none of the reviews addresses the application of the blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management. Therefore, there is a lack of up-to-date
    reviews that offer a comprehensive overview of the main issues related to current
    applications, challenges and future research directions of the blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain management. Considering the above arguments, the
    main objective of this study is to fill this gap by offering a systematic literature
    network analysis (SLNA) of the recent contributions of blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management, highlighting the research that has been
    developed over time, and identifying the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    to the agri-food value chain management, and proposing the most promising research
    directions for the future. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.
    The methodology adopted in this paper is described in Section 2, while the application
    of the research methodology to the context under study is provided in Section
    3. Then, the current applications of blockchain technology in the agri-food value
    chain management are presented in Section 4 followed by the challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain that are presented in Section
    5. The research gaps and proposed future research directions are presented in
    Section 6. Finally, conclusions and research limitations are drawn in Section
    7. 2. Research methodology: systematic literature network analysis Systematic
    literature network analysis (SLNA) is constituted with two methods: systematic
    literature review (SLR) and citation network analysis (CNA). The purpose of integrating
    these two existing methodologies (SLR and CNA) is to maximize the advantages related
    to each of them: SLR provides a reproducible and rigorous method that is applied
    in this study to select the most relevant and high-quality studies from previous
    literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through
    synthesising of the literatures, the state-of-the-art of applications and the
    challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    will be revealed. Simultaneously, why blockchain technology matters in agri-food
    value chain management is also disclosed. CNA offers an evidence-based approach
    to identifying the most-cited studies from the selected databases, revealing the
    contributions on blockchain technology theory building in the agri-food value
    chain management as well as suggesting future research directions that can facilitate
    the application of the blockchain technology to the agri-food value chain management
    [18]. The process of SLNA from the combination of SLR and CNA is shown in Fig.
    A1. 3. Applying the SLNA to the area under study The process of how to apply SLNA
    to the area of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management is described
    in the following five sub-sections. 3.1. Formulating the research questions The
    first stage of conducting SLNA is to formulate research questions. It is important
    to have well-specified, informative and clearly formulated research questions
    to avoid bias, error and ambiguity [19]. Therefore, the research questions were
    formulated based on the following process: (1) Brainstorming all types of applications
    of blockchain technology that can be used in agri-food value chain management;
    (2) Consulting with three experts in academia and agri-food industry to evaluate
    whether it is possible to apply the blockchain technology in these areas; (3)
    Examining possible applications of blockchain technology that can be applied to
    the agri-food value chain management. Based on the above processes and principles,
    the following research questions were formulated: RQ1. What are the main applications
    of blockchain technology that have been developed in agri-food value chain management?
    RQ2. What are the key challenges for applying blockchain technology to agri-food
    value chain management? RQ3. What are the research gaps and future research directions
    for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain management? 3.2. Locating
    study Denyer and Tranfield [20] proposed that a comprehensive list of core contributions
    is necessary to answer the review questions by searching the most relevant and
    high-quality studies. Eight databases were selected for literature search, including
    ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library,
    Emerald, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. The rationale for selecting these databases
    is that they include the top science and technology journals, conference proceedings
    and business research journals. Consistent with other SLR papers in blockchain
    technology (e.g. [17,21,22]), the identified keywords were used as the search
    criteria in our review. Since the aim of this research is to identify the main
    issues relating to the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management, a combination of “blockchain” and “agri-food value chain management”,
    with all the related terms were used for searching the title, keywords and abstract
    in the selected electronic academic databases. These keywords were combined later
    through Boolean connectors to constitute different search strings to be applied
    in the databases. Furthermore, consultation with various practitioners and academics
    in the relevant field was conducted to confirm whether search strings were also
    necessary. Finally, a total of 45 search strings were identified by the authors
    to be included in the search process. A full list of search strings is shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. Search strings for databases search. Keywords “blockchain”,
    “information security”, “information transparency”, “agriculture”, “agricultural”,

    As a very recent and new research area, as discussed earlier, the term of blockchain
    technology was first coined in 2008 [16]. In fact, the idea of blockchain technology
    was hardly discussed before 2008. Therefore, we use the year 2008 as the starting
    point to search relevant publications. Further, to find more relevant and important
    studies to be included in the analysis, various reference types such as journal
    papers, conference papers and book chapters were included in the systematic review.
    Simultaneously, the identification of key articles and book chapters that provide
    background information on blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    were found from different sources, including colleagues working in the same field.
    The initial search with the specified keywords and open access in the selected
    eight databases from 2008 to 2018 resulted in a preliminary sample of 632 contributions.
    Afterwards, each study was checked by three authors by carefully analysing the
    abstracts, introductions and conclusions to reduce any subjective bias and enhance
    validity. Moreover, relevant book chapters and other publications that were not
    covered by the databases were then identified through carefully searching the
    references used in the previous literature (e.g. [17,21,22]). The review of the
    work of influential authors in the field of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain management was also carried out by the same three authors. A series
    of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to include/exclude papers (Table
    2), which were built through a brainstorming session among these three authors.
    Studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria or duplicates or non-relevant
    studies were eliminated. As a result, 62 studies were finally selected. Table
    2. Criteria for inclusion or exclusion studies. Inclusion criteria Rationale Articles
    were published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and book chapters
    in English Peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and book chapters are considered
    to have better quality than non-peer-reviewed articles Articles were published
    between 2008 and 2018 The year 2008 was selected as the starting point as the
    term blockchain was coined in 2008 [16] The selected articles contain at least
    one keyword in their title or abstract Abstract or title focusing on the applications
    of blockchain technology was selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining
    abstract, introduction and conclusion The remaining abstract, introduction and
    conclusion focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain were selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining articles
    Articles focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain were selected All selected 62 studies were read entirely by the three authors
    independently. By cross-referencing all the citations and references and talking
    with experts in the experts from academia and the agri-food industry, nine additional
    studies were identified and added, resulting in a total of 71 academic peer-reviewed
    journal papers, conference papers and book chapters to be included in the analysis.
    The search and selection process is presented in Fig. A2. 3.4. Citation network
    analysis (CNA) CNA is an effective and efficient way to reveal the articles that
    represent the basis of the field and to identify which articles were used by many
    other authors for the development of their contributions [18]. The citation data
    (author, title, year, cited reference, source, time cited etc.) were collected
    from the Web of Science Core collection. Then, the software Gephi was used to
    build a citation network among the selected studies. Gephi is the leading visualization
    and exploration software for all graphs and networks, which can be applied to
    six main areas such as exploratory data analysis, link analysis, social network
    analysis, biological network analysis, and poster creation [23]. The rationale
    for this choice is that Gephi can provide large information handling capacity,
    friendly graphical user interface and high-quality output formats [24]. As shown
    in Fig. 1, a network consisting of 71 nodes was constructed. It comprises 47 connected
    components and 24 isolated components. Download : Download high-res image (822KB)

    studies. Note: Node size depends on the quantity of connected components. From
    the Fig. 1, we can see that the connected components were divided into seven clusters
    according to their citation information. For example, the orange cluster summarized
    the opportunities that blockchain technology could be applied in agri-food value
    chain management such as blockchain combined with IoT to be used in agri-food
    value chain, as well as used in agri-food value chain traceability. It is important
    to note that most of the papers included in this cluster were literature review
    papers [17,25,26]. A detailed analysis of benefits, opportunities and challenges
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT were discussed in the cluster of
    black. There were four clusters (Light green, purple, red and blue) mainly discussed
    how to use blockchain technology to increase the agri-food value chain traceability
    and manufacturing conceptually and empirically. Simultaneously, different traceability
    models were proposed and tested. Finally, the green cluster represents how blockchain
    along with other technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of Things served as an engine of the 4th industrial revolution, and how
    these technologies can revolutionize the current agri-food value chain management
    [27,28]. The detailed information of each cluster is shown in Table 3. Table 3.

    has gained increasing attention from researchers and practitioners, in 2016 Yli-Huumo
    et al. [17] proposed an SLR on blockchain technology by highlighting current research
    topics, challenges and future research directions from a technological perspective.
    Their research results indicate four research gaps existing in the current study:
    (1) Lack of high-quality journal papers, most of the papers are published in conferences,
    symposiums and workshops; (2) The majority of current research is conducted in
    Bitcoin environment, rather than in other blockchain environments; (3) Lack of
    research on usability; (4) No research on the challenges for applying blockchain
    technology, such as latency, throughput and bandwidth. Following Yli-Huumo et
    al. [17], a series of research articles attempt to fill the research gaps. Tian
    [38] and Faye [39] have explored the field of blockchain technology in the context
    of the agri-food value chain from a traceability perspective. The issue addressed
    is how to embed blockchain technology in the current traceability system to increase
    the transparency and security of the agri-food value chain. With the evolution
    of research in the blockchain-based traceability system, some researchers tried
    to examine some generic models for facilitating the development of blockchain-based
    traceability system, such as the “TRADE” model proposed by Maouchi et al. [36].
    Concerns about integrating blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain
    need to be addressed from a single company perspective firstly, therefore, Hamida
    et al. [40] provided a detailed analysis on enterprise blockchains of its applications,
    challenges and opportunities. It is interesting to note that within these studies,
    the paper An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based on RFID
    & blockchain technology proposed by Tian [38] is the most frequently cited paper,
    which has been cited 16 times by other authors among the selected papers (Table
    4). At the current stage of research in blockchain technology for traceability,
    most researchers (e.g. [[38], [39], [40]]) considered blockchain technology as
    a competitive advantage for agriculture value chain participants to gain trust
    from customers. Finally, most of these articles focus on addressing blockchain-based
    traceability system from the perspective of conceptual development. Table 4. Most

    of research examines how to combine blockchain technology with the IoT that can
    be applied in agri-food value chain management. Christidis and Devetsikiotis [41]
    noted that the combination of blockchain technology with IoT would allow agri-food
    value chain participants to get automated time-consuming workflows in a new and
    unique way, as well as to reduce significant costs in the process. Following Christidis
    and Devetsikiotis [41], many researchers have tried to contribute the theory-building
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT from different perspectives. Hammi
    et al. [49] explored how to improve trust relationship among agri-food value chain
    members by designing a blockchain-IoT application. Reyna et al. [50] investigated
    how blockchain technology could potentially improve the IoT. Finally, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed a blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT to
    enable grape value chain. The research trends on blockchain-based IoT has been
    from generally discussing the challenges and opportunities for combining blockchain
    technology with IoT to how to design a blockchain-based IoT system for solving
    the trust issues among agri-food value chain members, which facilitate to build
    a distributed peer-to-peer systems to interact with agri-food value chain participants
    in a trust and auditable manner. The trends towards stricter rules on food safety
    and food quality leads some researchers to explore potential applications of blockchain
    technology in other fields of agri-food value chain management, such as how to
    apply blockchain technology in food manufacturing [43] and how to use blockchain
    technology to increase the water sustainability [59]. Regarding the performance
    of applying blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain management, just
    a few papers measure the performance from the perspective of reducing tracking
    time to improve the traceability [4] and increasing the efficiency of the traceability
    in the agri-food value chain [13]. Simultaneously, several literature review papers
    investigated how blockchain technology has been applied in different industries
    such as agri-food industry, financial service and healthcare [8,16]. They provide
    insights on the development of blockchain technology in different industries and
    facilitate researchers to investigate how to transfer the knowledge from theory
    to practice. 3.5. Thematic analysis Braun and Clarke [51] stated that “thematic
    analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes)
    within data, which provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many
    other forms of qualitative analysis”. Holloway and Todres [52] underlined that
    thematic analysis can be seen as a foundational approach for qualitative analysis.
    In this paper, thematic analysis was used to allow blockchain themes being generated
    by six phases of analysis: reading the whole paper collected from SLR, generating
    initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes,
    and finally presenting the results. Following the process of thematic analysis,
    we divided the literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    based on the following themes: (1) current applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management; (2) the challenges for applying the blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. The detailed results from thematic
    analysis are presented in Section 4. Tama et al. [16] conducted a literature review
    on the blockchain technology and its current applications, where the majority
    of literature was concerned with the blockchain technology theory building and
    conceptual development. However, the findings in our study show that the trend
    has been gradually shifted from theory building trying to use blockchain technology
    in practice. Although the number of studies on how blockchain technology can be
    used in agri-food value chain management is increasing, there are a limited number
    of studies on how blockchain technology can be executed. 4. Current applications
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management The first application
    of the blockchain technology was Bitcoin – a peer-to-peer electronic cash system
    [53]. Then, blockchain technology evolved towards smart contracts with the ability
    to provide transparency and trust to the system [41]. A smart contract is a kind
    of computer program that stores on the blockchain and executes by all consensus
    nodes in the network. It can translate contractual clauses into code and store
    them into the storage file, and operate them automatically and independently in
    a prescribed manner based on the data that was included in the triggering transaction
    [54]. Through operating the smart contracts, the need for trusted intermediaries
    between partners can be minimized and the occurrence of malicious or accidental
    exceptions can be reduced. Thus, blockchain technology has been generalized and
    applied in different domains such as finance [55], smart city [56], healthcare
    [57] and agri-food value chain [43]. However, as reviewed by Yli-Huumo et al.
    [17], more than 80% of the academic papers on blockchain technology focused on
    the Bitcoin system, while less than 20% deal with other blockchain applications.
    Although it is a relatively new technology, blockchain is rapidly advancing and
    developing. Lucena et al. [58] stated that there was a huge opportunity for blockchain
    applications to global trade. Blockchain market is estimated to grow from 210.2
    million USD to 2312.5 million USD in the period from 2016 to 2021 based on the
    Global Opportunity Report [90]. Due to its potential increase in the global market,
    it is expected that blockchain technology will play a critical role in facilitating
    future industry development and revolution. However, Poberezhna [59] argued that
    the key challenge for blockchain was to be considered as a simply disruptive technology,
    rather than as an innovative integrative solution that could provide a value proposition
    across a number of business process. In the following four sub-sections, we analyse
    the literature of the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management by classifying them in four distinctive themes: traceability,
    information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. 4.1. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability According to Murki
    [60], different value chains need to embed blockchain technology in the current
    traceability system to create more agile value chains and closer customer relationship.
    Tse et al. [11] hold a similar view that the application of blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain may have been the optimal choice to fulfil the requirements
    of supervision and adaption of the fast-growing food market. More specifically,
    Kumar and Mallick [61] construe that blockchain technology has wider applications
    in agri-food value chain such as food delivery and shipping data records, food
    online ordering and transaction data, and food quality assurance data. To integrate
    blockchain technology in the existing traceability system of agri-food value chain,
    many researchers have tried to explore the options from different perspectives.
    Tian [38] proposed an agri-food value chain traceability system based on RFID
    (Radio-Frequency IDentification) and blockchain technology for helping Chinese
    agri-food markets to enhance their food safety and food quality during the logistics
    process. In their proposed traceability system, RFID was used for acquiring and
    sharing data in the agri-food value chain, meanwhile, blockchain technology was
    used for guaranteeing the data shared and published in this traceability system
    is reliable and authentic. However, some researchers argue that RFID technology
    and blockchain based traceability system has some defects in solving the counterfeit
    issues. For example, RFID tags can be cloned which can cause counterfeit parts
    to be circulated in the agri-food value chain [62]. To overcome the drawbacks
    of RFID, Boehm et al. [37] proposed an updated traceability system using blockchain
    technology combined with Near Field Communication (NFC) and verified users. In
    their proposed traceability system, users must provide valid user credentials
    if they want to update a product’s history on the blockchain. Thus, various changes
    of an agri-food product can be reported, and the capabilities of other members
    can be restricted at the same time. Therefore, holistic tracking agri-food products
    with higher transparency and security can be achieved. Faye [39] underlined that
    the application of blockchain technology in agri-food industry would foster more
    transparency and thus customers’ confidence towards agri-food products would be
    re-established. Although blockchain technology has great potential for revolutionizing
    current agri-food value chain traceability systems, it still has some inherent
    defects such as scalability that needs to be tackled, especially when we face
    mass data in the real world. Recent innovations in blockchain, such as scaling
    would change this working manner that requires every computer in the blockchain
    to process every transaction [63]. Croman et al. [64] argued that a scaled blockchain
    could accelerate the transaction process, without sacrificing high security, by
    determining the optimal number of computers to validate each transaction and divide
    work efficiently. Therefore, Tian [46] investigated a value chain traceability
    system based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point), blockchain
    technology and IoT. In their proposed new decentralized traceability system, HACCP
    was used to prevent food risk occurrences, and IoT combined with blockchain technology
    was used to continuously deliver massive real-time food-related information to
    all value chain partners in an effective, safe and efficient manner. Then, a case
    testing experiment was used to check whether the system was feasible or not. The
    research results indicate that food safety, value chain efficiency and transparency
    have been effectively improved. Badzar [65] emphasizes that openness and unchangeable
    attributes of blockchain ensure high transparency, stability and reliability of
    agri-food value chain, as well as provide liquidity, more accurate record-keeping
    and high transparency of ownership [66]. To have deep understanding of knowledge
    on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance agri-food business, Rabah
    [28] conducted a review on the applications of big data and blockchain technology
    in the agri-food industry. Their research results reveal that blockchain technology
    played a critical role in creating secure and transparent ledger that was available
    to all the involved participants within the agri-food value chain including the
    producers, manufacturers, logistics service providers, wholesalers, retailers
    and regulators. They provide insights into the effects of blockchain technology
    on the current traceability system, and facilitate the development of blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain management. Finally, Biswas et al. [67]
    propose a blockchain based wine value chain traceability system where every transaction
    is recorded as a block in the chain and is visible to relevant value chain members
    such as the grape grower, wine producer, bulk distributor, transit cellar, filler/packer,
    finished goods distributor, wholesaler and retailer entity. One of the most important
    features of their proposed system is that anyone can trace the purchase history
    of the wine by inputting the product ID in the system. However, their work just
    examines an example, rather than a practical application of blockchain technology
    in the wine value chain. Maouchi et al. [36] argue that although various approaches
    have been proposed to create a decentralized traceability system for agri-food
    value chain, these works do not state the feasibility of their work and their
    application for the agri-food value chain. Due to the great potential benefits
    of applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain traceability system,
    several agricultural industry enterprises around the world have evaluated the
    effect of blockchain technology. For example, Walmart plans to invest $25 million
    over five years from 2017 to establish one food safety collaboration centre in
    Beijing to build a completely new food traceability system with blockchain technology.
    Their mango blockchain solution pilots reduced the time for tracking mango origins
    from seven days to 2.2 s, thus, more transparency and greater efficiency have
    been achieved in Walmart’s food value chain. Then, a pork value chain traceability
    system combined with barcode has been built based on the mango blockchain solutions
    [13]. Yiannas [68] states that the biggest advantage of this system is that it
    allows any trusted users to verify the traceability and authenticity of the product
    at any point of the pork value chain. Despite the increasing emphasis on applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability system, recent studies
    conducted by Kshetri [69] show that just a few researchers have begun to systematically
    assess the effects of blockchain technology on current agri-food value chain traceability
    system. Caro et al. [4] introduced an AgriBlockIoT traceability system for agri-food
    value chain management. It was constituted with three main components, a REST
    Application Interface with the responsibilities to integrate with the existing
    software system, a controller equipped with the abilities to query and convert
    the data records stored in the blockchain, and blockchain involved with smart
    contracts as a gateway to the blockchain itself. It is important to note that
    smart contracts can fire autonomously; hence creating records whenever anomalies
    are detected. Then, two different implementations, namely Ethereum and Hyperledger
    Sawtooth were used to do the performance analysis of traceability. Their research
    results indicate that Hyperledger Sawtooth has better performances than the Ethereum
    counterpart and may be more suitable for IoT devices, because Etherum is quite
    CPU-intensive. Based on the case study for grain quality assurance tracking, Lucena
    [58] finds out that quality measurement throughout the transportation for grains
    along the value chain is always accompanied with fraud, poor monitoring and delay
    to final destinations. Their findings indicate that using blockchain technology
    in the grain value chain traceability system is the best way at present to reduce
    disputes among business partners and information asymmetries. Finally, Kumar and
    Iyengar [70] demonstrated a blockchain based traceability framework for rice value
    chain management. In their proposed framework, blockchain was used to record all
    related issues happening within the rice value chain and monitor the security
    and quality of rice in the transportation process. It is important to note that
    all members in the rice value chain should register themselves and match their
    unique identities and digital profiles in the blockchain system. The research
    result indicates that the security of rice in the transportation process and the
    efficiency of the rice value chain have been greatly improved. 4.2. Applying blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain information security Under the background
    of Industry 4.0 and distributed computing, the characteristics of information
    system in agri-food industry have experienced substantial changes. Blockchain
    technology has inherent benefits such as recording transactions in real-time,
    no intermediary, immutability and distributed ledger, which becomes the first
    choice for agri-food value chain managers to enhance information security [60].
    Tse et al. [11] construed that blockchain was a well worthy technology for helping
    agri-food value chain participants to record and transfer transactions authentically.
    Leng et al. [1] proposed a public blockchain for agricultural value chain system
    along with double-chain architecture. The research results reveal that the proposed
    agricultural business resource blockchain not only can increase the security of
    transaction information and privacy of enterprise information, but also can enhance
    the credibility of the public service platform and facilitate overall increase
    of efficiency across the whole value chain system. Neisse et al. [71] explored
    a blockchain-based approach to achieve data accountability and provenance tracking.
    Their findings indicate that for the dynamic data frequently shared among value
    chain members such as the transaction record in agri-food value chain, which have
    strict scalability and performance requirements, controllers or processors should
    manage a contract that registers all subjects accepting all or part of usage conditions.
    Recently, with the advancement of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) connections is
    estimated to increase to 3.9 billion to 2022 [72]. More and more agri-food value
    chain participants are being equipped with interconnected electronic devices and
    protocol suites to increase the connectivity and sophisticated data gathering
    and analytics capabilities [50]. However, most of the IoT solutions are dependent
    on the centralized server-client paradigm, connecting to the cloud servers through
    the Internet [26]. Decentralised architectures such as building a large Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may cause privacy and security issues to the
    users [73]. Thus, effective tools to ensure information security need to be supported
    by agri-food value chain participants to meet the requested security requirements.
    Currently, around 50% of agri-food practitioners have been experimenting blockchain
    technology with creating proof-of-concept, and 17% of agri-food practitioners
    have been preparing to deploy and use it in their business [74]. Hammi et al.
    [49] proposed a public blockchain-based approach in which devices can communicate
    with each other in a completely secure and efficient way by creating a secure
    virtual zone. After a series of tests, the research results indicate that the
    blockchain-based system demonstrated high resilience towards attacks. Iansiti
    and Lakhani [42] underlined that blockchain technology could provide secure, irreversible,
    distributed, transparent and accurate information sharing service. After conducting
    research on blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed that holistically using these blockchain-based ICT technologies
    has a positive effect in increasing the quality of agri-food products. 4.3. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food manufacturing In today’s highly competitive
    and knowledge-based economy, managing massive amount of information and services
    is the basic requirement for successful food manufacturers. As the information
    and services are diversified, growing in an accelerating velocity, and highly
    complex, an increase number of food manufacturers have difficulties in acquiring
    and managing them alone. Wang et al. [75] state that it is necessary for food
    manufacturers to work together and sustain their competitiveness. To address this
    issue, some researchers have started integrating blockchain concept into manufacturing
    practices. Li et al. [35] proposed a decentralized framework to manage the knowledge
    and services shared between different enterprises based on the blockchain application
    involved smart contracts and edge computing. In their proposed framework, edge
    computing acted as a foundation for providing distributed network, storage and
    computing capabilities in the manufacturing environment. The smart contracts played
    as interfaces between enterprise and its partners for successfully interact. Thus,
    a signed secure and controllable connection between the enterprise and the partner
    could be built with the transaction record and the status were updated on the
    blockchain. A case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the decentralized
    framework. The case study results indicate that manufacturers can develop scalable
    and flexible businesses at a lower cost, and ultimately the overall quality, efficiency,
    and effectiveness of manufacturing services can be improved. Furthermore, Zhao
    et al. [76], built a model of manufacturing service information based on blockchain
    principle and cloud computing, which theoretically solves the problems of sharing
    and securing the manufacturing resources, recalling the product data and guaranteeing
    the quality of the processing. Finally, Kumar and Mallic [61] reported that blockchain
    technology could be used in various perspectives of manufacturing, such as manufacturing
    management, production data, product warranty information and product assurance.
    Although blockchain technology has been seen as a critical element in the manufacturing
    sector in recent years, the role of blockchain technology for promoting resilience,
    scalability, security and autonomy of manufacturing service has been relatively
    overlooked [14]. 4.4. Applying blockchain technology in sustainable water management
    The agriculture productivity is highly dependent on water resource management.
    How to use water resources effectively and efficiently is crucial for agriculture
    development. To drive the sustainable development of water, it is critical to
    address water scarcity aspects that are deeply interrelated with agri-food development.
    Therefore, Civic Ledger [77] considered to develop a blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer
    trading platform (Water Ledger) that would allow more irrigators to participate
    in the platform that entitles and allocates water securely and transparently,
    further boosting the overall efficiency of water resources. Though creating new
    digital identity for irrigators and digitizing the water assets in agri-food value
    chain will cost a lot of money, Poberezhna [59] argues that blockchain combined
    with smart contracts can potentially help water companies and government bodies
    to access real-time data regarding market shares, consumption patterns and management
    of utility bills of consumers, thus, greater transparency to regulators and auditors
    can be achieved. Their research also indicates that recordkeeping will be significantly
    reduced when the blockchain platform is applied in water trading. 5. The challenges
    for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain Blockchain technology
    is still in testing phase and its implementation in agri-food value chain management
    has some issues that need to be tackled. Therefore, in this section, we will scrutinize
    the challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    A review of the literature indicates that there are six main challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management: storage capacity and
    scalability issue, privacy leakage, regulation problem, high cost problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. 5.1. Storage capacity and scalability Storage
    capacity along with scalability issues have been deeply questioned in the blockchain.
    Koteska et al. [25] stated that one of the main challenges for blockchain implementation
    is scalability. To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary to have
    a large number of full nodes (a node that can fully validate transactions and
    blocks) in the blockchain implementation. The nodes in the blockchain network
    are expected to validate each transaction of each block [50]. Otherwise, blockchain
    implementation in agri-food value chain management might result in a less decentralized
    system. Koteska et al. [25] proposed that scalability negatively affected three
    dimensions of the blockchain, the size of the data on the blockchain, the transaction
    processing rate and the latency of data transmission on the blockchain. Although
    only full nodes store the full chain, storage requirements are also significant
    [50]. For example of the Bitcoin, the blockchain is always growing with a rate
    of 1MB per block every ten minutes and store a large amount of data in every node
    that no interest for them [26]. As the number of transactions increase in the
    agri-food value chains, the amount of data becomes larger, and the loading of
    store and computing accompanied with data becomes harder, which results in the
    blockchain becoming bulky [78]. Simultaneously, every participant in the agri-food
    value chain needs to constantly store all transaction data to validate them on
    the blockchain because they need to check if the source of the current transaction
    is unspent or not [83]. Thus, with the node size increasing, additional resources
    are required by the nodes. Finally the system’s capacity scale is reduced and
    synchronization time for the new user is increased [50]. 5.2. Privacy leakage
    In the blockchain, each transaction can be traced, checked and audited and every
    user can be identified by their public key or its hash. Undoubtedly, blockchain
    technology provides a new level of transparency and helps to build trust. However,
    it also has negative effect on protecting users’ privacy [50]. Kosba et al. [79]
    stated that blockchain could not guarantee the transactional privacy even with
    the permission management because the information on blockchain was available
    to all participants who belonged to the blockchain network. Lu and Xu [80] underlined
    that every member could access all information on the blockchain because there
    were no privileged users. Maouchi et al. [36] argued that some agri-food value
    chain members might be competitors with each other and they did not enjoy the
    transparent traceability system. Therefore, many efforts for protecting privacy
    in blockchain has been done such as obfuscation on the transaction relationships
    to prevent linking or tracing analysis, hiding the identifies of the sender and
    the receiver through complicated cryptographic schemes, and blinding the transaction
    content whilst retaining the verifiability and computability [81]. In order to
    ensure transactions are not easily to be traced to any given person or computer,
    Monero [82] applies ring of signatures scheme to guarantee transactions untraceable.
    Other schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring Signature,
    Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-knowledge-proof have been used in blockchains to
    improve privacy, but no schemes can hide the sender, the receiver and the amount
    at the same time [40]. Kosba et al. [79] tackled these privacy issues differently
    through using encrypted transactions. The Hawk – a decentralized smart contract
    is responsible for translating the generic code written by programmers into cryptographic
    primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs that retaining transactional privacy.
    After researching in the wine value chain traceability system, Biswas et al. [67]
    stated that there were two drawbacks of the blockchain technology: one is the
    transaction speed; the other one is privacy as neither companies nor individuals
    would like to publish all information onto a public database. 5.3. High cost problem
    Lin and Liao [83] proposed that agri-food value chain participants would need
    a lot of money and time to embed blockchain technology in the current agri-food
    value chain traceability system. Yli-Huumo et al. [17] noted that when blockchain
    became more complex, the computational power would be another critical issue,
    as it required more computational power to confirm more blocks. Simultaneously,
    energy consumption also needs to be taken into consideration [39]. After conducting
    a case study on blockchain-based traceability system, Lu and Xu [80] pointed out
    some public blockchains inherent with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism wasted
    a lot of electricity. Most of the electricity is consumed in two different ways:
    (1) a large amount of electricity is used for the mining process, which involves
    a consensus algorithm that consists in a sort of brute force search for a hash;
    (2) another amount of electricity is consumed in peer-to-peer communications because
    it requires an edge device to be powered [26]. 5.4. Regulation problem Agri-food
    value chains are extended across the globe. Hence, applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management needs to be considered from a global perspective.
    However, blockchain is a new technology that involves different people from various
    countries without any legal or regulation to follow. Additionally, the absence
    of a central authority and the non-existent of censorship in the current blockchain
    system, this situation creates many uncertainties [50]. Atlam et al. [29] stated
    that this was a serious problem for both agri-food manufacturers and service providers.
    Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new laws or regulations to monitor and
    regulate blockchain applications in the agri-food industry for compliance [8].
    After conducting a case study on grain quality assurance tracking-based on blockchain
    technology, Lucena et al. [58] found a controversial issue when using blockchain
    technology regarding its legal value. Their research also indicates that complex
    agri-food value chain scenarios involving international trade and arbitration
    laws are yet to be proven. 5.5. Throughput and latency issue In the context of
    agri-food value chain management, due to the original restriction of block size
    and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current processing capacity
    of blokchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing millions of transactions
    in real-time. Aste et al. [84] (p.26) stated that “a system that could handle
    large transaction volumes would require large blocks or mechanisms in which multiple
    blocks are validated simultaneously”. All the above issues will cause a big problem
    for clients when running a blockchain-based system. After investigating an RFID
    and blockchain based traceability system for agri-food value chain, Tian [38]
    stated that there were two obstacles for applying blockchain technology: (1) the
    transaction capacity of blockchain is restricted to seven transactions per second
    due to the restricted size of block; (2) how to deal with storage and synchronization
    issues with the growing size of the blockchain. Regarding latency, it is critical
    to note that current blockchain system needs some time to process transactions.
    For example, in the case of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution
    with an average of ten minutes (10-minute block interval with 6-block confirmation)
    [26]. As for Ethereum, it is estimated around 3 min for 14-second block interval
    with 12-block confirmation [85]. Jindal et al. [86] construed that the time required
    for generating blocks and validating transactions is increases with an increase
    in the number of transactions. Sharma et al. [87] evaluated the performance of
    a blockchain-based distributed framework involved with Proof-of-Work algorithm
    and found that additional cost in computing sources and more processing time is
    required in case of network delays. 5.6. Lack of skills Given that blockchain
    is a new technology, a limited number of people have in-depth knowledge and skills
    about how blockchain can be used in agri-food value chain management [29]. To
    obtain general knowhow in blockchain technology and expectations of the technology
    in the context of agri-food value chain, Ge et al. [10] conducted numerous interviews
    and meetings with agri-food value chain stakeholders. They found that a considerable
    level of scepticism existed among stakeholders with low know-how of blockchain
    technology, partly due to the way blockchain was portrayed as panacea to all information
    problems, partly due to a series of technical issues that remained to be resolved.
    Therefore, Iansiti and Lakhani [42] proposed that applying blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain was likely to be a long process. Simultaneously,
    a widespread lack of understanding on how blockchain works in other areas also
    exists [88]. 6. Discussion: research gaps and future research directions Below,
    we summarized the research gaps and future research directions on blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management based on our systematic review of the literature.
    6.1. Future research directions for the applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management The analysis of the applications of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management allows us to better understand
    how blockchain technology has been applied and evolved in agri-food value chain
    management. Several directions for future research about implementing blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are suggested and summarized in
    the following. • In the context of applying blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain traceability, various researchers proposed different blockchain-based
    traceability system that involved different technologies such as RFID, IoT, NFC,
    cloud computing, and big data, as well took different agri-food value chain entities
    into consideration (see Table 5). It is interesting to note that the traceability
    system proposed by Davcev et al. [30] could provide a comprehensive function for
    monitoring the land status, vegetable status, as well as to help to achieve the
    transparent and secure agri-food value chain. Therefore, should be implemented
    in reality. However, most of the proposed traceability systems are staying in
    conceptual phase and there is little empirical research to suggest which one is
    most applicable to the reality. Additionally, just few researchers considered
    third-party regulators/authority organizations in their proposed traceability
    framework. Therefore, one of the priorities for researching the blockchain-based
    traceability system is to conduct empirical research involving third-party regulators/authority
    organizations on different context of agri-food value chains to assess the performance
    of the blockchain-based traceability system. Thus, future studies can evaluate
    the proposed blockchain-based traceability framework effects from different perspectives,
    such as computation costs, transaction processing speed, storage capability, and
    the overall efficiency of agri-food value chains. Table 5. Blockchain technology

    in the agri-food supply chain can share the same business rules and transaction

    if involved in the international trade. • There are two main areas in the literature
    for using blockchain technology to improve agri-food value chain information security:
    one is using blockchain technology alone; the other one is using blockchain technology
    combined with other technologies such as IoT (see Table 6). Obviously, double
    blockchain architecture has it unique advantages such as efficiency, transparency
    and privacy can be achieved with more data can be stored in the blockchain. Key
    technical components such as decentralized storage, mining hardware, and consensus
    mechanisms are easily to be achieved. However, it needs more effective consensus
    mechanism to deal with large amount of nodes and resources that stored in public
    service platform. Therefore, future research should investigate which consensus
    algorithm is more effective compared with others (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake,
    etc) in the same context. IoT applications have its own drawbacks such as they
    generate large volume of data and require connectivity and power for long periods.
    Besides, there are other limitations in memory, computer capacity, networks and
    limited power supply. In order to alleviate above issues, one important future
    research direction is to decide where the interactions will take place when combining
    blockchain technology with IoT, for example, inside the IoT, or blockchain, or
    a hybrid approach involving blockahin and IoT. It will need to discuss the advantages
    and disadvantages of these blockchain-IoT based applications through comparative
    analysis. This area is open for future researchers to investigate the impact and
    relative importance, and identify which one is the optimal choice to enhance agri-food
    information security. Table 6. Blockchain technology used for agri-food value
    chain information security. Authors Involved technologies Architecture Advantages
    Disadvantages Leng et al. [1] Blockchain Double chain architecture based on public

    and data would be increased Hybrid approach (1) Part of the data are stored in
    the blockchain, and the rest are direct shared with other partners (1) High cost
    because involved more devices • Another finding of this study is a new trend of
    focusing on blockchain technology to achieve a higher level of sharing knowledge
    and services among agri-food manufacturers. Current agri-food manufacturing ecosystem
    is changing from integrated and centralized systems to shared and distributed
    systems. Most of the proposed framework for achieving higher performance were
    based on the blockchain technology and cloud computing, which aimed to provide
    a secure, low energy consumption and high efficiency systems to agri-food manufacturers.
    However, it still has some drawbacks. For example, unstable data transmission,
    lack of uniformed technology standard and low internet speed, etc. Blockchain
    technology integrated with edge computing provide a new way to achieve a higher
    level knowledge sharing performance through developing a distributed, sharing,
    standardized, and secured framework. Key technological components such as communication
    protocol, decentralized storage, smart contracts, edge cloud are all needed to
    build this system. However, there are questions remaining about the combination
    of blockchain and edge computing in enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness
    of agri-food manufacturers. Thus, future studies should apply the blokchain technology
    and edge computing in different agri-food manufacturers using empirical and analytical
    tools to assess its effect on agri-food manufacturing. • A new trend emerging
    in the literature is the application of blockchain technology in sustainable water
    management. A few studies discussed how to apply blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability. However, these studies just considered how to enhance water
    sustainability from irrigator’s perspective and water company’s perspective, rather
    than taking the whole agri-food value chain stakeholders into consideration. Therefore,
    future work should holistically consider how to use blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability from the whole agri-food value chain perspective. 6.2. Future
    research directions for addressing the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management From our systematic literature review, six
    key challenges emerged for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management, they are storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost
    problem, regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills.
    Although a growing body of literature is available on discussing these challenges,
    a number of challenges still exist. The purpose of this section is to highlight
    the main challenges identified in the literature and propose future research directions
    for unsolved problems. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are summarized in Table 7. • One
    of key challenges for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    is the storage capacity. Although some researchers broadly investigated several
    methods that could enhance the storage capacity, for example, store part of the
    data on-chain and part of the data off-chain [85], build a multi-layers blockchain
    architecture with different purposes [40], and develop a new algorithm involved
    deep learning concept [12] (see Table 7). It is easily to find that more computational
    power is required when implementing these solution methods. Therefore, future
    work should investigate how to appropriate solve the data storage problem without
    increasing the computational power. Specifically, integrating the deep learning
    concept or artificially intelligence concept with current algorithms such as ant
    colony algorithm to achieve computational power efficiency and systematically
    eliminate the irrelevance data of blockchain provide a new route for solving the
    storage problem. Furthermore, comparative analysis of implementing these possible
    solutions in the context of agri-food value chain should be conducted empirically
    and analytically. • Most of the researchers investigated how to solve privacy
    leakage issues from single blockchain architecture perspective, and have applied
    different schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature,
    Homomorphic encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof to protect privacy of users. Few
    researchers investigated how to protect privacy from a double blockchain architecture
    perspective, that is, one for public, one for agri-food value chain participants.
    Therefore, future work should investigate how to design and evaluate double chain
    structures for blockchain. Further, conduct experiments to check how to combine
    the above-listed data privacy schemes to maximum the performance of data privacy
    mechanisms. • As for the high cost problem, different consensus algorithms have
    been proposed by various authors such as Proof-of-Stake and delegated Proof-of-Stake
    algorithm. Though these two algorithms have various advantages such as reducing
    the computing time, less nodes will be involved in the block validation, etc.
    However, no one have conducted comparative analysis using these two algorithms
    in empirical study in the context of agri-food value chain. This area is open
    for future researchers to systematically investigate the impact and relative importance
    of different mechanisms using empirical and analytical tools. • As discussed earlier,
    blockchain is a new technology which neither has any legislations or regulations
    to follow, nor has a defined way of how to insert the implications arising from
    blockchain technology into a norm setting. Although the application of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain is currently still in its infancy, it can
    be expected that more initiatives will be taken by various agri-food organizations
    [10]. Therefore, more work should be taken from theory and empirical perspectives
    to check the effects of blockchain technology on the agri-food value chain, especially
    to check its effect in the international agri-food trade, and then formulate corresponding
    standards based on the research results. • As for the throughput and latency issue,
    some researchers proposed different methods to solve this problem such as implementing
    Bitcoin-NG algorithm and increase the size of each block [17,89]. However, both
    of methods are not perfect enough which will have side effects such as larger
    blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate, and the latency is limited by
    the propagation time of the network, etc. Therefore, how to choose appropriate
    algorithm and block size without side effects become very important in solving
    the throughput and latency issue of blockchain. It is necessary to holistically
    consider this problem with continually experiments and get an optimal solution.
    • Finally, concerned with the lack of skills, we did not find many publications
    that gave us clear answers on this challenge. Only Ge et al. [10] proposed two
    learning objectives for solving the challenge of lacking skills: (1) learn general
    knowledge of blockchain technology; (2) identify how to benefit from blockchain
    technology. Table 7. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain

    studies on the performance of the agri-food value chain with double chain architecture;
    2. Conduct experiments to check how to combine these data privacy schemes to maximum
    the performance. Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature, Homomorphic
    encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof [40]; 1. Desired level of privacy can be achieved
    through implementing mixed techniques. 1. No scheme can hide the sender, the receiver
    and the amount at the same time; 2. More computation time is required. High cost
    problem Perform Proof-of-Stake algorithm [80] 1. Only require a small amount of
    computing time and the ability to ensure the normal operation of the blockchain;
    2. Latency is shorter. 1. The consensus speed is low; 2. Node is accumulated even
    when the node is not connected to the network in the stake stage. 1. Conduct comparative
    analysis of these two algorithms using empirical study in the context of agri-food
    value chain. Perform delegated Proof-of-Stake algorithm [78] 1. Less nodes involved
    in block validation; 2. Block size and intervals can be adjusted by delegates.
    1. Transactions are performed faster; 2. Dishonest delegates can cause financial
    loss. Regulation problem 1. Design and implementation of a clear regulatory framework
    for blockchain implementation in the agri-food domain and develop the evidence
    for the added value of the blockchain technology [10]; 2. Government should set
    up blockchain infrastructure to support policy formulation [26]. 1. Accelerate
    the process of formulating policies and regulations related to the blockchain
    implementation. 2. Make blockchain technology is easily accepted by agri-food
    value chain participants. 1. Government need to invest a lot of money and human
    resources, and may not get the suitable results. 1. Investigate the effects of
    blockchain technology on agri-food value chain, especially on the international
    agri-food trade, and then formulate standards and regulations. Throughput and
    latency issue 1. Implement Bitcoin-NG consensus algorithm [89]; 2. Increase the
    size of each block [17]. 1. Improve the latency and bandwidth without sacrificing
    other properties such as security; 2. More transactions speed per second. 1. Bandwidth
    is limited by the bandwidth of nodes and the latency limited by the propagation
    time of the network. 2. More expensive for managing larger blocks. 1. Holistically
    consider this problem to find the optimal solution for integrating Bitcoin-NG
    consensus algorithm and appropriate size of each block. Lack of skills Not addressed
    7. Conclusions In this study, we conducted an SLNA to review existing work on
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through question formulation,
    locating studies, study selection and evaluation, we identified 71 publications,
    including journal papers, conference proceedings and book chapters. Then, we used
    software Gephi to build a citation network based on the citation data collected
    from Web of Science, which helped us to identify current trends and future research
    directions of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. The target
    publications of this study covered a broad spectrum of themes such as blockchain-based
    information security and traceability system, and blockchain-based water sustainability
    and food manufacturing. By synthesising the literature of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management within a 10-year timeframe (2008–2018), this
    paper makes contributions to existing knowledge in three aspects: (1) The paper
    provides an overall picture of the evolution of blockchain technology and its
    application in agri-food value chains. (2) The paper elicited key challenges and
    proposed initial solutions for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value
    chain. (3) Research gaps have been identified and future research directions were
    suggested for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    The findings of this study provide a solid foundation for future studies in the
    area of blockchain technology and agri-food value chain management. Acknowledgment

    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19081833\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\
    \ Tokyo, Japan. As shown in Figure 1,\nits architecture consisted of ucode tags\
    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\
    \ The cloud platforms that have been\nestablished so far mainly include Xively\
    \ and Aneka [17].\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n3 of 25 \n \n2. The\

    \ the “network end” of IoT. According to the different functions implemented by\
    \ physical \nentity services in the IoT, IoT architecture established by the current\
    \ service-oriented approach can \nbe divided into the following two categories:\
    \ cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT \narchitecture. In the\
    \ cloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ \nbasic physical information collection, local information processing and transmission\

    \ is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the \nuID\
    \ center of the nonprofit standardization organization initiated by the university\

    \ years, under the impetus of organizations such as Internet Protocol for Smart\
    \ Objects \n(IPSO) Alliance, resource-constrained intelligent goods and sensing\
    \ nodes can access the internet \nthrough the IP protocol and become devices that\
    \ can be directly addressed in the network space \n[18]. Based on the service-oriented\
    \ design method, researchers have proposed a variety of software \narchitecture\
    \ reference models for building IoT systems. M2M was a standard IoT architecture\
    \ being \ndeveloped by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)\
    \ on the communication \nbetween machines and machines, which was designed for\
    \ non-intelligent terminal devices to \ncommunicate with other intelligent terminal\

    \ architecture combined the back-end cloud service with the front-end physical\
    \ \nentity service and proposed a 3-layer information physical fusion system software\
    \ architecture \nconsisting of the environment layer, the service layer and the\
    \ control layer. As shown in Figure 3, \nthe physical components in the environment\
    \ layer were services provided by the perceptron and \nthe executor. The cloud\
    \ service components in the service layer were services provided by \nplatforms\
    \ such as traditional cloud computing. As well, the following functions were implemented\
    \ \nin the control layer: monitoring physical components and services, ensuring\
    \ dynamic \ncomposability, ensuring service adaptability; and ensuring autonomous\
    \ Cyber-Physical System \nmanagement [20]. This architecture provides services\
    \ for collecting physical data and interacting \nwith the physical world. However,\
    \ these services do not constitute an independent executable IoT \nsystembut needto\

    \ a five-layer IoT architecture [22]. As shown in Figure 5, these layers are briefly\
    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\
    \ tags andreaders, etc. The common sensors \nare environmental sensors, animal\
    \ and plant life information sensors and other sensors related \nto agriculture.\
    \ Through these sensors, information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,\
    \ \nplant diseases, insect pests and animal vital signs can be obtained. The collected\
    \ information is \nsimply processed by the embedded device and uploaded to a higher\

    \ Crucial Technologies of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n3.1. Sensor Technology\n\
    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\
    \ products/food safety issues are receiving worldwide attention and their\nsafety\
    \ traceability is one solution accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments\
    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    13 of 24\nsupply chain traceability IoT-based system can ensure food safety and\
    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\

    \  can ensure food safety and quality at each \nlink of the production, from the\
    \ cropland to the consumer (Figure 6), which could help consumers \nestablish\
    \ confidence in food safety and contribute to sustainable development of the whole\
    \ food \nindustry [118].  \n \nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the Agri-food\
    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\
    \ deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the \nsupply chain will move\
    \ towards virtualization which is no longer required physical contact. The \n\
    virtualization of an agri-food supply chain helps administrators better monitor,\
    \ control, plan and \noptimize food supply chain processes [128]. Wang et al.\
    \ proposed a food safety pre-warning system \nbased on association rules mining\
    \ and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning \nFigure 6. Schematic\

    \ contact. The virtualization of an\nagri-food supply chain helps administrators\
    \ better monitor, control, plan and optimize food supply\nchain processes [128].\
    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most common\
    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\
    \ 3 explains the spectral\nimage-based remote sensing techniques, platforms and\
    \ vegetation indices; Section 4 describes remote\nsensing applications in the\
    \ agriculture sector; Section 5 presents a case study on IoT-based and\nUAV-based\
    \ PA; Section 6 explains the experiments and results; challenges are discussed\
    \ in Section 7;\nand conclusions and future directions are presented in Section\
    \ 8.\nTable 2. Common wireless nodes used in the agriculture domain.\nSr #\nWN1\n\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    much smaller than satellite-based ones, but relatively greater than the UAV platforms.\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    Camera\n3.2. Vegetation Indices\nUsing multi-spectral images from the remote sensors\
    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\

    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    Footnotes Abstract: With the growing number of deployments of Internet of Things
    (IoT) infrastructure for a wide variety of applications, the battery maintenance
    has become a major limitation for the sustainability of such infrastructure. To
    overcome this problem, energy harvesting offers a viable alternative to autonomously
    power IoT devices, resulting in a number of battery-less energy harvesting IoTs
    (or EH-IoTs) appearing in the market in recent years. Standards activities are
    also underway, which involve wireless protocol design suitable for EH-IoTs as
    well as testing procedures for various energy harvesting methods. Despite the
    early commercial and standards activities, IoT sensing, computing and communications
    under unpredictable power supply still face significant research challenges. This
    paper systematically surveys recent advances in EH-IoTs from several perspectives.
    First, it reviews the recent commercial developments for EH-IoT in terms of both
    products and services, followed by initial standards activities in this space.
    Then it surveys methods that enable the use of energy harvesting hardware as a
    proxy for conventional sensors to detect contexts in energy efficient manner.
    Next it reviews the advancements in efficient checkpointing and timekeeping for
    intermittently powered IoT devices. We also survey recent research in novel wireless
    communication techniques for EH-IoTs, such as the applications of reinforcement
    learning to optimize power allocations on-the-fly under unpredictable energy productions,
    and packet-less IoT communications and backscatter communication techniques for
    energy impoverished environments. The paper is concluded with a discussion of
    future research directions. Published in: IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials

    IEEE I. Introduction With the advancements in low-power and miniature electronics,
    recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase of Internet of Things (IoTs) applications
    covering a wide range of application areas, such as civil infrastructure, home
    automation, consumer electronics, wearable devices, and industrial or agricultural
    monitoring, to name a few. This trend is unstoppable as we continue to automate
    processes in every sector of our economy and daily life. Forecasts suggest that
    by 2020, a massive 5.8 billion of IoT devices will be deployed worldwide [1].

    commercial fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications networks have already
    been deployed with the aim of providing high data rates. However, the rapid growth
    in the number of smart devices and the emergence of the Internet of Everything
    (IoE) applications, which require an ultra-reliable and low-latency communication,
    will result in a substantial burden on the 5G wireless networks. As such, the
    data rate that could be supplied by 5G networks will unlikely sustain the enormous
    ongoing data traffic explosion. This has motivated research into continuing to
    advance the existing wireless networks toward the future generation of cellular
    systems, known as sixth generation (6G). Therefore, it is essential to provide
    a prospective vision of the 6G and the key enabling technologies for realizing
    future networks. To this end, this paper presents a comprehensive review/survey
    of the future evolution of 6G networks. Specifically, the objective of the paper
    is to provide a comprehensive review/survey about the key enabling technologies
    for 6G networks, which include a discussion about the main operation principles
    of each technology, envisioned potential applications, current state-of-the-art
    research, and the related technical challenges. Overall, this paper provides useful
    information for industries and academic researchers and discusses the potentials
    for opening up new research directions. A diagram shows the ultra era in 6G networks.

    • SLR is conducted using PRISMA approach and148 articles are selected and critically
    analyzed. • The results show the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture.
    • The potential benefits of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their
    implementation in agriculture sector are identified and discussed. • The study
    will positively impact the research around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture
    is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in
    ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world''s population, agri-food
    demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural
    methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully
    benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand
    and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore,
    aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the
    emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this
    purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting
    Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific
    literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying
    the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies
    adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology
    readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies
    such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are
    significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research
    studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most
    use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to
    the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful
    information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along
    with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in issue Next article

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    Year-wise distribution of selected research studies from 2011 to 2021. The breakdown
    of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section
    1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res
    image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution
    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image

    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies
    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    \ Generation (5G) Technology is a recent generation of\nmobile networks. In this\
    \ paper, evaluations in the ﬁeld of mobile communication technology are\npresented.\
    \ In each evolution, multiple challenges were faced that were captured with the\
    \ help of\nnext-generation mobile networks. Among all the previously existing\
    \ mobile networks, 5G provides a\nhigh-speed internet facility, anytime, anywhere,\
    \ for everyone. 5G is slightly different due to its novel\nfeatures such as interconnecting\
    \ people, controlling devices, objects, and machines. 5G mobile system\nwill bring\
    \ diverse levels of performance and capability, which will serve as new user experiences\
    \ and\nconnect new enterprises. Therefore, it is essential to know where the enterprise\
    \ can utilize the beneﬁts\nof 5G. In this research article, it was observed that\
    \ extensive research and analysis unfolds different\naspects, namely, millimeter\
    \ wave (mmWave), massive multiple-input and multiple-output (Massive-\nMIMO),\
    \ small cell, mobile edge computing (MEC), beamforming, different antenna technology,\
    \ etc.\nThis article’s main aim is to highlight some of the most recent enhancements\
    \ made towards the 5G\nmobile system and discuss its future research objectives.\n\
    Keywords: 5G; millimeter wave (mmW); massive multiple input and multiple output\
    \ (MIMO); small\ncell; mobile edge computing (MEC); beamforming; machine learning\n\
    1. Introduction\nMost recently, in three decades, rapid growth was marked in the\
    \ ﬁeld of wireless\ncommunication concerning the transition of 1G to 4G [1,2].\
    \ The main motto behind this\nresearch was the requirements of high bandwidth\
    \ and very low latency. 5G provides a\nhigh data rate, improved quality of service\
    \ (QoS), low-latency, high coverage, high reli-\nability, and economically affordable\
    \ services. 5G delivers services categorized into three\ncategories: (1) Extreme\
    \ mobile broadband (eMBB). It is a nonstandalone architecture that\noffers high-speed\
    \ internet connectivity, greater bandwidth, moderate latency, UltraHD\nstreaming\
    \ videos, virtual reality and augmented reality (AR/VR) media, and many more.\n\
    (2) Massive machine type communication (eMTC), 3GPP releases it in its 13th speciﬁcation.\n\
    It provides long-range and broadband machine-type communication at a very cost-effective\n\
    price with less power consumption. eMTC brings a high data rate service, low power,\n\
    extended coverage via less device complexity through mobile carriers for IoT applications.\n\
    (3) ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) offers low-latency and ultra-high\n\
    reliability, rich quality of service (QoS), which is not possible with traditional\
    \ mobile net-\nwork architecture. URLLC is designed for on-demand real-time interaction\
    \ such as remote\nsurgery, vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication, industry 4.0,\
    \ smart grids, intelligent\ntransport system, etc. [3].\n1.1. Evolution from 1G\
    \ to 5G\nFirst generation (1G): 1G cell phone was launched between the 1970s and\
    \ 80s, based\non analog technology, which works just like a landline phone. It\
    \ suffers in various ways,\nSensors 2022, 22, 26. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22010026\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 26\n2 of 32\nsuch as poor\
    \ battery life, voice quality, and dropped calls. In 1G, the maximum achievable\n\
    speed was 2.4 Kbps.\nSecond Generation (2G): In 2G, the ﬁrst digital system was\
    \ offered in 1991, providing\nimproved mobile voice communication over 1G. In\
    \ addition, Code-Division Multiple\nAccess (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile\
    \ (GSM) concepts were also discussed. In 2G,\nthe maximum achievable speed was\
    \ 1 Mpbs.\nThird Generation (3G): When technology ventured from 2G GSM frameworks\
    \ into 3G\nuniversal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) framework, users encountered\
    \ higher\nsystem speed and quicker download speed making constant video calls.\
    \ 3G was the ﬁrst\nmobile broadband system that was formed to provide the voice\
    \ with some multimedia.\nThe technology behind 3G was high-speed packet access\
    \ (HSPA/HSPA+). 3G used MIMO\nfor multiplying the power of the wireless network,\
    \ and it also used packet switching for\nfast data transmission.\nFourth Generation\
    \ (4G): It is purely mobile broadband standard. In digital mobile\ncommunication,\
    \ it was observed information rate that upgraded from 20 to 60 Mbps in\n4G [4].\
    \ It works on LTE and WiMAX technologies, as well as provides wider bandwidth\
    \ up\nto 100 Mhz. It was launched in 2010.\nFourth Generation LTE-A (4.5G): It\
    \ is an advanced version of standard 4G LTE. LTE-A\nuses MIMO technology to combine\
    \ multiple antennas for both transmitters as well as a\nreceiver. Using MIMO,\
    \ multiple signals and multiple antennas can work simultaneously,\nmaking LTE-A\
    \ three times faster than standard 4G. LTE-A offered an improved system\nlimit,\
    \ decreased deferral in the application server, access triple trafﬁc (Data, Voice,\
    \ and\nVideo) wirelessly at any time anywhere in the world.LTE-A delivers speeds\
    \ of over 42 Mbps\nand up to 90 Mbps.\nFifth Generation (5G): 5G is a pillar of\
    \ digital transformation; it is a real improvement\non all the previous mobile\
    \ generation networks. 5G brings three different services for end\nuser like Extreme\
    \ mobile broadband (eMBB). It offers high-speed internet connectivity,\ngreater\
    \ bandwidth, moderate latency, UltraHD streaming videos, virtual reality and aug-\n\
    mented reality (AR/VR) media, and many more. Massive machine type communication\n\
    (eMTC), it provides long-range and broadband machine-type communication at a very\n\
    cost-effective price with less power consumption. eMTC brings a high data rate\
    \ service,\nlow power, extended coverage via less device complexity through mobile\
    \ carriers for IoT\napplications. Ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC)\
    \ offers low-latency and\nultra-high reliability, rich quality of service (QoS),\
    \ which is not possible with traditional\nmobile network architecture. URLLC is\
    \ designed for on-demand real-time interaction\nsuch as remote surgery, vehicle\
    \ to vehicle (V2V) communication, industry 4.0, smart grids,\nintelligent transport\
    \ system, etc. 5G faster than 4G and offers remote-controlled operation\nover\
    \ a reliable network with zero delays. It provides down-link maximum throughput\
    \ of\nup to 20 Gbps. In addition, 5G also supports 4G WWWW (4th Generation World\
    \ Wide\nWireless Web) [5] and is based on Internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) protocol.\
    \ 5G provides\nunlimited internet connection at your convenience, anytime, anywhere\
    \ with extremely high\nspeed, high throughput, low-latency, higher reliability\
    \ and scalability, and energy-efﬁcient\nmobile communication technology [6]. 5G\
    \ mainly divided in two parts 6 GHz 5G and\nMillimeter wave(mmWave) 5G.\n6 GHz\
    \ is a mid frequency band which works as a mid point between capacity and\ncoverage\
    \ to offer perfect environment for 5G connectivity. 6 GHz spectrum will provide\n\
    high bandwidth with improved network performance. It offers continuous channels\
    \ that\nwill reduce the need for network densiﬁcation when mid-band spectrum is\
    \ not available\nand it makes 5G connectivity affordable at anytime, anywhere\
    \ for everyone.\nmmWave is an essential technology of 5G network which build high\
    \ performance\nnetwork. 5G mmWave offer diverse services that is why all network\
    \ providers should add\non this technology in their 5G deployment planning. There\
    \ are lots of service providers\nwho deployed 5G mmWave, and their simulation\
    \ result shows that 5G mmwave is a far\nless used spectrum. It provides very high\
    \ speed wireless communication and it also offers\nultra-wide bandwidth for next\
    \ generation mobile network.\nSensors 2022, 22, 26\n3 of 32\nThe evolution of\

    \ focused on architecture, key concepts, and implementation chal-\nlenges and\
    \ issues. The numerous current surveys focused on various 5G technologies\nwith\
    \ different parameters, and the authors did not cover all the technologies of\
    \ the 5G\nnetwork in detail with challenges and recent advancements. Few authors\
    \ worked on MIMO\n(Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access) NOMA, MEC, small cell technologies.\
    \ In contrast, some\nothers worked on beamforming, Millimeter-wave (mmWave). But\
    \ the existing survey\ndid not cover all the technologies of the 5G network from\
    \ a research and advancement\nperspective. No detailed survey is available in\
    \ the market covering all the 5G network\ntechnologies and currently published\
    \ research trade-offs. So, our main aim is to give a\ndetailed study of all the\
    \ technologies working on the 5G network. In contrast, this survey\ncovers the\
    \ state-of-the-art techniques as well as corresponding recent novel developments\n\
    by researchers. Various recent signiﬁcant papers are discussed with the key technologies\n\
    accelerating the development and production of 5G products. This survey article\
    \ collected\nkey information about 5G technology and recent advancements, and\
    \ it can be a kind of a\nguide for the reader. This survey provides an umbrella\
    \ approach to bring multiple solutions\nand recent improvements in a single place\

    \ recent advances of 5G Massive MIMO, 5G NOMA, 5G millimeter\nwave, 5G IOT, 5G\
    \ with machine learning, and 5G optimization-based approaches. In\naddition, the\
    \ summary is also presented in each subsection that paves the researchers for\n\
    the future research direction.\n4.1. 5G Massive MIMO\nMultiple-input-multiple-out\
    \ (MIMO) is a very important technology for wireless\nsystems. It is used for\
    \ sending and receiving multiple signals simultaneously over the\nsame radio channel.\
    \ MIMO plays a very big role in WI-FI, 3G, 4G, and 4G LTE-A networks.\nMIMO is\
    \ mainly used to achieve high spectral efﬁciency and energy efﬁciency but it was\n\
    not up to the mark MIMO provides low throughput and very low reliable connectivity.\
    \ To\nresolve this, lots of MIMO technology like single user MIMO (SU-MIMO), multiuser\
    \ MIMO\n(MU-MIMO) and network MIMO were used. However, these new MIMO also did\
    \ not still\nfulﬁll the demand of end users. Massive MIMO is an advancement of\
    \ MIMO technology\nused in the 5G network in which hundreds and thousands of antennas\
    \ are attached with\nbase stations to increase throughput and spectral efﬁciency.\
    \ Multiple transmit and receive\nantennas are used in massive MIMO to increase\
    \ the transmission rate and spectral efﬁciency.\nWhen multiple UEs generate downlink\
    \ trafﬁc simultaneously, massive MIMO gains higher\ncapacity. Massive MIMO uses\
    \ extra antennas to move energy into smaller regions of space\nto increase spectral\
    \ efﬁciency and throughput [43]. In traditional systems data collection\nfrom\
    \ smart sensors is a complex task as it increases latency, reduced data rate and\
    \ reduced\nreliability. While massive MIMO with beamforming and huge multiplexing\
    \ techniques can\nsense data from different sensors with low latency, high data\
    \ rate and higher reliability.\nMassive MIMO will help in transmitting the data\
    \ in real-time collected from different\nsensors to central monitoring locations\
    \ for smart sensor applications like self-driving cars,\nhealthcare centers, smart\
    \ grids, smart cities, smart highways, smart homes, and smart\nenterprises [44].\n\
    Highlights of 5G Massive MIMO technology are as follows:\nSensors 2022, 22, 26\n\
    12 of 32\n1.\nData rate: Massive MIMO is advised as the one of the dominant technologies\
    \ to\nprovide wireless high speed and high data rate in the gigabits per seconds.\n\
    2.\nThe relationship between wave frequency and antenna size: Both are inversely\n\
    proportional to each other. It means lower frequency signals need a bigger antenna\n\
    and vise versa.\n3.\nNumber of user: From 1G to 4G technology one cell consists\
    \ of 10 antennas. But, in\n5G technologies one cell consist of more than 100 antennas.\
    \ Hence, one small cell at\nthe same time can handle multiple users [45]. As shown\
    \ in Figure 2.\n4.\nMIMO role in 5G: Massive MIMO will play a crucial role in\
    \ the deployment of future\n5G mobile communication as greater spectral and energy\
    \ efﬁciency could be enabled.\nMassive MIMO\nArray Antenna\nBase Station\nUE1\n\
    UE2\nUE3\nUE4\nUE5\nUE6\nUEn\nFigure 2. Pictorial representation of multi-input\
    \ and multi-output (MIMO).\nState-of-the-Art Approaches\nPlenty of approaches\
    \ were proposed to resolve the issues of conventional MIMO [7].\nThe MIMO multirate,\
    \ feed-forward controller is suggested by Mae et al. [46]. In the\nsimulation,\
    \ the proposed model generates the smooth control input, unlike the conventional\n\
    MIMO, which generates oscillated control inputs. It also outperformed concerning\

    \ used for better results.\nThe performance of stand-alone MIMO, distributed MIMO\
    \ with and without cor-\nporation MIMO, was investigated by Panzner et al. [47].\
    \ In addition, an idea about the\nintegration of large scale in the 5G technology\
    \ was also presented. In the experimental\nanalysis, different MIMO conﬁgurations\
    \ are considered. The variation in the ratio of overall\ntransmit antennas to\
    \ spatial is deemed step-wise from equality to ten.\nThe simulation of massive\
    \ MIMO noncooperative and cooperative systems for down-\nlink behavior was performed\
    \ by He et al. [48]. It depends on present LTE systems, which\ndeal with various\
    \ antennas in the base station set-up. It was observed that collaboration\nin\
    \ different BS improves the system behaviors, whereas throughput is reduced slightly\
    \ in\nthis approach. However, a new method can be developed which can enhance\
    \ both system\nbehavior and throughput.\nIn [8], different approaches that increased\
    \ the energy efﬁciency beneﬁts provided\nby massive MIMO were presented. They\
    \ analyzed the massive MIMO technology and\ndescribed the detailed design of the\
    \ energy consumption model for massive MIMO systems.\nThis article has explored\
    \ several techniques to enhance massive MIMO systems’ energy\nefﬁciency (EE) gains.\
    \ This paper reviews standard EE-maximization approaches for the\nconventional\
    \ massive MIMO systems, namely, scaling number of antennas, real-time\nimplementing\
    \ low-complexity operations at the base station (BS), power ampliﬁer losses\n\
    minimization, and radio frequency (RF) chain minimization requirements. In addition,\n\
    open research direction is also identiﬁed.\nIn [49], various existing approaches\
    \ based on different antenna selection and schedul-\ning, user selection and scheduling,\
    \ and joint antenna and user scheduling methods adopted\nin massive MIMO systems\
    \ are presented in this paper. The objective of this survey article\nwas to make\
    \ awareness about the current research and future research direction in MIMO\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 26\n13 of 32\nfor systems. They analyzed that complete utilization\
    \ of resources and bandwidth was the\nmost crucial factor which enhances the sum\
    \ rate.\nIn [50], authors discussed the development of various techniques for\
    \ pilot contam-\nination. To calculate the impact of pilot contamination in time\
    \ division duplex (TDD)\nmassive MIMO system, TDD and frequency division duplexing\
    \ FDD patterns in massive\nMIMO techniques are used. They discussed different\
    \ issues in pilot contamination in\nTDD massive MIMO systems with all the possible\
    \ future directions of research. They also\nclassiﬁed various techniques to generate\
    \ the channel information for both pilot-based and\nsubspace-based approaches.\n\
    In [19], the authors deﬁned the uplink and downlink services for a massive MIMO\n\
    system. In addition, it maintains a performance matrix that measures the impact\
    \ of pilot\ncontamination on different performances. They also examined the various\
    \ application of\nmassive MIMO such as small cells, orthogonal frequency-division\
    \ multiplexing (OFDM)\nschemes, massive MIMO IEEE 802, 3rd generation partnership\
    \ project (3GPP) speciﬁcations,\nand higher frequency bands. They considered their\
    \ research work crucial for cutting edge\nmassive MIMO and covered many issues\
    \ like system throughput performance and channel\nstate acquisition at higher\
    \ frequencies.\nIn [13], various approaches were suggested for MIMO future generation\
    \ wireless\ncommunication. They made a comparative study based on performance\
    \ indicators such\nas peak data rate, energy efﬁciency, latency, throughput, etc.\
    \ The key ﬁndings of this\nsurvey are as follows: (1) spatial multiplexing improves\
    \ the energy efﬁciency; (2) design of\nMIMO play a vital role in the enhancement\
    \ of throughput; (3) enhancement of mMIMO\nfocusing on energy & spectral performance;\
    \ (4) discussed the future challenges to improve\nthe system design.\nIn [51],\
    \ the study of large-scale MIMO systems for an energy-efﬁcient system sharing\n\
    method was presented. For the resource allocation, circuit energy and transmit\
    \ energy\nexpenditures were taken into consideration. In addition, the optimization\
    \ techniques were\napplied for an energy-efﬁcient resource sharing system to enlarge\
    \ the energy efﬁciency for\nindividual QoS and energy constraints. The author\
    \ also examined the BS conﬁguration,\nwhich includes homogeneous and heterogeneous\
    \ UEs. While simulating, they discussed\nthat the total number of transmit antennas\
    \ plays a vital role in boosting energy efﬁciency.\nThey highlighted that the\
    \ highest energy efﬁciency was obtained when the BS was set up\nwith 100 antennas\

    \ Multiple Access (NOMA)\nNOMA is a very important radio access technology used\
    \ in next generation wireless\ncommunication. Compared to previous orthogonal\
    \ multiple access techniques, NOMA\noffers lots of beneﬁts like high spectrum\
    \ efﬁciency, low latency with high reliability and\nhigh speed massive connectivity.\
    \ NOMA mainly works on a baseline to serve multiple users\nwith the same resources\
    \ in terms of time, space and frequency. NOMA is mainly divided\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 26\n14 of 32\ninto two main categories one is code domain NOMA and another\
    \ is power domain NOMA.\nCode-domain NOMA can improve the spectral efﬁciency of\
    \ mMIMO, which improves the\nconnectivity in 5G wireless communication. Code-domain\
    \ NOMA was divided into some\nmore multiple access techniques like sparse code\
    \ multiple access, lattice-partition multiple\naccess, multi-user shared access\
    \ and pattern-division multiple access [52]. Power-domain\nNOMA is widely used\
    \ in 5G wireless networks as it performs well with various wireless\ncommunication\
    \ techniques such as MIMO, beamforming, space-time coding, network\ncoding, full-duplex\
    \ and cooperative communication etc. [53]. The conventional orthogonal\nfrequency-division\
    \ multiple access (OFDMA) used by 3GPP in 4G LTE network provides\nvery low spectral\
    \ efﬁciency when bandwidth resources are allocated to users with low\nchannel\
    \ state information (CSI). NOMA resolved this issue as it enables users to access\
    \ all\nthe subcarrier channels so bandwidth resources allocated to the users with\
    \ low CSI can\nstill be accessed by the users with strong CSI which increases\
    \ the spectral efﬁciency. The\n5G network will support heterogeneous architecture\
    \ in which small cell and macro base\nstations work for spectrum sharing. NOMA\
    \ is a key technology of the 5G wireless system\nwhich is very helpful for heterogeneous\
    \ networks as multiple users can share their data\nin a small cell using the NOMA\
    \ principle.The NOMA is helpful in various applications\nlike ultra-dense networks\
    \ (UDN), machine to machine (M2M) communication and massive\nmachine type communication\
    \ (mMTC). As NOMA provides lots of features it has some\nchallenges too such as\
    \ NOMA needs huge computational power for a large number of\nusers at high data\
    \ rates to run the SIC algorithms. Second, when users are moving from the\nnetworks,\
    \ to manage power allocation optimization is a challenging task for NOMA [54].\n\
    Hybrid NOMA (HNOMA) is a combination of power-domain and code-domain NOMA.\nHNOMA\
    \ uses both power differences and orthogonal resources for transmission among\n\
    multiple users. As HNOMA is using both power-domain NOMA and code-domain NOMA\n\
    it can achieve higher spectral efﬁciency than Power-domain NOMA and code-domain\n\
    NOMA. In HNOMA multiple groups can simultaneously transmit signals at the same\n\
    time. It uses a message passing algorithm (MPA) and successive interference cancellation\n\
    (SIC)-based detection at the base station for these groups [55].\nHighlights of\
    \ 5G NOMA technology as follows:\n•\nNOMA is different than all the previous orthogonal\
    \ access techniques such as TDMA,\nFDMA and CDMA. In NOMA, multiple users work\
    \ simultaneously in the same band\nwith different power levels. As shown in Figure\
    \ 3.\n•\nNOMA provides higher data rates and resolves all the loop holes of OMA\
    \ that makes\n5G mobile network more scalable and reliable.\n•\nAs multiple users\
    \ use same frequency band simultaneously it increases the perfor-\nmance of whole\
    \ network.\n•\nTo setup intracell and intercell interference NOMA provides nonorthogonal\
    \ transmis-\nsion on the transmitter end.\n•\nThe primary fundamental of NOMA\
    \ is to improve the spectrum efﬁciency by strength-\nening the ramiﬁcation of\
    \ receiver.\nOrthogonal Multiple Access (OMA)\nNon-Orthogonal Multiple Access\

    \ 2022, 22, 26\n15 of 32\nState-of-the-Art of Approaches\nA plenty of approaches\
    \ were developed to address the various issues in NOMA.\nA novel approach to address\
    \ the multiple receiving signals at the same frequency is\nproposed in [22]. In\
    \ NOMA, multiple users use the same sub-carrier, which improves the\nfairness\
    \ and throughput of the system. As a nonorthogonal method is used among multiple\n\
    users, at the time of retrieving the user’s signal at the receiver’s end, joint\
    \ processing\nis required. They proposed solutions to optimize the receiver and\
    \ the radio resource\nallocation of uplink NOMA. Firstly, the authors proposed\
    \ an iterative MUDD which\nutilizes the information produced by the channel decoder\
    \ to improve the performance\nof the multiuser detector. After that, the author\
    \ suggested a power allocation and novel\nsubcarrier that enhances the users’\
    \ weighted sum rate for the NOMA scheme. Their\nproposed model showed that NOMA\
    \ performed well as compared to OFDM in terms of\nfairness and efﬁciency.\nIn\
    \ [53], the author’s reviewed a power-domain NOMA that uses superposition coding\n\
    (SC) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the transmitter and the\
    \ receiver\nend. Lots of analyses were held that described that NOMA effectively\
    \ satisﬁes user data\nrate demands and network-level of 5G technologies. The paper\
    \ presented a complete\nreview of recent advances in the 5G NOMA system. It showed\
    \ the comparative analysis\nregarding allocation procedures, user fairness, state-of-the-art\
    \ efﬁciency evaluation, user\npairing pattern, etc. The study also analyzes NOMA’s\
    \ behavior when working with\nother wireless communication techniques, namely,\
    \ beamforming, MIMO, cooperative\nconnections, network, space-time coding, etc.\n\
    In [9], the authors proposed NOMA with MEC, which improves the QoS as well as\n\
    reduces the latency of the 5G wireless network. This model increases the uplink\
    \ NOMA\nby decreasing the user’s uplink energy consumption. They formulated an\
    \ optimized\nNOMA framework that reduces the energy consumption of MEC by using\
    \ computing and\ncommunication resource allocation, user clustering, and transmit\
    \ powers.\nIn [10], the authors proposed a model which investigates outage probability\
    \ under\naverage channel state information CSI and data rate in full CSI to resolve\
    \ the problem\nof optimal power allocation, which increase the NOMA downlink system\
    \ among users.\nThey developed simple low-complexity algorithms to provide the\
    \ optimal solution. The\nobtained simulation results showed NOMA’s efﬁciency,\
    \ achieving higher performance\nfairness compared to the TDMA conﬁgurations. It\
    \ was observed from the results that\nNOMA, through the appropriate power ampliﬁers\
    \ (PA), ensures the high-performance\nfairness requirement for the future 5G wireless\
    \ communication networks.\nIn [56], researchers discussed that the NOMA technology\
    \ and waveform modulation\ntechniques had been used in the 5G mobile network.\
    \ Therefore, this research gave a detailed\nsurvey of non-orthogonal waveform\
    \ modulation techniques and NOMA schemes for next-\ngeneration mobile networks.\
    \ By analyzing and comparing multiple access technologies,\nthey considered the\
    \ future evolution of these technologies for 5G mobile communication.\nIn [57],\
    \ the authors surveyed non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) from the devel-\n\
    opment phase to the recent developments. They have also compared NOMA techniques\n\
    with traditional OMA techniques concerning information theory. The author discussed\
    \ the\nNOMA schemes categorically as power and code domain, including the design\
    \ principles,\noperating principles, and features. Comparison is based upon the\
    \ system’s performance,\nspectral efﬁciency, and the receiver’s complexity. Also\
    \ discussed are the future challenges,\nopen issues, and their expectations of\
    \ NOMA and how it will support the key requirements\nof 5G mobile communication\
    \ systems with massive connectivity and low latency.\nIn [17], authors present\
    \ the ﬁrst review of an elementary NOMA model with two users,\nwhich clarify its\
    \ central precepts. After that, a general design with multicarrier supports\n\
    with a random number of users on each sub-carrier is analyzed. In performance\
    \ evaluation\nwith the existing approaches, resource sharing and multiple-input\
    \ multiple-output NOMA\nare examined. Furthermore, they took the key elements\
    \ of NOMA and its potential research\ndemands. Finally, they reviewed the two-user\
    \ SC-NOMA design and a multi-user MC-\nSensors 2022, 22, 26\n16 of 32\nNOMA design\
    \ to highlight NOMA’s basic approaches and conventions. They also present\nthe\

    \ technol-\nogy is covered. Table 6 shows how other authors worked on the improvement\
    \ of var-\nious parameters such as spectral efﬁciency, fairness, and computing\

    \ Wave (mmWave)\nMillimeter wave is an extremely high frequency band, which is\
    \ very useful for 5G\nwireless networks. MmWave uses 30 GHz to 300 GHz spectrum\
    \ band for transmission. The\nfrequency band between 30 GHz to 300 GHz is known\
    \ as mmWave because these waves\nhave wavelengths between 1 to 10 mm. Till now\
    \ radar systems and satellites are only using\nmmWave as these are very fast frequency\
    \ bands which provide very high speed wireless\ncommunication. Many mobile network\
    \ providers also started mmWave for transmitting\ndata between base stations.\
    \ Using two ways the speed of data transmission can be improved\none is by increasing\
    \ spectrum utilization and second is by increasing spectrum bandwidth.\nOut of\
    \ these two approaches increasing bandwidth is quite easy and better. The frequency\n\
    band below 5 GHz is very crowded as many technologies are using it so to boost\
    \ up the\ndata transmission rate 5G wireless network uses mmWave technology which\
    \ instead of\nincreasing spectrum utilization, increases the spectrum bandwidth\
    \ [58]. To maximize the\nsignal bandwidth in wireless communication the carrier\
    \ frequency should also be increased\nby 5% because the signal bandwidth is directly\
    \ proportional to carrier frequencies. The\nfrequency band between 28 GHz to 60\
    \ GHz is very useful for 5G wireless communication\nas 28 GHz frequency band offers\
    \ up to 1 GHz spectrum bandwidth and 60 GHz frequency\nband offers 2 GHz spectrum\
    \ bandwidth. 4G LTE provides 2 GHz carrier frequency which\noffers only 100 MHz\
    \ spectrum bandwidth. However, the use of mmWave increases the\nspectrum bandwidth\
    \ 10 times, which leads to better transmission speeds [59,60].\nHighlights of\
    \ 5G mmWave are as follows:\n•\nIn the technological world, everyone uses WiMax,\
    \ GPS, wiﬁ, 4G, 3G, L-Band, S-Band,\nC- Band Satellite, etc., for communication.\
    \ The radio frequency spectrum of these\ntechnologies is minimal, which lies between\
    \ 1 GHz to 6 GHz. Hence, it is very crowded.\nThe spectrum range from 30 GHz to\
    \ 300 GHz, known as mmWave, is less utilized and\nstill not allocated to other\
    \ communication technologies. After a long time, the range\nfrom 24 GHz to 100\
    \ GHz is allocated to 5G. As shown in Figure 4.\n•\nThe 5G mmWave offer three\
    \ advantages: (1) MmWave is very less used new Band,\n(2) MmWave signals carry\
    \ more data than lower frequency wave, and (3) MmWave can\nbe incorporated with\
    \ MIMO antenna with the potential to offer a higher magnitude\ncapacity compared\
    \ to current communication systems.\nState-of-the-Art of Approaches\nIn [11],\
    \ the authors presented the survey of mmWave communications for 5G. The ad-\n\
    vantage of mmWave communications is adaptability, i.e., it supports the architectures\
    \ and\nprotocols up-gradation, which consists of integrated circuits, systems,\
    \ etc. The authors over-\nviewed the present solutions and examined them concerning\
    \ effectiveness, performance,\nSensors 2022, 22, 26\n17 of 32\nand complexity.\
    \ They also discussed the open research issues of mmWave communica-\ntions in\
    \ 5G concerning the software-deﬁned network (SDN) architecture, network state\n\
    information, efﬁcient regulation techniques, and the heterogeneous system.\nIn\
    \ [61], the authors present the recent work done by investigators in 5G; they\
    \ discussed\nthe design issues and demands of mmWave 5G antennas for cellular\
    \ handsets. After that,\nthey designed a small size and low-proﬁle 60 GHz array\
    \ of antenna units that contain\n3D planer mesh-grid antenna elements. For the\
    \ future prospect, a framework is designed\nin which antenna components are used\
    \ to operate cellular handsets on mmWave 5G\nsmartphones. In addition, they cross-checked\
    \ the mesh-grid array of antennas with the\npolarized beam for upcoming hardware\
    \ challenges.\nFigure 4. Pictorial representation of millimeter wave.\nIn [12],\
    \ the authors considered the suitability of the mmWave band for 5G cellular\n\
    systems. They suggested a resource allocation system for concurrent D2D communications\n\
    in mmWave 5G cellular systems, and it improves network efﬁciency and maintains\
    \ network\nconnectivity. This research article can serve as guidance for simulating\
    \ D2D communica-\ntions in mmWave 5G cellular systems. Massive mmWave BS may be\
    \ set up to obtain a\nhigh delivery rate and aggregate efﬁciency. Therefore, many\
    \ wireless users can hand off\nfrequently between the mmWave base terminals, and\
    \ it emerges the demand to search the\nneighbor having better network connectivity.\n\
    In [62], the authors provided a brief description of the cellular spectrum which\
    \ ranges\nfrom 1 GHz to 3 GHz and is very crowed. In addition, they presented\
    \ various noteworthy\nfactors to set up mmWave communications in 5G, namely, channel\
    \ characteristics regarding\nmmWave signal attenuation due to free space propagation,\
    \ atmospheric gaseous, and\nrain. In addition, hybrid beamforming architecture\
    \ in the mmWave technique is analyzed.\nThey also suggested methods for the blockage\
    \ effect in mmWave communications due to\npenetration damage. Finally, the authors\
    \ have studied designing the mmWave transmission\nwith small beams in nonorthogonal\
    \ device-to-device communication.\nThis section covered various works done on\

    \ plays a big role in developing the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT\nwill connect\
    \ lots of things with the internet like appliances, sensors, devices, objects,\
    \ and\napplications. These applications will collect lots of data from different\
    \ devices and sensors.\nSensors 2022, 22, 26\n18 of 32\n5G will provide very high\
    \ speed internet connectivity for data collection, transmission,\ncontrol, and\
    \ processing. 5G is a ﬂexible network with unused spectrum availability and it\n\
    offers very low cost deployment that is why it is the most efﬁcient technology\
    \ for IoT [63].\nIn many areas, 5G provides beneﬁts to IoT, and below are some\
    \ examples:\nSmart homes: smart home appliances and products are in demand these\
    \ days. The 5G\nnetwork makes smart homes more real as it offers high speed connectivity\
    \ and monitoring\nof smart appliances. Smart home appliances are easily accessed\
    \ and conﬁgured from remote\nlocations using the 5G network, as it offers very\
    \ high speed low latency communication.\nSmart cities: 5G wireless network also\
    \ helps in developing smart cities applications\nsuch as automatic trafﬁc management,\
    \ weather update, local area broadcasting, energy\nsaving, efﬁcient power supply,\
    \ smart lighting system, water resource management, crowd\nmanagement, emergency\
    \ control, etc.\nIndustrial IoT: 5G wireless technology will provide lots of features\
    \ for future industries\nsuch as safety, process tracking, smart packing, shipping,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, automation of\nequipment, predictive maintenance and logistics.\
    \ 5G smart sensor technology also offers\nsmarter, safer, cost effective, and\
    \ energy-saving industrial operation for industrial IoT.\nSmart Farming: 5G technology\
    \ will play a crucial role for agriculture and smart\nfarming. 5G sensors and\
    \ GPS technology will help farmers to track live attacks on crops\nand manage\
    \ them quickly. These smart sensors can also be used for irrigation control, pest\n\
    control, insect control, and electricity control.\nAutonomous Driving: 5G wireless\
    \ network offers very low latency high speed com-\nmunication which is very signiﬁcant\
    \ for autonomous driving. It means self-driving cars\nwill come to real life soon\
    \ with 5G wireless networks. Using 5G autonomous cars can\neasily communicate\
    \ with smart trafﬁc signs, objects and other vehicles running on the road.\n5G’s\
    \ low latency feature makes self-driving more real as every millisecond is important\
    \ for\nautonomous vehicles, decision taking is performed in microseconds to avoid\
    \ accidents [64].\nHighlights of 5G IoT are as follows:\n•\nIoT is termed as “Internet\
    \ of Things.” It provides machine-to-machine (M2M) com-\nmunication and shares\
    \ information between heterogeneous devices without human\ninterference. As shown\
    \ in the Figure 5.\n•\n5G with IoT is a new feature of next-generation mobile\

    \ in determining and enlarging the\n5G system.\nIn [66], the author introduced\
    \ an IoT authentication scheme in a 5G network, with more\nexcellent reliability\
    \ and dynamic. The scheme proposed a privacy-protected procedure for\nselecting\
    \ slices; it provided an additional fog node for proper data transmission and\
    \ service\ntypes of the subscribers, along with service-oriented authentication\
    \ and key understanding\nto maintain the secrecy, precision of users, and conﬁdentiality\
    \ of service factors. Users\nanonymously identify the IoT servers and develop\
    \ a vital channel for service accessibility\nand data cached on local fog nodes\
    \ and remote IoT servers. The author performed a\nsimulation to manifest the security\
    \ and privacy preservation of the user over the network.\nThis section covered\
    \ various works done on 5G IoT by multiple authors. Table 8 shows\nhow different\

    Various machine learning (ML) techniques were applied in 5G networks and mobile\n\
    communication. It provides a solution to multiple complex problems, which requires\
    \ a\nlot of hand-tuning. ML techniques can be broadly classiﬁed as supervised,\
    \ unsupervised,\nand reinforcement learning. Let’s discuss each learning technique\
    \ separately and where it\nimpacts the 5G network.\nSupervised Learning, where\
    \ user works with labeled data; some 5G network problems\ncan be further categorized\
    \ as classiﬁcation and regression problems. Some regression\nproblems such as\
    \ scheduling nodes in 5G and energy availability can be predicted using\nLinear\
    \ Regression (LR) algorithm. To accurately predict the bandwidth and frequency\n\
    allocation Statistical Logistic Regression (SLR) is applied. Some supervised classiﬁers\n\
    are applied to predict the network demand and allocate network resources based\
    \ on the\nconnectivity performance; it signiﬁes the topology setup and bit rates.\
    \ Support Vector\nMachine (SVM) and NN-based approximation algorithms are used\
    \ for channel learning\nbased on observable channel state information. Deep Neural\
    \ Network (DNN) is also\nemployed to extract solutions for predicting beamforming\
    \ vectors at the BS’s by taking\nmapping functions and uplink pilot signals into\
    \ considerations.\nSensors 2022, 22, 26\n20 of 32\nIn unsupervised Learning, where\
    \ the user works with unlabeled data, various clus-\ntering techniques are applied\
    \ to enhance network performance and connectivity without\ninterruptions. K-means\
    \ clustering reduces the data travel by storing data centers content\ninto clusters.\
    \ It optimizes the handover estimation based on mobility pattern and selection\n\
    of relay nodes in the V2V network. Hierarchical clustering reduces network failure\
    \ by\ndetecting the intrusion in the mobile wireless network; unsupervised soft\
    \ clustering helps\nin reducing latency by clustering fog nodes. The nonparametric\
    \ Bayesian unsupervised\nlearning technique reduces trafﬁc in the network by actively\
    \ serving the user’s requests\nand demands. Other unsupervised learning techniques\
    \ such as Adversarial Auto Encoders\n(AAE) and Afﬁnity Propagation Clustering\
    \ techniques detect irregular behavior in the\nwireless spectrum and manage resources\
    \ for ultradense small cells, respectively.\nIn case of an uncertain environment\
    \ in the 5G wireless network, reinforcement learning\n(RL) techniques are employed\
    \ to solve some problems. Actor-critic reinforcement learning\nis used for user\
    \ scheduling and resource allocation in the network. Markov decision\nprocess\
    \ (MDP) and Partially Observable MDP (POMDP) is used for Quality of Experience\n\
    (QoE)-based handover decision-making for Hetnets. Controls packet call admission\
    \ in\nHetNets and channel access process for secondary users in a Cognitive Radio\
    \ Network\n(CRN). Deep RL is applied to decide the communication channel and mobility\
    \ and speeds\nup the secondary user’s learning rate using an antijamming strategy.\
    \ Deep RL is employed\nin various 5G network application parameters such as resource\
    \ allocation and security [67].\nTable 9 shows the state-of-the-art ML-based solution\
    \ for 5G network.\nHighlights of machine learning techniques for 5G are as follows:\n\
    •\nMachine learning (ML) is a part of artiﬁcial intelligence. It processes and\
    \ analyses the\ndata that automates a systematic model that ﬁnds patterns and\
    \ carries out decisions\nwith minimum human interference. As shown in the Figure\
    \ 6.\n•\nIn ML, a model will be deﬁned which fulﬁlls the desired requirements\
    \ through\nwhich desired results are obtained. In the later stage, it examines\

    \ ﬁrstly describes the demands for the traditional authentication pro-\ncedures\
    \ and beneﬁts of intelligent authentication. The intelligent authentication method\n\
    was established to improve security practice in 5G-and-beyond wireless communication\n\
    systems. Thereafter, the machine learning paradigms for intelligent authentication\
    \ were\norganized into parametric and non-parametric research methods, as well\
    \ as supervised, un-\nsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches. As a\
    \ outcome, machine learning tech-\nniques provide a new paradigm into authentication\
    \ under diverse network conditions and\nunstable dynamics. In addition, prompt\
    \ intelligence to the security management to obtain\ncost-effective, better reliable,\
    \ model-free, continuous, and situation-aware authentication.\nIn [68], the authors\
    \ proposed a machine learning-based model to predict the trafﬁc\nload at a particular\
    \ location. They used a mobile network trafﬁc dataset to train a model\nthat can\
    \ calculate the total number of user requests at a time. To launch access and\
    \ mobility\nmanagement function (AMF) instances according to the requirement as\
    \ there were no\npredictions of user request the performance automatically degrade\
    \ as AMF does not handle\nthese requests at a time. Earlier threshold-based techniques\
    \ were used to predict the\ntrafﬁc load, but that approach took too much time;\
    \ therefore, the authors proposed RNN\nalgorithm-based ML to predict the trafﬁc\
    \ load, which gives efﬁcient results.\nIn [15], authors discussed the issue of\
    \ network slice admission, resource allocation\namong subscribers, and how to\
    \ maximize the proﬁt of infrastructure providers. The author\nproposed a network\
    \ slice admission control algorithm based on SMDP (decision-making\nprocess) that\
    \ guarantees the subscribers’ best acceptance policies and satisﬁability (ten-\n\
    ants). They also suggested novel N3AC, a neural network-based algorithm that optimizes\n\
    performance under various conﬁgurations, signiﬁcantly outperforms practical and\
    \ straight-\nforward approaches.\nSensors 2022, 22, 26\n22 of 32\nThis section\
    \ includes various works done on 5G ML by different authors. Table 10\nshows the\
    \ state-of-the-art work on the improvement of various parameters such as energy\n\
    efﬁciency, Quality of Services (QoS), and latency with 5G ML.\nTable 10. The state-of-the-art\

    \ Techniques for 5G\nOptimization techniques may be applied to capture NP-Complete\
    \ or NP-Hard prob-\nlems in 5G technology. This section brieﬂy describes various\
    \ research works suggested for\n5G technology based on optimization techniques.\n\
    In [80], Massive MIMO technology is used in 5G mobile network to make it more\n\
    ﬂexible and scalable. The MIMO implementation in 5G needs a signiﬁcant number\
    \ of radio\nfrequencies is required in the RF circuit that increases the cost\
    \ and energy consumption\nof the 5G network. This paper provides a solution that\
    \ increases the cost efﬁciency and\nenergy efﬁciency with many radio frequency\
    \ chains for a 5G wireless communication\nnetwork. They give an optimized energy\
    \ efﬁcient technique for MIMO antenna and\nmmWave technologies based 5G mobile\
    \ communication network. The proposed Energy\nEfﬁcient Hybrid Precoding (EEHP)\
    \ algorithm to increase the energy efﬁciency for the 5G\nwireless network. This\
    \ algorithm minimizes the cost of an RF circuit with a large number\nof RF chains.\n\
    In [16], authors have discussed the growing demand for energy efﬁciency in the\n\
    next-generation networks. In the last decade, they have ﬁgured out the things\
    \ in wireless\ntransmissions, which proved a change towards pursuing green communication\
    \ for the next\ngeneration system. The importance of adopting the correct EE metric\
    \ was also reviewed.\nFurther, they worked through the different approaches that\
    \ can be applied in the future for\nincreasing the network’s energy and posed\
    \ a summary of the work that was completed\npreviously to enhance the energy productivity\
    \ of the network using these capabilities. A\nsystem design for EE development\
    \ using relay selection was also characterized, along with\nan observation of\
    \ distinct algorithms applied for EE in relay-based ecosystems.\nIn [81], authors\
    \ presented how AI-based approach is used to the setup of Self Organiz-\ning Network\
    \ (SON) functionalities for radio access network (RAN) design and optimization.\n\
    They used a machine learning approach to predict the results for 5G SON functionalities.\n\
    Firstly, the input was taken from various sources; then, prediction and clustering-based\n\
    machine learning models were applied to produce the results. Multiple AI-based\
    \ devices\nwere used to extract the knowledge analysis to execute SON functionalities\
    \ smoothly. Based\non results, they tested how self-optimization, self-testing,\
    \ and self-designing are done for\nSON. The author also describes how the proposed\
    \ mechanism classiﬁes in different orders.\nIn [82], investigators examined the\
    \ working of OFDM in various channel environments.\nThey also ﬁgured out the changes\
    \ in frame duration of the 5G TDD frame design. Subcarrier\nspacing is beneﬁcial\
    \ to obtain a small frame length with control overhead. They provided\nvarious\
    \ techniques to reduce the growing guard period (GP) and cyclic preﬁx (CP) like\n\
    complete utilization of multiple subcarrier spacing, management and data parts\
    \ of frame\nat receiver end, various uses of timing advance (TA) or total control\
    \ of ﬂexible CP size.\nThis section includes various works that were done on 5G\
    \ optimization by different\nauthors. Table 11 shows how other authors worked\
    \ on the improvement of multiple pa-\nrameters such as energy efﬁciency, power\
    \ optimization, and latency with 5G optimization.\nSensors 2022, 22, 26\n23 of\

    \ over 4G\nThis section presents descriptions of various novel features of 5G,\
    \ namely, the concept\nof small cell, beamforming, and MEC.\n5.1. Small Cell\n\
    Small cells are low-powered cellular radio access nodes which work in the range\
    \ of\n10 meters to a few kilometers. Small cells play a very important role in\
    \ implementation of\nthe 5G wireless network. Small cells are low power base stations\
    \ which cover small areas.\nSmall cells are quite similar with all the previous\
    \ cells used in various wireless networks.\nHowever, these cells have some advantages\
    \ like they can work with low power and they\nare also capable of working with\
    \ high data rates. Small cells help in rollout of 5G network\nwith ultra high\
    \ speed and low latency communication. Small cells in the 5G network\nuse some\
    \ new technologies like MIMO, beamforming, and mmWave for high speed data\ntransmission.\
    \ The design of small cells hardware is very simple so its implementation is\n\
    quite easier and faster. There are three types of small cell tower available in\
    \ the market.\nFemtocells, picocells, and microcells [83]. As shown in the Table\
    \ 12.\nTable 12. Types of Small cells.\nTypes of\nSmall Cell\nCoverage\nRadius\n\

    Wired,\nﬁber,\nMicrowave\nMedium\nMmWave is a very high band spectrum between\
    \ 30 to 300 GHz. As it is a signiﬁcantly\nless used spectrum, it provides very\
    \ high-speed wireless communication. MmWave offers\nultra-wide bandwidth for next-generation\
    \ mobile networks. MmWave has lots of advan-\ntages, but it has some disadvantages,\
    \ too, such as mmWave signals are very high-frequency\nsignals, so they have more\
    \ collision with obstacles in the air which cause the signals loses\nenergy quickly.\
    \ Buildings and trees also block MmWave signals, so these signals cover a\nshorter\
    \ distance. To resolve these issues, multiple small cell stations are installed\
    \ to cover\nthe gap between end-user and base station [18]. Small cell covers\
    \ a very shorter range, so\nthe installation of a small cell depends on the population\
    \ of a particular area. Generally, in\na populated place, the distance between\
    \ each small cell varies from 10 to 90 meters. In the\nsurvey [20], various authors\
    \ implemented small cells with massive MIMO simultaneously.\nThey also reviewed\
    \ multiple technologies used in 5G like beamforming, small cell, massive\nMIMO,\
    \ NOMA, device to device (D2D) communication. Various problems like interference\n\
    management, spectral efﬁciency, resource management, energy efﬁciency, and backhauling\n\
    are discussed. The author also gave a detailed presentation of all the issues\
    \ occurring while\nimplementing small cells with various 5G technologies. As shown\
    \ in the Figure 7, mmWave\nhas a higher range, so it can be easily blocked by\
    \ the obstacles as shown in Figure 7a. This\nis one of the key concerns of millimeter-wave\
    \ signal transmission. To solve this issue,\nSensors 2022, 22, 26\n24 of 32\n\
    the small cell can be placed at a short distance to transmit the signals easily,\
    \ as shown in\nFigure 7b.\nMillimeter wave signals blocked\n by trees and buildings\
    \ \nSmall cell are placed to fill the gap \nbetween the base station and users.\n\
    (a)\n(b)\nFigure 7. Pictorial representation of communication with and without\
    \ small cells.\n5.2. Beamforming\nBeamforming is a key technology of wireless\
    \ networks which transmits the signals\nin a directional manner. 5G beamforming\
    \ making a strong wireless connection toward\na receiving end. In conventional\
    \ systems when small cells are not using beamforming,\nmoving signals to particular\
    \ areas is quite difﬁcult. Beamforming counter this issue using\nbeamforming small\
    \ cells are able to transmit the signals in particular direction towards a\ndevice\
    \ like mobile phone, laptops, autonomous vehicle and IoT devices. Beamforming\
    \ is\nimproving the efﬁciency and saves the energy of the 5G network. Beamforming\
    \ is broadly\ndivided into three categories: Digital beamforming, analog beamforming\
    \ and hybrid beam-\nforming. Digital beamforming: multiuser MIMO is equal to digital\
    \ beamforming which\nis mainly used in LTE Advanced Pro and in 5G NR. In digital\
    \ beamforming the same fre-\nquency or time resources can be used to transmit\
    \ the data to multiple users at the same time\nwhich improves the cell capacity\
    \ of wireless networks. Analog Beamforming: In mmWave\nfrequency range 5G NR analog\
    \ beamforming is a very important approach which improves\nthe coverage. In digital\
    \ beamforming there are chances of high pathloss in mmWave as\nonly one beam per\
    \ set of antenna is formed. While the analog beamforming saves high\npathloss\
    \ in mmWave. Hybrid beamforming: hybrid beamforming is a combination of both\n\
    analog beamforming and digital beamforming. In the implementation of MmWave in\
    \ 5G\nnetwork hybrid beamforming will be used [84].\nWireless signals in the 4G\
    \ network are spreading in large areas, and nature is not\nOmnidirectional. Thus,\
    \ energy depletes rapidly, and users who are accessing these signals\nalso face\
    \ interference problems. The beamforming technique is used in the 5G network to\n\
    resolve this issue. In beamforming signals are directional. They move like a laser\
    \ beam\nfrom the base station to the user, so signals seem to be traveling in\
    \ an invisible cable.\nBeamforming helps achieve a faster data rate; as the signals\
    \ are directional, it leads to less\nenergy consumption and less interference.\
    \ In [21], investigators evolve some techniques\nwhich reduce interference and\
    \ increase system efﬁciency of the 5G mobile network. In\nthis survey article,\
    \ the authors covered various challenges faced while designing an op-\ntimized\
    \ beamforming algorithm. Mainly focused on different design parameters such as\n\
    performance evaluation and power consumption. In addition, they also described\
    \ various\nissues related to beamforming like CSI, computation complexity, and\
    \ antenna correlation.\nThey also covered various research to cover how beamforming\
    \ helps implement MIMO\nin next-generation mobile networks [85]. Figure 8 shows\
    \ the pictorial representation of\ncommunication with and without using beamforming.\n\

    \ with and without using beamforming.\n5.3. Mobile Edge Computing\nMobile Edge\
    \ Computing (MEC) [24]: MEC is an extended version of cloud computing\nthat brings\
    \ cloud resources closer to the end-user. When we talk about computing, the\n\
    very ﬁrst thing that comes to our mind is cloud computing. Cloud computing is\
    \ a very\nfamous technology that offers many services to end-user. Still, cloud\
    \ computing has many\ndrawbacks. The services available in the cloud are too far\
    \ from end-users that create\nlatency, and cloud user needs to download the complete\
    \ application before use, which\nalso increases the burden to the device [86].\
    \ MEC creates an edge between the end-user\nand cloud server, bringing cloud computing\
    \ closer to the end-user. Now, all the services,\nnamely, video conferencing,\
    \ virtual software, etc., are offered by this edge that improves\ncloud computing\
    \ performance. Another essential feature of MEC is that the application\nis split\
    \ into two parts, which, ﬁrst one is available at cloud server, and the second\
    \ is at\nthe user’s device. Therefore, the user need not download the complete\
    \ application on\nhis device that increases the performance of the end user’s\
    \ device. Furthermore, MEC\nprovides cloud services at very low latency and less\
    \ bandwidth. In [23,87], the author’s\ninvestigation proved that successful deployment\
    \ of MEC in 5G network increases the\noverall performance of 5G architecture.\
    \ Graphical differentiation between cloud computing\nand mobile edge computing\
    \ is presented in Figure 9.\nFigure 9. Pictorial representation of cloud computing\
    \ vs. mobile edge computing.\nSensors 2022, 22, 26\n26 of 32\n6. 5G Security\n\
    Security is the key feature in the telecommunication network industry, which is\
    \ neces-\nsary at various layers, to handle 5G network security in applications\
    \ such as IoT, Digital\nforensics, IDS and many more [88,89]. The authors [90],\
    \ discussed the background of 5G\nand its security concerns, challenges and future\
    \ directions. The author also introduced the\nblockchain technology that can be\
    \ incorporated with the IoT to overcome the challenges in\nIoT. The paper aims\
    \ to create a security framework which can be incorporated with the LTE\nadvanced\
    \ network, and effective in terms of cost, deployment and QoS. In [91], author\
    \ sur-\nveyed various form of attacks, the security challenges, security solutions\
    \ with respect to the\naffected technology such as SDN, Network function virtualization\
    \ (NFV), Mobile Clouds\nand MEC, and security standardizations of 5G, i.e., 3GPP,\
    \ 5GPPP, Internet Engineering Task\nForce (IETF), Next Generation Mobile Networks\
    \ (NGMN), European Telecommunications\nStandards Institute (ETSI). In [92], author\
    \ elaborated various technological aspects, security\nissues and their existing\
    \ solutions and also mentioned the new emerging technological\nparadigms for 5G\
    \ security such as blockchain, quantum cryptography, AI, SDN, CPS, MEC,\nD2D.\
    \ The author aims to create new security frameworks for 5G for further use of\
    \ this\ntechnology in development of smart cities, transportation and healthcare.\
    \ In [93], author\nanalyzed the threats and dark threat, security aspects concerned\
    \ with SDN and NFV, also\ntheir Commercial & Industrial Security Corporation (CISCO)\
    \ 5G vision and new security\ninnovations with respect to the new evolving architectures\
    \ of 5G [94].\nAuthenticationThe identiﬁcation of the user in any network is made\
    \ with the help\nof authentication. The different mobile network generations from\
    \ 1G to 5G have used\nmultiple techniques for user authentication. 5G utilizes\
    \ the 5G Authentication and Key\nAgreement (AKA) authentication method, which\
    \ shares a cryptographic key between user\nequipment (UE) and its home network\
    \ and establishes a mutual authentication process\nbetween the both [95].\nAccess\
    \ Control To restrict the accessibility in the network, 5G supports access control\n\
    mechanisms to provide a secure and safe environment to the users and is controlled\
    \ by\nnetwork providers. 5G uses simple public key infrastructure (PKI) certiﬁcates\
    \ for authenti-\ncating access in the 5G network. PKI put forward a secure and\
    \ dynamic environment for\nthe 5G network. The simple PKI technique provides ﬂexibility\
    \ to the 5G network; it can\nscale up and scale down as per the user trafﬁc in\
    \ the network [96,97].\nCommunication Security 5G deals to provide high data bandwidth,\
    \ low latency, and\nbetter signal coverage. Therefore secure communication is\
    \ the key concern in the 5G\nnetwork. UE, mobile operators, core network, and\
    \ access networks are the main focal point\nfor the attackers in 5G communication.\
    \ Some of the common attacks in communication at\nvarious segments are Botnet,\
    \ message insertion, micro-cell, distributed denial of service\n(DDoS), and transport\
    \ layer security (TLS)/secure sockets layer (SSL) attacks [98,99].\nEncryption\
    \ The conﬁdentiality of the user and the network is done using encryption\ntechniques.\
    \ As 5G offers multiple services, end-to-end (E2E) encryption is the most suitable\n\
    technique applied over various segments in the 5G network. Encryption forbids\
    \ unautho-\nrized access to the network and maintains the data privacy of the\
    \ user. To encrypt the radio\ntrafﬁc at Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP)\
    \ layer, three 128-bits keys are applied at\nthe user plane, nonaccess stratum\
    \ (NAS), and access stratum (AS) [100].\n7. Summary of 5G Technology Based on\

    8. Conclusions\nThis survey article illustrates the emergence of 5G, its evolution\
    \ from 1G to 5G mobile\nnetwork, applications, different research groups, their\
    \ work, and the key features of 5G.\nIt is not just a mobile broadband network,\
    \ different from all the previous mobile network\ngenerations; it offers services\
    \ like IoT, V2X, and Industry 4.0. This paper covers a detailed\nsurvey from multiple\
    \ authors on different technologies in 5G, such as massive MIMO,\nNon-Orthogonal\
    \ Multiple Access (NOMA), millimeter wave, small cell, MEC (Mobile\nEdge Computing),\
    \ beamforming, optimization, and machine learning in 5G. After each\nsection,\
    \ a tabular comparison covers all the state-of-the-research held in these technologies.\n\
    This survey also shows the importance of these newly added technologies and building\
    \ a\nﬂexible, scalable, and reliable 5G network.\n9. Future Findings\nThis article\
    \ covers a detailed survey on the 5G mobile network and its features. These\n\
    features make 5G more reliable, scalable, efﬁcient at affordable rates. As discussed\
    \ in the\nabove sections, numerous technical challenges originate while implementing\
    \ those features\nor providing services over a 5G mobile network. So, for future\
    \ research directions, the\nSensors 2022, 22, 26\n28 of 32\nresearch community\
    \ can overcome these challenges while implementing these technologies\n(MIMO,\
    \ NOMA, small cell, mmWave, beam-forming, MEC) over a 5G network. 5G commu-\n\
    nication will bring new improvements over the existing systems. Still, the current\
    \ solutions\ncannot fulﬁll the autonomous system and future intelligence engineering\
    \ requirements\nafter a decade. There is no matter of discussion that 5G will\
    \ provide better QoS and new\nfeatures than 4G. But there is always room for improvement\
    \ as the considerable growth\nof centralized data and autonomous industry 5G wireless\
    \ networks will not be capable of\nfulﬁlling their demands in the future. So,\
    \ we need to move on new wireless network tech-\nnology that is named 6G. 6G wireless\
    \ network will bring new heights in mobile generations,\nas it includes (i) massive\
    \ human-to-machine communication, (ii) ubiquitous connectivity\nbetween the local\
    \ device and cloud server, (iii) creation of data fusion technology for vari-\n\
    ous mixed reality experiences and multiverps maps. (iv) Focus on sensing and actuation\
    \ to\ncontrol the network of the entire world. The 6G mobile network will offer\
    \ new services\nwith some other technologies; these services are 3D mapping, reality\
    \ devices, smart homes,\nsmart wearable, autonomous vehicles, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ and sense. It is expected that\n6G will provide ultra-long-range communication\
    \ with a very low latency of 1 ms. The\nper-user bit rate in a 6G wireless network\
    \ will be approximately 1 Tbps, and it will also\nprovide wireless communication,\
    \ which is 1000 times faster than 5G networks.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization:\

    Abstract: The growth of the global population coupled with a decline in natural\
    \ resources, farmland,\nand the increase in unpredictable environmental conditions\
    \ leads to food security is becoming a major\nconcern for all nations worldwide.\
    \ These problems are motivators that are driving the agricultural\nindustry to\
    \ transition to smart agriculture with the application of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) and\nbig data solutions to improve operational efﬁciency and productivity.\
    \ The IoT integrates a series\nof existing state-of-the-art solutions and technologies,\
    \ such as wireless sensor networks, cognitive\nradio ad hoc networks, cloud computing,\
    \ big data, and end-user applications. This study presents\na survey of IoT solutions\
    \ and demonstrates how IoT can be integrated into the smart agriculture\nsector.\
    \ To achieve this objective, we discuss the vision of IoT-enabled smart agriculture\
    \ ecosystems\nby evaluating their architecture (IoT devices, communication technologies,\
    \ big data storage, and\nprocessing), their applications, and research timeline.\
    \ In addition, we discuss trends and opportunities\nof IoT applications for smart\
    \ agriculture and also indicate the open issues and challenges of IoT\napplication\
    \ in smart agriculture. We hope that the ﬁndings of this study will constitute\
    \ important\nguidelines in research and promotion of IoT solutions aiming to improve\
    \ the productivity and quality\nof the agriculture sector as well as facilitating\
    \ the transition towards a future sustainable environment\nwith an agroecological\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: sustainable agriculture; food security; green technologies;\

    1. Introduction\nIn order to meet the current global needs of humanity, new solutions\
    \ and technologies\nare constantly being proposed and implemented. This has led\
    \ to the advent of the Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) [1,2]. IoT is deﬁned as the\
    \ network of all objects that are embedded\nwithin devices, sensors, machines,\
    \ software and people through the Internet environment\nto communicate, exchange\
    \ information and interact in order to provide a comprehen-\nsive solution between\
    \ the real world and the virtual world [3]. In recent years, IoT has\nbeen applied\
    \ in a series of domains, such as smart homes [4,5], smart cities [6,7], smart\n\
    energy [8,9], autonomous vehicles [10,11], smart agriculture [12–15], campus manage-\n\
    ment [16,17], healthcare [18,19], and logistics [20,21]. Series of other IoT applications\
    \ have\nbeen described by Shaﬁque et al. [22]. An illustration of rich and diverse\
    \ IoT applications\nfor smart agriculture is provided in Figure 1.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396. https://doi.org/10.3390/app12073396\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n2 of 19\nIn recent years, with the aim of increasing\
    \ agricultural production, new solutions and \ntechnologies have been introduced\
    \ in the agriculture sector [24]. An emerging trend is the \napplication of the\
    \ IoT and big data. A significant number of studies have been focused on \nresearch,\
    \ experiments, and applications [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over\
    \ 500 \nbillion IoT devices will be connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The\
    \ use of IoT and big \ndata will enable smart agriculture and is expected to enhance\
    \ efficiency and productivity \n[28]. \n \nFigure 1. An illustration of IoT applications\
    \ for smart agriculture. \nOver the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have\
    \ been strongly applied in the \nagricultural sector, building the foundation\
    \ for developing smart agriculture [29]. The \nunique characteristics of WSN,\
    \ such as the ability to self-organize, self-configure, self-es-\ntablish, and\
    \ self-recover, make it suitable for smart agriculture [30]. The sensor device\
    \ \nconsists of a radio frequency (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and\
    \ battery power \n[31]. The WSN focuses on applications such as environmental\
    \ monitoring, machine con-\ntrol automation, and traceability [32–35]. \nAlong\
    \ with the development of science and technology, the urgent requirement for \n\
    breakthrough solutions and technologies aiming at improving productivity and efficiency\
    \ \nin the agriculture sector has led to adoption of the IoT. The primary motivation\
    \ for their \napplications is the breakthrough progress of smart agriculture and\
    \ its inevitable role as \nthe future of smart and sustainable environment management.\
    \ IoT integrates a series of \nexisting solutions and technologies, such as WSN,\
    \ cognitive radio, ad hoc networks, cloud \ncomputing, and end-user applications\
    \ [36]. In the smart agricultural sector, automation \nsolutions and technologies,\
    \ mechanical machines, knowledge, decision-making tools, ser-\nvices, and software\
    \ are integrated seamlessly to help farmers improve productivity, prod-\nuct quality,\
    \ and profitability [37]. \nFigure 1. An illustration of IoT applications for\
    \ smart agriculture.\nAccording to the United Nations’ (UN 2019) statistics, the\
    \ world population is esti-\nmated to grow to 10 billion by 2050 [23]. As a consequence,\
    \ the requirements of agricultural\nproducts are continually increasing. However,\
    \ farmlands are declining, natural resources\nare increasingly depleted, and the\
    \ rise of unpredictable nature challenges, such as global\nwarming, salinization,\
    \ and ﬂooding, make food security the most concerning problem for\nall nations\
    \ worldwide.\nIn recent years, with the aim of increasing agricultural production,\
    \ new solutions and\ntechnologies have been introduced in the agriculture sector\
    \ [24]. An emerging trend is the\napplication of the IoT and big data. A signiﬁcant\
    \ number of studies have been focused on\nresearch, experiments, and applications\
    \ [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over 500\nbillion IoT devices will\
    \ be connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The use of IoT and big data\nwill\
    \ enable smart agriculture and is expected to enhance efﬁciency and productivity\
    \ [28].\nOver the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been strongly applied\
    \ in the agri-\ncultural sector, building the foundation for developing smart\
    \ agriculture [29]. The unique\ncharacteristics of WSN, such as the ability to\
    \ self-organize, self-conﬁgure, self-establish,\nand self-recover, make it suitable\
    \ for smart agriculture [30]. The sensor device consists of a\nradio frequency\
    \ (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and battery power [31]. The WSN\n\
    focuses on applications such as environmental monitoring, machine control automation,\n\
    and traceability [32–35].\nAlong with the development of science and technology,\
    \ the urgent requirement for\nbreakthrough solutions and technologies aiming at\
    \ improving productivity and efﬁciency\nin the agriculture sector has led to adoption\
    \ of the IoT. The primary motivation for their\napplications is the breakthrough\

    \ productivity, product\nquality, and proﬁtability [37].\nIn this work, a comprehensive\
    \ survey of IoT applications for smart agriculture is\nconducted. An analysis\
    \ of 135 relevant works published between 2017 and 2022 was con-\nducted. Firstly,\

    \ such as\n(1) location sensor, (2) optical sensor, (3) mechanical sensor, (4)\
    \ electrochemical sensor, and\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n5 of 19\n(5) air ﬂow\

    soil temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, leaf moisture, precipitation, wind\
    \ speed, wind\ndirection, and solar radiation, and barometric pressure [21,24,36].\n\
    2.2. Communication Technology\nThe survey of communication technologies for IoT\
    \ [43,44] indicated that to integrate\nIoT into the smart agriculture sector,\
    \ communication technologies must progressively\nimprove the evolution of IoT\
    \ devices. They play an important role in the development of\nIoT systems. The\
    \ existing communication solutions can be classiﬁed as: protocol, spectrum,\n\
    and topology.\nProtocols: many wireless communication protocols have been proposed\
    \ for the smart\nagriculture sector. Based on these protocols, devices in a smart\
    \ agricultural system can\ninteract, exchange information, and make decisions\
    \ to monitor and control farming condi-\ntions and improve yields and production\
    \ efﬁciency. The typical, low-power communication\nprotocol numbers commonly used\
    \ in smart agriculture can be divided into short-range and\nlong-range categories\
    \ based on the communication range.\n-\nShort-range: NFMI (near-ﬁeld magnetic\
    \ induction) [45], Bluetooth [46], ZigBee [47],\nterahertz (Z-Wave) [48,49], and\
    \ RFID [50].\n-\nLong-range: LoRa [51], Sigfox [52], and NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT)\
    \ [53].\nTable 1 presents some typical communication technologies for the smart\
    \ agriculture\nsector. The values in Table 1 indicate that short-range communication\
    \ technologies have\na transmission distance of less than 20 (m), high energy\
    \ efﬁciency, and low data rate.\nThese protocols are often employed in sensor\
    \ networks, while long-range communication\ntechnologies have transmission distances\
    \ of up to several tens of kilometres, consume more\nenergy, and are installed\
    \ for backhaul device-to-device communications. A diverse survey\nof low-power\
    \ communication technologies for IoT that presents solutions, challenges, and\n\
    some open issues is described by Sundaram et al. [54].\nTable 1. Some typical\

    Spectrum: Each radio device uses certain frequency bands for communication. The\n\
    FCC (Federal Communications Commission) has deﬁned unlicensed spectrum bands for\n\
    unlicensed operations in scientiﬁc, industrial, and medical purposes [55]. These\
    \ spectrum\nbands are often applied for low-power levels and short-range applications.\
    \ Consequently, a\nseries of common technologies for the smart agriculture sector,\
    \ from wireless machine con-\ntrol and UAVs to communication technologies such\
    \ as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, use unlicensed\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n6 of 19\n\
    spectrum bands [56]. However, the use of unlicensed spectra faces several challenges,\
    \ such\nas the quality of service guarantee, the cost of setting up the initial\
    \ infrastructure, and the\ninterference generated by the huge number of IoT devices\
    \ [57,58].\nA licensed spectrum usually is allocated to mobile networks. It provides\
    \ more efﬁcient\nnetwork trafﬁc, more reliability, enhances the quality of service\
    \ (QoS), offers security,\nprovides extensive coverage, and involves lower initialization\
    \ infrastructure costs for users.\nHowever, the use of licensed spectrum bands\
    \ has faced some limitations, such as high data\ntransmission costs and the low\
    \ energy efﬁciency of IoT devices [59].\nSeveral recent studies have demonstrated\
    \ the efﬁciency of unlicensed spectrum bands\nin the mm wave range. It uses extremely\
    \ low power but provides large transmission\ndistances and high data rates [60,61].\
    \ One limitation of the mm wave spectrum is that the\ndata rate is strongly affected\
    \ by weather conditions, especially rain [62].\nTopology: The establishment of\
    \ the communication spectrum band and operation pro-\ntocol of IoT devices depends\
    \ on the structure that deploys IoT devices for smart agriculture\napplications.\
    \ Network structures for smart agriculture usually have two main types of\nnodes:\
    \ sensor and backhaul nodes [63]. The common characteristics of IoT sensor nodes\n\
    are short communication distance, low data rate, and high energy efﬁciency. In\
    \ contrast,\nIoT backhaul nodes often require large transmission distances, high\
    \ throughput, and data\nrates. Therefore, based on the role of each IoT network\
    \ node, the sensor node or backhaul\nnode selects and installs appropriate communication\
    \ technologies [64]. Figure 5 presents a\ntypical low-power network topology designed\
    \ for measuring and monitoring factors in a\nsmart farm. The system includes:\n\
    (1)\nIoT sensor nodes collect information from the farming environment, such as\
    \ soil\nmoisture, air humidity, temperature, nutrient ingredients of soil, pest\
    \ images, and\nwater quality, then transmit collected data to IoT backhaul devices.\
    \ Depending on\nthe operation purpose and installation location, IoT sensor nodes\
    \ can be installed as\nRFDs (reduced-function devices), which only communicate\
    \ with FFDs (full-function\ndevices). These nodes cannot communicate with the\
    \ other RFDs, aiming to save\nenergy and decrease investment costs.\n(2)\nIoT\
    \ backhaul nodes, besides having the role of an IoT sensor node, also play a role\
    \ as\nintermediate nodes to receive information from other IoT nodes and transmit\
    \ it to the\ncontrol centre. IoT backhaul nodes are often installed as an FFD\
    \ device, which can\nconnect to other FDD and RFD devices.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12,\

    \ besides the main problems of sensing, collecting\ndata, and controlling devices\
    \ to respond to the real farming environment, data storage and\nprocessing are\
    \ also important problems and face some challenges [26,28]. In reality, the\n\
    number of collected data is huge, and traditional data storage, organization,\
    \ and processing\nsolutions are not feasible. Therefore, big data processing solutions\
    \ need to be researched\nand applied for smart agriculture [65,66].\nThe complexity\
    \ of data storage and processing is due to the unique characteristics\nof the\
    \ smart agriculture ﬁeld, including unstructured data and various formats, such\n\
    as text, images, audio and video, economic ﬁgures, and market information. Recent\n\
    solutions and technologies have introduced the use of cloud platforms for storage\
    \ and\ndata analytics, which are collected from farms [36,67]. In addition, cloud-assisted\
    \ big data\nanalytic solutions, such as edge computing [68] or fog computing [69],\
    \ are also proposed to\nreduce latency and costs and support QoS.\nThe survey\
    \ results demonstrate that, in recent years, many management information\nsystems\
    \ for smart agriculture have been proposed [70–72]. Nowadays, possible solutions\n\
    have been developed and commercialized, providing solutions and services for farmers\n\
    to manage farms and ﬁelds, aiming to increase productivity, reduce human labour,\
    \ and\nenhance farming efﬁciency, as follows:\n-\nOnFarm [73]: It is part of the\

    \ and increasing sales of products.\n3. Typical Applications of IoT in Smart Agriculture\n\
    In recent years, a series of IoT applications for agriculture have been introduced.\n\
    According to survey results, we divided these applications into categories based\
    \ on their\npurpose, including monitoring, tracking and traceability, and greenhouse\
    \ production. The\ndetailed results are presented in the following subsection.\n\
    3.1. Monitoring\nIn the agriculture sector, factors affecting the farming and\
    \ production process can be\nmonitored and collected, such as soil moisture, air\
    \ humidity, temperature, pH level, etc.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n8 of 19\n\
    These factors depend on the considered agricultural sector. Some smart agricultural\
    \ sectors\nare applying the following monitoring solutions:\nCrop Farming: In\
    \ this sector, some vital factors that affect the farming process and\nproduction\
    \ efﬁciency include air temperature, precipitation, air humidity, soil moisture,\n\
    salinity, solar radiation, pest status, soil nutrient ingredients, etc. In [81],\
    \ the authors\ndesigned an IoT device called FarmFox. This device allows real-time\
    \ collection and analysis\nof the composition of the farming soil and transmits\
    \ the information to farmers/owners\nvia the Internet. The results demonstrate\
    \ the health of the soil is monitored in real time to\nprovide timely recommendations\
    \ to farmers aiming to increase productivity and farming\nefﬁciency.\nFurthermore,\
    \ in [82], the authors proposed an IoT device to allow intelligent control\nof\
    \ temperature and humidity factors, called a weather radar. This device will automatically\n\
    turn on the warning mode using the light signal and send messages to the farmer\
    \ when the\ntemperature or humidity exceeds a pre-installed threshold. In [83],\
    \ the authors introduced\nan IoT system based on Web GIS to monitor pest status\
    \ and provide early warnings. In\naddition, this study also proposes a predictive\
    \ model based on monitoring the habitat of\npests and diseases. The efﬁciency\
    \ of the proposed system was indicated, based on the\npredicted ﬁgures of the\
    \ locust epidemic, to have a high accuracy rate (over 87%) in 2019\n(China).\n\
    Monitoring information, such as soil condition, moisture, and temperature, and\
    \ the\nprediction of natural factors, such as rainfall and weather, support the\
    \ control of growing\nconditions of crops, helping farmers plan and make irrigation\
    \ decisions to optimize pro-\nduction and reduce labour costs. In addition, the\
    \ collected data, combined with big data\nprocessing technology, can provide recommendations\
    \ for implementing preventive and\nremedial solutions against pests and diseases\
    \ in farming.\nAquaponics: It is an integration of aquaculture and hydroponics.\
    \ Aquaponics is a\nfarming technique where ﬁsh waste becomes a source of nutrients\
    \ needed by plants. One of\nthe most important issues in such farms is constantly\
    \ monitoring water quality, water level,\ntemperature, salinity, pH, sunlight,\
    \ etc. [84]. According to this research direction, in [85],\nthe authors designed\
    \ an IoT system to monitor the temperature and pH value of water for\naquaponics\
    \ farms. Moreover, this system is also equipped with a control system of water\n\
    metrics to keep the ﬁsh habitat stable and an automatic ﬁsh feeding function to\
    \ increase\nthe productivity of the ﬁsh. The results show that the IoT system\
    \ had stable operation and\nprovided real-time monitoring parameters. The authors\
    \ of [86] designed an aquaponics\nfarm for households/urban areas based on IoT.\
    \ This system recommends the proper ratio\nof ﬁsh and plants.\nConsequently, the\
    \ system decreases feed consumption as well as reduces carbon\nemissions into\
    \ the environment. The primary purpose of this proposal aims to balance the\n\
    self-sustaining ability of the aquaponics system. The experimental results demonstrate\
    \ the\nnumber of ﬁsh decreases from 30 to 15, and the number of plants increases\
    \ from 20 to 30,\nbut the crop production will increase by more than 50%. A detailed\
    \ and diverse survey of\nthe IoT systems and devices for control and monitoring\
    \ of aquaponics farms is introduced\nin [87]. Based on the obtained data, monitoring\
    \ can improve the production of ﬁsh and\nplants through the control, supplementation,\
    \ and regulation of nutritional ingredients in\nthe water. The collected data\
    \ were also used to automate the management of aquaponics\nfarms to reduce labour\
    \ costs.\nForestry: Humans depend on forests for survival. Moreover, forests play\
    \ a vital\nrole in the carbon cycle and provide a habitat for more than two-thirds\
    \ of animal species\nin the world. Forests also have the effect of protecting\
    \ watersheds, limiting ﬂoods, and\nmitigating climate change. The main factors\
    \ that need to be monitored in a forest include\nsoil ingredients, air temperature,\
    \ humidity, and concentration of several different gases,\nsuch as oxygen, methane,\
    \ ammonia, and hydrogen sulphide. A series of forest control\nsystems and solutions\
    \ are presented in [88,89] based on IoT and big data analytics.\nAppl. Sci. 2022,\
    \ 12, 3396\n9 of 19\nIn [90], the authors designed a peatland forest environmental\
    \ monitoring system.\nThis forest area plays a very vital role in the rainforest\
    \ ecosystem of Brunei. However,\nthe peatland forest type is very burnt. This\
    \ work designed an IoT system to monitor\nenvironmental conditions, such as temperature,\
    \ humidity, wind direction, barometric\npressure, and manage possible disasters.\
    \ For the purpose of enhancing feasibility, IoT\ndevices use the solar-powered\
    \ system and communicate with the monitoring centre based\non the LoRa network.\
    \ In [91], the authors proposed a solution to control forest changes\nand vitality\
    \ by using high-resolution RapidEye satellite imagery. This solution has been\n\
    deployed commercially in several states in Germany and has detected leaf diseases\
    \ in a\npine forest affected by pests. Survey results indicate that monitoring\
    \ in forestry focuses on\nproviding early warning systems against forest ﬁres,\
    \ pest control, or deforestation.\nLivestock Farming: It is deﬁned as the process\
    \ of raising domesticated animals, such as\ncows, pigs, sheep, and goats, chickens,\
    \ etc., in an agricultural environment to obtain traction,\nserve production,\
    \ and obtain products such as meat, eggs, milk, fur, leather, etc. In this\narea,\
    \ the factors to be monitored depend on the type and number of farming animals\
    \ [92].\nIn [93], the authors designed a support system for the diagnosis, prevention,\
    \ and treatment\nof diseases for livestock called VetLink. This system can provide\
    \ recommendations for\nanimal health for farmers in rural areas where it is difﬁcult\
    \ to access veterinary doctors\nimmediately. In [94], the authors proposed a noncontact\
    \ temperature measurement system\nand monitoring of animals to ensure early detection\
    \ of diseases and animal health. This\nsystem can be used for remote monitoring\
    \ of animal health and timely anomaly detection.\nIn [95], the authors introduced\
    \ a monitoring system for large-scale pig farms based on IoT.\nThe speciﬁc solution\
    \ is to attach an IC tag on each pig to monitor the behaviour of each pig,\nsuch\
    \ as their period of feeding and resting and exercise. Data from sensors are collected\n\
    and combined with data analytics solutions that can make recommendations for pig\
    \ health.\nThe monitoring data of water, feed, and animal health for livestock\
    \ in the farming\nprocess helps farmers set up livestock plans, reduce labour\
    \ costs, and enhance production\nefﬁciency. While a series of solutions has been\
    \ provided for monitoring large-scale farms,\ntheir application in small and medium-sized\
    \ farms is very limited, especially in developing\ncountries. This can be attributed\
    \ to the high cost and the lack of knowledge needed to\nset up, manage, and operate\
    \ IoT systems. Therefore, effective and low-cost solutions for\nagricultural IoT\
    \ have much potential.\n3.2. Tracking and Tracing\nIn order to meet the needs\
    \ of consumers and increase proﬁt value, in the future, farms\nneed to demonstrate\
    \ that products offered to the market are clean products and can be\ntracked and\
    \ traced conveniently, thereby enhancing the trust of consumers in product\nsafety\
    \ and health-related issues. In order to solve this problem, a series of tracking-\
    \ and\ntracing-based problems for the smart agricultural sector has been proposed,\
    \ speciﬁcally as\nfollows:\nIn [96], the authors designed an information system\
    \ that allows tracking and tracing\nof agricultural products and foods such as\
    \ dairy and vegetables, called SISTABENE. This\nsystem helps suppliers track the\
    \ production process and errors arising in the supply chain,\nand helps end-users\
    \ trace the origin of food. In [97], the authors proposed a food supply\nchain\
    \ traceability system based on blockchain technology. It helps to track and trace\
    \ agri-\nfood supply chains’ production process and trace the origin of agricultural\
    \ products. This\nsolution has been employed at Shanwei Lvfengyuan Modern Agricultural\
    \ Development\nCo., Ltd. (Shanwei, China). Although there are still limitations,\
    \ the results demonstrate\nthat this solution has successfully supported the tracing\
    \ of food and agricultural prod-\nucts through QR codes, improving product quality\
    \ and ensuring the clear traceability of\nproducts. In [98,99], the authors proposed\
    \ smart agricultural solutions to tracking and\ntracing agricultural products,\
    \ thereby allowing consumers to know the product’s entire\nhistory. These solutions\
    \ enable tracking and tracing some of the data collected along the\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n10 of 19\nsupply chain, ensuring that consumers and other stakeholders\
    \ can identify products’ origin,\nlocation, and history.\n3.3. Smart Precision\
    \ Farming\nThe advent of the GPS (global positioning system) has created breakthrough\
    \ advances\nin many ﬁelds of science and technology. The GPS provides the most\
    \ important parameters\nfor locating a device, such as location and time. GPS\
    \ systems have been successfully\ndeployed in many ﬁelds, such as smartphones,\
    \ vehicles, and IoT ecosystems. However,\nGPS is only good support for outdoor\
    \ systems and the sky. Meanwhile, the demand\nfor the locating and navigating\
    \ systems in the home and on the streets of smart cities is\ngrowing rapidly.\
    \ Aiming to solve this problem, an advanced global navigation satellite\nsystem\
    \ (GNSS) is being deployed [100]. Based on GPS and GNSS systems, suitable farming\n\
    maps have been established for ﬁelds and farms. As a result, agricultural machinery\
    \ and\nequipment can be operated autonomously [101]. Figure 6 presents an illustration\
    \ of the\ntypical cloud-assisted, IoT-based precision agriculture platform.\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n11 of 20 \n \ntheir machines, allowing\
    \ machines to operate autonomously and remotely via the Internet \n[107]. \n \n\
    Figure 6. Cloud-assisted IoT-based precision agriculture platform. \n3.4. Greenhouse\
    \ Production \nA greenhouse consists of walls and a roof, which are usually made\
    \ from transparent \nmaterials, such as plastic or glass. In a greenhouse, plants\
    \ are grown in a controlled envi-\nronment, including controlling for moisture,\
    \ nutrient ingredients of the soil, light, tem-\nperature, etc. Consequently,\
    \ greenhouse technology makes it possible for humans to grow \nany plant, at any\
    \ time, by providing suitable environmental conditions [108]. Figure 7 \nillustrates\
    \ a smart agriculture IoT system for monitoring greenhouse farming factors \n\
    based on IoT ecosystems. \nIn [109], the authors introduced an IoT-based greenhouse\
    \ environmental monitoring \nsystem for multipoint monitoring in large greenhouses.\
    \ Instead of using multiple sensors \nat different locations, this solution involves\
    \ a drive system that allows the sensor system \ndiff\nl\ni\ni\nh\nh\nTh\ni\n\

    In smart precision farming, one of the most important applications is the use\
    \ of drones\nin monitoring and farming activities. Some common farming tasks using\
    \ UAVs include\nspraying pesticides, fertilizing, sowing seeds, evaluating and\
    \ mapping, and monitoring\ncrop growth. In [102], the authors presented a detailed\
    \ survey of drone applications for\nsmart agriculture, including applications,\
    \ control technology, and future trends of the UAV\napplication for smart agriculture.\
    \ In [103], the authors designed an automatic agricultural\nproduct classiﬁcation\
    \ system based on camera systems, image processing algorithms, and\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n11 of 19\nmechanical actuators. The experimental results for\
    \ agriculture products such as oranges\nand tomatoes present a classiﬁcation success\
    \ rate of over 95%, and the sorting time for each\nproduct is less than 1(s).\
    \ This solution can be adapted and applied to the classiﬁcation of\ndifferent\
    \ agricultural products. In [104], the authors proposed a solution to estimate\
    \ grape\nproduction. The proposed solution combines an RGB-D camera mounted on\
    \ a mobile robot\nplatform and size estimation algorithm for a bunch of grapes.\
    \ The experimental results\npresent an average error in the range of [2.8–3.5]\
    \ (cm). The results demonstrate this solution\nis a feasible method for evaluating\
    \ the productivity of large-scale grape farms.\nThe survey results show that smart\
    \ precision agricultural equipment, such as irriga-\ntion systems, unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAV), and smart agricultural equipment, etc.,\nare conﬁgurable in\
    \ an autonomous-control mode based on certain conditions or can be\ncontrolled\
    \ remotely by the farmer via the Internet [105,106]. Smart precision farming helps\n\
    to improve productivity and production efﬁciency and is suitable for large-scale\
    \ farms.\nNowadays, suppliers of precision agricultural equipment have IoT modules\
    \ built into their\nmachines, allowing machines to operate autonomously and remotely\
    \ via the Internet [107].\n3.4. Greenhouse Production\nA greenhouse consists of\
    \ walls and a roof, which are usually made from transparent\nmaterials, such as\
    \ plastic or glass. In a greenhouse, plants are grown in a controlled\nenvironment,\
    \ including controlling for moisture, nutrient ingredients of the soil, light,\n\
    temperature, etc. Consequently, greenhouse technology makes it possible for humans\
    \ to\ngrow any plant, at any time, by providing suitable environmental conditions\

    \ of IoT in the agricultural sector still presents some \nchallenges. We have\
    \ present two main problems: economic efficiency and technical prob-\nlems. We\
    \ consider these issues coupled with policies that will drive the integration\
    \ of IoT \ntechnologies in agriculture. \nFigure 7. An illustration of IoT application\

    \ an IoT-based greenhouse environmental monitoring\nsystem for multipoint monitoring\
    \ in large greenhouses. Instead of using multiple sensors\nat different locations,\
    \ this solution involves a drive system that allows the sensor system\nto move\
    \ to different locations in the greenhouse. The experimental results show that\
    \ the\nproposed system can effectively monitor multiple points in large greenhouses.\
    \ In [110], the\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n12 of 19\nauthors introduced an energy-saving\
    \ temperature control technology for smart greenhouses.\nThis study proposed two\
    \ intelligent control methods: active disturbance rejection control\nand fuzzy\
    \ active disturbance rejection control. The experimental results demonstrate\n\
    that the proposed technology saves over 15% of the total energy consumption of\
    \ the\ngreenhouse. In [111], the authors designed an intelligent IoT system to\
    \ monitor and\ncontrol greenhouse temperature for energy efﬁciency and improve\
    \ crop productivity. The\nexperimental results for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\
    \ where daytime temperatures can be\nabove 50 ◦C, demonstrate the efﬁciency of\
    \ the proposed solution, including saving energy\nand predicting the rate of plant\
    \ growth.\nRecent studies indicated that solutions integrating IoT, big data processing,\
    \ and artiﬁ-\ncial intelligence could be applied in greenhouses to reduce labour\

    \ the greenhouse farms and the cus-\ntomer [112–115].\n4. Challenges and Open\
    \ Research Directions\nThe survey results indicate that IoT components for the\
    \ smart agriculture sector,\nincluding hardware and software, have been focused\
    \ on research and achieved many\nbreakthrough results. Several IoT solutions have\
    \ been deployed on large-scale farms/ﬁelds.\nHowever, the widespread deployment\
    \ of IoT in the agricultural sector still presents some\nchallenges. We have present\
    \ two main problems: economic efﬁciency and technical prob-\nlems. We consider\
    \ these issues coupled with policies that will drive the integration of IoT\n\
    technologies in agriculture.\n4.1. Economic Efﬁciency\nIn agricultural economics,\
    \ one of the most important characteristics is a low rate of\nproﬁt of an investment\
    \ project, which presents many risks from natural conditions. The\nbeneﬁt–cost\
    \ of a new technology seeking deployment in agriculture should be carefully\n\
    calculated to ensure a trade-off between the cost of technology implementation\
    \ and the\nproﬁt potential. Therefore, we discuss the economic aspects related\
    \ to IoT implementation\nin smart agriculture.\nThere are several types of costs\
    \ related to the implementation of IoT in agriculture.\nWe divided them into categories,\
    \ including (1) the system initialization cost and (2) the\nsystem operating cost.\
    \ The system initialization cost includes hardware purchases (IoT\ndevices, gateways,\
    \ base station infrastructure). The system operating cost includes service\nregistration\
    \ cost and the cost of labour to manage IoT devices. Furthermore, additional op-\n\
    erating costs include incurred costs from energy consumption, maintenance, data\
    \ exchange\namong IoT devices, gateways and cloud servers. According to the opinion\
    \ of Turgut and\nBoloni [116], the successful deployment of the IoT technologies\
    \ will only happen if the\ncustomer beneﬁts (customers need to know the beneﬁts\
    \ and potential) that IoT systems\nprovide exceed their physical value and privacy\
    \ costs. The businesses participating in the\nIoT domain will proﬁt and achieve\
    \ success. We can describe this process using these two\nconditions, as follows:\n\
    Success o f IoT Applications=\n\x1A Vservice > Cpri + Cuser\nh\n+ Cpay, Farmer\
    \ Bene f its\n(1)\nVin f o + Rpay > Cbusiness\nh\n, Businesses Bene f its\n(2)\n\
    where\nVservice is the expected value received by the IoT service users.\nCpri\
    \ is the cost of the loss of privacy.\nCuser\nh\nis the equipment and hardware\
    \ costs the user pays.\nCpay is the payment for the service fee.\nVin f o is the\
    \ received information value.\nRpay is the received direct payment.\nCbusiness\n\
    h\nis the share of the hardware and maintenance costs of the business.\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n13 of 19\nAccording to the opinion of the service user\
    \ (farmers or the owner of the farm),\nEquation (1) shows that the perceived value\
    \ of the service for the user (Vservice) must be\nhigher than the total of costs,\
    \ including: the cost of the loss of privacy (Cpri), the equipment\nand hardware\
    \ costs the user pays (Cuser\nh\n), and the payments for the service fee (Cpay),\
    \ while\nthe opinion of the service provider, as shown in Equation (2), shows\
    \ that the received\ninformation value (Vin f o) and the received direct payments\
    \ (Rpay) must be higher than the\nshare of the hardware and maintenance costs\
    \ of the business (Cbusiness\nh\n).\nThere is still a gap between service providers\
    \ and service users (farmers or the owner\nof the farm), leading to the slow deployment\
    \ of IoT applications in smart agriculture. In\nterms of the economic aspect,\
    \ the analyzed results show that the need for a support policy\nfrom regulatory\
    \ agencies and governments to allow service providers and service users\nto use\
    \ IoT-based smart agriculture applications in their infancy can be met. As discussed\n\
    in [117], to promote smart agriculture, the European Union has issued supportive\
    \ economic\npolicies, the so-called the European CAP (Common Agricultural Policy),\
    \ whose annual\nbudget amounts to approximately EUR 59 billion and is paid for\
    \ by the nations of the EU.\nIn our view, to be able to apply IoT in the ﬁeld\
    \ of smart agriculture, service costs\n(Cpay) and the operating and system initialization\
    \ cost of IoT (Cuser\nh\n) needs to constantly be\nimproved and optimized to reduce\
    \ the cost of the IoT services for farmers. In addition, IoT\nbusinesses (service\
    \ providers) also need to maximize the value of information obtained\n(Vin f o)\
    \ to improve the proﬁtability of the service providers.\nIn reality, service providers\
    \ may commercially exploit the information received (Vin f o)\nin the period of\
    \ providing services for farms, aiming to encourage the deployment of\nIoT applications\
    \ in smart agriculture. Nowadays, several IoT platform providers allow\nfree registration\
    \ and use of services with some limitation conditions regarding services’\nfunctionality\
    \ and ability processing; the number of connected IoT devices; and the number\n\
    of data stored while premium functions and services charge users a fee.\nIn addition,\
    \ one of the signiﬁcant factors slowing down IoT adoption in agriculture\nis farmers’\
    \ knowledge and ability to use IoT devices. In developed countries, this issue\n\
    can be easily solved due to the accessibility of new technologies of farmers.\
    \ Otherwise, in\ndeveloping countries, where the majority of farmers in rural\
    \ areas have very limited access\nto advanced technologies, this issue is a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge [118,119].\n4.2. Technical Problems\nInterference: Deploying a huge\
    \ number of IoT devices for smart agriculture can\ncause interference to different\
    \ network systems, especially some IoT networks using short\nspectrum bands such\
    \ as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, and LoRa (See Table 1). Interference can\ndegrade\
    \ system performance as well as reduce the reliability of IoT ecosystems. IoT\n\
    networks that use cognitive technology to reuse unlicensed spectra increase the\
    \ cost of the\ndevice. In our opinion, the advent of the 6G network [120] will\
    \ allow a huge number of\ndevices to connect to the Internet with an extremely\
    \ high access speed and extremely large\nbandwidth. The full interference problem\
    \ of IoT networks will be solved.\nSecurity and Privacy: One of the most important\
    \ problems of applying IoT in smart\nagriculture is the security problem, including\
    \ the protection of data and systems from\nattacks on the Internet. In regard\
    \ to system security, IoT devices’ limited capacity and\nability led to complex\
    \ encryption algorithms that are impossible to implement on IoT\ndevices. As a\
    \ result, IoT systems can be attacked using the Internet to gain system control\n\
    rights; IoT gateways are also attacked via denial of service [121–123]. In addition,\
    \ cloud\nservers can be attacked by data spooﬁng to perform unauthorized tasks\
    \ that affect the\nautonomous farming processes of farms. Cloud infrastructures\
    \ can also be controlled by\nattackers [124,125]. Several issues of detailed IoT\
    \ data privacy and security measures have\nbeen discussed in [126–128]. According\
    \ to Neshenko et al., the IoT data security issue is one\nof the biggest problems\
    \ slowing down IoT adoption in smart agriculture [129].\nRegarding data security,\
    \ the obtained information from IoT systems in farms is col-\nlected, processed,\
    \ and commercially exploited by service providers to varying degrees.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n14 of 19\nTherefore, one of the most important problems of policies\
    \ regards the validity and legal\nstatus of farm data [130]. In reality, these\
    \ data are of great value when aggregated and\nanalyzed for large-scale agricultural\
    \ activities. Consequently, without policies, the data\nprivacy and security of\
    \ farms can affect the competitive advantage of farmers/farm owners.\nIn our opinion,\
    \ using cryptography coupled with access keys is a possible solution to\nsolve\
    \ this problem. Keys could be made available based on a regional user group and\n\
    to those who contributed to the database. For further complex cases, secure multiparty\n\
    computation can be used, where the homomorphic encryption method [131,132], or\
    \ this\nmethod combined with the blockchain [133], can be applied for the purpose\
    \ of balancing\nprivacy and data utility.\nIn our opinion, the security problems\
    \ of IoT systems will be an exciting research topic\nand garner attention for\
    \ both academia and industry research. An in-depth survey of\nthreats and solutions\
    \ to improve robustness, trust, and privacy for future IoT systems is\npresented\
    \ in [134].\nReliability: Most IoT devices are expected to be deployed outdoors\
    \ (in ﬁelds and\nfarms). Harsh work environments lead to the rapid degradation\
    \ of IoT devices’ quality and\ncan lead to unexpected manufacturer failures. The\
    \ mechanical safety of IoT devices and\nsystems must be ensured so they can withstand\
    \ extremes of weather, such as temperature,\nhumidity, rainstorms, and ﬂoods [135].\
    \ In our opinion, new materials and technologies\nneed to continue to be studied\
    \ to improve the durability of devices.\nThe open problems and challenges discussed\
    \ in this section indicate that for IoT\nto be widely deployed in the smart agriculture\
    \ sector, there are still many issues to be\nsolved. Service providers need to\
    \ reduce the service costs, more effectively exploiting\nthe information collected\
    \ from the farm. On the other hand, farmers need to improve\ntheir skills to be\
    \ able to apply IoT solutions on their farm to enhance productivity and\nfarming\
    \ efﬁciency. Researchers need to continually study and propose optimal solutions\n\
    and technologies to ensure IoT systems’ privacy and security and improve the durability\
    \ of\nIoT devices. These are really major challenges and exciting research topics\
    \ in the future so\nIoT can be widely applied in the smart agriculture sector.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nIn this study, we presented an overview of IoT and big data for\
    \ the smart agriculture\nsector. Several issues related to promoting IoT deployment\
    \ in the agriculture sector have\nbeen discussed in detail. Survey results indicate\
    \ that many studies have been performed\nto apply IoT for smart agriculture, aiming\
    \ to enhance productivity, reduce human labour,\nand improve production efﬁciency.\
    \ The beneﬁts of applying IoT and big data in agriculture\nwere discussed. In\
    \ addition, we also pointed out the challenges we need to overcome\nto be able\
    \ to accelerate the deployment of IoT in smart agriculture. However, there are\n\
    still some challenges that need to be addressed for IoT solutions to be affordable\
    \ for the\nmajority of farmers, including small- and medium-scale farm owners.\
    \ In addition, security\ntechnologies need to be continuously improved, but in\
    \ our opinion, the application of\nIoT solutions for smart agriculture is inevitable\
    \ and will enhance productivity, provide\nclean and green foods, support food\
    \ traceability, reduce human labour, and improve\nproduction efﬁciency. On the\
    \ other hand, this survey also points out some interesting\nresearch directions\
    \ for security and communication technologies for IoT. We think that\nthese will\
    \ be very exciting research directions in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ have been signiﬁcantly developed and have greatly expanded\ntheir potential.\
    \ In fact, novel advancements to the Internet of things (IoT) have paved the way\
    \ for\nnew possibilities, representing a set of key enabling technologies for\
    \ smart cities and allowing the\nproduction and automation of innovative services\
    \ and advanced applications for the different city\nstakeholders. This paper presents\
    \ a review of the research literature on IoT-enabled smart cities, with\nthe aim\
    \ of highlighting the main trends and open challenges of adopting IoT technologies\
    \ for the\ndevelopment of sustainable and efﬁcient smart cities. This work ﬁrst\
    \ provides a survey on the key\ntechnologies proposed in the literature for the\
    \ implementation of IoT frameworks, and then a review\nof the main smart city\
    \ approaches and frameworks, based on classiﬁcation into eight domains, which\n\
    extends the traditional six domain classiﬁcation that is typically adopted in\
    \ most of the related works.\nKeywords: smart cities; internet of things; big\
    \ data\n1. Introduction\nThe increasing development and dissemination of Internet\
    \ of things (IoT) and Internet\nof everything (IoE) technologies represent an\
    \ important enabler in the current smart cities\nlandscape, leading the smart\
    \ city paradigm to the big data scale. In fact, as noted in [1], a\ntechnical\
    \ report by Ericson estimated that 29 billion devices would be connected by 2022.\n\
    According to the report presented by Statista Research in 2019, it has been estimated\
    \ that\nthe total number of connected IoT devices worldwide will increase to about\
    \ 75 billion by\n2025 [2], creating a potential IoT economic impact that could\
    \ reach USD 11 trillion per\nyear by 2025 [3]. These numbers are revealing that\
    \ IoT is going to be one of the highest\nvalue disruptive technologies, opening\
    \ new frontiers, possibilities and challenges in the\nproduction of smart services\
    \ and applications. The importance of IoT is more and more\nclosely connected\
    \ to the evolution of smart cities, for which IoT represents one of the key\n\
    drivers for smarter innovation and sustainable development. Smart cities are complex\
    \ socio-\ntechnical infrastructures, composed of human actors (different stakeholders\
    \ and users, such\nas citizens, city operators, administrative institutions, public\
    \ and private companies, etc.)\nand digital devices (e.g.: city sensors and actuators\
    \ exploited in many domains, such as\nmobility and transportation, environment,\
    \ energy, healthcare, governance, industry 4.0 etc.;\nsmart home and smart buildings\
    \ devices; and personal devices, such as smartphones).\nThis complexity is reﬂected\
    \ in the large variety of heterogeneous approaches, contexts,\napplication domains\
    \ and technological solutions that have been proposed in the literature\nfor the\
    \ realization and management of smart cities. The main goal of implementing and\n\
    integrating IoT solutions is to allow smart cities to advance further, providing\
    \ new capabili-\nties and features while signiﬁcantly reducing human intervention\
    \ [4]. In addition, it is also\nimportant to focus on the social challenges addressed\
    \ and the societal beneﬁts achieved by\nthe adoption of these technologies, for\
    \ instance assessing how they can contribute to the\nSustainable Development Goals\
    \ (SDGs) developed by United Nations within the context\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12,\
    \ 1607. https://doi.org/10.3390/app12031607\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n2 of 21\nof the 2030 Agenda [5]. Some of the main technical\
    \ challenges for modern IoT-enabled\nsmart cities are represented by the requirements\
    \ of supporting a multitude of different data\nproviders, dealing with many different\
    \ protocols and data formats, as well as ensuring\ninteroperability and scalability\
    \ and supporting the sharing of components. This is crucial\nin order to avoid\
    \ the implementation of redundant solutions for data ingestion, storage\nand analysis,\
    \ thus lowering operative costs and enhancing the city’s sustainability. The\n\
    motivation and contributions of the present paper are the following:\n1.\nProvide\
    \ an updated and comprehensive (although not exhaustive) overview of re-\nsearch\
    \ literature about smart city domains, solutions and frameworks, as well as about\n\
    key IoT technologies and applications integrated in smart city components.\n2.\n\
    Provide insights into recent trends, open technical and social challenges (also\
    \ assessing\nthe contribution of IoT–smart city technologies and domains toward\
    \ the SDGs) and\nfuture directions to be addressed in the implementation of IoT\
    \ in smart cities.\nIn this paper, an effort has been made to integrate IoT and\
    \ smart city solutions follow-\ning a classiﬁcation approach that focuses on the\
    \ identiﬁcation of eight applicable domains:\ngovernance; living and infrastructures;\
    \ mobility and transportation; economy; industry\nand production; energy; environment;\
    \ and healthcare. The rest of the paper is organized\nas follows. In Section 2,\
    \ a review of the main technologies employed in IoT frameworks\nis presented.\
    \ Section 3 provides a survey focused on IoT-enabled smart city domains\nand components.\
    \ Section 4 illustrates some recent trends and open challenges, and also\nassesses\
    \ the societal challenges involved and investigates potential future directions\
    \ for\nIoT-powered smart cities. Section 5 is left for the conclusions.\n2. IoT\
    \ Technologies and Architecture\nThe Internet of things has introduced an important\
    \ paradigm innovation in the com-\nmunication among digital devices, as well as\
    \ in the way that they connect with the physical\nenvironment [1] and interact\
    \ with human users. IoT architectures integrate and unify all\nsteps of data sensing/actuating\
    \ from/to devices, transmitting/receiving messages, data\nstorage, processing,\
    \ analysis and ﬁnal exploitation through the use of cloud, fog and edge\ncomputation,\
    \ services and applications. Many different technologies are involved in the\n\
    development of IoT frameworks. However, general functional architectures have\
    \ been\nproposed in the literature that are based on a simpliﬁed version of the\
    \ Open Systems\nInterconnection (OSI) model, but with different approaches. Some\
    \ works [1,6] deﬁne a\ntypical IoT framework composed of three layers (from the\
    \ lowest physical level to the\nhigher levels of abstraction): the perception/sensing\
    \ layer; the network layer; and the\napplication layer. In other works [7–12]\
    \ the former approach is expanded into ﬁve layers of\narchitecture, including:\
    \ the perception/sensing layer; the transportation/network layer;\nthe middleware/processing\
    \ layer; the application layer; and the business layer. In Figure 1,\nthe three-layer\
    \ and ﬁve-layer IoT architectures are depicted.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, x FOR PEER\

    \ \nthe functionalities and involved technologies. The five-layer architecture\
    \ was considered \nFigure 1. The most common IoT architectures (three-layer and\

    Different computing paradigms are deﬁned depending on which level of the stack\n\
    is being considered, from bottom to top: edge computing; fog computing; and cloud\n\
    computing [13]. In the following, a description of the different layers is provided\
    \ in terms\nof the functionalities and involved technologies. The ﬁve-layer architecture\
    \ was considered\nsince it can be viewed as a more detailed version of the three-layer\
    \ architecture.\n2.1. Perception/Sensing Layer\nThe perception or sensing layer\
    \ is related to the physical level that is made up of\ndevices, such as sensors\
    \ and actuators, which interact among themselves and with the\nphysical world\
    \ by sending and receiving data, exploiting wireless networks [8]. In this\ncontext,\
    \ sensors, actuators and mobile device technologies are involved. There is a wide\n\
    range of commercial devices that measure many kinds of physical quantities and\
    \ vari-\nables, i.e., sensors for measuring temperature, humidity, pressure, distance\
    \ and geospatial\ncoordinates, speed, acceleration, voltage, weight, pollutant\
    \ particles, luminance level, bio-\nmetrical signals, etc. Actuators are employed\
    \ to control/move other devices or systems\nphysically or virtually, and they\
    \ are typically classiﬁed into electrical, pneumatic and hy-\ndraulic categories\
    \ [14]. Several software tools and solutions are used to deploy low-level\nIoT\
    \ applications. Those described in the following are based on visual programming\
    \ lan-\nguages (VPLs): NetLab is an open source environment for developing embedded\
    \ systems;\nArdublock is an open source visual block programming tool for Arduino\
    \ systems; and\nScratch is a visual programming tool, developed at MIT, for IoT\
    \ code generation and\ncommunication with Arduino-based IoT products [15].\n2.2.\
    \ Transportation/Network Layer\nThe transportation or network layer provides the\
    \ function of data routing and trans-\nmission. Network gateways/brokers can be\
    \ used as mediators for integrating different\nIoT nodes, allowing them to transmit\
    \ and receive data to and from different sensors for\nM2M connectivity. Regarding\
    \ data transmission, different technologies and protocols\nare used. Proximity\
    \ communication protocols include Bluetooth, radio-frequency iden-\ntiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID) tag technology and near-ﬁeld communication (NFC). Larger coverage\nnetworks\
    \ exploit wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee, long range wide-area net-\n\
    work (LoRaWAN), Sigfox and 5G.\nBluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy [16] are low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnologies designed for personal area networks (PANs),\
    \ which are suitable for low-\nbandwidth data transmission among mobile devices\
    \ over a short range of up to 10 m. They\nare usually employed in smart contexts\
    \ for connecting personal devices.\nRFID exploits radio frequencies for data communication\
    \ and is usually used to\nuniquely identify objects, people, vehicles, etc. Communication\
    \ is established between\na reader device and a tag device, which can be passive\
    \ or active. NFC [17] is similar to\nRFID, but it has an even shorter range for\
    \ communication (up to few centimeters). Unlike\nRFID, NFC does not implement\
    \ a reader/tag hierarchy and can be used for two-way\ncommunication. It is typically\
    \ used for mobile payments and access control operations.\nWi-Fi is based on the\
    \ IEEE 802.11 standard and uses wireless frequencies (operating\nat 2.4, 5 and\
    \ 60 GHz bands) to provide high-speed internet connectivity (from 1 Mb/s to\n\
    6.75 Gb/s) within a limited distance (up to 100 m) [18]. It is designed for wireless\
    \ local area\nnetworks (WLAN).\nWiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave\
    \ Access) is based on the IEEE\n802.16 standard, operating at 2–66 GHz bands and\
    \ providing data rates from 1.5 Mb/s to\n1 Gb/s [18]. It can support broadband\
    \ wireless access for up to 50 km for ﬁxed stations and\nbetween 5–15 km for mobile\
    \ stations [19].\nZigbee is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. It is a low-power\
    \ and low cost protocol\nfor wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It usually supports\
    \ star, tree and mesh network\ntopologies. The Zigbee protocol operates at 2.4\
    \ GHz and provides a data rate of about\n250 kbit/s [20]. The data transmission\
    \ range is similar to that of Wi-Fi (from 10 to 100 m).\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12,\
    \ 1607\n4 of 21\nLoRaWAN is a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) that is capable\
    \ of transmit-\nting over long ranges (about 10 km) and also supports multitenancy\
    \ and multi-domain\nnetworks [14]. It consists of several gateways that can be\
    \ added when the network size\nincreases and a higher capacity is required.\n\
    Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is an LPWAN protocol that operates on LTE licensed\nfrequency\
    \ bands, with a data rate of about 200 Kb/s [3]. The bandwidth of NB-IoT is about\n\
    180 KHz, and this protocol allows the connection of the order of hundreds of thousands\
    \ of\ndevices [21]. The NB-IoT technology also optimizes energy consumption, providing\
    \ power\ncontrol and power saving modalities [22].\nLTE-M is another LPWAN protocol,\
    \ operating at a 1.4 MHz bandwidth [23]. It was\nintroduced with the aim of supporting\
    \ a massive number of devices, providing 10 year bat-\ntery life support [24]\
    \ and supporting data rates of up to 1 Mbit/s, which is enough to satisfy\nthe\
    \ higher data rate requirements for devices such as video cameras and wearables\
    \ [25].\nThe features supported in LTE-M include handover management, extended\
    \ discontinuous\nreception and the suspension/resumption of radio resource control\
    \ connection.\nZ-Wave is a low-power protocol typically used in wireless home\
    \ area networks,\noperating at 868 MHz and 900 MHz frequencies [7]. Z-Wave devices\
    \ cannot directly\nconnect to the Internet or other mobile devices. Therefore,\
    \ the Z-Wave network is based on\nthe use of a controller, which acts as a gateway,\
    \ in order to manage all connected devices\nand allow them to interact with other\
    \ mobile devices via the Internet or local networks [26].\nSigfox is a narrowband\
    \ communication system for transmitting data over long ranges\n(up to 40 km [27]).\
    \ Although it employs narrowband signals, Sigfox can be suitable for\nmany kinds\
    \ of applications, such as geolocation services and control messages.\nFinally,\
    \ 5G is the ﬁfth generation of cellular networks. It is a very low-latency (less\n\
    than 1 ms) and high-bandwidth (10 Gb/s) protocol [28], making it a strong enabler\
    \ for\nsmart cities and allowing the interconnectivity of a large number of IoT\
    \ devices, as well as\nbeing suitable for real-time processing.\nThe last part\
    \ of the network layer stack is in charge of suitably formatting data for\ntheir\
    \ presentation. The client/server architecture, represented by the subscription\
    \ mecha-\nnism between IoT devices and brokers, presents different modalities\
    \ for sending/receiving\nmessages/data, i.e., push and pull. Typically, pull protocols\
    \ are REST call, web services,\nFTP and HTTP/HTTPS. On the other hand, the most\
    \ common push protocols to receive\ndata via data-driven subscriptions are: WebSocket\
    \ (WS), Constrained Application Proto-\ncol (CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing\nProtocol (AMQP) and FIWARE NGSI and NGSI-V2\
    \ [29]. Furthermore, in order to allow\ndata exchange among multiple devices and\
    \ applications, distributed publish–subscribe\nmessaging systems should be supported\
    \ (such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Orion Broker\nof FIWARE) for handling multiple\
    \ data streams in an efﬁcient and scalable way [13]. In this\ncontext, in order\
    \ to increase fault tolerance when handling data that should not be lost in\n\
    case of failure, the data persistence of queues is an important feature (e.g.,\
    \ Apache Kafka).\n2.3. Middleware/Processing Layer\nThe middleware or processing\
    \ layer can serve many different functionalities. For\ninstance, it can act as\
    \ a data aggregator module, since data may be collected from hetero-\ngeneous\
    \ devices with different protocols that may not have been originally designed\
    \ to\ncommunicate and interact with each other. Therefore, the middleware layer\
    \ has to enable\ninteroperability among connected devices, performing the necessary\
    \ programming and/or\nmodel abstractions. Interoperability should be ensured at\
    \ different levels:\n•\nTechnical level [30], in order to efﬁciently achieve and\
    \ ensure end-to-end connectivity\namong devices, gateways, brokers, servers, etc.;\n\
    •\nSyntactical level, for managing the variety of protocols and formats;\n•\n\
    Semantic level, for exploiting Semantic Web technologies, such as XML, RDF, OWL\n\
    Ontology and linked data (LD), to achieve unambiguous data representation and\
    \ data\nsemantic enrichment, thus improving the expressiveness level of the system\
    \ [31].\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n5 of 21\nIoT middleware is also typically\
    \ devoted to providing scalability and reliability, allow-\ning the system to\
    \ handle a growing number of IoT connections and communication loads at\nthe big\
    \ data scale as well as supplying stable and fault-tolerant services. Moreover,\
    \ in order\nto enable data processing over IoT, database-level data persistence\
    \ is needed to integrate\nthe data coming with different protocols in a shared\
    \ model, and this is performed in the\nmiddleware layer. Therefore, middleware\
    \ includes the different data storage modalities\nand eventually covers other\
    \ functionalities, such as context identiﬁcation, information\nextraction and\
    \ the reconciliation of collected data. For example, FIWARE provides different\n\
    generic enablers (Cygnus, QuantumLeap, STH-Comet) to store data coming from the\
    \ Orion\nContext Broker.\n2.4. Application Layer\nThe application layer provides\
    \ the output formats, applications and services requested\nby the ﬁnal users.\
    \ Usually, works in the literature that are based on the three-layer IoT\narchitecture\
    \ include the messaging protocols management in this layer, as described in the\n\
    network layer at the end of Section 2.2.\nThe growing dissemination of IoT devices\
    \ and systems has led to the increasing\nadoption of event-driven applications\
    \ (exploiting push protocols). This is a signiﬁcant\nparadigm shift from the older\
    \ generation of smart city applications that relied on vertical\napplications\
    \ and were often based on extract, transform, load/extract, load, transform\n\
    (ETL/ELT) processes and languages, which usually only support pull protocols.\
    \ On the\nother hand, different frameworks and ecosystems are used to design and\
    \ implement event-\ndriven IoT application, for example VPL tools [32]. One of\
    \ the most used is Node-RED,\nwhich is based on the Node.js engine and allows\
    \ the creation of application ﬂows in a\ngraphic environment through the composition\
    \ of visual nodes or blocks [33].\n2.5. Business Layer\nThe business layer was\
    \ introduced to classify all operations and front-end tools that\nconsume data\
    \ from the application layer for producing advanced big data analytics and\nvisualization\
    \ services, with the goal of building business models, supporting decision-\n\
    making processes and performing simulations and what-if analysis. This can be\
    \ achieved\nby implementing, for instance, predictive models based on machine\
    \ learning, deep learn-\ning and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) techniques [34],\
    \ as well as advanced and interactive\nvisual analysis tools [35]. Moreover, the\
    \ business layer includes all operations performed\nby system administrators,\
    \ which are needed to assess, control and maintain the overall\nfunctionality\
    \ of the platform/framework.\nIoT security aspects deserve a separate and speciﬁc\
    \ discussion. In fact, security\nrequirements and related issues have to be addressed\
    \ along the full IoT stack, including\nall functional architecture layers, from\
    \ the authentication of personal devices with IoT\nbrokers and ensuring secure\
    \ communication and secure encrypted storage for private data\nto the authentication\
    \ mechanisms for accessing and using IoT applications, data analytics\nand data\
    \ visualization tools. All of these requirements have to follow and cope with\
    \ strict\nregulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) standard\
    \ [36].\n3. Review of IoT-Enabled Smart City Components and Solutions\nThere is\
    \ a wide range of research literature regarding IoT application in smart city\n\
    contexts. A search of the Web of Science (WoS) database for papers containing\
    \ the key-\nwords “smart city” OR “smart cities” AND “IoT” OR “Internet of things”\
    \ in their topic\n(i.e., the union of the “title”, “abstract” and “keywords” search\
    \ ﬁelds) resulted in a total\nof 5285 articles, published from 2010 to 2021, which\
    \ is a very large number of resources to\nbe extensively and systematically reviewed,\
    \ or even to be ﬁltered in a supervised way to\nselect and consider the most relevant\
    \ papers. In order to provide an overview of the grow-\ning interest around these\
    \ topics, the temporal evolution of the above-mentioned papers\n(grouped by year\
    \ of publication) is reported in Figure 2. It is to be noted that the apparent\n\

    \ on reviews and surveys as a starting point for our study. \nTherefore, the literature\

    \ one of the following fields: title; abstract; and paper keywords. Subsequently,\
    \ \na supervised overview and filter was performed in order to assure that each\
    \ paper \ntopic actually fit the subject of this review; \nFigure 2. The temporal\

    \ Subsequently,\na supervised overview and ﬁlter was performed in order to assure\
    \ that each paper\ntopic actually ﬁt the subject of this review;\n2.\nRecent literature\
    \ was the main object of the present review, i.e., papers published from\n2018\
    \ to the present (2021) were selected from the initial search;\n3.\nPapers from\
    \ Q1 and Q2 journals (as ranked in the SCImago index) were given priority\nover\
    \ those from Q3 and Q4.\nFollowing these criteria, a total of 52 surveys and reviews\
    \ on IoT-enabled smart cities\nwere considered as the baseline for the survey\
    \ presented in this paper. It is to be noted\nthat most of the 52 surveys reviewed\
    \ often aimed to review one or some speciﬁc IoT–smart\ncity domains and use cases\
    \ without providing a more general or comprehensive overview,\nwhich is one of\
    \ the aims of this paper. In addition, in our opinion, the few general surveys\n\
    that were retrieved lacked in addressing the relationships between each smart\
    \ city domain\n(with related sub-domains and scenarios) with the related IoT technologies\
    \ that have been\nemployed in each speciﬁc context.\nIn order to describe the\
    \ wide landscape that we found by reviewing the selected\nliterature in the most\
    \ comprehensive way, the following eight domains were identiﬁed\n(as depicted\
    \ in Figure 3), which are typically used to classify smart city components and\n\
    application areas: governance; living and infrastructures; mobility and transportation;\n\
    economy; industry and production; energy; environment; and healthcare. This approach\n\
    extends the six-domain classiﬁcation presented in [1,37]. The classiﬁcation proposed\
    \ in this\npaper is not meant to be exhaustive and, in some cases, these domains\
    \ may not necessarily\nbe orthogonal as they may overlap in several contexts and\
    \ applications.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n7 of 21\nerature in the most comprehensive\
    \ way, the following eight domains were identified (as \ndepicted in Figure 3),\

    \ related components and application areas. \nIn the next subsections, each of\
    \ the above identified smart city domains is discussed \nin terms of general scenarios,\
    \ features and services provided, the IoT technologies em-\nployed, the frameworks\
    \ or solutions adopted and real-world case studies of smart cities \nimplementing\
    \ solutions for that specific domain. \n3.1. Smart Governance \nSmart governance\

    trative procedures through a smarter collaboration among different stakeholders\
    \ and so-\ncial actors [38], including public administrations, city officers,\
    \ private companies and cit-\nizens. This can be successfully accomplished by\
    \ providing innovative city services, dedi-\ncated channels and network integration\
    \ for citizens. For instance, citizens can be engaged \nin participating with\
    \ city governance activities and decisional processes through ICT-\nbased tools\
    \ and social media [39] as evidence of the mobile crowdsourcing paradigm [40],\

    \ through a smarter collaboration among different stakeholders and social\nactors\
    \ [38], including public administrations, city ofﬁcers, private companies and\
    \ citizens.\nThis can be successfully accomplished by providing innovative city\
    \ services, dedicated\nchannels and network integration for citizens. For instance,\
    \ citizens can be engaged in par-\nticipating with city governance activities\
    \ and decisional processes through ICT-based tools\nand social media [39] as evidence\
    \ of the mobile crowdsourcing paradigm [40], according to\nwhich citizens can\
    \ act as “users as sensors” with their smartphones and mobile devices,\nparticipating\
    \ as individuals and in groups in the acquisition process of data of interest\
    \ for\nsmart communities.\nIoT technologies are transforming traditional city\
    \ governance transactions and pro-\ncesses into smart government resources on\
    \ the basis of the different participating ac-\ntors, i.e., government-to-citizen\
    \ (G2C), government-to-business (G2B) and government-to-\ngovernment (G2G) [41,42]:\n\
    •\nGovernment-to-citizen (G2C) refers to the set of software solutions (typically\
    \ web\nand mobile based) that support the relationships between public administrations\
    \ and\ncitizens, such as public administration web portals and/or mobile applications\
    \ and\nsocial media channels employed for communication and interaction between\
    \ local\ngovernments and citizens. In addition, IoT technologies, such as RFID\
    \ and biometric\nsensors, are widely and increasingly adopted in electronic ID\
    \ cards and mobile devices\nfor identity recognition, electronic authentication\
    \ and signature, according to different\ngovernmental standards, such as the European\
    \ Community’s electronic IDentiﬁcation,\nAuthentication and trust Services (eIDAS)\
    \ [43]. These features are typically required\nto access services that are provided\
    \ by public administrations and consult citizens’ per-\nsonal data related to\
    \ public services, etc., thus simplifying a lot of the communication\nand interaction\
    \ between governmental authorities and citizens;\n•\nGovernment-to-business (G2B)\
    \ regards the interactions between public administra-\ntions and businesses companies.\
    \ In this model, e-procurement solutions are adopted,\ni.e., digital tools (mainly\

    \ are widely adopted in G2B\nactivities, facilitating and enhancing the relationship\
    \ between local governments and\ncompanies that provide public and private services\
    \ to citizens. For instance, trans-\nportation companies use location-based sensors\
    \ (usually exploiting GPS technology)\nand services, sharing them with local administrations\
    \ and allowing the easier and\nmore efﬁcient urban planning for mobility and transportation\
    \ [44]. In addition, it\nincludes similar aspects involved in many other domains\
    \ that provide public and\nfundamental services, such as waste management, water,\
    \ energy, etc. To this end,\nthe use of cloud computing is generally adopted to\
    \ store and share data and results\namong the different stakeholders (city operators,\
    \ companies and citizens);\n•\nGovernment-to-government (G2G) is related to the\
    \ software solutions that aim to\nimprove communications between the different\
    \ public administration entities and\ngroups, thereby speeding up all processes\
    \ that require the interaction of these actors.\nThis implies the use of IoT technologies\
    \ for data collection, storage and sharing, which\nexploits, for instance, cloud\
    \ computing and web/mobile-based services. A report of\nthe European JRC also\
    \ observed that governments may beneﬁt from the combination\nof various data sources\
    \ (e.g., from IoT and the web) with suitable analytical techniques\n(including\
    \ AI-based techniques) to better identify and design speciﬁc administrative\n\
    policies [45].\nIn Barcelona, ICT has represented a key driver for the evolution\
    \ of the city model,\nbased on ﬂexible and efﬁcient e-government initiatives and\
    \ services that aim to make\nthe city more innovative, inclusive and self-sufﬁcient\
    \ [46]. In the early 2000s, the city of\nBarcelona started implementing the 22@Barcelona\
    \ Project to enhance the technological,\nsocio-economical and sustainable impact\
    \ of the region in order to improve citizens’ quality\nof life (QoL) [47]. In\
    \ Amsterdam, a consortium consisting of the municipalities, research\ncenters\
    \ and private companies of the metropolitan area developed and launched the\n\
    Amsterdam Smart City Platform (ASCP) in 2014: an online board where the aforementioned\n\
    stakeholders can discuss urban issues, propose solutions and foster city innovation\
    \ [48]. The\nlocal government in Rio de Janeiro has promoted city data sharing\
    \ initiatives, hosting them\nin the so-called Intelligent Operations Centre (IOC)\
    \ premises with the aim of increasing\nthe efﬁciency of city services [49]. Moreover,\
    \ the Rio Agora social platform has been\nimplemented to allow citizens to propose\
    \ and discuss public policies with municipal\nauthorities [3]. Singapore has adopted\
    \ several smart governance projects through the\nSmart Nation and Digital Governance\
    \ Group (SNDGG) [50], including a digital identity\nsystem for Singapore residents\
    \ that allows them to perform easier transactions with public\nadministration\
    \ and the Core Operations Development and eXchange (CODEX), which\nis a digital\
    \ platform delivering smart services to citizens. In Toronto, the Sidewalk Labs\n\
    smart city project was proposed. The project promotes data sharing standards and\
    \ data\ngovernance models to proﬁtably exploit the data gathered from citizens\
    \ [51] through the\nurban data trust model. This allows for the collection, management\
    \ and aggregation of\nurban non-personal data, de-identiﬁed data and personal\
    \ information (according to data\nprivacy regulations and laws) and then extracts\
    \ value from them [52]. Songdo in South\nKorea is considered one of most advanced\
    \ large-scale greenﬁeld-based smart city projects\nin the world [53]. In fact,\
    \ Songdo is deﬁned as a ubiquitous U-city, in which data are\ncontinuously collected\
    \ through a capillary network of sensors and equipment. Data are\nshared and interconnected\
    \ with information from public institutions, such as the Incheon\nCity Trafﬁc\
    \ Information Center, the Korean Meteorological Administration, the Institute\n\
    of Health and Environment, Police Agency, etc. Data are analyzed by the U-Integrated\n\
    Operation Center and provided to citizens through media broadcasts and control\
    \ servers\nin order to help them to ﬁnd the necessary information [54].\nAppl.\

    \ living domain includes all components related to developing smarter city\ninfrastructures\
    \ (e.g., smart homes, smart buildings, etc.) as well the management and\nimprovement\
    \ of public services, such as cultural activities, tourism and education, which\n\
    are involved in enhancing the general quality of life of citizens:\n•\nSmart Buildings:\
    \ IoT allows the rapidly growing implementation of many kinds of\nfacilities for\
    \ smart buildings, for instance, air conditioning management, rainwater\ndrainage,\
    \ security systems for managing authenticated access to buildings, video\nsurveillance\
    \ and human activity monitoring [55], alerts for events such as ﬁres and gas\n\
    leaks, tools for monitoring the structural integrity of buildings [56], etc. Many\
    \ different\nIoT technologies are involved in the living and infrastructures domain,\
    \ depending on\nthe speciﬁc use case or scenario. As for smart buildings, IoT\
    \ integration with Building\nInformation Modeling (BIM) tools provides a high-ﬁdelity\
    \ representation of buildings\nand spatial properties as a set of virtual assets\
    \ [57], i.e., a digital twin of the building;\n•\nSmart Homes: In these environments,\
    \ different kinds of sensors, actuators and per-\nsonal devices are connected\
    \ through wireless networks and are often powered by\nhuman–machine interfaces\
    \ that are based on artiﬁcial intelligence to provide smart\nand automated services\
    \ for the users, with the goal of assisting them in daily tasks,\nsuch as lighting\
    \ control, surveillance, managing home appliances and home resources,\nenergy\
    \ consumption, etc. [58]. In addition, smart home applications can be useful to\n\
    detect and track the actions of the house’s residents in order to monitor their\
    \ health\nconditions [12], thereby especially helping the elderly and disabled\
    \ people. Several\nkinds of sensors are applied to smart home and indoor sensing\
    \ contexts. For in-\nstance, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are employed\
    \ for the detection of gas\nleaks [59]. Devices based on triboelectric nanogenerators\
    \ (TENG) are used for smart\nwindows [60] and smart indoor lighting systems [61].\
    \ Video cameras and Closed-\ncircuit television (CCTV) systems are used for smart\
    \ surveillance. Digital humidity\nand temperature (DHT) sensors are largely adopted\
    \ in ﬁre alerting systems [62]. The\nmost recent generation of domestic appliances\
    \ and entertainment devices is often\npowered by AI and assistive services, so\
    \ that they can interact while interconnected\nthrough wireless networks (the\
    \ most used network communication protocols are\nBluetooth, Zigbee, infrared and\
    \ Wi-Fi [63]), thus providing users with a better, more\nefﬁcient and enjoyable\
    \ home life and experience;\n•\nSmart Living Services: IoT devices have a large\
    \ application in a variety of areas and\nactivities that contribute toward improving\
    \ the general quality of life for smart citizens.\nCultural activities, for instance,\
    \ smart tourism management, are taking advantage of\nexploiting mobile applications,\
    \ GIS-aware and location-based services, multimedia\nstreams, virtual and augmented\
    \ reality and social media to manage and offer a better\nexperience for tourism\
    \ stakeholders [64]. Examples of these applications include\ntourist experience\
    \ enhancement, destination competitiveness and sustainability im-\nprovement by\
    \ tracking users’ ﬂows and behaviors [65]. Education is experiencing an\nincreasing\
    \ decentralization process with the inclusion of ICT and IoT elements, and\nthis\
    \ allows the production of new education services that can enhance interaction\
    \ in\nremote and real-world learning activities [66].\nNumerous smart living and\
    \ infrastructures applications can be found in real-world\ncases. In [67], it\
    \ is reported that 840 million units of smart home products were supplied in\n\
    China in 2019. Los Angeles has implemented smart strategies for tourism management.\n\
    Tourist trafﬁc is measured through sensors embedded in the pavements and this\
    \ informa-\ntion is used to adjust site visitor lights [68]. In Dubai, tourists\
    \ can discover places of interest\nand events by exploiting NFC tags from their\
    \ personal devices. There are many dedi-\ncated mobile apps that take advantage\
    \ of cloud computing and allow visitors to connect\nseamlessly, without the need\
    \ to download the app [69].\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n10 of 21\n3.3. Smart Mobility\
    \ and Transportation\nThe smart mobility and transportation concept implies the\
    \ shift from traditional\ntransportation systems to Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS),\
    \ where a smart IoT infrastructure\nconnects different actors (citizens, public\
    \ administrations, private companies) and entities\n(vehicles, personal devices,\
    \ city sensors, actuators, etc.) [70]. IoT and intelligent transporta-\ntion systems\
    \ (ITSs) [71] allow the provision of smart applications and services to manage,\n\
    for instance, private and public trafﬁc ﬂows, dynamic trafﬁc routing, smart parking,\
    \ vehicle\nsharing and sustainable mobility, connected driving, etc. Intelligent\
    \ trafﬁc solutions often\nrely on the application of predictive models for early\
    \ warnings, accident prevention and\nreal-time trafﬁc congestion management.\n\
    In this context, many IoT network technologies have been proposed and used. City\n\
    sensors and actuators (e.g., for the management of trafﬁc lights, digital signage,\
    \ road\nbarriers, etc.), location-based GPS services and mobile-to-mobile communication\
    \ are the\nbasis for the implementation of vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V)\
    \ and vehicle-to-\ninfrastructure communication (V2I). Additionally, 5G networks\
    \ and LTE-based systems\nhave been employed for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services\
    \ [72]. Vehicular ad hoc net-\nworks (VANETs) [73] have been designed to handle\
    \ a large number of nodes (including\nvehicles, roadside units (RSU) and on-board\
    \ units (OBU) [74]) and present a good adapt-\nability to the frequent topology\
    \ changes and the data exchange rate [75]. The adoption of\nITSs is at the basis\
    \ of smart parking and car sharing [76] services. The most disseminated\ndevices\
    \ are RFID tags, infrared and ultrasonic sensors, smartphone-based sensors, video\n\
    cameras for smart parking [77] and on-board diagnostic systems (OBD tools) [78].\n\
    In Berlin, the smart mobility service Jelbi was introduced in 2019, based on a\
    \ mobile\napplication that is connected to all services provided locally (e.g.,\
    \ car-sharing companies\nsuch as MILES and DB Flinkster and e-vehicle hire companies\
    \ such as TIER), to foster the\npassage toward a more sustainable mobility [79].\
    \ In Florence, the Snap4City platform has\nbeen developed in the context of the\
    \ Sii-Mobility project for sustainable mobility, providing\na ﬂexible IoT smart\
    \ city platform and several applications to manage heterogeneous and\ncomplex\
    \ urban mobility scenarios by integrating city sensors/actuators and IoT/IoE [34].\n\
    Atlanta has powered its transportation infrastructure with many smart technologies.\
    \ For\ninstance, a system of adaptive trafﬁc signals that adjust to trafﬁc conditions\
    \ in real time\nare installed on the North Avenue Smart Corridor (a critical longitudinal\
    \ communication\nroadway) [3]. London has a cycle rental system, currently offering\
    \ more than 11,500 bikes\nand over 750 docking stations. As for car-sharing solutions,\
    \ London has six active operators\nin the city, covering the whole Greater London\
    \ area [80]. In addition, London’s public\ntransportation system provides the\
    \ use of Oyster cards, which are smart electronic cards\nthat exploit RFID technology\
    \ and can be used for paying and buying electronic tickets for\npublic transportation,\
    \ thereby reducing queues and eventually tracking users’ ﬂows. In\nSantander,\
    \ smart mobility services are applied to the management of public transportation,\n\
    outdoor parking management and trafﬁc routing [81]. The city of Bilbao has enhanced\
    \ the\nsustainability of local mobility by deploying a network of e-bikes with\
    \ 40 pick-up points\nand e-buses that are supported by mobile applications: GeoBilbao\
    \ (reporting real-time\ninformation about parking and trafﬁc status) and iBilbobus\
    \ (information about bus stops\nand schedules) [66]. In Seoul, the Gangnam ubiquitous\
    \ district has a centralized control\nframework, including the Transport Operation\
    \ and Information Service (TOPIS) app and\nthe “Owl Bus”, which is an innovative\
    \ bus service performing analytics on the big data\nthat is collected on-board\
    \ [82].\n3.4. Smart Economy\nA smart economy is based on the innovative interconnection\
    \ of local and global mar-\nkets through ICT, providing e-business and e-commerce\
    \ services to increase productivity\nand delivery [83]. In addition, the concept\
    \ of a sharing economy is also included in this\ndomain, where individuals or\
    \ private companies offer services exploiting their own assets\nas well as through\
    \ peer-to-peer marketplaces. There are also peer-to-peer labor services,\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n11 of 21\nin which citizens and stakeholders offer their\
    \ work and experience for speciﬁc tasks [84].\nArtiﬁcial intelligence and machine\
    \ learning techniques have been implemented for building\npredictive models and\
    \ improving recommendation systems for e-commerce and retail shop-\nping [85].\
    \ The use of NFC and wireless sensor technologies has facilitated payment and\n\
    transaction processes. In Shenzen, the use of mobiles and smartphones in daily\
    \ transactions\nand information access is making cash and bankcards obsolete [86].\n\
    3.5. Smart Industry and Production\nSmart industry and industry 4.0 deﬁne a transformation\
    \ process in which IoT tech-\nnologies, cyber-physical systems (CPS), M2M communication\
    \ systems and cloud-based\nmanufacturing [87] allow an innovative and less human-dependent\
    \ productive environ-\nment [88]. Regarding the automation of goods supply chains,\
    \ they can be easily tracked\nfrom the manufacturing process to ﬁnal distribution\
    \ using sensor technologies, such as\nRFID and NFC. Real-time information can\
    \ be collected and analyzed for shipment tracking,\nas well as for the assessment\
    \ of the quality and usability of products [14]. The smart indus-\ntry and production\
    \ domain includes all ﬁelds in which ICT leads to the automatization\nof the productive\
    \ workﬂow, therefore also includes smart agriculture and farming, which\naddresses\
    \ the challenge of sustainable food production. Smart agriculture systems often\n\
    employ IoT devices to improve irrigation efﬁciency [89] and AI solutions are often\
    \ deployed\nin IoT for agriculture, e.g., for crop monitoring, disease detection\
    \ and data-driven crop\nsupply management [7].\nDublin Airport has employed smart\
    \ industry 4.0 solutions to replace its baggage-\nhandling systems in Terminal\
    \ 2 [90]. In Shenzen, a smart industrial complex includes a\nseries of smart factories\
    \ that share technologies and provide efﬁcient services (exploiting\nan ultra-high-speed\
    \ Internet connection, next-generation wireless network, free Wi-Fi\ninfrastructures\
    \ and IoT devices connected via a common cloud platform) [3].\n3.6. Smart Energy\n\
    Smart energy systems involve the intelligent integration of decentralized renewable\n\
    and sustainable energy sources and their efﬁcient distribution [91] and aim to\
    \ optimize\npower consumption [92]. Smart grids take advantage of ICT and IoT\
    \ technologies for\nthe better management of power generation and distribution,\
    \ exploiting, for instance,\nprediction models (developed from collected consumption\
    \ data) and often ensuring the\nself-healing of the energy network supply [93].\
    \ Smart grids help energy load balancing\non the basis of usage and availability.\
    \ In this way, it is possible to switch automatically to\nalternative sources\
    \ of energy, as well as predicting future energy demand and estimating\nthe power\
    \ availability and price [14].\nNew generations of smart energy IoT devices have\
    \ been designed for alternative\nenergy harvesting, such as triboelectric nanogenerators\
    \ (TENG) and electrostatic energy\nharvesters (EEH) [59]. A multiplicity of IoT\
    \ sensors is involved in the smart energy context,\nsuch as light dependent resistors\
    \ (LDRs), sensors for measuring light luminosity [94] and\nthe consumption of\
    \ solar radiation and electricity [95].\nNice, France, has made efforts to improve\
    \ smart energy management by scheduling\nelectricity consumption in residential\
    \ and business locations. The smart grid in Nice\nwas created through a smart\
    \ solar neighborhood in city areas by supplying and storing\ndistributed electricity\
    \ [58]. The city of Padova has performed several initiatives in intelligent\n\
    energy management, such as a smart lighting system in which each smart light device\
    \ is\ngeolocated in the city and is powered by photometer sensors that monitor\
    \ the intensity\nof the light emitted by the lamps and check that the correct\
    \ operation of the bulbs is\nperformed [96]. Atlanta has implemented a smart neighborhood\
    \ project to reduce the\nHome Energy Rating System (HERS) score. Energy optimization\
    \ platforms manage home\nappliances, switching to solar power and batteries if\
    \ available [3]. In Helsinki, smart grids\nhelp to reduce energy usage by 15%\
    \ [97]. The Masdar City project aimed to be one of\nthe most efﬁcient and environment-friendly\
    \ systems in the UAE by exploiting renewable\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n12 of\
    \ 21\nenergy technologies. The city has planned a solar power array and rooftop\
    \ solar panels that\ncan provide more than 10 MW. This, combined with wind energy\
    \ harvesting technologies,\ncan supply energy for a target population of about\
    \ 40,000 citizens [98].\n3.7. Smart Environment\nThe smart environment domain\
    \ includes environmental data collection, monitoring\nand analysis for pollution\
    \ reduction, water quality and supply monitoring and weather\nand climate events\
    \ management [67]. In this regard, air quality monitoring is a crucial\nfactor\
    \ for tracking levels of air pollutants (e.g., NOx, O3, CO2, N2O, PM10, PM2.5,\
    \ etc.),\nwhich represent a serious issue for human health (caused by transportation,\
    \ heating and\nindustrial emissions). Smart waste management is also included\
    \ in this area since it has\nnumerous impacts on the environment. Control policies\
    \ for waste production are handled\nwith smart waste bins that are installed with\
    \ sensors and are capable of providing the\nreal-time analysis of the capacity\
    \ that is currently available [92].\nAs for smart water, sensing devices that\
    \ are devoted to the assessment of water\nquantity and quality typically measure\
    \ parameters such as pH, conductivity, turbidity, total\ndissolved solids, etc.\
    \ [99]. Electromagnetic and ultrasonic sensors are employed to measure\nthe pressure\
    \ for water consumption rate analysis [100]. The application of WSNs for water\n\
    quantity and quality monitoring systems has opened up a new generation of smart\
    \ water\nmonitoring systems, providing a more advanced context awareness and near\
    \ real-time\ninteraction [101].\nSmart environment applications and services are\
    \ typically based on ambient and\nchemical sensors, which are used to measure\
    \ physical quantities expressing environmental\nparameters and conditions, such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, pressure [7] and different kinds\nof pollutants. Smart\
    \ sensing and visualization technologies (satellites, LiDAR) are applied\nto greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions (GHG) and land usage [99]. Location-based services and GIS\ndata\
    \ are also employed.\nIn Singapore, solid waste is managed by the Integrated Waste\
    \ Management Facility\n(IWMF), which includes innovative IoT technology that allows\
    \ for an increase in the process\nefﬁciency and a reduction in GHG emissions [102].\
    \ In Amsterdam, the Green City Watch is\na geo-spatial AI platform that monitors\
    \ urban green infrastructures in near real time using\nAI algorithms and satellite\
    \ images [103]. In Stockholm, solar-powered smart waste bins are\ninstalled, which\
    \ automatically report when they are fully charged and also perform waste\npackaging\
    \ [66]. The Busan smart city, South Korea, employs smart water management\nsystems\
    \ in the whole urban water cycle [3]. In the context of the European TRAFAIR\n\
    project, six European cities (Florence, Pisa, Livorno and Modena in Italy and\
    \ Santiago de\nCompostela and Zaragoza in Spain) have adopted the Snap4City platform\
    \ for monitoring\nurban air quality (using sensors that collect data in the six\
    \ cities) and providing urban air\nquality predictions using simulation models\
    \ [104].\n3.8. Smart Healthcare\nIoT technologies and ubiquitous computing have\
    \ been widely applied to mobile\nhealthcare for remote monitoring, telemedicine\
    \ and telenursing, adverse drugs reactions,\ncommunity healthcare, etc., and these\
    \ aspects are even more relevant in this recent period\nof the COVID-19 pandemic.\
    \ Remote patient monitoring (RPM) can be performed through\nthe use of wearable\
    \ or implanted devices (e.g., cardiac devices, airﬂow monitors, blood glu-\ncometers,\
    \ etc.) that are connected in the cloud using WSN technologies [20]. This has\
    \ led to\nthe development of body sensor networks (BSNs) or wireless body area\
    \ networks (WBANs),\nin which the integration of multiple heterogeneous data sources\
    \ allows the acquisition of\nthe biometric and physiological data of the patients\
    \ for IoT healthcare applications [105].\nSmart hospitals also rely on IoT technologies\
    \ to provide services for medical staff and pa-\ntients (the identiﬁcation and\
    \ monitoring of patients in hospitals and the smart management\nof medical instruments\
    \ supporting decision-making processes in hospitals) [106]. All of\nthese application\
    \ ﬁelds and the related requirements impose well-deﬁned standards, such\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n13 of 21\nas Health Level Seven (HL7), PACS-DICOM in biomedical\
    \ image processing [107], etc.\nRecent advances propose the use of AI techniques\
    \ to deﬁne innovative applications, e.g.,\nmachine learning prognostics and the\
    \ measurement of biometric parameters or symptoms\nfrom multimedia (using mobile\
    \ videos or voice messages, through deep learning- and\nspeech recognition-based\
    \ methods) [108] and disease prediction and prevention [109].\nSingapore has developed\
    \ the HealthHub platform, which integrates personal health\nrecord management\
    \ and the clinical data of patients and citizens [3]. In Stockholm, the\nNew Karolinska\
    \ Solna Hospital integrated smart energy and BIM technologies to provide\nuser-focused\
    \ services (for patients, visitors and medical staff) [110]. The hospital of Hefei,\n\
    China, is one of the ﬁrst of China’s smart hospitals [111] where all aspects of\
    \ the patients\nare managed via IoT and connected healthcare, also providing smart\
    \ building services\nand sustainable energy management. The Helsinki University\
    \ Hospital has implemented\na real-time locating system (RTLS) to collect and\
    \ share anonymized location data about\non-site movements for proximity tracing\
    \ during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, cloud\nservices are provided to enable\
    \ doctors and nurses to remotely interact with COVID-19\npatients [112].\nTo conclude\
    \ the review, Table 1 presents an integrated summary of the smart city\ndomains\
    \ that were presented in this section, in terms of supported services and features,\n\
    real-world case studies and the IoT technologies employed.\nTable 1. A summary\

    \ Future Directions\nIoT smart city technologies and applications are spreading\
    \ rapidly, and this is reported\nin more and more real-world cases. However, on\
    \ the basis of the analysis and review\nperformed in the previous sections, this\
    \ integration process is not complete since it is still\nfacing some open challenges,\
    \ which may be resolved in future developments.\nFor instance, there are interoperability\
    \ problems due to the presence of many different\nIoT protocols, formats and frameworks\
    \ [3,29,92,105,113], and this aspect is enhanced\nby the fact that many smart\
    \ city applications have been initially developed as vertical\nsilos applications\
    \ [3,18] with each of them using its own solutions for data ingestion,\nstorage\
    \ and exploitation. Resolving the interoperability issues could bring economic\n\
    beneﬁts. In fact, achieving a higher level of interoperability among devices,\
    \ applications\nand services involves the reduction in costs for producing completely\
    \ new and different\ndeployments of the solutions [113], thereby allowing backward\
    \ compatibility through\nthe exploitation of older systems as well as an incremental\
    \ deployment and integration.\nOn the other hand, the development of the IoT/IoE\
    \ paradigm has led to the adoption\nof event-driven and push protocols [32], which\
    \ has paved the way not only to sense the\ncity but also to act through actuators\
    \ and to create event-driven applications. However,\nmost of the solutions proposed\
    \ in the literature still focus on limited domains, addressing\nspeciﬁc problems\
    \ with little or no software reuse [3]. In order to handle the high variety\n\
    of IoT devices and applications, the paradigm of microservice-oriented architecture\
    \ is\nincreasingly adopted in recent IoT-based solutions for smart cities [13,29,32,109].\
    \ This\nenhances the scalability and availability of IoT frameworks and simpliﬁes\
    \ the complexity\nof the traditional service-oriented architectures (SOA) [32].\
    \ For IoT-based solutions, the\nachievement of a higher scalability represents\
    \ the possibility to efﬁciently collect and\nprocess increasingly larger amounts\
    \ of data, which often leads to a higher accuracy in\ndata analysis and often\
    \ enables real-time or near real-time processing [114]. These aspects\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 1607\n15 of 21\nimply important social involvement, for instance,\
    \ in security and resilience, since they\nallow the building of more resilient\
    \ tools that are able to perform real-time analysis and\nsimulations, e.g., those\
    \ used by local public authorities for early warnings and alerts in\ncritical\
    \ events, such as disaster management [99] and resilience planning. Moreover,\
    \ many\nIoT solutions are still oriented toward traditional programming environments,\
    \ while the\nmost recent trends show an advancement in the exploitation of visual\
    \ paradigm languages\n(VPL) [15,32], including Node-RED, for implementing workﬂows\
    \ for IoT applications.\nThe adoption of microservice-oriented architectures leads\
    \ toward the overcoming of\nthe monolithic platform approach [3] since the microservice\
    \ paradigm allows the reuse of\nsoftware components and blocks. Moreover, microservice\
    \ architectures are open to exten-\nsions and they can also exploit external services\
    \ more easily (when necessary for delegating\npart of the computation as well\
    \ as accessing additional services or applications) [29]. For\ninstance, they\
    \ can be easily adapted to support almost all kinds of IoT and communication\n\
    protocols and also support data-driven and event-driven push modalities. This\
    \ is moving\nin the direction of the implementation of smarter frameworks for\
    \ business intelligence and\ndata analytics, as well as more interactive visual\
    \ analysis tools [32]. This deeper level of\nintegration and complexity of IoT-enabled\
    \ smart city platforms should bring advancements\nin performing real-time simulations,\
    \ what-if analysis and supporting decision-making\nprocesses, which is the basis\
    \ of the production of smarter and more efﬁcient services and\napplications for\
    \ all involved stakeholders.\nFurthermore, IoT-enabled smart city platforms are\
    \ evolving toward cross-organization\nand multitenancy IoT platforms and applications.\
    \ This allows the development of large\ninfrastructures that can support multiple\
    \ organizations, enhance scalability and reduce the\ninfrastructures’ costs since\
    \ they are shared between multiple operators [36]. This aspect\nis closely connected\
    \ with the reuse of components in smart city frameworks and tries to\nharmonize\
    \ and overcome the efforts needed in building custom-made platforms for each\n\
    city or each speciﬁc context, which is economically inefﬁcient [3]. Other potential\
    \ future di-\nrections include the introduction and dissemination of novel network\
    \ technologies, such as\n5G [28,59,72,102]. Technological advances in networks\
    \ and device solutions are important.\nIn fact, the adoption of the most recent\
    \ network technologies, such as 5G, combined with\nhigher efﬁciency in building\
    \ techniques and technologies following the paradigm of net\nzero energy infrastructure\
    \ can lead to building solutions that are aiming for net zero carbon\nemissions\
    \ [102]. Furthermore, the introduction of innovative computing paradigms, such\n\
    as the introduction and integration of deep learning and AI solutions [109,115],\
    \ semantic\ntechnologies and natural language processing (NLP) would improve the\
    \ interaction level\nbetween smart devices and all smart city actors, as well\
    \ as enabling the production of\nsmarter services for a better quality of life.\n\
    Finally, in order to also discuss the societal challenges addressed by IoT and\
    \ smart city\ntechnologies, we focused on assessing each application area and\
    \ domain, as discussed in\nSection 3, in terms of their contribution to the SDGs.\
    \ To this end, we will brieﬂy introduce\nthe 17 indicators representing the SDGs:\
    \ (1) no poverty; (2) zero hunger; (3) good health\nand well-being; (4) quality\
    \ education; (5) gender equality; (6) clean water and sanitation;\n(7) affordable\
    \ and clean energy; (8) decent work and economic growth; (9) industry, innova-\n\

    \ communities;\n(12) responsible consumption and production; (13) climate action;\
    \ (14) life below water;\n(15) life on land; (16) peace, justice and strong institutions;\
    \ and (17) partnerships for the\ngoals. On the basis of our ﬁndings while reviewing\
    \ the literature, relevant contributions\nand relations among the presented IoT–smart\
    \ city application areas and the following SDGs\nwere retrieved:\n•\nZero Hunger:\

    \ in healthcare contexts\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n16 of 21\ncan be useful for\
    \ monitoring critical cases, conditions and events [109], especially in\nthe period\
    \ of COVID-19 pandemic;\n•\nQuality Education: Smart education solutions contribute\
    \ to creating innovative educa-\ntion services, as well as to enhancing the interaction\
    \ between remote and real-world\nlearning activities [66];\n•\nClean Water and\
    \ Sanitation: Smart water solutions [100] are employed to monitor\nthe quantity\
    \ and quality of water distribution and aim to minimize consumption and\nmanage\
    \ wastewater treatments [101]. This represents an important step in the proper\n\
    design and maintenance of quality water systems;\n•\nAffordable and Clean Energy:\
    \ Smart energy solutions and energy grids [3,58,93,96,97]\ncontribute to a more\
    \ efﬁcient energy distribution and usage [92], helping to minimize\npower consumption\
    \ and consider innovative sustainable energy sources [91];\n•\nDecent Work and\
    \ Economic Growth: Smart governance solutions [3,38,39,46–54]\ncontribute to economic\
    \ growth [38] since they are expected to provoke a strong push\nin the direction\
    \ of smart and digital public administrations [39]. Moreover, smart\neconomy solutions\
    \ [83,84] can also contribute to allowing citizens, companies and\nsmart city\
    \ stakeholders to follow the market for smart applications and data economy,\n\
    rethinking the ﬂexibility of jobs and labors [84] and, thus, redeﬁning the economic\n\
    value associated with them;\n•\nIndustry, Innovation and Infrastructure: Smart\
    \ industry solutions [3,14,33,90] are\nestablishing new and relevant digital infrastructures\
    \ for sustainable industrial produc-\ntion [88] and data economy;\n•\nSustainable\
    \ Cities and Communities: Several IoT-enabled smart city components\ncontribute\
    \ to improving the sustainability of smart city communities. For instance,\nsmart\
    \ mobility solutions [3,66,79–82] are aiming to establish near-to-zero emissions\n\
    and reduced trafﬁc ﬂows and to also enhance the adoption of smart transportation\n\
    and IoT paradigms. These aspects will bring relevant inﬂuences and improvements\n\
    for the quality of life in smart cities [92];\n•\nClimate Action: Smart environment\
    \ technologies [3,66,102,103] that are focused on\nmonitoring air quality and\
    \ pollutant levels [99,104] contribute to analyzing and con-\ntrolling air quality\
    \ and fossil combustion, as well as their environmental impact in\nterms of CO2,\
    \ NO, NO2, etc. (which are the main effects of fossil combustion);\n•\nPeace,\
    \ Justice and Strong Institutions: Smart governance solutions [3,38,39,46–54]\n\
    contribute to providing institutions with data-driven decision-making processes\
    \ [39],\nwhich makes citizens’ participation more inclusive and deliberative,\
    \ thus creating a\nconsensus for the public good and enhancing equality and social\
    \ justice [38].\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper, a review of the recent research\
    \ literature on IoT-enabled smart cities\nframework was performed. The rationale\
    \ behind this study was the requirement to un-\nderstand and classify the most\
    \ recent trends in the adoption of IoT technologies as a key\ndriver for the efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable development of smart cities. The purpose was also\nto highlight\
    \ the main open challenges that need to be addressed and resolved in the future.\n\
    The review was conducted both for key IoT technologies, which were analyzed following\n\
    an architectural perspective, and for smart city approaches and frameworks, which\
    \ were\nbased on classiﬁcation into eight domains describing the main application\
    \ areas. From this\nanalysis, it emerged that in recent years, the integration\
    \ of IoT solutions and smart city\nframeworks is achieving increasingly higher\
    \ levels of complexity and wider application\nranges, which go beyond the past\
    \ generation of vertical silo applications that were based\non speciﬁc domains.\
    \ In fact, the necessity to overcome vertical silos (i.e., where data are\ncollected\
    \ and “siloed” in a unique system and closed to the rest of IoT [114]) has provoked\n\
    several initiatives. For instance, the EU developed speciﬁc initiatives and IoT\
    \ programs,\nsuch as the open API standard Open Messaging Interface (O-MI) and\
    \ Open Data Format\n(O-DF) [116]. This produces new added-value across multiple\
    \ platforms, providing the\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 1607\n17 of 21\npossibility to\
    \ share protocols, data and results and allowing the better and more efﬁcient\n\
    cooperation between all involved actors and stakeholders (users, software and\
    \ network\nproviders, institutions, companies, etc.) [114]. To this end, the new\
    \ generation of smart\napplications will manage and optimize more complex sets\
    \ of heterogeneous information,\ndata, systems, sensors, devices, etc. However,\
    \ this process is still not complete since it\nhas to cope with several open technical\
    \ and social challenges (regarding the efforts to\nharmonize the many different\
    \ standards for IoT formats and protocols, interoperability\nand scalability issues\
    \ and the achievement of sustainability goals) in order to move toward\nmicroservice-oriented\
    \ architectures, event-driven/data-driven applications and more sus-\ntainable\
    \ solutions. Finally, another important driver could be represented by all involved\n\
    stakeholders and actors, who are raising their awareness and becoming more actively\n\
    engaged in the smart city environment, not only as service consumers but also\
    \ as the\nproducers of valuable contents and information.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Cited By Index Terms Recommendations Comments ABSTRACT Born from a need for a
    pure “pay-per-use” model and highly scalable platform, the “Serverless” paradigm
    emerged and has the potential to become a dominant way of building cloud applications.
    Although it was originally designed for cloud environments, Serverless is finding
    its position in the Edge Computing landscape, aiming to bring computational resources
    closer to the data source. That is, Serverless is crossing cloud borders to assess
    its merits in Edge computing, whose principal partner will be the Internet of
    Things (IoT) applications. This move sounds promising as Serverless brings particular
    benefits such as eliminating always-on services causing high electricity usage,
    for instance. However, the community is still hesitant to uptake Serverless Edge
    Computing because of the cloud-driven design of current Serverless platforms,
    and distinctive characteristics of edge landscape and IoT applications. In this
    paper, we evaluate both sides to shed light on the Serverless new territory. Our
    in-depth analysis promotes a broad vision for bringing Serverless to the Edge
    Computing. It also issues major challenges for Serverless to be met before entering
    Edge computing. References Paarijaat Aditya, Istemi Ekin Akkus, Andre Beck, Ruichuan

    Abstract: With the arrival of new technologies in modern smart factories, automated\
    \ predictive\nmaintenance is also related to production robotisation. Intelligent\
    \ sensors make it possible to\nobtain an ever-increasing amount of data, which\
    \ must be analysed efﬁciently and effectively to\nsupport increasingly complex\
    \ systems’ decision-making and management. The paper aims to review\nthe current\
    \ literature concerning predictive maintenance and intelligent sensors in smart\
    \ factories.\nWe focused on contemporary trends to provide an overview of future\
    \ research challenges and\nclassiﬁcation. The paper used burst analysis, systematic\
    \ review methodology, co-occurrence analysis\nof keywords, and cluster analysis.\
    \ The results show the increasing number of papers related to key\nresearched\
    \ concepts. The importance of predictive maintenance is growing over time in relation\n\
    to Industry 4.0 technologies. We proposed Smart and Intelligent Predictive Maintenance\
    \ (SIPM)\nbased on the full-text analysis of relevant papers. The paper’s main\
    \ contribution is the summary and\noverview of current trends in intelligent sensors\
    \ used for predictive maintenance in smart factories.\nKeywords: intelligent sensors;\
    \ maintenance; smart factory; Industry 4.0\n1. Introduction\nIndustry sets the\
    \ direction for the world economy, accounting for more than 70% of\nthe world’s\
    \ total material production [1], depending on the regional economy’s develop-\n\
    ment. The continuous introduction of new technologies in developed countries has\
    \ an\nimpact on its relatively low level of employment of the population at the\
    \ level of 20% [2].\nSimultaneously, the share of products and semiﬁnished products\
    \ in international trade\nis continuously growing, despite the declining share\
    \ of national Gross Domestic Product\n(GDP) in developed countries [3]. All these\
    \ facts are caused by introducing new technolo-\ngies, which in the current industrial\
    \ era of Industry 4.0 are summarised by many authors\nunder the name Smart Factory.\n\
    This review aims to give the reader a comprehensive view of maintenance and in-\n\
    telligent sensors in Smart Factory. As can be seen from the following, current\
    \ literature\nreviews [4–10] have shown that the literature is focusing on speciﬁc\
    \ topics only separately.\nThe literature specializes in different types of sensors\
    \ but does not consider them in relation\nto those technologies, and industry\
    \ 4.0. Professional texts lack a summary of literature and\ntexts that would bring\
    \ the usability and potential of sensors closer to common practice,\nso that these\
    \ ﬁndings can be clearly used for business management in the implementation\n\
    of maintenance system planning. This would be beneﬁcial for operational managers\
    \ and\nengineers for the design of new maintenance systems. This article provides\
    \ a comprehen-\nsive overview of current trends to help structure and guide future\
    \ research. At the same\ntime, it answers key questions related to contemporary\
    \ trends in maintenance processes in\nsmart factories. We deﬁne which Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies and intelligent sensors usually\nprovide maintenance in smart\
    \ factories. Moreover, it helps to ﬁnd new trends in smart and\nintelligent predictive\
    \ maintenance.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21041470\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\

    \ and organisational changes\nand desirable competencies is further addressed\
    \ by Sousa [16], as well as Lee et al. [17].\nThey pay attention to the gap between\
    \ recent researches on the actual level of deployment.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n\
    3 of 40\nIn the ﬁeld of maintenance of intelligent factories, we ﬁnd several literature\
    \ reviews\nwith the resonant notion of predictive maintenance. In their overview,\
    \ Carvalho [18]\nfocuses on machine learning methods, which they consider a promising\
    \ tool for predictive\nmaintenance. Sakib [19] observes the shift from service\
    \ activities to proactive, predictive\nmaintenance and places [20] in the context\
    \ of Industry 4.0. Olesen and Shaker [21] deals\nwith practical use in thermal\
    \ power plants, and Fei [22] in the ﬁeld of aircraft systems.\n2.1. Intelligent\
    \ Sensors\nWe ﬁnd a critical area in the concept of smart factories, and that\
    \ is intelligent logistics—\ntransport and warehousing. These operations include\
    \ identiﬁcation and detection of the\nlocation of resources across the company.\
    \ We understand sensors as a technical reproduc-\ntion of natural processes because\
    \ human nerves transform external stimuli into electrical\nsignals transmitted\
    \ to the central nervous system—the brain. Smart sensors process ag-\ngregated\
    \ data from production processes in real-time and enable self-determination of\n\
    machines and other smart devices [23,24]. Data on production resources are used\
    \ to mon-\nitor, collect, and evaluate the data obtained. The most common type\
    \ of wireless sensors\nwork on radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), ZigBee, and\
    \ Bluetooth technology [25].\nEifert [26] deﬁnes intelligent sensors as a multi-component\
    \ measuring device that is self-\ncalibrating, self-optimised, and easy to integrate\
    \ into the environment for high connectivity.\nBesides, intelligent sensors also\
    \ have process intelligence and can generate multidimen-\nsional data information.\
    \ The literature of the most inﬂected RFID technology is also one of\nthe key\
    \ technologies for implementing the Internet of Things (IoT). In RFID technology,\n\
    it is an active and passive tag, where the active sensor sends information for\
    \ hundreds\nof meters, and the passive tag receives it. The integrated sensor\
    \ in production enables\na ﬂexible and targeted strategy of predictive maintenance\
    \ and control [27]. Sensors that\nare part of the IoT can proactively monitor\
    \ the device and issue alerts when the device\ndeviates from the speciﬁed parameters,\
    \ we speak of so-called facility management [28].\nKarabegovic [29] adds that\
    \ the sensors convert physical parameters (temperature, speed,\nhumidity) into\
    \ signals that can be measured electronically. The use of smart sensors in\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0 is characterised by Schmitt [30]. The key element is knowledge of the current\n\
    state of the system. Sensor data with other parameters of the given process in\
    \ the sense\nof self-diagnostics and machine learning can be evaluated in real-time.\
    \ The traceability of\nindividual components is also essential—from screws to\
    \ the uniformity of seals, this knowl-\nedge enables the measurement of tolerance\
    \ and comprehensive monitoring of the condition\nof machines and other equipment.\n\
    2.2. Predictive Maintenance\nPredictive maintenance (PdM) is the latest maintenance\
    \ policy adopted by many\nindustries. Above all, these are areas that require\
    \ absolute reliability, such as power\nplants, public services, transport systems,\
    \ and emergency services. Forecasted information\nis usually necessary for the\
    \ long term and for planning various operational activities\n(maintenance, production,\
    \ inventory, etc.). In addition, due to technological and logistical\nlimitations,\
    \ maintenance cannot always be performed everywhere [31]. Maintenance is\na critical\
    \ activity that takes place in production. Machine failures during production\n\
    can lead to adverse effects on the production schedule, delivery delays, or employee\n\
    overtime to compensate for the loss. PdM predicts system failures to optimize\
    \ maintenance\nefforts [32,33]. According to Carvalho [18,34], PdM is a set of\
    \ tools used to determine\nwhen speciﬁc maintenance is required. The tool is based\
    \ on continuous monitoring of\nthe machine or process, and this allows maintenance\
    \ to be performed only when needed.\nA secondary, no less important function of\
    \ PdM is the possibility of early detection of\nfaults, thanks to tools based\
    \ on historical data—machine learning—as well as visual aspects\nof faults—colour\
    \ and wear. As a possible part of the Industry 4.0 concept, PdM aims to\nminimise\
    \ maintenance costs, implement zero-waste production, and reduce the number of\n\
    major failures [35]. Despite PdM’s beneﬁts, Herrmann [36] highlights the potential\
    \ risks\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n4 of 40\nof remote access to maintenance processes\
    \ and cites Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)\nattacks, for example. According\
    \ to Zonta [20], we distinguish three approaches to PdM,\nnamely: Based on a physical\
    \ model, where the main feature is mathematical modelling\nrequiring the timeliness\
    \ of the state and statistical methods of evaluation. The second\napproach is\
    \ the knowledge-based approach, which reduces the complexity of the physical\n\
    model, and the last approach is the data-driven approach, which we ﬁnd most often\n\
    in the current development of PdM. This approach is based on artiﬁcial intelligence,\n\
    i.e., machine learning and statistical modelling, and is a satisfactory approach\
    \ in the\nconditions of Industry 4.0 [37]. Farooq et al. distinguish experience-driven\
    \ and data-\ndriven maintenance [38]. Experience-driven preventive maintenance\
    \ is based on gathering\nknowledge about production equipment, which is then used\
    \ to plan future maintenance.\nOn the contrary, data-driven preventive maintenance\
    \ is based on analysing a large volume\nof data (Figure 2).\nSensors 2021, 21,\

    \ maintenance is based on analysing a large volume of data \n(Figure 2). \n \n\

    \ Factory \nOne of the key components of Industry 4.0 is a smart factory, otherwise\
    \ also a smart \nor digital factory. A smart factory represents the future state\
    \ of fully interconnected pro-\nduction systems, without a significant amount\
    \ of manpower [13]. According to Chen [25], \na smart factory is a manufacturing\
    \ solution that provides adaptive and flexible manufac-\nturing processes that\
    \ reflect the rapidly and dynamically changing conditions in the world. \nOn the\
    \ one hand, this solution can be understood as a combination of software and hard-\n\
    ware, which should lead to the optimisation of production and the reduction of\
    \ waste of \nscarce resources. On the other hand, the concept can be perceived\
    \ as a space for perspec-\ntive cooperation with business partners based on the\
    \ formation of a dynamic organisation. \nThe smart factory architecture itself\
    \ includes a physical resource layer, a data and network \nlayer, as well as an\
    \ end layer. All elements of the intelligent factory are interconnected, \nexchanging\
    \ information, and recognising and evaluating situations. Thus, physical and \n\

    \ Factory\nOne of the key components of Industry 4.0 is a smart factory, otherwise\
    \ also a smart or\ndigital factory. A smart factory represents the future state\
    \ of fully interconnected produc-\ntion systems, without a signiﬁcant amount of\
    \ manpower [13]. According to Chen [25], a\nsmart factory is a manufacturing solution\
    \ that provides adaptive and ﬂexible manufactur-\ning processes that reﬂect the\
    \ rapidly and dynamically changing conditions in the world. On\nthe one hand,\
    \ this solution can be understood as a combination of software and hardware,\n\
    which should lead to the optimisation of production and the reduction of waste\
    \ of scarce\nresources. On the other hand, the concept can be perceived as a space\
    \ for perspective\ncooperation with business partners based on the formation of\
    \ a dynamic organisation. The\nsmart factory architecture itself includes a physical\
    \ resource layer, a data and network\nlayer, as well as an end layer. All elements\
    \ of the intelligent factory are interconnected,\nexchanging information, and\
    \ recognising and evaluating situations. Thus, physical and\ncyber technology\
    \ is integrated, which results in improved controllability, control, trans-\n\
    parency of production processes, maximises value for the customer, and in addition,\
    \ there is\ncommunication between the factory and the market itself [39,40]. The\
    \ core technologies of\nIndustry 4.0 include IoT, cloud computing, and high-volume\
    \ data analysis. IoT represents\nthe integration of sensors and computer technology\
    \ in the ﬁeld of wireless communication,\nand cloud services allow access to the\
    \ network respectively, as a shared pool of computing\nresources. The combination\
    \ of these technologies allows the involvement of all devices\nin the concept\
    \ of a smart factory, but the collection of huge amounts of data requires\nanother\
    \ technology, which is the analysis of high-volume data. With the help of analytical\n\
    tools—data mining or machine learning—this technology is one of the most important\n\
    elements of the entire concept of Industry 4.0 [41]. Other technologies related\
    \ to the vision\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n5 of 40\nof a smart factory include autonomous\
    \ robots, additive manufacturing, augmented reality,\nand cybersecurity. Drastic\
    \ changes in technology are changing the concept of production.\nIn the modern\
    \ concept, traditional centrally controlled processes are replaced by decen-\n\
    tralised control, which builds on the ability of individual elements of a smart\
    \ factory to\ncommunicate with each other. In self-regulatory production, people,\
    \ machines, equipment,\nand products communicate with each other [42].\n3. Materials\

    \ the Endnote software database and Microsoft Excel software,\nwhich were used\
    \ to evaluate various aspects of the monitored topics. Our research team\nconsisted\
    \ of three members who participated in the evaluation and analysis of search\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 1470\n9 of 40\nresults. This phase included evaluating the full\
    \ texts of individual publications based on\nthe set research goals.\nWe focused\
    \ mainly on:\n•\nThe research method (case study, experiment, simulation)\n•\n\
    Objectives of the articles\n•\nUsed intelligent sensors and data\n•\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0 technologies for smart factories\n•\nPredictive maintenance processes characteristics\n\
    •\nSmart and intelligent keywords domain\nWe used the clustering method during\
    \ the analysis, which is part of the VOSviewer\nsoftware [45] and allows classiﬁcation\
    \ using keywords. Using VOSviewer, we performed a\nco-occurrence analysis of keywords,\
    \ which is based on clustering methods. Cluster analysis\nenabled to ﬁnd a number\
    \ of paired keywords cited in the same publications. The results\nof the cluster\
    \ analysis clearly capture the knowledge structure of the research frontiers.\n\
    We evaluated the quality of publications included for the synthesis (ﬁnal selection)\
    \ thorough\nreview of individual team members. In particular, the ranking of journals,\
    \ citations of\npublications, and their possible biases were considered.\n3.7.\
    \ Excluded Studies\nTo avoid possible effects of bias, it is necessary to mention\
    \ the most important publica-\ntions, which were eliminated from the sample for\
    \ qualitative synthesis reasons. Aheleroff\net al. [50] examined the application\
    \ of smart IoT sensors in the fridge (smart homes focus).\nSeveral publications\
    \ are mainly focused on the logistic area [51], i.e., from the automotive in-\n\
    dustry [52–54] or the aviation industry [55,56]. We excluded from the analysis\
    \ publications\nfocused on agriculture, which do not deal with smart factories’\
    \ production processes. These\nare publications using intelligent sensors in milling\
    \ [57] and aquaponics [58]. The review\npapers were eliminated from the ﬁnal selection.\n\
    4. Results\nThe results are divided into three parts according to the research\
    \ question: an overview\nof the main topics, smart and intelligent predictive\
    \ maintenance, and Industry 4.0 Tech-\nnologies and Sensors for Smart Factory.\n\
    4.1. Main Topics and Trends Overview\nFirst, we identiﬁed occurrences of the primary\
    \ topics “smart factory/production,”\n“intelligent/smart sensors,” and “predictive/smart\
    \ maintenance” in the Web of Science\nand Scopus databases. This part of the research\
    \ related to the research question 1. All three\nconcepts are connected in the\
    \ research area by engineering, supplemented by telecommuni-\ncations and predictive\
    \ maintenance by medicine, or intelligent sensors in computer science.\nThe total\
    \ number of publications in the databases is shown in Figure 4.\nThe results shown\
    \ in Figure 5 show an increase in the number of publications over time.\nThis\
    \ increase has been apparent for smart factory publications since 2015 and intelligent\n\
    sensors since 2012. Further, we performed burst detection analysis in the researched\
    \ areas\nfor Web of Science publications.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n10 of 40\n\

    \ dealing with intelligent, ﬂexible, and automation planning and scheduling of\n\
    manufacturing systems. This wave is the period 1970–1990, characterised by the\
    \ burst\nterms intelligent, system, knowledge, plan, and schedule. The second\
    \ wave in 1990–2010\nwith the primary burst terms: agent, manufacturing, control,\
    \ expert, and process, refers to\npapers using holon, RFID, or web technologies\
    \ in factories. Publications on manufacturing\ncontrol systems [62,63] were highly\
    \ cited in this period. The current trend in smart factory\nis related to implementing\
    \ intelligent manufacturing [64]. In this contemporary wave,\nburst terms Industry\
    \ 4.0, digital twin, IoT, deep learning, digitalisation, smart grid, cyber,\n\
    and sustain dominate. These terms are well-known Industry 4.0 technologies and\
    \ processes.\nTop cited papers focused on operational planning of a smart grid\
    \ [65], deep learning\nin agriculture [66], and big data for the self-organised\
    \ multiagent system in the smart\nfactory [67].\nTop cited papers from smart/intelligent\
    \ sensors were in areas related to the Internet of\nThings [68], wireless sensor\
    \ networks [69], and nanotechnology applications [70]. We found\nthat the important\
    \ paper title terms are IoT, structure, and sensor in the burst analysis.\nFigure\
    \ 5 shows that the early history of intelligent sensors, 1970–1990, emphasised\
    \ the\nﬁrst application of sensors (burst terms sensor, intelligent, process).\
    \ Later, in 1990–2010\ncame articles focused on the structure [71], optic, and\
    \ control of sensors, and their usage\nfor robots. Some essential publications\
    \ in this period focused on structural health monitor-\ning [72], piezoelectric\
    \ laminate beam [73], and free vibration behaviour of the beam [74].\nThe most\
    \ contemporary period from 2010 to 2020, similar to the smart factory/production,\n\
    covered the area of Industry 4.0 new technologies. In addition to the mentioned\
    \ Internet\nof Things [75], there is a signiﬁcant representation of publications\
    \ focused on wearable\nsensor-based systems [76], deep learning [77], edge technology\
    \ [78], graphene-based smart\nmaterials, blockchain, smart city, and grid.\nThe\
    \ last area focused on smart/predictive maintenance. After omitting medical and\n\
    ecological articles, the most cited publications focused on proportional-integral-derivative\n\
    (PID) control [79], monitoring, and fault diagnosis in production [80]. Based\
    \ on the burst\nanalysis results, we found that the most important terms are maintenance,\
    \ learning, and pre-\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n12 of 40\ndict. We identiﬁed three\
    \ trend waves in area maintenance (Figure 5). In the ﬁrst wave from\n1970 to 1990,\
    \ the publications dealt with predictive maintenance. In engineering and pro-\n\
    duction, maintenance is associated with predicting machines’ status [81] or deterioration\n\
    of processes [82]. In the second wave in 1990 to 2010, we found that the publications\
    \ dealt\nwith burst terms program, diagnostics, intelligence, knowledge, and database.\
    \ These pub-\nlications focus, for example, on diagnostics, monitoring, or maintenance\
    \ of intelligent\ncomputer numerical control (CNC) machine tools [83] or power\
    \ transformers [84]. The cur-\nrent trend wave is characterised by Industry 4.0\
    \ technologies such as digital twins, deep\nmachine learning, IoT, big data analytics,\
    \ blockchain, and digitisation for maintenance.\nThe most signiﬁcant publications\
    \ of this period focused on big data analytics in logistics\nand supply chain\
    \ management [85], maintenance strategy selection [86], vibration analy-\nsis\
    \ of rotating machinery, or cloud-enabled prognosis [87] for predictive maintenance\
    \ in\nproduction.\nBased on the burst analysis detection, we conclude that in\
    \ all three areas in the\nlast 10 years, the focus has been on the concept of\
    \ Industry 4.0 and related technologies.\nWe arranged the keywords with the highest\
    \ burst weights into three research areas in\nFigure 7. The results show that\
    \ the terms Internet of Things and deep learning have the\nhighest weight for\
    \ all topics. The terms Big Data, grid, and intelligent are also common to\nthe\
    \ area. From this ﬁnding, we can conclude that the current trend in the monitored\
    \ areas\nis related to the collecting of big data through intelligent sensors\
    \ on IoT devices and their\nevaluation using learning algorithms.\nThe internet,\
    \ smart grid, and blockchain technology are important for sensors used\nin maintenance.\
    \ The use of sensors in smart factories lies mainly in the area of control,\n\
    with a focus on processes. The sensors, together with actuators, are used to collect\
    \ data to\ncontrol and optimise conditions. Piezoelectric, optics, wearable, beam,\
    \ graphene, and other\nsensors’ features are used. A special area of sensors lies\
    \ in robotics, which has experienced\nrapid development in recent years. In the\
    \ world’s most industrialised countries, such\nas South Korea, Japan, Germany,\
    \ and Sweden, there is the largest share of robots per\n10,000 employees in factories\
    \ [88]. Automation in smart factories requires new types\nof sensors that have\
    \ the ability to automatically calibrate and improve the functions of\nIoT devices.\
    \ The IoT is not aiming only at connect two machines with pre-programmed\nfunctions.\
    \ For IoT communication, it is important to connect embedded devices to the\n\
    Internet and communicate with each other [89]. It is an intelligent connection\
    \ of various\nproducts, devices, and facilities that provide a wide range of functions\
    \ that evaluate certain\nconditions. The interaction between systems brings new\
    \ possibilities. The key elements are\nminiature intelligent sensors [90]. Even\
    \ though devices and systems were not originally\ndesigned to share data, the\
    \ Internet of Things can. Connecting smart sensors and gateways\nto existing devices\
    \ leads to data collection and analysis, understanding, and better decision\n\
    making [91].\nPublications about smart factory/production are related to cyber-physical\
    \ systems,\nplanning, scheduling, and sustaining them. Maintenance in smart factories\
    \ relies on\nIndustry 4.0 technologies, digitisation, data-driven manufacturing,\
    \ agent-based systems,\nand digital twins. Predictive maintenance consists of\
    \ programs for predicting, diagnosing,\nand analysing future maintenance needs.\
    \ Based on the rules, features, and conditions,\nthere are machines and devices\
    \ controlled and repaired to maintain their life and future\nsustainability. Information\
    \ and data are collected and shared through databases.\n4.2. Smart and Intelligent\
    \ Predictive Maintenance\nWe performed a co-occurrence analysis based on original\
    \ papers’ keywords using\nVOSviewer. This part of the analysis related to research\
    \ question 2. The results show that\nthe keywords maintenance, optimisation, predictive\
    \ maintenance, system, and big data\nwere most often used in publications. Publications\

    \ of co-occurrence analysis. \nFigure 8. Keywords of co-occurrence analysis.\n\

    condition monitoring, fault diagnosis).\n•\nRUL: Prognostics and health management\
    \ for RUL (keywords: prognostics and health\nmanagement, signal processing, remaining\
    \ useful lives).\nThe ﬁrst cluster consists of publications that focus on intelligent\
    \ sensors in smart\nmaintenance factories without preferring speciﬁc methods.\
    \ This cluster is represented, for\nexample, by publications focused on data-driven\
    \ simulation [92], big data in an Industry 4.0\nenvironment [93], or performing\
    \ predictive maintenance in a bottling plant [94]. The sec-\nond cluster consists\
    \ mainly of publications that emphasise the use of condition-based\nmaintenance.\
    \ The intelligent condition-based maintenance uses data fusion [95] and the\n\
    Internet of Things in connection to learning techniques [96]. The third cluster\
    \ related to\npublications mainly emphasised fault diagnosis’ importance for monitoring\
    \ and mainte-\nnance. The fault diagnosis is used for prognosis in signal processing\
    \ [97] and maintenance\nmanagement systems [98]. The last cluster is characterised\
    \ by a focus on determining the\ncurrent health and the remaining life of devices\
    \ and machines. This concept is described\nconcerning edge-cloud platforms [99].\n\
    While the concept of condition monitoring has been around for some time, the market\n\
    for more sophisticated predictive maintenance products is still very young. There\
    \ are four\ntypes of maintenance classiﬁed in the literature: corrective, scheduled,\
    \ condition-based,\nand statistical-based maintenance [100,101]. Predictive maintenance\
    \ has evolved from\ncorrective maintenance using new technologies and procedures\
    \ for predicting and prevent-\ning failure. Corrective maintenance is based on\
    \ the reactive strategy to the maintenance\nprocess—however, with a proactive\
    \ strategy related to the preventive or opportunistic\napproach. Preventive maintenance\
    \ is then seen as condition-based, dynamic predictive,\nor scheduled (periodic)\
    \ maintenance. The corrective maintenance is based on the repair or\nreplacement\
    \ of assets ex-post. Condition-based maintenance means the decision-making\nprocess,\
    \ usually in real-time, based on selected indicators computed from the gathered\n\
    data.\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n14 of 40\nTable 6 depicts maintenance process characteristics\
    \ from analysed papers. The condition-\nbased preventive maintenance is discussed\
    \ in Farooq et al. [38], Kumar et al. [102], Li et al. [96],\nLin et al. [103],\
    \ Musselman and Djurdjanovic [104], Yan et al. [93], and Sadiki et al. [105].\n\
    Preventive maintenance is regular maintenance of machines, devices, and equipment\
    \ to\nprevent their downtime concerning failure state. The preventive maintenance\
    \ actions were\nclassified by Doostparast et al. [106] as inspection, low-level\
    \ repair, and replacement. These\nactions are based on fault prediction time statistically,\
    \ upon failure accident, time-based (at the\nage for old machines), or cycle-based\
    \ (periodically).\n4.3. Industry 4.0 Technologies and Sensors for Smart Factory\n\
    Furthermore, full texts of articles concerning Industry 4.0 technologies were\
    \ analysed.\nWe performed a cluster analysis of the obtained keywords of Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies. The\nresults of the analysis are shown in Figure 9. The most\
    \ common keywords in the articles\nwere sensor, big data, Internet of Things,\

    4.3.1. Motion, Position, Proximity, and Speed Sensors\nThe ﬁrst type of sensors\
    \ are motion-based probes. Position and movement sensors\nare mounted for monitoring\
    \ the machine or product position on the production lines.\nInductive, photoelectric,\
    \ potentiometric (resistance-based), capacitive, optical, magnetic,\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 1470\n23 of 40\nand other sensing methods are used for detection of position.\
    \ Sensors based on motion\ndetection must meet the requirements in the areas of\
    \ durability, weight, energy consump-\ntion, and at the same time, suitability\
    \ for mass production regarding to the end user—\ncustomer [123,124]. Shoabid\
    \ [125] describes motion-based sensors as a combination of\nan accelerometer,\
    \ gyroscope, magnetometer, and linear acceleration. The application of\nthese\
    \ sensors can be found primarily in the ﬁeld of healthcare systems, with various\
    \ com-\nbinations of the above-mentioned sensors. A gyroscope is used mainly for\
    \ gait analysis,\nfall detection, or gesture recognition, or in combination with\
    \ an accelerometer. Proximity\nsensors detect the presence of an object without\
    \ contact. These sensors are based on the\noptical, ultrasonic, inductive, and\
    \ capacitive nature. Wearable sensors are able to monitor,\nfor example, physiological\
    \ parameters in real time.\nSpeed sensors have an opportunity for detecting object\
    \ speed (usually for wheels,\nmotor, or rotating particles). Enterprises use speedometers,\
    \ accelerometers, light detec-\ntion and ranging (LIDAR) sensors, tachometers,\
    \ Doppler radars, etc. Farooq et al. [38]\ndiscussed genetic-algorithm-based prediction\
    \ process for intelligent maintenance of textile\nspinning systems. They used\
    \ vibration and speed data in a multiagent system for tracking\ndiscrepancies\
    \ and error distribution of machine processing. Integrated Electronics Piezo-\n\
    Electric accelerometers have been frequently used for machine vibration measurement.\n\
    Peng et al. [113] use them for an automatic health condition diagnosis without\
    \ ﬁeld worker\nmaintenance effort. The results show that dynamic response signals\
    \ from the accelerometer\nincreased the completeness and performance of the vibration\
    \ diagnosis function. Further,\nPeng and Tsan [98] developed a sensor diagnosis\
    \ and monitoring system to classify the\nhealth condition of the online integrated\
    \ IEPE accelerometer. The solution was integrated\ninto a production line.\nGoodall\
    \ et al. [92] developed, based on the RFID, a data-driven simulation for con-\n\
    trolling work-in-process parts in a remanufacturing process and determining the\
    \ time for\noperators to process them [104]. Park et al. [112] performed experiments\
    \ on servo motor\nlifespan using an accelerated degradation testing method based\
    \ on thermal stresses. The ex-\nperimental data are used sensors for monitoring\
    \ the torque, position, electrical resistance,\nand moment of inertia of rotor.\
    \ Shan et al. [114] presented the system architecture and\nhardware for the welding\
    \ line, which provides the real-time ﬁne-grained visualisation of\nthe welding\
    \ robot operation status. The electrocardiogram of intelligent manufacturing\n\
    equipment technology provides the maintenance of intelligent manufacturing equipment.\n\
    4.3.2. Vibration and Torque Sensors\nVibration sensors are used for monitoring\
    \ the acceleration machine vibration, indicat-\ning a potential machine issue.\
    \ Some sensors have modern fast Fourier transform signal\nprocessing to detect\
    \ failures in machine components. Vibration sensors are the core of\npreventive\
    \ maintenance and provide the condition of the device determination.\nBarbieri\
    \ et al. [99] proposed autonomous health management prognostics for smart\nmanufacturing\
    \ via on-board sensors. Kiangala and Wang [94] integrated a practical use of\n\
    intelligent sensors in a small bottling plant. Predictive maintenance is used\
    \ for detecting\nearly faults and failures in conveyor motors. Uhlmann et al.\
    \ [117] developed a smart sensor\nnetwork for condition monitoring in factories.\
    \ Collected data from MEMS sensors are\nprocessed in the cloud services and visualised\
    \ on the mobile platform.\nTorsion (torque, rotational) sensors convert a torque\
    \ reaction and rotary into electrical\nsignal. These sensors measure stationary\
    \ or dynamic variables, usually in motors, turbines,\nor generators. Kozlowski\
    \ et al. [110] used a torque sensor for designing a classiﬁer for\ncutting tool\
    \ condition assessment in RUL prediction. Kumar et al. [102] evaluated and\nestimated\
    \ RUL for particular failures in distinct health states and faults. Vlasov et\
    \ al. [119]\nused wireless vibration sensor networks that allow real-time analysis\
    \ of the state of the\nelectronic equipment (motor). The purpose of their approach\
    \ is to minimize the cost of\nmaintenance and develop a system of predictive maintenance\
    \ for optimisation predictive\nrepair. Zhang et al. [121] used vibration sensors\
    \ for accurate prediction of the remaining\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n24 of 40\n\
    useful life of the rotatory machines. Deep learning model combined a long short-term\n\
    memory neural network with an attention mechanism for maintenance in mechanical\n\
    manufacturing.\n4.3.3. Acoustical, Sound, and Ultrasonic Sensors\nAnother group\
    \ of sensors are sensors focused on sound detection, usually via mi-\ncrophone\
    \ devices. When a signal is detected by a sound sensor, the level of voltage is\n\
    translated to the appropriate sound level. Kaptan [126] describes the location\
    \ of city buses\nusing sound sensors and an accelerometer instead of the standard\
    \ global positioning system\n(GPS) location. In such a scenario, the accelerometers\
    \ detect the movement of the vehicle\nand the microphone sensing distinguishes\
    \ the sound level inside and outside the vehicle.\nCompared to GPS location, energy\
    \ savings of up to 46% occur. Another possible usage of\nacoustic sensors is described\
    \ by Ryu [127] in the ﬁeld of material detection. Using machine\nlearning techniques,\
    \ sound sensors are able to estimate relevant information such as the\ncharacter\
    \ of an object and its location. Ultrasonic sensors are non-contact devices using\n\
    the ﬂight of the sound wave greater than that of the human audible range. Similarly,\
    \ as\nwith sonar, the measurement is based on the Doppler Shift principle. Yan\
    \ et al. [120] con-\nducted fusion data mining to predict the remaining life of\
    \ a key component of machining\nequipment by multisource sensors (acoustical,\
    \ vibration, optical, or power).\n4.3.4. Pressure, Force, Touch, and Tension Sensors\n\
    Pressure sensors identify the pressure deviations in the measurement objects or\
    \ envi-\nronment. The change detection is usually based on barometric, piezoelectric,\
    \ capacitive,\noptical, or resonant sensing principles. Examples of these types\
    \ of sensors are Bourdon\ntubes, diaphragms, pressure gauge, or manometers. Tension\
    \ sensors help with the defor-\nmation and movement of the belt automated material\
    \ handling system monitoring for\nintelligent condition-based maintenance [104].\n\
    Force sensors monitor tensile compressive force signal and translate it into an\
    \ output\nelectric signal. Their application includes lead cells, strain gauges,\
    \ or sensing resistors.\nVery popular are piezoelectric and magnetostrictive technologies.\
    \ Another way of sensing\nis based on induction, pneumatic, and hydraulic forces.\n\
    4.3.5. Optical, Light, and Machine Vision Sensors\nAnother type of sensors are\
    \ sensors with a machine vision function. Machine vision\ntechnology has grown\
    \ signiﬁcantly in recent years and is becoming part of autonomous\nvehicles, intelligent\
    \ systems, and robotics. Optical sensor input into the systems makes\nthese systems\
    \ intelligent. Visual data are captured in the form of a series of images and\n\
    after the digitisation process are processed using a machine learning algorithm\
    \ [128,129].\nIn the ﬁeld of material wear detection, three-dimensional (3D) sensors\
    \ are also used, which\nrepresent new technical means for obtaining information.\
    \ Three-dimensional data provides\nmore information and at the same time, reduces\
    \ the deviation of the measured data [130].\nA large group of sensors consists\
    \ of chemical character sensors. Advances in chemical,\nsensing, and wireless\
    \ technologies have accelerated the development of wireless chemical\nsensors.\
    \ These devices allow the collection and distribution of biochemical information.\n\
    The use of these types of sensors can be found in the areas of environmental or\
    \ health\nmonitoring [131,132].\nTarashioon et al. [115] described the design\
    \ of solid-state lighting products based\non the reliability system diagnostics\
    \ (self-maintenance). The light sensor design using\nlight-emitting diode technology\
    \ is used to monitor system ambient light.\n4.3.6. Temperature Sensors\nTemperature\
    \ sensors usually detect changes in machine condition or critical state\nin the\
    \ factory (especially in hazardous environments.). The sensors obtain temperature\n\
    information directly (resistive temperature detectors, thermistors, and thermocouples)\
    \ or\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n25 of 40\nindirectly (infrared sensors). Some of\
    \ these sensors have a temperature display. Infrared\n(IR) sensors work on the\
    \ basis of the optical principle using light. We distinguish reﬂective\nand transmissive\
    \ IR sensors. Reﬂective IR sensors’ transmitter and detector are positioned\n\
    adjacent to each other facing the object. Transmissive sensors use LED and photo\
    \ diodes to\ndetect the object passing between them.\nAnother group of sensors\
    \ consists of probes measuring temperature and humidity.\nAdvances in biomaterials\
    \ offer opportunities to design electronics with unique mechanical\nstability\
    \ capabilities, i.e., sensors whose material composition offers the possibility\
    \ of\napplication in medical implants and disposable wearable devices. Suitable\
    \ applications\ncan be found in the accurate scanning of biological tissues, internal\
    \ organs, but also in the\ntextile and food industry [133].\nBekar et al. [108]\
    \ analysed the real-world industrial data to implement the PdM\nstrategy for the\
    \ manufacturing enterprise. They evaluated the quality of the process,\nvibration\
    \ and temperature data by understanding outliers, and developed maintenance\n\
    solutions. Sadiki et al. [105] show the advantages of condition-based maintenance\
    \ for real-\ntime intelligent monitoring for the industrial machine. Tmote sky\
    \ sensors network and Z1\nmote operate through the edge router and enhance the\
    \ maintenance simulation’s purpose.\nVillalobos et al. [118] introduced a ﬂexible\
    \ forecaster analyser system for anticipation of\nalarms’ activation based on\
    \ the temperature sensor data. The deep learning techniques\nbased on the short-term\
    \ memory recurrent neural network contribute to the predictive\nmaintenance approach.\n\
    4.3.7. Liquid, Flow, Gas, and Chemical Sensors\nFlow sensors enable the possibility\
    \ to analyse the cooling water and lubrication ﬂow\nrate. These sensors use magnetic,\
    \ ultrasonic, or thermal detectors to monitor the current\nintensity in the pipeline.\
    \ Chien and Chen [109] used mass ﬂow controllers for monitoring\nmode and position\
    \ of silane reactant ﬂow. Their research is related to a data-driven\nframework\
    \ for monitoring equipment’s health condition (RUL).\nOil particle sensors enable\
    \ the possibility of monitoring contamination levels in lu-\nbrication systems\
    \ (for example, gear boxes). These sensors target to change the level of\npollution\
    \ based on the presence of the number of substances processed. They analysed the\n\
    light intensity via a laser beam and photo detector.\nHumidity (moisture) sensors\
    \ focused diagnostics on water content in oils to prevent\ncorrosion of machines.\
    \ These sensors are usually installed in a lubrication or hydraulic tank.\nHumidity\
    \ sensors play an essential role in the selected automated manufacturing processes.\n\
    To achieve the desired atmosphere, it is necessary to detect, monitor, and regulate\
    \ humidity\nin conditions of low and high temperatures. The use of sensors for\
    \ moisture detection can\nbe found, for example, in monitoring systems and networks,\
    \ as a monitoring device in\nagriculture, and as a tool for determining soil moisture\
    \ during irrigation. Furthermore,\nalso in the ﬁeld of corrosion diagnostics in\
    \ the areas of infrastructure and construction.\nThe key element in this type\
    \ of sensor is the materials used and the associated availability\nof suitable\
    \ production technologies [134].\n4.3.8. Electronic, Current, Energy, and Magnetic\
    \ Sensors\nEnergy and current measurement sensors ensure the density of electrical\
    \ cable isola-\ntion. Their purpose is to measure the current draw of machines.\
    \ These sensors have been\nused in many industrial areas but have had shortcomings\
    \ regarding demands in the areas\nof miniaturisation, energy consumption, and\
    \ insufﬁcient stability. At present, optical ﬁbres\nand magnetic ﬂuids are widely\
    \ used, due to their versatility of application [135]. In the case\nof electronic\
    \ sensors, these can be, for example, gas sensors that are capable of performing\n\
    sensitive analysis in real time, thanks to their ﬂexibility and the possibility\
    \ of integration\nwith intelligent electronics and mechanical resistance in relation\
    \ to energy consumption,\nand respectively, the performance of electronic components.\
    \ However, balancing these\nvariables offers applications not only in the above\
    \ areas, but also in aviation, aerospace,\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n26 of 40\n\
    and nuclear industry [136] display devices, and there is considerable potential\
    \ in the area\nof environmental monitoring [137]. Zhang et al. [122] described\
    \ a data-driven smart pro-\nduction line with installed energy consumption sensors\
    \ for forecast and fault diagnosis of\nmaintenance.\n4.3.9. Virtual Sensors\n\
    Virtual sensors are advanced applications in the software layer of the machine\
    \ that\nenhance the knowledge of the devices. These state-of-the-art sensors obtained\
    \ data not\nonly from physical machines (for example robots), but also the knowledge\
    \ bases [138].\nAl-Jlibawi et al. [107] call them adaptive soft sensors due to\
    \ their low cost, parallel work,\nrobust characteristics, easy implementation,\
    \ and real-time estimation features. They used\nPLC and SCADA for collecting data\
    \ in the reﬁnery via a distribution control system.\n4.3.10. Nuclear, Chemical,\
    \ Microparticles, and Nanoparticles Sensors\nThe last category consists of sensors\
    \ that are based on modern technologies using\nchemical processes. These are sensors\
    \ based on nanoparticles and microparticles, which\nenable monitoring directly\
    \ inside the monitored object. Lao et al. [111] present a robust\nmoving horizon\
    \ estimation of sensor maintenance based on the observation and monitoring\nof\
    \ chemical processes. Comparison of four simulations demonstrates the economic\
    \ perfor-\nmance advantages of sensor-predictive maintenance. Jia et al. [139]\
    \ described the design\nof the nanosensors for detection of antibiotics to prevent\
    \ the production of resistance to\nantibiotics. Nanomaterial chemistry is used\
    \ for developing current arsenic detection nanos-\ntructures [140]. The main advantages\
    \ of nanomaterials are the high ﬂexibility, sensitivity,\ncompatibility, and stretchability\
    \ of sensors in electronics devices [141].\n5. Discussion\nThe discussion is divided\
    \ into two parts. First, we discuss the sensor-based smart\nfactory to imagine\
    \ the factories of the future. Then, in the second part, we focus on insights\n\
    and future research issues related to intelligent sensors.\n5.1. Sensor-Based\
    \ Smart Factory Discussion\nThe essence of the use of intelligent sensors based\
    \ on IoT lies in smart factories,\nwhich have modern sensor technology, intelligent\
    \ analytical programs, and networking\ncomponents of production (machines, supplies,\
    \ components, ﬁnal products, equipment,\netc.). Smart factories are a new way\
    \ of organizing production. Their goal is to better serve\ncustomers through greater\
    \ production ﬂexibility and resource optimisation. The factories of\nthe future\
    \ combine the efﬁciency of mass production with custom production and optimize\n\
    the supply chain in real-time thanks to the Internet connection [142]. These factories\
    \ handle\nﬂuctuations in demand, which are fully automated and fault-durable.\
    \ The smart factory\nis connected to the Internet, however it has advanced security\
    \ against cyberattacks that\nwould jeopardize production.\nWe summarised the intelligent\
    \ sensor advantages in Figure 10 based on Reference [143].\nSensitivity is deﬁned\
    \ as the relation unit change between output and input. Smart sensors\nsuch as\
    \ IoT devices are wireless, using the internet and usually cloud. Intelligent\
    \ sensors\nhave low power consumption, automatic diagnostics, calibration, and\
    \ the ability to process\nand share data in real-time. Robust means good durable\
    \ material, solid welds, seals, pot-\nting, chemical compatibility, secured wires,\
    \ and other situational protection. Automatic\ndiagnostics are related to the\
    \ possibility for making decisions or proceeding action-based\nactions for control.\
    \ Some authors emphasise low cost as a feature for smart sensors, but we\nthink\
    \ that it depends on user experience and sensor value added.\nSensors 2021, 21,\

    In smart factories, thanks to intelligent sensors, each product actively participates\
    \ in\nthe production process. The components to be processed contain digital information\
    \ on\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n28 of 40\nhow to process them. They, therefore,\
    \ communicate directly with robots and production\nmachines. With the help of\
    \ a chip with radio frequency identiﬁcation or other sensor\ntechnology, it can\
    \ control its production ﬂow. A smart product has access to knowledge\nrelated\
    \ to its structure, composition, or purpose [149]. On the other hand, thanks to\
    \ this\nconnection, the customer uses the user interface and intervenes in production\
    \ in real-time.\nThe sensors allow the customer to obtain information for creating\
    \ the product speciﬁcation,\nand its adjustment according to needs and requirements\
    \ [150]. Autonomous vehicles\npowered by electricity are also connected to the\
    \ system, ensuring the transport of stock and\nﬁnal products around the factory.\
    \ Vehicle control is provided by a sophisticated system of\nsensors. Parts, materials,\
    \ and components needed for production are transported to the\nfactory when they\
    \ are really needed for production (Just-in-Time system). Sensors and\npossibly\
    \ drones constantly check stock in a smart factory [151].\nWe performed profound\
    \ words’ analysis of full-text papers to ﬁnd phrases containing\nthe terms “smart”\
    \ or “intelligent”. Figure 11 shows that the obtained keywords form vari-\nous\
    \ clusters and subclusters related to the predictive maintenance process. We identiﬁed\n\
    four main components of the Smart and Intelligent Predictive Maintenance (SIPM)\
    \ system\nfor smart factories based on cluster analysis. These are the production\
    \ system, the moni-\ntoring system, the factory planning system, and the maintenance\
    \ system. The production\nsystem of SIPM is based on energy saving control, transportation,\
    \ and economics costs,\nwith use of controllers for predictive maintenance based\
    \ on data analysis, and equipment\ndiagnostics. The monitoring system uses condition-based\

    We discussed the results and interpreted them in the perspective of previous studies\n\
    and research. Predictive maintenances in Cavalieri-Salaﬁa’s model [153] includes\
    \ data\nacquisition from sensors, data manipulation (ﬁltering, transforming, removing\
    \ noise),\naggregation, prediction, decision-making, scheduling, and further monitoring\
    \ of status and\nconﬁguration. Similarly, it describes the process of data acquisition,\
    \ data processing, and\nmachine decision-making [154]. Possible application of\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) for pre-\nventive maintenance is discussed by Carlson\
    \ and Sakao [155]. Modern systems are based\non the Internet of Things that enable\
    \ real-time prediction and data sharing [96]. Uhlmann\net al. [117] described\
    \ the solution of sensor network enhanced by cloud. The edge technolo-\ngies [156]\
    \ allow integration between PLC and cloud for modern sensors. Miniaturisation\n\
    of current sensors and nanotechnology [157] provides higher ﬂexibility of maintenance\n\
    systems. Fernandes et al. [158] emphasise the role of data visualisation, data\
    \ mining, and\ndata storage. These models have a standard data ﬂow process which\
    \ is a part of the possible\nprediction preparation. It is necessary to set a\
    \ reliability model to analyse the dataset [159].\nRuhi and Karim [160] show that\
    \ a suitable statistical model can be applied to estimate the\noptimum maintenance\
    \ period at a minimum cost. Stodola and Stodola [161] pointed out\nthat a useful\
    \ model needs to consider human factors and related issues such as labour\nintensity,\
    \ administrative, and human errors.\n5.2. Discussion on Insights and Future Research\
    \ Issues\nWe discussed practical considerations and potential avenues for future\
    \ research.\nThe following directions have been identiﬁed for potential further\
    \ work.\n5.2.1. Wireless Network of Sensors\nOne of the current trends is the\
    \ use of a wireless network of sensors (WSN), which\naccording to Vlasov et al.\
    \ [119] consists of intelligent sensors for sensing physical parame-\nters. The\
    \ individual sensors act as network elements (nodes) that can read, process, and\n\
    transmit wireless data in smart factories. They consist of processing, communication,\n\
    and the sensor unit. WSN is a network of Micro-Electro-Mechanical systems (MEMS)\
    \ of\nsensor devices [162]. MEMS offers a high potential for condition monitoring\
    \ applications.\nThese sensors are, in comparison to industrial sensors, cost-effective,\
    \ wireless, and highly\nintegrable and conﬁgurable [117]. Part of these networks\
    \ could be process controllers (ac-\ntuators) that communicate data and operate\
    \ some units [163]. The cyber-physical systems\nintegrate these sensors and actuator\
    \ networks into a coherent form. Vlasov et al. [119] show\nthat the use of wireless\
    \ communication channels in the monitoring system is driven by the\nsensor network\
    \ in the shortest possible time. Uhlmann et al. [117] pointed out their main\n\
    advantage—low cost. Sadiki et al. [105] recommend to check the viability of these\
    \ network\napplications before their implementation in factories to save operation\
    \ costs and improve\nreal-time monitoring performance. Main advantages of industrial\
    \ WSN, summarising\nKumar et al. [163], are: minimal cost and compactness, interoperability,\
    \ resistance to noise\n(and co-existence), self-organizing, robustness (fault-tolerance),\
    \ link-reliability, energy con-\nsumption, low-delay, service differentiation\
    \ and quality, scalability, predictable behaviour,\nmultiple sources, data aggregation,\
    \ and speciﬁc protocols. However, the limitations of\nwireless sensors are the\
    \ spatial arrangement in the environment, deployment time, mainte-\nnance cost\
    \ of communication channels [119], scalability, and lack of protocols. Flammini\n\
    et al. [164] emphasised that fault assumption and transmission errors are more\
    \ frequent\nin wired communication than on wired links. Thus, data quality (in\
    \ terms of validity,\nintegrity, accuracy, and reliability) is an important factor\
    \ of wired networks connected to\nthe internet [165].\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n\
    30 of 40\n5.2.2. Dominance of Vibration and Temperature Sensors for Maintenance\n\
    The analysis of the types of sensors used for predictive maintenance in Section\
    \ 4.3 showed\nthat vibration and temperature sensors are most often used. According\
    \ to Uhlmann [117],\nthe number of powerful MEMS sensors such as vibration and\
    \ temperature sensors has in-\ncreased. Vibration can identify problems before\
    \ other symptoms, such as temperature, sound,\npower consumption, and contaminated\
    \ lubricants. When the first signs of a malfunction\nappear, there is usually\
    \ only a few months left until a complete machine downtime. Vibration\nmonitoring\
    \ enables to determine which phase of the fault curve the machine is currently\
    \ in.\nExcessive vibration is usually the first symptom of internal problems,\
    \ such as defective bear-\nings, imbalances, misalignments, and loose components,\
    \ that shorten the life of the equipment.\nOnly after detectable changes in vibration\
    \ is it possible to detect possible errors using power,\nparticle, or infrared\
    \ sensors. Finally, errors also appear on the temperature sensors. According\n\
    to Barbieri et al. [99], vibrational signals are a starting point of the component\
    \ degradation\nmodel. Crucial decision lies in the selection of adequate signals\
    \ for failure estimation and main-\ntenance prediction. The further research challenge\
    \ in infrared thermography is the signal and\nimage processing to enhance the\
    \ detection and simplify the interpretation of the results [166].\nAkerberg et\
    \ al. [167] pointed out that the requirements for vibration sensors, battery lifetime,\n\
    update frequency, and security are lower than for flow, torque, or proximity sensors.\
    \ The\nmain benefits of vibration sensors are predictability of impending failures,\
    \ machine safety, cost,\nextended maintenance intervals, machine reliability,\
    \ and confidence in scheduled maintenance.\nIn the future, these advantages resulting\
    \ from the use of vibration sensors can be obtained by\nusing new types of sensors,\
    \ for example, virtual sensors or nanosensors, etc. For this reason,\ncurrent\
    \ research is focused on minimizing the costs and flexibility of vibration and\
    \ temperature\nsensor solutions.\n5.2.3. Challenges of the Deep Learning and Big\
    \ Data Analytics\nComponents connected to the network generate a large amount\
    \ of heterogeneous\ndata that smart industry systems must process. Large industrial\
    \ data is collected from\nmultiple sources, such as devices, products, and customers,\
    \ in heterogeneous forms [108].\nTheir analysis is crucial for companies in almost\
    \ all market sectors. Advanced analysis of\nbig data is a way to get to know customers\
    \ and devices (machine state) in detail. Companies\nthat use it will be able to\
    \ provide customers with literally “tailor-made” services, lower\nmoods, and increase\
    \ efﬁciency in production, including maintenance. Thanks to the current\ncapacity\
    \ of computer technology, even large volumes of data can be processed faster,\
    \ which\nallows smart industry systems to move information in real-time. Farooq\
    \ et al. [38] consider\nindustrial prognosis and applying predictive analytics\
    \ using machine learning techniques\nas new challenges to identify failure modes\
    \ and reduce downtime. The application of the\nsimulation enhances more possibilities\
    \ for after-market services, such as maintenance [92].\nLearning and intelligent\
    \ techniques such as deep learning to analyse industrial big data\nare proposed\
    \ as future directions in maintenance [103,120]. We consider the main problem\n\
    in the ﬁeld of data analysis to be the inability to translate and create a business\
    \ case for\nanalysts with a comprehensive view. This means that there is no concept\
    \ of how to evaluate\nthe analytical results and translate them into actions (for\
    \ example, maintenance schedules).\nCompanies often make the mistake of supplementing\
    \ random ﬁndings instead of a selective\nand targeted approach such as predictive\
    \ maintenance. Results of the analysis must lead to\nconclusions, which requires\
    \ a properly chosen tool for data visualisation. Other possible\nresearch directions\
    \ are related to virtual metrology [109].\n5.2.4. Challenge of Interoperability\n\
    Interconnectivity is a prerequisite for the existence of a smart industry. It\
    \ is not just\na peripheral connection of one device to another or a centralised\
    \ connection of the ma-\nchine to the control system, but a complex network. In\
    \ a corporate environment, this\nmeans connecting machines, people, materials,\
    \ products, information and communica-\ntion technologies and systems, and, ﬁnally,\
    \ data in the form of documents. Scalability\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n31 of 40\n\
    enables possible network size enhancing or reduction based on the industrial require-\n\
    ments. This needs appropriate protocols, standards, and robust integration of\
    \ hundreds\nof network nodes. Interoperability is linked to their compatibility,\
    \ i.e., all elements of the\nindustrial Internet of Things should be able to communicate\
    \ with each other (exchange\ndata) and interact. Through standardisation, disparate\
    \ systems that work together can be\nsoldered into a single process. Today’s factories\
    \ already use sensor systems for various\nmeasurements and operations. The use\
    \ of new solutions must work with these old systems.\nThis problem is caused by\
    \ a lack of robustness, time constraints, and service-differentiated\nprotocols.\
    \ One of the future solutions is, for example, the oneM2M [168] or OPC Uniﬁed\n\
    Architecture [169] industry communication standards, which are platform-independent\n\
    and support semantic interoperability [170]. On these platforms, data objects\
    \ and each\ndevice have well-deﬁned behaviour on the network, and the capability\
    \ of horizontal com-\nmunication between individual devices processing in real-time.\
    \ There is a possibility to\nconnect other components (such as plug and produce),\
    \ which then have their image in the\ncloud.\n5.2.5. Challenges of Control and\
    \ Maintenance Systems Decentralisation\nMany of the wireless sensor networks still\
    \ have centralised control (so-called “network\nmanager”). Centralised server-client\
    \ systems had one central database, which leads to data\nconsistency, easy administration,\
    \ and a high level of security. However, centralisation can\nresult in the failure\
    \ of a single point. High trafﬁc can overload the bottleneck. A centralised\n\
    “network management” system can be slow and take a vest to lose data packets.\
    \ It is\nessential to use decentralised solutions within complex digital ecosystems,\
    \ such as pro-\nduction factories. The responsibility and need to make operational\
    \ decisions is performed\nat lower levels. A distributed architecture based on\
    \ decentralisation is suitable for their\ncoordination and management [171]. Coordination\
    \ between the individual nodes involved\nin cyber-physical systems requires communication\
    \ between the elements. The beneﬁt of the\ndistributed architecture of components\
    \ connected to the network and decentralised smart\nindustry systems is the expandability\
    \ (scalability) of the network, as well as the increased\nresistance to failures\
    \ of the network itself, individual connected systems, as well as their\ncomponents.\
    \ For example, Kiangala and Wang [94] proposed a decentralised monitoring\nsystem\
    \ with a cloud-based dashboard displaying real-time reports for every maintenance\n\
    schedule generated. Zhang et al. [122] consider as a future trend services in\
    \ cyberspace\nthat control, plan, and schedule production line items in a timely\
    \ way. Smart Industry\nsystems already use intelligent algorithms to monitor,\
    \ control, manage, and plan complex\nprocesses and operations throughout the production\
    \ process and supply chain. Advanced\ncognitive technologies will be gradually\
    \ implemented in production systems to increase\nthe autonomy of individual components\
    \ of the network. These systems use the principles\nof collective intelligence\
    \ in industrial processes, especially solutions based on multiagent\nsystems.\
    \ The future of these systems lies in achieving a high level of artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    that will use the collective knowledge of all parts of the network.\n5.2.6. High\
    \ Potential of Virtual- and Nano-Sensors\nSensor technology, the elements informing\
    \ about the state and activity of the object, is\ncurrently unprecedented and\
    \ developed in various industries due to its reliability. Sensors\nas sources\
    \ of primary information about the real environment are the input element of\n\
    practically all control, measuring, and automation systems today, and together\
    \ with mi-\ncrosystems, they accompany human activity (via biometric sensors)\
    \ at almost every step.\nAn interesting trend can be traced in the development\
    \ of electronics and microelectronics\nin sensor systems, which include circuits\
    \ for signal processing, analysis, and uniﬁcation\nin a single compact design\
    \ with a sensor element. In optimizing this process, a tighter\nsystem connection\
    \ of electronics and microelectronics with related elements of optics or\nﬁne\
    \ mechanics within mechatronics is increasingly being applied. The intention of\
    \ such an\ninterconnection is to achieve the development and production integration\
    \ of entire systems\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n32 of 40\non a single chip, from\
    \ input sensors to various types of actuators. From another point of\nview, it\
    \ is possible to see the inﬂuence of miniaturisation and new sensor types such\
    \ as\nnanosensors. The higher resistance of the sensors to mechanical inﬂuences,\
    \ acceleration,\nand vibrations also leads to their placement directly in the\
    \ parts of the system, which in\nmany cases gives the function of the sensor a\
    \ wider range. Nanosensors have, due to\nminiaturisation, good preconditions for\
    \ massive use in smart factories. These trends are\ncurrently aided by the search\
    \ for ways to create wireless sensor networks with remote\ndata transmission.\
    \ Al-Jlibawi et al. [107] described the properties of soft (virtual) sen-\nsors\
    \ and their function in parallel work with physical sensors and industrial processes.\n\
    Virtual sensors are used for damage detection [172], industrial robot interaction\
    \ [173],\nidentiﬁcation, and approximation tasks, or for digital twin applications.\
    \ On-line evaluation\nof input effects directly in the actuator can then lead\
    \ to a “sensor-less” system, whose other\nadvantage, in addition to lower one-time\
    \ investment costs, should be the greater reliability\nof the system with protection\
    \ against possible outages. Li et al. [165] described automatic\ncontrol systems\
    \ without sensors based on wireless nodes, RIFID, and programmable logic\ncontroller\
    \ (PLC). Automated devices perform their tasks based on industrial wireless nodes\n\
    fully responsible for communication. Controllers have the automation control function\n\
    based on the received commands from other devices in the network.\n5.2.7. Challenges\
    \ of Availability and Reconﬁgurability of Sensors\nThe development of industry\
    \ systems is progressing towards their maximum modular-\nity and capability of\
    \ autonomous reconﬁguration based on automatic situation recognition.\nThe self-organisation\
    \ of production processes therefore also includes reconﬁgurability, char-\nacterised\
    \ as independent adaptability to internal and external conditions. Condition-based\n\
    systems are being developed in the ﬁeld of maintenance. The main problem in the\
    \ future\nmay be the use of old sensors (installed on older devices in production),\
    \ which will lead\nto unacceptably high manufacturing and maintenance costs in\
    \ the long term. Kozlowski\net al. [110] mentioned the unavailability of devices\
    \ (CNC machines) on the market to struc-\nturally optimally distributed sensors\
    \ on machine parts. Related to this issue is the problem\nof today’s industrial\
    \ practice—the lack of appropriate measurement signals. The result is\nthe need\
    \ for additional installation of sensors on the device. A problem with the weak\
    \ sig-\nnal from the sensors can lead to injury, product losses, and production\
    \ outages. Even small\nand temporary communication errors can cause signiﬁcant\
    \ production interruptions [167].\nThis production issue can be caused by signal\
    \ inference from devices that operate on the\nsame frequency. It means that at\
    \ the same time, waves and signals coexist in a given\nenvironment, which disrupt\
    \ the function of the sensors. This problem can be described as\na real-time availability\
    \ issue. Lao et al. [111] show that preventive maintenance of sensors\nand actuators\
    \ in real-time can signiﬁcantly mitigate the damage from production losses,\n\
    process upsets, and downtime based on speciﬁc routine regulations.\n5.2.8. Security\
    \ and Safety Challenge\nThe severity of cyber security issues is growing, along\
    \ with our growing dependence\non technology, both personally and socially. In\
    \ production, important data is collected by\nincreasingly connecting production\
    \ systems or even the robots themselves to computer\nnetworks, sometimes with\
    \ communication to the cloud, and new security risks arise. Ba-\nsic cyber security\
    \ principles can signiﬁcantly improve the security of connected devices.\nThe\
    \ contemporary challenge of safety is the security of the stored data from sensors.\
    \ In ad-\ndition to the sensors that collect data, which is a physical prerequisite\
    \ for the Industry 4.0\nconcept, the sovereignty of the data is important [174],\
    \ especially from a psychological\npoint of view. Only enterprises that trust\
    \ the security of their networks are also willing\nto store and share their data.\
    \ Sensor security does not require high demands on battery\ncapacity. However,\
    \ security is considered too complicated, especially for IoT, due to the\nuse\
    \ of various techniques such as keying to protect authentication, cryptographic\
    \ code\nveriﬁcation, security gateways [175], safety protocols, remote wireless\
    \ security manage-\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n33 of 40\nment [176], or security\
    \ analysis to detect attacks. Almost all interconnected systems have\ntheir weaknesses\
    \ that their creators are unaware of. For this reason, prevention is particu-\n\
    larly important [167]. An important factor due to the number of interconnected\
    \ devices is\nthe cost of security. Gungor and Hancke [177] point out that security\
    \ is a crucial feature in\ndesigning wireless sensor networks. Safe communication\
    \ protects against external attacks\nand intrusion.\n6. Conclusions\nThe fourth\
    \ industrial revolution is permeating the industry, enabling an increasing\nnumber\
    \ of enterprises to have an incomparably greater overview of their production\n\
    and maintenance activities than ever before. The deployment of highly reliable\
    \ and\nlow-maintenance devices contributes to the precise planning of production\
    \ capacity and\nequipment’s associated maintenance.\nThe ﬁrst research question\
    \ relates to the contemporary trends in the maintenance\nprocesses of smart factories.\
    \ The number of papers discussing the key terms sensors,\nsmart factories, and\
    \ preventive maintenance increased over time, mostly in the last years.\nWe found\
    \ that the contemporary burst trend is related to Industry 4.0 technology. Predic-\n\
    tive maintenance, smart factories, and intelligent sensors publications, together\
    \ concerned\ntopics mainly related to deep machine learning, Internet of Things,\
    \ and big data analytics.\nThe maintenance process in smart factories is based\
    \ on digitisation, data-driven manufac-\nturing, agent-based systems, and digital\
    \ twins. Intelligent sensors in such factories use\nedge, fog, and deep learning\
    \ methods for control of manufacturing processes. In the future,\nInternet and\
    \ blockchain will be important for predictive maintenance.\nSmart and intelligent\
    \ predictive maintenance is characterised to answer a second\nresearch question.\
    \ Here, the results show four different types of maintenance used in smart\nfactories—Industry\
    \ 4.0 for predictive maintenance, smart manufacturing for condition-\nbased maintenance,\
    \ fault diagnosis for maintenance and prognostics, and remaining useful\nlife\
    \ analysis. The importance of predictive maintenance is also growing due to the\
    \ growing\nnumber of robots, digitisation, and artiﬁcial intelligence introduced\
    \ into production lines\nto automate routine activities.\nFollowing the third\
    \ question’s answer, we can state that the three types of sensors are\nmainly\
    \ used for predictive maintenance in smart factories. Firstly, intelligent sensors\
    \ which\nhave the potential to connect to higher-level systems. Furthermore, there\
    \ is a possibility to\nconnect these intelligent sensors to the internet—to build\
    \ up the IoT devices. Finally, we can\nuse the gathered data in cloud-related\
    \ technologies. The most prevalent methods used\nfor collecting and monitoring\
    \ machines and devices are vibration analysis [120], SCADA\nsystems, CNC machine\
    \ sensors, and PLCs. Based on the deep analysis, we conclude that\nthe current\
    \ trend, insights, and future research issues are characterised by:\n•\nUsage\
    \ of multisource wireless networks of sensors in predictive maintenance.\n•\n\
    Dominance of vibration and temperature sensors for predictive maintenance.\n•\n\
    Challenges of the big data analytics and deep learning techniques.\n•\nChallenges\
    \ of interoperability of multiple sensors and maintenance systems.\n•\nDecentralisation\
    \ of maintenance control systems.\n•\nHigh potential of virtual sensors and nanosensors\
    \ for the future.\n•\nChallenge of availability and reconﬁgurability of sensors.\n\
    •\nSecurity and safety of sensor data.\nBased on the results synthesis, we proposed\
    \ the Smart and Intelligent Predictive Main-\ntenance (SIPM) system for smart\
    \ factory concerning four major subsystems: production,\nmonitoring, planning,\
    \ and maintenance. These subsystems communicate and collaborate\nthrough modern\
    \ IoT and cloud-based technologies. Their main advantage is real-time\nmanagement\
    \ and planning to reduce the economic costs caused by production downtime.\nFrom\
    \ a managerial point of view, the predictive maintenance system in smart factories\n\
    is an early warning, especially in high-risk industries. The ability to detect\
    \ weak signals\nof potentially signiﬁcant strategic impact is a welcome positive\
    \ in a turbulent business\nSensors 2021, 21, 1470\n34 of 40\nenvironment. The\
    \ system of predictive maintenance does not reduce the responsibility\nor the\
    \ possibility of personal development of employees, but it must be stimulated\
    \ by\nresponsible managers. It offers the possibility to reduce the number of\
    \ hierarchical levels\nbetween managers and ordinary employees, so that you can\
    \ bring about higher employee\nautonomy and help other innovation processes to\
    \ be implemented effectively. The challenge\nfor managers today is to select criteria\
    \ based on which they will be able to select intelligent\nsensors for smart factories.\
    \ There is a wide range of sensors on the market and the\nauthors most often state\
    \ the criteria of sensor sensitivity, sensor cost, ﬂexibility, and size\n(miniaturity).\n\
    Further research may comprise the advanced machine learning methods as deep\n\
    learning, data-driven algorithms. The new concept called “Machine as a Service”\
    \ (MaaS)\ntakes over the software as a service (SaaS) model and is another trend\
    \ suitable for future\nresearch. An interesting direction of future research concerns\
    \ building performance model\nevaluation related to the reasonable cost. The cost/beneﬁt\
    \ analysis of using preventive\ntools in contrast to sustainability requirements\
    \ is challenging for research.\nThis work suffers from several limitations, notably\
    \ related to publication collections,\nﬁltering, and analysis. The search strategy\
    \ is biased by the problematic synonym of the\nterm “factory”. Primarily, the\
    \ term “plant” is not interchangeable in the same meaning.\nThe study is limited\
    \ because we omitted highly cited publications related to medicine in\nburst analysis.\
    \ Our goal was to bring the reader closer manufacturing- and production-\nrelated\
    \ publications. Investigated trends in burst detection analysis have weights based\
    \ on\noccurrence in publication titles. Results do not show the quality of publication\
    \ based on\nthe times cited. Thus, we instead present examples of highly cited\
    \ publications of most\nimportant burst terms. The lack of a comprehensive review\
    \ due to a steadily increasing\nnumber of related works is another notable limitation\
    \ of this study.\nSupplementary Materials: The PRISMA Checklist (Table S1) and\

    \ projected to increase to 9 billion by 2050,\nfood production will need to increase\
    \ from its current level. The bulk of this growth will need to\ncome from smallholder\
    \ farmers who rely on generational knowledge in their farming practices and\n\
    who live in locations where weather patterns and seasons are becoming less predictable\
    \ due to\nclimate change. The expansion of internet-connected devices is increasing\
    \ opportunities to apply\ndigital tools and services on smallholder farms, including\
    \ monitoring soil and plants in horticulture,\nwater quality in aquaculture, and\
    \ ambient environments in greenhouses. In combination with other\nfood security\
    \ eﬀorts, internet of things (IoT)-enabled precision smallholder farming has the\
    \ potential\nto improve livelihoods and accelerate low- and middle-income countries’\
    \ journey to self-reliance.\nUsing a combination of interviews, surveys and site\
    \ visits to gather information, this research\npresents a review of the current\
    \ state of the IoT for on-farm measurement, cases of successful IoT\nimplementation\
    \ in low- and middle-income countries, challenges associated with implementing\
    \ the\nIoT on smallholder farms, and recommendations for practitioners.\nKeywords:\
    \ internet of things; low-cost sensors; smallholder agriculture; global engineering\n\
    1. Introduction\nIn the 1930s, one farmer in the United States could grow enough\
    \ to feed four people. Today,\none farmer can feed 155 people [1]. Approximately\
    \ 1 billion people worldwide are involved in\nagriculture, and although the total\
    \ number of farmers are declining, the demand for agricultural\ncrops is expected\
    \ to double as the world population reaches 9 billion by 2050 [2]. This will require\n\
    an increase in agricultural productivity, especially from low- and middle-income\
    \ countries (LMICs).\nRecent technological advances have contributed to the rise\
    \ of precision agriculture, enabling farmers\nto make better decisions with more\
    \ information about their soil, water, crop, and local climate [3,4].\nHowever,\
    \ uptake of these advances has been limited to commercial-scale and cash-crop\
    \ cultivation [1].\nThere is a growing body of evidence, which indicates that\
    \ the implementation of precision\nagriculture tools and practices across diﬀerent\
    \ types of farming oﬀers beneﬁts. For example, a digital\ndecision support system\
    \ (DSS) that utilized crop information provided by growers, in combination\nwith\
    \ weather data, eﬀectively alerted growers when to apply fungicide to their potatoes,\
    \ resulting\nin the eﬀective mitigation of late blight disease and more eﬃcient\
    \ fungicide use, saving them up\nto 500 USD per acre cultivated [5–7]. Another\
    \ DSS platform integrated weather data and electrical\ncapacitance sensors for\
    \ real-time monitoring of soil water content along with soil water balance and\n\
    irrigation scheduling models to provide recommendations to durum wheat farmers\
    \ on timing and\nintensity of irrigation, resulting in water savings of at least\
    \ 25% compared to traditional scheduling\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750; doi:10.3390/su12093750\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n2 of 19\n\
    practices [8]. In another common application, optical sensors attached to fertilizer\
    \ equipment measure\nthe light reﬂectance at speciﬁc wavebands, which are related\
    \ to chlorophyll content, an indicator of\nplant nitrogen (N) content, and fertilizer\
    \ is applied in that location based on the estimated N deﬁciency.\nCompared to\
    \ the grower selected constant-rate, sensor-enabled variable-rate fertilization\
    \ has been\nshown to increase corn N uptake by more than 20% [9] and save 10–15\
    \ kg N per acre of corn and cotton,\nespecially when soil N content varies year-to-year\
    \ [10].\nSmallholder farms account for a large share of agricultural production\
    \ in LMICs and help\nmaintain the genetic diversity of food supply, and mitigate\
    \ the risks of nutritional deﬁciencies and\necosystem degradation [11]. However,\
    \ they face challenges including pressures on farmland from\npopulation growth\
    \ and urbanization, and an inability to rely on generational knowledge and practices\n\
    due to climate change. Technology advances made through precision agriculture\
    \ could address\nsome of these challenges [3,12–14]. The internet-of-things (IoT)\
    \ and the services that it enables has\ncontributed to the rise of precision agriculture,\
    \ and it is being applied in smallholder agriculture [4,15,16].\nHowever, limited\
    \ research exists that reports outcomes and challenges for implementation of the\
    \ IoT\nin smallholder agriculture [3,17]. Thus, this article aims to illustrate\
    \ the current landscape of the IoT in\nsmallholder farming, summarize speciﬁc\
    \ implementation cases, and describe some of the challenges\nand recommendations\
    \ in order to direct this sector.\nA typical IoT for agriculture system consists\
    \ of the following: (i) measurement device, (ii) data\ntransmission, (iii) data\
    \ storage and analytics, (iv) feedback and implementation, and (v) project\nstructure\
    \ and support (Figure 1). The device layer consists of a sensor to measure the\
    \ parameter of\ninterest (e.g., soil moisture) and the electronics necessary to\
    \ support its functions. Devices are arranged\nin a topology and connected to\
    \ a gateway using a communication protocol in the data transmission\nlayer. Broad\
    \ coverage of cellular networks allows for frequent, and in some cases near real-time,\n\
    data transmission. Individual or aggregated measurements are received by a server\
    \ where they can be\nqueried, cleaned, and analyzed. Relevant insights are fed\
    \ back to an end-user or other IoT devices to\ninform decisions and prompt actions.\
    \ A vast catalog of existing products and services that are tailored\nfor speciﬁc\
    \ applications make each of these operations increasingly easier and provide a\
    \ lower cost to\nimplement. More detailed introductions to IoT architecture design\
    \ and theory can be found in [18,19].\nThis review primarily focuses on categories\
    \ (i) and (ii), accompanied by discussion of the implications\non (v).\nFigure\
    \ 1. Internet of things (IoT) for agriculture architecture.\nAn important enabler\
    \ for IoT services in LMICs (and a sub-set of LMICs—global food security\nstrategy\
    \ (GFSS) countries [20]) is reliable cellular infrastructure [21]. Country level\
    \ data from the\nWorld Bank suggests that the GFSS country set average for cellular\
    \ connections and smartphone\npenetration is on par with India, a common benchmark\
    \ for digital services among developing countries\n(Figure 2). However, the linkage\
    \ has not yet been made to the agricultural sector. Internet usage in\nGFSS countries\
    \ ranges from 10%–50% of the population and correlates inversely with the population\n\
    Sustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n3 of 19\nemployed in agriculture (Figure 3a). Where\
    \ access to internet falls short, digital services often beneﬁt\nfrom cellular\
    \ connectivity. However, while agricultural productivity has increased in most\
    \ GFSS\ncountries, those gains show no correlation with mobile phone penetration\
    \ (Figure 3b). For example,\na recent study has shown that mobile phone ownership\
    \ in farming households is nearly universal;\nhowever, fewer than 25% use a phone\
    \ to access information about agriculture and livestock, or for\nbuying and selling\
    \ products [22]. These data, and more from the GFSS agriculture dataset, can be\n\
    accessed in the Supplementary Materials.\nFigure 2. Mobile phone subscriptions\
    \ and smartphone penetration across the global food security\nstrategy (GFSS)\
    \ country set, India, China, and the United States [23,24].\nFigure 3. (a) Agriculture\
    \ and internet usage across the GFSS country set, India, China, and the United\n\
    States [23] (b) Crop productivity and mobile connectivity [23]. Crop production\
    \ index (CPI) shows\nagricultural production for each year relative to the base\
    \ period 2004–2006 (CPI = 100). It includes all\ncrops except fodder crops.\n\
    2. Approach\nA mixed method approach consisting of a combination of literature\
    \ reviews, expert interviews,\nweb-based surveys, and site visits were used to\
    \ carry out this research [25–27]. The literature review\nincluded a review of\
    \ 87 relevant publications, which are catalogued in an open online repository\
    \ [25].\nThis review provided an overview of sensors and IoT for agriculture globally.\
    \ Next, 25 interviews with\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n4 of 19\nrelevant experts\
    \ worldwide were conducted. These expert interviews were used to identify the\

    \ directions for technology\ndevelopment in this sector. Seventy web-based surveys\
    \ were then distributed to stakeholders in the\nIoT and agricultural technology\
    \ communities from which we received 37 responses; these web-based\nsurveys served\
    \ to not only triangulate the expert interview data, but also to provide use case\
    \ proﬁles\nfor our site visits. Finally, ﬁve site visits and discussions with\
    \ farmers at IoT implementation sites in\nIndia and Kenya were conducted. The\
    \ site visits were used to validate ﬁndings from the literature\nreview, expert\
    \ interviews, and web-based surveys. Two countries were selected for the site\
    \ visits;\n(i) India, which was selected because of the large number of agricultural\
    \ technologies being piloted\nand implemented there on smallholder farms, and\
    \ (ii) Kenya, where we conducted a majority of our\nsite visits. Among the diﬀerent\
    \ GFSS countries, Kenya had the most active IoT for agriculture projects,\nand\
    \ this inﬂuenced our selection.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Current State\
    \ of IoT for Agriculture\nFor this overview of IoT for agriculture, sensor and\
    \ communication technology applications\nare classiﬁed into ﬁve categories of\
    \ (a) climate, (b) livestock, (c) plant, (d) soil, and (e) water.\nWithin each\
    \ category, there are many common, measurable parameters that can inﬂuence the\n\
    performance of the agricultural system (Figure 4). This categorization focuses\
    \ on “ground-based”\nmeasurements, while other methods exist including aerial-\
    \ and space-based earth observation or\nremote sensing, for example in [26,28].\
    \ In some cases, remote sensing and ground-based measurements\nare combined to\
    \ provide temporally (ground-based sensors) and spatially (remote sensing) dense\
    \ crop\nmeasurements [29].\nFigure 4. Measurement categories and related measurable\
    \ parameters.\nTable 1 summarizes common electronic sensors, their applications\
    \ in agriculture, and articles\nthat describe those in more detail. Wherever available,\
    \ articles that report on applications in LMICs\nare included, although relevant\
    \ precision agriculture research from across the globe is also included.\nSome\
    \ parameters can use diﬀerent technologies to estimate the same output. Methods\
    \ for measuring\nbasic agricultural parameters, including soil and atmospheric\
    \ conditions, are well-established,\nand commercial products are available for\
    \ IoT applications. New applications for optical sensors,\nin particular, are\
    \ evolving as the cost of semiconductor technology and data storage and transmission\n\
    decreases. A particular challenge with using low-cost sensors in agriculture is\
    \ the need to calibrate the\nsensor for the speciﬁc implementation conditions.\
    \ For applications where artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is\napplied to classify events\
    \ based on measurement patterns, complex training datasets are necessary to\n\
    teach the AI algorithm.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n5 of 19\nTable 1. Sensor\

    \ careful consideration should be given to the path and\nprocess by which measurements\
    \ are transformed into insights. Data transmission can represent a\nmajor challenge\
    \ in smallholder agriculture applications. Edge computing is becoming more common\n\
    in commercial IoT products, in which onboard device memory and processing capacity\
    \ is utilized to\ncarry out some data reduction and analysis [80]. However, for\
    \ insights that require a large quantity\nof measurements or computational power,\
    \ transmitting data to the cloud for computing will be\nrequired. Table 2 summarizes\
    \ common IoT data transmission protocols and their associated advantages\nand\
    \ disadvantages.\nThe IoT for smallholder agriculture represents a challenge for\
    \ data transmission due to remote\nlocations, with devices distributed over large\
    \ areas or multiple farms that have potentially limited\naccess to electricity\
    \ and cellular networks. Therefore, the range, data rate, and power consumption\
    \ are\nimportant design considerations and are compared for the common communication\
    \ protocols.\nIn Figure 5, communication protocols are grouped based on data rate\
    \ and range of transmission,\nwhich is divided into “Long range”, including low-power\
    \ wide area network (LPWAN), which includes\nLoRa and SigFox, “Short range”, including\
    \ Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Zigbee, and Z-Wave,\nand cellular communication\
    \ including GSM 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G. With respect to power consumption,\nsolutions\
    \ that are tailored to IoT applications oﬀer superior performance to more general\
    \ protocols\n(Figure 6). While the range and power consumption of protocols like\
    \ LoRa and SigFox are well suited\nfor IoT applications, their device compatibility\
    \ is more limited compared to generic wireless protocols\nlike Bluetooth and WiFi.\
    \ Additionally, cellular and satellite communication oﬀer the advantage of\nproviding\
    \ a direct link to a web server instead of passing through an intermediate gateway.\n\

    \ for common communication protocols [81,82]. Bubble size is\nproportional to\
    \ data rate.\nEven though many organizations in LMICs have developed IoT systems\
    \ for agriculture, few studies\nhave reported on the implementation in a smallholder\
    \ context and associated outcomes. Research in\nEmbu County, Kenya tested diﬀerent\
    \ proximal soil sensors to estimate soil properties and composition\non smallholder\
    \ plots and provided management recommendations to farmers [57]. The measurements\n\
    showed considerable variation, both within plots and regionally, indicating a\
    \ need for management\nrecommendations based on both local measurements and regional\
    \ soil maps. Another application\nimplemented a tracing system for smallholders\
    \ who raised live poultry that were traded in Vietnam to\nprevent the spread of\
    \ avian inﬂuenza [75]. Low-cost radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) tags on\n\
    transport cages and electronic tag readers at markets tracked birds from farm-to-market,\
    \ revealing\nthat birds passed through up to six intermediate traders, creating\
    \ a high risk of virus transmission.\nMany commercial entities serving smallholder\
    \ farmers use the IoT to track assets and interface digitally\nwith customers;\
    \ for example, tractors and implements for hire by Hello Tractor in West Africa\
    \ and\nEM3 AgriServices in India [83], and irrigation equipment by Agriworks,\
    \ Futurepump, and SunCulture\nin East Africa [84]. Enrollment in these services\
    \ is enabling more productive growing; however,\nlow digital literacy is a barrier\
    \ that requires a mix of traditional and technology-enabled engagement\nwith farmers.\
    \ A notable case is the use of sensors to monitor borehole pump reliability for\
    \ potable and\nirrigation water supply in East Africa, which is discussed later\
    \ in this article.\n3.2. Implementation Cases\nIn addition to reviewing the literature\
    \ and interviewing experts, we found it useful to study\non-the-ground implementations\
    \ of the IoT for smallholder agriculture. In particular, this research\naimed\
    \ to understand what helps to create an enabling environment at the country level,\
    \ and the keys to\nsuccess and the risks associated with active IoT in smallholder\
    \ agriculture projects in India and Kenya.\nIndia is home to over 130 million\
    \ smallholder farms [85] and is a common testbed and incubator for\ndigital services\
    \ for farmers. Site visits and discussions in India focused on identifying the\
    \ factors that\nenable innovations in the agricultural sector in order to promote\
    \ those in GFSS countries. The following\nis a summary of those factors.\n• Mobile\
    \ network connectivity and cost: Relatively cheap monthly mobile data plans of\n\
    0.21 USD/GB [38,39] have helped IoT companies explore opportunities to work with\
    \ sensors using\ncellular services for data transmission.\n• Market opportunity:\
    \ The large population size and density, and increasing incomes of the Indian\n\
    middle class, make India a lucrative market for IoT providers [41].\nSustainability\
    \ 2020, 12, 3750\n8 of 19\n• Policies to support farmers: Agriculture accounts\
    \ for 17.32% of India’s GDP and employs over\n50% of the population, and some\
    \ state governments are providing subsidies for new farm equipment\nthat could\
    \ be leveraged towards precision agriculture purchases [40].\n• Academic institutions:\
    \ Some of the highest ranking academic institutions in India are performing\n\
    research that beneﬁts Indian farmers and are raising the awareness of farming\
    \ challenges to students\nthrough hackathons.\nKenya represents a very diﬀerent\
    \ landscape compared to India. The population and total number\nof farm holdings\
    \ are vastly smaller, and many of the enabling factors discussed above are yet\
    \ to emerge.\nHowever, Kenya was selected because, among the diﬀerent GFSS countries,\
    \ the authors’ investigations\nand discussions revealed several active IoT for\
    \ agriculture cases across diﬀerent applications and\nlocations in Kenya. These\
    \ cases are summarized in this section along with some of the keys to the\nsuccess\
    \ and the associated risks with project sustainability.\nAs part of the Kenya\
    \ Resilient Arid Lands Partnership for Integrated Development (RAPID) project\n\
    to manage the recently discovered Lodwar Basin Aquifer in northern Kenya, electrical\
    \ current sensors\nwere installed on solar-electric borehole pumps to monitor\
    \ “water system functionality, the approximate\nnumber of pumping hours and volume\
    \ extracted per day, and the last report date for the sensor” [86].\nData from\
    \ the current sensors are transmitted via cellular or satellite network to a web\
    \ server and\ndashboard where county government staﬀ can monitor borehole use.\
    \ While the pumped water serves a\nvariety of community needs, some is used for\
    \ irrigating small farm plots on municipal land that would\notherwise be infertile\
    \ (Figure 7). One of the keys to the success of this IoT implementation was the\
    \ clear\nvalue and utility to the government oﬃcials responsible for the pumps,\
    \ who indicated that access to the\ndashboard signiﬁcantly reduced maintenance\
    \ costs and pump downtime. The Kenya RAPID project\nalso beneﬁts from having a\
    \ large, distributed, and well-coordinated team where each organization\nplays\
    \ a clear role, including the supplier of the IoT technology. The sensor measurements\
    \ have revealed\ndetailed pump usage patterns in relation to rainfall [74], and\
    \ this, coupled with a machine learning\nalgorithm to predict failures and reduce\
    \ detection time, has resulted in an increase in system-wide\npump uptime from\
    \ 70% to > 99% [87]. A risk for the project is the current reliance on grant funding,\n\
    although the IoT component has now been incorporated into the county government\
    \ budget.\nBorehole pump monitoring for small plot community farming in Turkana\n\

    \ that transmits solar irrigation pump\nusage data to an online server via cellular\
    \ or satellite data (right).\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n9 of 19\nThe IoT\
    \ solution for the aquaponics system at Kikaboni Farm was developed by Upande,\
    \ and it\nmonitors water conditions (temperature and pH) in the ﬁsh tanks and\
    \ environmental conditions\n(ambient temperature and relative humidity) in the\
    \ hydroponic vegetable growing area (Figure 8).\nThe sensors are battery-powered,\
    \ charged by 3–10 W solar PV panels, and transmit measurements\nover a LoRa network\
    \ to a gateway with a mobile data connection. Data are stored and processed\n\
    on Upande servers and regularly fed back to the farm’s horticulture manager who\
    \ can perform\nnecessary adjustments. For example, the cover material for the\
    \ vegetable structure was changed after\nmeasurements showed that temperatures\
    \ were far above the recommended growing temperatures for\nleafy green vegetables\
    \ (Figure 8). One of the keys to success for this application is the ability of\
    \ the\nhorticulture manager to interpret the data, which has allowed them to make\
    \ signiﬁcant improvements\nto their product yield and quality. Kikaboni Farm has\
    \ also collaborated on product development by\nproviding a testbed for improvements\
    \ to Upande Vipimo IoT products.\nA risk for this project is the reliance on the\
    \ expertise and willingness of the horticulture manager.\nWater and greenhouse\

    \ (bottom) Lettuce plants growing in the aquaponics beds before (left) and after\n\
    (right) improvements to the growing environment.\nWith little vegetation in the\
    \ Mara River watershed, rainy season precipitation causes rapid river\nlevel rise\
    \ and destructive ﬂooding (Figure 9). The IoT solution developed by Upande consists\
    \ of\nsolar-battery powered sound navigation and ranging (SONAR) level sensors\
    \ at several points along\nthe river, connected by LoRa to several grid-connected\
    \ gateways with cellular access. In the event\nthat the level sensors detect a\
    \ rapid river level rise, an SMS-based system is activated, which alerts\ndownstream\
    \ farmers to pump water out of the river in order to open capacity to receive\
    \ the upstream\nsurge. One of the keys to the success of this system is the dedication\
    \ of volunteers to coordinate\nactivities, maintain the IoT system, and host workshops\
    \ to engage the local communities. Some of\nthe risks to the sustainability of\
    \ this project are a lack of ﬁnancial support, the rugged and remote\nconditions\
    \ that the IoT must survive in, and the inconsistent support from the county government\
    \ to\nallow the system to operate.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n10 of 19\n\

    \ to grow high-value vegetables throughout\nthe year in a controlled environment.\
    \ However, uncontrolled greenhouse conditions can be harsh and\ndamaging to plants.\
    \ Researchers at the Dedan Kimathi University of Technology developed an IoT\n\
    temperature, relative humidity, and soil moisture sensor coupled to an internet-connected\
    \ gateway to\nassist farmers on their research farm (Figure 10) [34]. In this\
    \ case, the system relies on the expertise of\nthe farmers to interpret data and\
    \ make the proper adjustments to the greenhouse. The farmers showed\na high level\
    \ of satisfaction with the system and reported that it had greatly improved productivity\
    \ of\ntomatoes in their greenhouses. A key to the success of this project is the\
    \ close connection and proximity\nbetween the IoT developers and the farmers,\
    \ and the ability of the farmers to interpret the sensor\nmeasurements. This project\
    \ is also equipping engineering students with the skills and experience\nneeded\
    \ to provide commercial IoT for agriculture solutions in Kenya [88]. A potential\
    \ risk to the\nsustainability of this project is that steady funding is needed\
    \ to build a pipeline of work given the\nexpertise, location, and access to research\
    \ agriculture facilities.\nGreenhouse monitoring in Nyeri\nFigure 10. Greenhouse\

    \ available to smallholder farmers, Arable has developed a\nmulti-parameter IoT\
    \ device with a suite of sensors for measurements including ambient temperature,\n\
    humidity, precipitation, Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index (NDVI), and photosynthetic\
    \ active\nradiation (Figure 11) [22,60]. During current pilots in central Kenya,\
    \ the devices are installed on\nsmallholder farms and data is transmitted through\
    \ cellular network to cloud servers where it is stored\nand analyzed. Reduced\
    \ data is fed back to Kenyan partner researchers and agriculture extension\nagents\
    \ who oﬀer advice to area farmers. Agriculture extension agents reported that\
    \ the local-scale\ninformation is a valuable supplement to regional forecasts\
    \ provided by the Kenyan government and\nhelp them to provide better advice to\
    \ farmers. A risk to this project is the challenge of determining an\neconomical\
    \ pathway to sustain and expand the IoT technology and staﬀ in the ecosystem.\n\

    \ of Challenges and Recommendations\nBased on our literature review, expert interviews,\
    \ surveys, and site visits, the team has synthesized\na list of the challenges\
    \ in IoT for smallholder agriculture in GFSS countries (summarized in Figure 12),\n\
    and proposed recommendations for some of the relevant players involved. The following\
    \ section is\na summary of challenges grouped into ﬁve categories, which correspond\
    \ to the IoT architecture in\nFigure 1: (i) measurement device, (ii) data transmission,\
    \ (iii) data storage and analytics, (iv) feedback\nand implementation, and (v)\
    \ project structure and support. A detailed discussion of the challenges,\nopportunities,\
    \ and recommendations for the IoT for smallholder agriculture can be found in\
    \ the full\nproject report [25]. We believe that this section will be appealing\
    \ to audiences beyond the academic\nand research community, and speciﬁc recommendations\
    \ are segmented towards Technologists, Project\nmanagers, and Funders.\n \nFigure\
    \ 12. Challenges in IoT for smallholder agriculture.\nSustainability 2020, 12,\
    \ 3750\n12 of 19\n3.3.1. Measurement Device Challenges\nAccess to components:\
    \ Oﬀ-the-shelf IoT products are often not available, suitable, or aﬀordable\n\
    for commercial technologies in developing countries. Therefore, custom made solutions\
    \ are designed\nin-house or by local IoT companies. During our site visit in Kenya,\
    \ a number of IoT implementation\nteams that we spoke to indicated that procuring\
    \ electronic and hardware components during the\nproduct development phase often\
    \ delayed the project and increased costs.\nTechnologists: A good starting point\
    \ for prototype circuit components is the local electronics and\nscrap market\
    \ (e.g., CBD in Nairobi, Kisenyi in Kampala, Suame Magazine in Kumasi). These\
    \ markets\nusually stock basic circuit and prototyping components that can be\
    \ used as a “good enough” solution\nto reach a proof-of-concept prototype.\nDevice\
    \ design: Smallholder farms are often in rugged and remote locations and require\
    \ special\nconsideration when designing a connected, electronic device for long-term\
    \ monitoring.\nTechnologists: As soon as possible in the design process, test\
    \ your device at a pilot site that is\nrepresentative of the actual implementation\
    \ site.\nProject managers: Involve the farmers, agriculture extension agents,\
    \ and farmer co-operatives in the\nproduct design phase to help your team identify\
    \ non-obvious challenges and improve the likelihood\nthat farmers will accept\
    \ the idea.\nSensor calibration: Correlating the raw sensor measurements to actual\
    \ physical values requires\nperforming controlled calibration tests that can be\
    \ expensive and time consuming.\nTechnologists: Aim to eventually provide calibration\
    \ documentation for your product so that it can\nbe benchmarked against other\
    \ products and measurement methods. Perform some simple tests to\ncheck factory-calibrated\
    \ sensors in conditions as close to the implementation conditions as possible\
    \ in\ncase there is a need to apply a correction factor.\nAccess to expertise:\n\
    Many teams we visited mentioned a lack of access to expertise and\nresources for\
    \ technical and business challenges. For example, several engineers reported spending\n\
    signiﬁcant amounts of time combing through websites to ﬁnd technical solutions\
    \ during their\nproduct development.\nTechnologists: Participate in online communities\
    \ focused on IoT for agriculture hardware, especially\nfor idea exchange, technical\
    \ support, and recruiting. For example, we found the Gathering of Open Ag\nTech\
    \ to be a good example of such a resource in the agriculture sector (forum.goatech.org).\n\
    3.3.2. Data Transmission Challenges:\nPoor connectivity: Due to the remote location\
    \ of some farming communities, poor mobile network\nconnectivity and reliability\
    \ is a common challenge.\nTechnologists: As a last resort, data can be collected\
    \ manually, i.e., from a central hub connected to\nindividual devices by a local\
    \ wireless network.\nProject managers: Check mobile network coverage in your implementation\
    \ area using GSMA maps\nand cross-check with non-industry sources, for example,\
    \ a compilation of user contributed Nperf data.\nTransmission cost: While data\
    \ costs have decreased signiﬁcantly, the recurring cost of providing\nIoT services\
    \ was frequently identiﬁed as a challenge for commercial applications.\nTechnologists:\
    \ For some applications, satellite and LPWAN-based service providers are increasingly\n\
    cost-competitive with conventional mobile data.\n3.3.3. Data Storage and Analytics\n\
    Measurement to feedback: Raw sensor measurements can be diﬃcult to reduce into\
    \ actionable\nrecommendations for farmers.\nProject managers: While measurements\
    \ are relatively easy to display on a dashboard, correlating\nthem with crop growth\
    \ and other eﬀects requires input from a topical expert. Accessing the right\n\
    Sustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n13 of 19\nexpertise can be a challenge in itself,\
    \ but resources at universities and agricultural extension agencies\ncan often\
    \ give some direction.\nTechnologists: Take a human centered approach by having\
    \ farmers and agriculture experts from\nthe area provide input on (a) what kind\
    \ of recommendations would be useful and actionable and (b)\nthe best means for\
    \ the farmer to receive the recommendation.\nEquity of access: The ownership of\
    \ data collected is often overlooked in IoT projects and can lead\nto disagreements\
    \ among stakeholders.\nProject managers: Negotiate data access with project partners\
    \ and funders. While it is important\nto maintain community access to data, service\
    \ providers and funders may have requirements for\ndata access.\nFunders: Communicate\
    \ early with the project implementers and have clear guidelines on data\naccess,\
    \ privacy, ownership, and sharing mechanisms of the data with the community.\n\
    3.3.4. Feedback and Implementation\nSmartphone penetration: Many agriculture advisory\
    \ mobile apps are designed for use on\na smartphones; however, smartphone penetration\
    \ is low among rural populations in GFSS\ncountries [89,90].\nProject managers:\
    \ Make sure the output is reaching the intended audience in a format that is\n\
    accessible to them. If smartphone penetration is low, then using another medium\
    \ such as radio,\ntelevision, local print media, or extension agents can be appropriate\
    \ to provide recommendations\nto farming communities [17]. Early discussions with\
    \ farmers, farmer co-operatives, and agriculture\nextension agents could help\
    \ to make sure that the output is reaching the audience through the right\ncommunication\
    \ channel.\nRemote location: Many smallholder farms are in remote, diﬃcult-to-access\
    \ locations, which can\nadd signiﬁcant cost to IoT services if technicians need\
    \ to regularly visit farms.\nTechnologists: Incorporate onboard diagnostics for\
    \ your device (e.g., battery voltage, microcontroller\ntemperature, accelerometer)\
    \ in order to minimize maintenance visits.\nProject managers: Identify a local\
    \ farmer or extension agent who can assist with basic sensor\nmaintenance and\
    \ troubleshooting, for example, the horticulture manager at Kikaboni Farm described\n\
    in Section 3.2.\nIoT revenue generation: Identifying the best customer for the\
    \ information collected is important.\nIn many cases, there is an opportunity\
    \ to provide a service along with the hardware, which can provide\nrecurring revenue.\n\
    Project managers: Many IoT for agriculture projects are initially grant funded,\
    \ and determining\napproaches to monetize data and analytics services will help\
    \ ensure project sustainability. Consider\nthis aspect when agreeing on the terms\
    \ of the funding.\n3.3.5. Project Structure and Support\nComplicated ecosystem:\n\
    Successfully implementing an agriculture-IoT project involves\ncoordination of\
    \ a large, and sometimes complicated, ecosystem of actors over a long timescale.\n\
    Project managers: Try to organize a team of collaborators that includes data scientists,\
    \ sensor\nexperts, and agriculture experts so that each is contributing to solving\
    \ a speciﬁc part of the problem in\nwhich he/she is an expert.\nIoT business model:\
    \ Most people we connected with during this project agreed that data from\non-farm\
    \ sensors is valuable. However, identifying a speciﬁc customer, or buyer, of the\
    \ device or\nservice is less straightforward, especially when the beneﬁciary is\
    \ unlikely to have the means to aﬀord\nthe technology.\nProject managers: Identifying\
    \ and understanding whom the end customer is and who will be\npaying for the data\
    \ is important. A good example is the Kenya RAPID project, described in Section\
    \ 3.2,\nin which the county government includes the IoT services in their annual\
    \ budget.\nSustainability 2020, 12, 3750\n14 of 19\nShort funding timelines: Two-\
    \ and three-year grants from donor agencies are short timelines;\nwhen it comes\
    \ to farming seasons, this is a relatively short time period because you get data\
    \ from\nonly one or two cropping cycles, so collecting quality data and making\
    \ actionable recommendations is\na challenge.\nFunders: Increase funding timelines\
    \ to ﬁve to seven years to allow for data collection over multiple\ncropping periods.\
    \ A larger dataset also enables better pattern recognition and predictive analytics,\n\
    leading to suitable actionable recommendations.\nVertical integration: Many organizations\
    \ are providing an end-to-end solution in which a\nsingle organization takes on\
    \ the responsibility of farmer recruitment, IoT technology development,\nimplementation,\
    \ data analysis and recommendations, and monitoring and evaluation.\nProject managers:\
    \ Some of the key stakeholders the team spoke with indicated that, while they\n\
    were experts in a few aspects of the IoT and agriculture, trying to work on the\
    \ entire end-to-end process\nof an agriculture IoT ecosystem was stretching them\
    \ thin; thus, incorporating a horizontal structure in\nwhich each organization\
    \ oﬀers speciﬁc expertise to solve the overall problem in a piecemeal fashion\
    \ is\nfavorable for project success.\nFunders: Funding agencies can play a facilitation\
    \ role to connect diverse groups with speciﬁc\nexpertise to solve the overall\
    \ problem. Organizations forming new partnerships could particularly\nbeneﬁt from\
    \ guidance in negotiating agreements and contracts.\n4. Conclusions\nThis review\
    \ presents a perspective of the current state of the IoT in smallholder agriculture,\n\
    including summaries of state-of-the-art sensor and communication technologies\
    \ and real examples of\nIoT implementation on farms in Kenya, and the challenges\
    \ and recommendations associated with the\nimplementation of IoT on smallholder\
    \ farms in LMICs. The barriers and challenges are largely known\nand surmountable,\
    \ and viable implementation of the IoT is already occurring. Currently, applications\
    \ for\nscenarios with easily detectable and actionable parameters offer more immediate\
    \ promise and likelihood\nof uptake than those implementing measurements that\
    \ are more difficult to interpret. Additionally,\ntargeting measurements that\
    \ address a significant pain point (e.g., water supply reliability) can ensure\n\
    buy-in from and value to the communities involved. Major evolving challenges due\
    \ to climate change\nwill motivate implementation of the IoT to improve resilience\
    \ and secure safety nets for global food\nsupply. Greater resilience and agricultural\
    \ productivity have the potential to strengthen rural economies\nand help developing\
    \ countries along their journey to self-reliance. The IoT for agriculture objective\n\
    remains: To gather sufficient quantities of data of the right type, from the right\
    \ location, at a low cost,\nand with sufficiently well-informed analysis and understanding\
    \ for farmers to take action.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available\

    Received 09 Jul 2018 Accepted 30 Oct 2018 Published 18 Nov 2018 Abstract The Internet
    of Things (IoT) is a network of Internet-enabled devices that can sense, communicate,
    and react to changes in their environment. Billions of these computing devices
    are connected to the Internet to exchange data between themselves and/or their
    infrastructure. IoT promises to enable a plethora of smart services in almost
    every aspect of our daily interactions and improve the overall quality of life.
    However, with the increasing wide adoption of IoT, come significant privacy concerns
    to lose control of how our data is collected and shared with others. As such,
    privacy is a core requirement in any IoT ecosystem and is a major concern that
    inhibits its widespread user adoption. The ultimate source of user discomfort
    is the lack of control over personal raw data that is directly streamed from sensors
    to the outside world. In this survey, we review existing research and proposed
    solutions to rising privacy concerns from a multipoint of view to identify the
    risks and mitigations. First, we provide an evaluation of privacy issues and concerns
    in IoT systems due to resource constraints. Second, we describe the proposed IoT
    solutions that embrace a variety of privacy concerns such as identification, tracking,
    monitoring, and profiling. Lastly, we discuss the mechanisms and architectures
    for protecting IoT data in case of mobility at the device layer, infrastructure/platform
    layer, and application layer. 1. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is
    a group of connected physical devices that exchange data about themselves and
    their environments and may take actions on it. The 2017 report of the International
    Data Corporation [ 1] forecasts that 50 billion devices will be connected by 2020
    with a $8.9 trillion market value. Gartner [ 2] published a similar study expecting
    that, in 2020, 50 Billion devices will have their own unique Identifier with a
    $19 trillion market share opportunity. Not only are IoT devices equipped with
    a varying level of computational power (e.g., microcontrollers) but also many
    run a full stack operating system (e.g., Contiki [ 3] and RIOT [ 4]) that enables
    these devices to perform high-level functionality. The main strength of IoT is
    the huge impact it will have on several aspects of the user’s everyday interactions
    and the surrounding environment (e.g., smart spaces). This will improve our quality
    of life in different domains [ 5] as shown in Figure 1 including Energy [ 6],
    Safety, Security, Industry [ 7], Environment, Entertainment, and Healthcare [
    8]. However, IoT devices are intrinsically resource-constrained in terms of computation,
    battery power, intermittent connectivity, and network protocols.    Figure 1  Internet
    of Things applications. These constraints directly impact the choice of technology
    applicable to maintain user privacy. Hence, promoting IoT adoption from the user
    perspective and mitigating potential risks of data misuse and security concerns.
    IoT devices do not commonly implement a standard security scheme [ 3, 4], which
    means there is a huge risk to connect this large number of unsecured devices to
    the Internet [ 9]. Proofpoint Inc. has uncovered the first proven cyberattack
    based on IoT household smart appliances between December 23, 2013, and January
    6, 2014. This attack involved more than 750,000 malicious email communications
    coming from more than 100,000 everyday consumer gadgets such as home routers,
    smart TVs, and smart refrigerators [ 10]. In 2015, two ethical hackers, Charlie
    Miller and Chris Valasek, gained control of a Jeep Cherokee remotely through vulnerability
    in its onboard entertainment system. According to the hackers, they were able
    to break the Uconnect system that the Chrysler’s line-up of cars and trucks use
    due to open vulnerability. Hundreds of thousands of vehicles could be affected.
    In October 2016, a major DDoS attack took down several giant servers such as Airbnb,
    Reddit, Etsy, Sound Cloud, New York Times, Amazon, Twitter, and Spotify. Though
    it is not clear yet that the blame is on IoT, it is quite likely. IoT devices
    are considered not only a security threat, but also a major privacy concern, as
    these devices collect much personal data such as user identity, location, energy
    consumption, and telephone numbers. This information can reveal a lot about the
    user’s daily life activities (e.g., using washing machines, watching TV, and leaving
    or returning home). The major concern yet is that these devices not only can collect
    users’ private data but also can control their environments. Thus, users are highly
    uncomfortable exposing personal data to public or private servers without a well-established
    trust model [ 11]. Therefore, the lack of well-designed IoT-oriented privacy and
    security techniques will inhibit the user adoption to any IoT technology [ 12].
    The following scenario embodies much of the semantic meaning of user privacy leakage
    and associated risks. Ahmed looks at his smartwatch while doing his usual workout
    and sees that his heart rate is a little high. Once he arrived home, he speaks
    to the smart speaker installed in his room to provide him a list of nearby cardiologists
    to check his heart and blood vessels. Next day after finishing his work, Ahmed
    visited a cardiologist, and he felt relieved when his doctor reassured everything
    is fine. “You just did more exercises than usual and nothing to worry about”,
    the doctor said. The next day, every time Ahmed uses his browser he finds too
    many advertisements related to heart medication, heart monitoring devices, and
    many tutorials about diagnosing a heart attack and how to handle it. Things got
    more serious when he received a phone call from his insurance company for check-up
    survey. “Goodbye privacy”, he whispers to himself as he speaks with the company
    representative. This is only one scenario of too many that shows high privacy
    risks associated with modern technology usage that has become an inevitable part
    of our everyday life. There exist many published surveys on IoT privacy and security
    issues, challenges, and solutions. Ziegeldorf et al. [ 13] analyze the privacy
    issues in IoT. Their focus is on classifying the various privacy threats and pointing
    out the challenges in IoT scenarios. Sadeghi et al. [ 14] introduce the security
    and privacy challenges of industrial IoT systems. They also discuss possible solutions
    towards a complete and secure framework for industrial IoT. Sicari et al. [ 15]
    focus on the main security challenges and the current solutions. They categorize
    the issues into authentication, access control, confidentiality, privacy, trust,
    secure middleware, mobile security, and policy enforcement. Suo et al. [ 16] review
    the security and privacy in IoT, where they analyze the security architecture
    and features. They also discuss ongoing research status and the challenges of
    secure technologies including encryption mechanism, communication security, protecting
    sensor data, and cryptographic algorithms to support privacy preservation in IoT.
    Although security and privacy are highly correlated, this paper primarily focuses
    on privacy challenges and discusses a broad range of privacy-related aspects in
    open IoT environments to provide better insights on the design principles and
    development of privacy preserving IoT environments. The remainder of this paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the unique characteristics of IoT
    posing significant challenges on resource-constrained IoT devices. We also discuss
    the notion of privacy in IoT by pointing out some scenarios related to privacy
    concerns. Section 3 describes major IoT privacy issues and concerns such as identification,
    tracking, monitoring, and profiling. Then, we discuss existing IoT privacy solutions
    in Section 5. Section 6 provides a comprehensive analysis of privacy issues and
    mechanisms at the different layers of the IoT stack, namely, Device Layer, Platform
    Layer, and application layer, respectively. Lastly, Section 7 concludes the paper
    and provides closing notes. 2. Privacy in the Internet of Things IoT provides
    consumers with a high degree of automation and control on how to carry out everyday
    tasks through saturating the environment with smart things. IoT smart things refer
    to a broad spectrum of nonstandard computing devices including microcontrollers,
    sensors, and actuators that can transmit and exchange data to enable smarter interactions
    and support informed decision making. Things are embedded in consumers'' devices
    and industrial machinery to collect and exchange data about the surroundings.
    Things can also cause physical changes to their environments and can be controlled
    directly from proximity or remotely via Internet. Although privacy concerns discussed
    in this paper are generally valid for any IoT deployments, we provide examples
    related to consumers'' connected devices such as smart appliances to make the
    point clear. In addition, the pace at which consumers'' smart devices are developed
    is much higher than the development of safeguard techniques that can protect these
    devices and their data collection from growing privacy threats. Given the high
    penetration of IoT devices and their impact on our everyday life, we need to fully
    understand the risks and challenges such devices pose on our privacy. More importantly,
    we need to answer the following question: Is it possible to support privacy preserving
    and safe environment for IoT users such those offered in traditional Internet?
    To precisely answer this question, we need first to discriminate between relevant
    terminologies such as privacy, trust, and security. Privacy means that information
    about individuals must be protected and should not be exposed without explicit
    consent under any circumstances. Every individual has the ultimate right to decide
    with whom to share their data. For example, in our previous scenario, Ahmed should
    be the only one to decide whether to share his heart conditions with the insurance
    company or not. Trust is defined as the product of attack probability and the
    damage it can cause. Trust is derived from two crucial terms: transparency and
    consistency. Transparency means that IoT devices collecting information inform
    the user about what data is collected, the purpose of collection, and how the
    collected data will be used. Consistency means that the behaviour of IoT devices
    consistently meets user expectation. For example, if a user asks his smart speaker
    to control the room light, it must do nothing unintended, but the specific requested
    task. Security refers to the protection of devices and connection from unauthorized
    access. Based on the aforementioned definitions, it is evident that privacy is
    more general than both security and trust. For instance, an IoT service could
    gain user trust and provide proper security but still violates the user’s privacy
    by exposing personal data without clear and explicit permissions. 2.1. Impact
    of Device Limitations on Privacy IoT smart things are typically resource-constrained
    with limited capabilities due to size and weight (e.g., memory, processing, and
    battery power) and network connectivity (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4). For example, IEEE
    802.15.4 specification is constrained with respect to (1) low data rates, which
    range from 20 Kbits/s (868 MHz) to 250 Kbits/s (2.45 GHz), (2) unreliable and
    lossy links compared to wired links, (3) small packet size (127 bytes), which
    means less room for payload when including other headers, and (4) aggressive power
    cycle, by which IoT smart things aim to save power by staying longer in low-power
    mode. Such constraints directly impact the type and complexity of functionality
    that IoT devices can run. Recently, significant efforts have been made towards
    standardizing the IoT protocol stack [ 17]. For example, to enable low-power connectivity
    among smart objects in IoT systems, the IEEE 802.15.4–2006 low-power physical
    (PHY) layer and the IEEE 802.15.4e link layer based on Time Synchronized Channel
    Hopping (TSCH) have been developed in 2006 [ 18]. Several scholars pointed out
    the technical challenges that face IoT environments due to various resource constraints.
    Yu et al. [ 19] consider IoT devices as weak access points to vital infrastructures
    (e.g., a medical or military facility) and can be misused to leak sensitive data.
    The authors have made two main observations regarding IoT systems: (1) network-based
    approaches are less vulnerable than host-based approaches due to inherent limitations
    and possible unpatched vulnerabilities on IoT devices; (2) traditional static
    perimeter defenses are unable to secure IoT devices, since these devices are deployed
    deep inside the network, with their physical and computational context constantly
    changing. Therefore, resource limitations make it challenging to secure IoT layers
    individually. Table 1 lists the top countries, in Sept 2017, with IoT devices
    (237,539 devices) vulnerable to Heartbleed [ 20] according to SHODAN [ 21] and
    other sources. Table 1  List of top countries with vulnerable IoT devices. 2.2.
    Impact of Complex Heterogeneity on IoT Privacy IoT has intrinsic complexity, since
    multiple diverse objects located in different contexts can exchange information
    among each other. This complicates the design and deployment of efficient, interoperable,
    and scalable mechanisms to preserve users’ privacy. Heterogeneity also has significant
    influence on the design of IoT protocols. Recourse-constrained devices will interact
    with one another/infrastructure (e.g., web servers and cloudlets) either directly
    or through gateways. In this case, it is essential to implement or create lightweight
    security protocols that support an end-to-end secure communication channel. These
    protocols require implementing distributing management system to distribute credentials
    and facilitate keys session establishment between peers. The data flooding caused
    by billions of IoT devices is a big threat, in a way that hurts and violates the
    user’s privacy. One of the main violations of the large volume of data exchange
    is linking this data to a certain user. So, the user’s anonymity is another dimension
    that must be taken into consideration to support privacy in connected environments.
    Further, creating mechanisms to provide data summarization and access policies
    related to private data will enable transparency and avoid IoT silently taking
    control of our lives. There exist several surveys focusing on the impact of IoT
    heterogeneity on users’ privacy. Heer, T. et al. [ 22] provide a number of requirements
    to secure IoT environments and preserve user privacy through overcoming specific
    technical limitations including (1) complex heterogeneity of IoT systems, which
    complicates protocol design and system operation; (2) scarce CPU and memory resources,
    which limit the use of resource-demanding cryptoprimitives, such as public-key
    cryptography as used in most Internet security standards; and (3) end-to-end security
    measures that are IoT-oriented, since traditional Internet-based approaches are
    typically inapplicable due to resource limitations. The lessons we learned so
    far suggests that resource limitations are a major inhibitor to the adoption of
    traditional techniques as is. IoT architectures must implement privacy by design
    from the ground up [ 23], to provide users with central control over their security
    and privacy. 3. Motivating Scenarios The vulnerabilities of IoT devices can lead
    to huge security breaks and threaten user privacy by exposing vital personal information.
    In this section, we provide some scenarios of IoT applications where personal
    data can be breached. 3.1. Smart Home Utility Monitoring According to a recent
    report published by US Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2017 [ 24],
    64.7 million smart meters have been installed in electric utilities in 2015. Around
    88% of these installations were residential upgrades as shown in Table 2. These
    smart meters measure and log electricity usage at a minimum of 1-hour intervals
    but can report readings in real-time at a much higher sampling rate. This data
    is collected by utility companies at least once a day. Smart meters range from
    basic hourly interval meters to real-time meters equipped with two-way communication
    that is capable of recording and transmitting instantaneous data. Natural gas
    meters and water meters are also on the rise and likely count to similar numbers.
    However, EIA does not publish their data publicly. The extensive deployment of
    smart meters has serious privacy implications since they unintentionally leak
    detailed information about residents’ activities. Processing and analyzing this
    information can lead to serious privacy leakage such as profiling the behaviour
    of the residents. Furthermore, with existing sophisticated analytics such data
    may reveal when residents are home and what may be their heath conditions (e.g.,
    toilet flushing rate may indicate that the resident has diarrhoea). This does
    not stop at breaking the user privacy but may very much lead to life-threating
    situations. Table 2  Number of AMI installations by sector, 2015. Molina-Markham
    et al. [ 25] raise awareness around privacy issues related to the use of smart
    meters. They show that even without knowing any information about household activities,
    applying off-the-shelf statistical methods can easily extract complex usage patterns
    from smart meter data. Their work is based on data collected over a 2-month period
    from three homes. The data contains household power consumption aggregated at
    1-second rate. Even with this small-scale deployment, the authors managed to demonstrate
    the latent for power consumption patterns to reveal a range of personal information,
    such as how many people are in the house, sleeping routines, and eating routines.
    The proposed privacy-enhancing smart meter is based on 3 components: household
    smart meters, neighbourhood gateways, and a remote utility server. The server
    applies Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocols [ 26] that allow a prover (smart meter)
    to demonstrate the knowledge of a secret (collected data) to a verifier (gateway/server),
    without revealing any information that help the verifier to infer the secret.
    This enables utility companies to accomplish their goals without compromising
    the customer’s privacy. Apthorpe et al. [ 27] discuss the same concern. However,
    they point out that an Internet Service provider (ISP) or other network observers
    can gather private and sensitive information about home activities by analyzing
    Internet traffic from smart homes containing IoT devices even if the devices use
    secure encryption. Several strategies have been investigated to avoid the privacy
    risks associated with smart home traffic monitoring such as traffic blocking,
    tunnelling, and rate-shaping. However, the user cannot block outgoing traffic
    from their home; otherwise their devices will be unusable. While traffic tunnelling
    via a VPN is more secure, it does not totally guarantee privacy preserving. Authors
    propose the use of traffic shaping using Independent Link Padding (ILP) to prevent
    the leak of rate information and thus render attacks impossible. 3.2. Crowdsourcing
    and Public Monitoring Crowdsourcing is the use of collective knowledge of a large
    crowd to help solving a specific problem. Crowdsourcing benefits from high penetration
    of smartphones, which becomes the common mobile platform for users worldwide.
    Developers and average users with limited programming experience can create feature-rich/personalized
    applications by simply requesting access to private information such as location,
    contact lists, media files, etc. However, this model raises serious privacy concerns
    with no trust mechanisms that govern how applications access and handle such private
    information. It is also technically possible that applications may gain unauthorized
    access to the device’s camera, networks, and system settings. Mobile Crowdsourcing
    Networks (MCN) include four basic types of entities as depicted in Figure 2: (i)
    The service provider is a crowdsourcing platform that offers crowdsourcing services
    to both end users and public crowds. (ii) End users are the clients who purchase

    Yang et al. [ 28] point out that the privacy may be leaked out from either data
    or tasks. Privacy threats resulting from data leakage can be divided into three
    categories. (1) privacy of sensed data contains personal information about participants,
    such as identities, location information, and biometric information. For example,
    the location information can be easily obtained either from GPS receivers embedded
    in mobile devices or triangulation-based approaches on Wi-Fi or cellular networks.
    Moreover, environmental context such as ambient temperature, light, noise level
    may also reveal the location information. The disclosure of the location information
    may leak the privacy of participants, such as home and workplace locations, routines,
    and habits. (2) Privacy of crowdsourced data may contain sensitive information,
    such as business and financial records, proprietary research data, or personal
    health information. (3) Privacy of crowdsourcing results can be analyzed to infer
    sensitive information not authorized/known by the service provider. 4. Evaluation
    of Privacy Threats in IoT IoT increasingly evolve with new emerging technologies
    and services. In this section, we discuss the various privacy threats and challenges
    associated with IoT environments. We provide a solid definition and a concrete
    example of privacy violation for each threat. Then, we discuss the impact of IoT
    evolution on this threat. Lastly, we point out the main challenges associated
    with these threats as well as any correlation when exists. 4.1. User Identification
    From privacy perspectives, user identification is the ability to distinguish a
    person (or an entity) or revealing their identity based on a piece of acquired
    data (e.g., name, address, or personal information). The risk of such a threat
    is that privacy-violating actions could be carried out after the customer is identified.
    This threat enables and aggravates other threats, e.g., profiling and tracking
    of individuals’ behaviour. It also allows for linking information from different
    sources for the same identified target. Analyzing this information can easily
    result in exposing the target’s life pattern. For example, developers that have
    access to user traces can utilize machine learning techniques to infer personal
    information about users’ interests, which can be exploited to flood user interfaces
    with ad-ware and targeted advertisements. The wide adoption of IoT facilitates
    the collection of a huge amount of data using IoT devices that can be stored and
    analyzed beyond the user’s control domain. Thus, user identification becomes the
    dominant threat regarding user’s privacy. Further, with the increasing number
    of IoT deployments, the user identification threat and associated risks will significantly
    scale up. Different IoT technologies bring their own benefits and challenges.
    Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) is commonly used in IoT scenarios to recognize/identify
    things, record metadata, and control distinct targets through radio waves [ 29].
    The basic RFID system architecture contains tags and readers [ 30]. Tags are associated
    with objects for identification and readers read these tags using a close proximity
    communication technology. When connected to the Internet, RFID remote readers
    can automatically recognize, track, and monitor any object with a global tag,
    and in real time if needed [ 31]. Pateriya et al. [ 32] point out that vulnerable
    tags are subject to spying, spoofing, traffic analysis, and denial of service
    attacks. Unauthorized reader can access these vulnerable tags without proper access
    privileges. Although the tag information could potentially be protected using
    lightweight security mechanisms, tracking is easy to accomplish through tag replies.
    User identification is currently implemented in almost all mobile platforms, using
    a variety of mechanisms including face recognition, fingerprints, and/or voice
    recognition. Surveillance systems also implement face and voice recognition using
    embedded cameras and microphones, respectively. An unauthorized attacker could
    gain full access to a surveillance camera and tamper its firmware to send the
    data to the legitimate server and copy the attacker. Identifying customers by
    authorized controllers also remains a privacy threat that leads to other threats
    such as profiling and utility monitoring. Surveillance cameras deployed in public
    settings (e.g., for video analytics and customer profiling [ 33, 34]) utilize
    public facial databases (e.g., MIT-CBCL Face Recognition Database) to track users.
    Such systems have become available to the public use for free like marketing platforms
    [ 35]. User identification through facial recognition has indeed become an inevitable
    reality and significantly hurts user privacy. 4.2. User Tracking User tracking
    is primarily based on user identification, and it becomes a threat when the data
    collected about a certain user is maintained and used to track this user’s behaviour.
    The most famous type of user tracking is based on location. When a user is identified,
    binding the location history enables tracking. Location-based services require
    that users share their location information. Thus, user location can be tracked
    without users’ explicit consent and likely without their knowledge. Several technologies
    significantly affect user tracking such as positioning techniques, which has made
    great developments in recent years. Positioning techniques are typically based
    on Global Positioning Systems (GPS), GSM, RFID, and the Wireless LAN [ 36, 37].
    The work done in [ 38] shows that average Facebook users significantly underestimate
    the amount of data to which they allow third-party applications access. The evolution
    of such technologies provides service providers with a tool to learn about personal
    patterns (e.g., home location, work location, and visited places), which raises
    the concern of location privacy intrusion. Since the IoT market is open, user
    location information can be abused or sold to third parties for targeted advertisements
    purposes. More seriously, criminals could exploit such data to perform various
    types of criminal activities that risk individual’s life. For example, the use
    of GPS to stalk customers [ 39– 41] and, generally, the uncomfortable feeling
    of being observed are discussed in [ 42]. Even when fake identity is used, the
    system cannot overcome such a privacy threat with location-based services enabled
    [ 43]. 4.3. Profiling Profiling [ 44] refers to recording and analyzing data to
    characterize personal behaviour to assess or infer their personal interests in
    a certain domain or for discrimination purposes. Off-the-shelf data mining tools
    can draw a clear picture of the customer needs and easily provide a detailed customer
    profile. Following the rule “know your customer” [ 45, 46], in e-commerce, online
    profiling is a key tool for companies to better understand their customer needs.
    Profiling data is increasingly used for target advertisements, Web sites personalization,
    and service matching. However, profiling leads to privacy violation when used
    to learn a customer''s political and religious views, sexual orientation, and/or
    medical conditions [ 47– 49], valuable information that can be shared and sold
    without further consent [ 50– 54]. The rising of Internet-connected systems and
    the evolution of data mining algorithms and tools significantly contributed to
    the emergence of big data [ 55]. From IoT and big data perspectives, the argument
    is that limiting access to private/personal data negatively impacts the accuracy
    of the data mining exercise. Besides this conflict of interest between privacy
    and profiling, we noticed that identification and tracking threats further aggravate
    the possibilities for profiling and increase the risks of privacy leakage by data
    hunting black markets. 4.4. Utility Monitoring and Controlling This threat is
    directly relevant to gathering data related to customers’ utility usage. Such
    data could be used to infer user’s daily life patterns. This sensitive information
    represents major privacy threat if acquired through an unauthorized access. However,
    it becomes more serious when attackers gain privileged access to control utility
    usage without the user’s explicit permission or knowledge. Gubbi et al. [ 56]
    categorize IoT applications into four domains: (1) Personal and Home, (2) Enterprise,
    (3) Utilities, and (4) Mobile. In personal and home applications, Wi-Fi is typically
    used to provide high bandwidth for video streaming services and support high sampling
    rates for audio streaming as well as control of home appliances such as air conditioners,
    refrigerators, and washing machines. In Enterprise applications, IoT devices collect
    data from workplace environment. For example, environmental monitoring applications
    keep track of the number of occupants and manages the utilities within the building
    (e.g., HVAC, lighting). If attackers gain access to these devices, they can cause
    financial and personal harm to owners. Although utility companies claim that they
    collect data to optimize their service, the granularity at which such data is
    collected raise concerns. Fine granularity data may reveal private information
    that users do not want to share. For example, collecting water usage at high sampling
    rate can reveal whether customers are home or not. Data analytics tools also can
    show when customers take showers or use the bathroom. All these are private information
    that users would not feel comfortable sharing with others. For example, smart
    grid and smart metering [ 57], image processing, computer vision to support video
    based IoT [ 58], and irrigation monitoring in the agricultural industries [ 59].
    It is highly challenging to control the disclosure of all this information from
    these different applications. It is also readily viable that companies could store
    customers’ data and retain it indefinitely due to increasingly advancing storage
    technology with continuously decreasing prices. The increasing evolution and adoption
    of IoT continue to aggravate user privacy and present new challenges on supporting
    infrastructure to provide more robust privacy preserving techniques. Users need
    to be aware of entities collecting their private data, understand how this data
    is shared outside their control domain, evaluate the purpose of access, estimate
    potential data misuse, and assess associated risks and consequences. Such requirements
    pose additional challenges on IoT infrastructures to provide users with safe and
    privacy preserving environments. Parker Higgins [ 60] tweeted about the unsettling
    similarity of the Samsung Smart TV privacy policy, which warned consumers not
    to discuss sensitive topics near the device [ 61]. This incident led Samsung to
    edit its privacy policy and clarify the Smart TV’s data collection practices [
    62]. With IoT becoming an important part of everyday life, people must pay extra
    attention to their privacy and systems must implement ethical practices in dealing
    with private data. Users should always be aware of the exact purpose of data collection
    and understand the spectrum of potential misuse. There must be also continuous
    enforcing mechanisms for access policies. The control should ultimately be placed
    at the users’ hands to make informed decisions on how their private data is collected
    and shared beyond their control domain. 5. Classifications of IoT Privacy Solutions
    Privacy issues in traditional Internet mostly impact connected users surfing the
    Internet. However, in IoT scenarios, privacy concerns may affect people who are
    not even using any IoT service but happen to be present in the environment. In
    traditional Internet services, the W3C group has defined the Platform for Privacy
    Preferences (P3P) [ 63], which provides a standard language for the description
    of privacy preferences and policies. P3P allows for automatic negotiation of the
    privacy concerning parameters based on data needed to run the service and the
    privacy requirements set by the user. Internet applications can implement well-established
    authentication procedures to capture the data flow and determine whether there
    are any potential privacy violations and immediately notify the user. However,
    in IoT settings it is far complex to precisely capture privacy violations due
    to the lack of well-defined control domain boundaries. Therefore, IoT environments
    must respect the privacy of individuals and ensure that collected personal data
    must be used for absolutely nothing, but the intended purpose. Lastly, collected
    data must be stored only until it is strictly needed. This section discusses the
    proposed solutions, summarized in Table 3, to overcome privacy challenges and
    related security issues as follows. (i) Authentication and authorization (ii)
    Edge computing and plug-in architectures (iii) Data anonymization (iv) Digital
    forgetting and data summarization Table 3  Summary of privacy preserving proposed
    solutions in IoT environments. 5.1. Authentication and Authorization Authentication
    in IoT scenarios is challenging due to the limitations of IoT devices. However,
    many researchers have proposed lightweight solutions to address these limitations
    and support authentication in constrained environments. Lee et al. [ 64] proposed
    simple and secure key establishment to be used in IoT networks. The authors introduce
    an encryption method based on XOR operations to implement a lightweight cryptography
    protocol. The hardware implementation of this protocol is demonstrated and can
    be used to establish the mutual authentication procedure in a typical RFID system
    for IoT applications. Porambage et al. [ 65] propose PAuth Key protocol, an authentication
    scheme and keying mechanism suitable for resource-constrained WSNs (a.k.a. IoT),
    irrespective of their vendor or form factor. PAuth provides application-level
    end-to-end security through two phases: registration and authentication. In the
    registration phase, end users and edge devices obtain their cryptographic credentials.
    The authentication phase establishes key-based authentication using mutual communication.
    The protocol allows end users to authenticate with the sensing nodes directly
    and acquire sensor data and services. The protocol supports distributed IoT applications
    since the certificates are lightweight and can be handled by resource-constrained
    devices. Sharaf-Dabbagh et al. [ 66] propose a new authentication framework for
    IoT environments based on device fingerprinting techniques. According to their
    model, each IoT device has a unique fingerprint, which can be used to communicate
    with the cloud infrastructure. The model provides authentication of IoT devices
    through a twofold approach: (1) a generative model to verify that the received
    messages belong to a certain object; (2) validation of the sender legitimacy to
    ensure that it is not a malicious object. The authors adopted the infinite Gaussian
    mixture model (IGMM) as a generative model if the object fingerprint follows a
    multivariate Gaussian distribution. The second validation method is implemented
    using Bhattacharyya distance to compare the clustering results from IGMM with
    the expected cluster shape for the device. Then, the proposed framework uses transfer
    learning techniques to effectively detect emulation attacks, thus, differentiating
    between fingerprint abnormalities resulting from environments versus attacks.
    Bouij-Pasquier et al. [ 67] propose SmartOrBAC, a context-aware authorization
    model that accommodates IoT network requirements. SmartOrBAC leverages real-time
    context to make informed authorization decisions. The authors separate functionality
    into multiple layers and resource-constrained devices collaborate to perform tasks
    using distributed processing. Salman et al. [ 68] propose an authentication scheme
    for heterogeneous IoT environments based on Software Defined Network (SDN). SDN
    controllers are used to manage security parameters by implementing a trusted certificate
    authority. All SDN controllers rely on a central SDN controller that translates
    different technology-specific identities into a single shared identity scheme
    based on virtual IPv6 addresses. This shared identity is then used to authenticate
    devices and gateways. The SDN controller authenticates gateways and gateways authenticate
    their associated devices. The proposed scheme is performed in three steps: (1)
    the gateway obtains an authentication certificate from a controller, (2) things
    register with the gateway, and (3) IoT devices send authentication requests to
    the gateway. Their analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme
    is secure against replay attack, masquerade attack, and man-in-the-middle attack.
    5.2. Edge Computing and Plug-In Architectures There is a growing adoption of the
    edge computing paradigm [ 91] in the last few years. In edge computing data processing
    and storage occur partially at the network edge, rather than completely in the
    backed. Due to the increasing trend of generating data at the edge of the network,
    it makes more sense to leverage edge computing to resolve concerns such as latency,
    device limitations, security, and more importantly user privacy [ 92]. Davies
    et al. [ 69] discuss the concern of data privacy in IoT networks, following Geoffrey
    Moore’s warning [ 93] about the discontinuity awaiting every new technology. The
    authors introduce a plug-in mediator solution to overcome the privacy concerns
    stemming from overcentralization of IoT systems. The proposed architecture suggests
    deploying privacy mediators (i.e., trusted software modules) into the data distribution
    pipeline. A mediator runs on a cloudlet [ 94] to enforce the privacy policy specified
    by sensor/user. While developers can provide sensor drivers that convert data
    into common formats, customers can create privacy policies that control the mediator
    configuration and the sensor data routing to/from that mediator. This architecture
    enables the implementation of various types of data privacy controls such as deletion,
    denaturing, summarization, inference, anonymization, and mobility. Langheinrich
    [ 70] presents a privacy-aware system (pawS) to overcome the privacy concerns
    by guaranteeing that collected data remains private. It provides data collection
    and processing tools that notify users of what exactly is collected. Thus, the
    user decides what actions can be taken. The proposed architecture adopts privacy
    preserving principles in ubiquitous computing [ 71]. The architecture encompasses
    four components: (1) machine-readable privacy policies to provide choice and consent,
    (2) policy announcement mechanisms to give notice, (3) privacy proxies to support
    access control, and (4) policy-based data access for protected recourses. However,
    proximity, negotiation, and locality are not implemented in this system. This
    architecture presents to customers all available options upfront to choose from,
    rather than forcing them to negotiate with an automated process to get the best
    deal. Bagüés et al. [ 72] introduce a privacy preserving framework for smart homes
    (Sentry@HOME). The framework adopts a user-centric approach to control the dissemination
    of private data according to the privacy policies defined by the user. It consists
    of five essential components: Sentry Registry (SR), Sentry Implementation (SI),
    Context Handler (CH), Sentry Manager Interface (SMI), and the Noise Module (NM).
    The framework embeds privacy enforcements into existing smart home infrastructure.
    The authors demonstrate that the smart home is a safe harbour for privacy-sensitive
    data and that their framework acts as a guardian sentry. Seong et al. [ 73] present
    a decentralized architecture of PrPl, which proposes Personal-Cloud Butlers as
    a safe harbour for personal data indexing. A butler is configured for each user
    to provide fine-grain access control and storage. A similar work is presented
    in [ 74] that investigates on-device sensor abstractions for augmented reality
    applications to prevent private data from accidental leakage from applications
    having privileged access to raw sensor data. 5.3. Data Anonymization Data anonymization
    is the process of removing identifiable information that may lead to personal
    identification so that people/objects described by such data remain anonymous
    [ 75]. The purpose of data anonymization is generally to protect user privacy.
    Several attempts have been made to provide anonymization, image blurring, and
    denaturing mechanisms for IoT applications [ 77, 78], especially for images and
    videos. Denaturing is the process of using image processing techniques to blur
    or alter a specific part of the image to preserve personal privacy. Data anonymization
    not only protects user privacy but also enables service providers to use collected
    data to customize the services for users. Data anonymization has three main objectives
    [ 76]: protecting the privacy of involved users, hiding any information about
    the network internal structure, and maintaining the anonymized traffic traces
    as realistic as possible to the nonanonymized packet stream. Sliwa [ 79] presents
    a new framework for anonymized data exchange that integrates user privacy, system
    safety, and quality of service. The main challenge is how to design a data broker
    that takes only general knowledge about the required data communication and possibly
    unaware of the semantics, yet assures reliable and secure data exchange between
    partners. The author also points out the challenges of developing data separation
    algorithms that allow for certain flexibility to service providers, yet respect
    the predefined access rules (personal identity, granularity). Berrehili and Belmekki
    [ 80] present a deep risk analysis for IoT privacy threats. The authors propose
    several technical and nontechnical approaches to protect user privacy in IoT scenarios.
    They provide a recommendation for IoT app developers to inform users about potential
    privacy violations resulting from private data disclosure. The authors also propose
    that IoT devices implement an authentication algorithm to verify the source of
    updated files using a cryptographic mechanism. They also suggest using anonymization
    techniques to mask the personal information in the data before sharing. Shinzaki
    et al. [ 81] extend the identification-based key sharing scheme to TLS to implement
    mutual authentication, encrypt data communication, and provide anonymization technology
    for the safe disclosure of data using multiple layers of meshes on a map for the
    utilization of positional data. Similarly, Otgonbayar et al. [ 82] present a new
    anonymization algorithm based on the k−anonymity privacy model. The proposed algorithm
    uses the time-based sliding window technique to manipulate IoT streams by partitioning
    the stream tuples based on their description. Wang et al. [ 83] introduce a scalable
    privacy-aware IoT architecture that enables live video analytics across many cameras
    by combining OpenFace [ 95], a high accuracy open-source face recognizer, with
    face tracking to maintain high accuracy and achieve full frame rate speeds. Authors
    also use privacy mediators to enforce user-defined privacy policies (e.g., face
    denaturing), yet the system maintains the original videos for possible future
    needs (e.g., finding an evidence from a crime scene). Addo et al. [ 84] present
    a reference framework for protecting end user’s privacy throughout the emotion
    analytics lifecycle. They propose Affect-Driven Personalization Lifecycle (ADPL),
    a model to learn the privacy preferences of end users through implementing a set
    of privacy rules: personalized anonymity, secure multiparty privacy preservation,
    encrypted data provenance, image-melding and reshaping techniques, and result
    aggregation. 5.4. Digital Forgetting and Data Summarization Digital forgetting
    is the process of provably deleting all copies of a dataset [ 96], while data
    summarization provides a high-level data abstraction to hide details or reduce
    granularity. Digital forgetting and data summarization are important concepts
    to relieve people’s anxiety around data collection. Users would feel more comfortable
    sharing their data knowing that collected data will be wiped out once the purpose
    of collection is void [ 85]. Data summarization is classified into the following:
    (i) Temporal summarization: in which collected data is a function of time (e.g.,
    gather sensor reading per day rather than per minute) (ii) Spatial summarization:
    in which collected data is a function of location (e.g., releasing location data
    at the zip code level rather than raw GPS readings) As the cost of storage decreases,
    the ability to store a large amount of data at low cost dramatically increases.
    This makes it easy for entities collecting data to store it for longer time. Hence,
    the need for creating efficient mechanisms that periodically delete information
    that is no longer needed for which it was generated arises. Therefore, IoT environments
    must take into consideration applying either data forgetting or summarization
    to protect user privacy. A few experimental solutions have been recently developed
    that allow users to share private data over the Internet with assurance that such
    data will be entirely deleted after a certain period of time (e.g., drop.io and
    the Guest Pass features on Flickr [ 97]). However, porting such solutions to IoT
    environments is not straightforward. Therefore, several data forgetting techniques
    have been proposed using classical cryptography [ 86]. Most of these techniques
    assume that encrypted data is deleted when the required decryption key is deleted.
    Several other techniques have been developed based on distributed data storage
    so that data is deleted due to unavoidable social and technical processes [ 87].
    Despite digital forgetting is an effective tool to preserve user privacy, it becomes
    challenging when the data size grows very large due to processing and analytics
    overhead [ 98]. Therefore, efficient data analytics techniques are required to
    reduce such overhead and optimize the process. To address this problem, Baraniuk
    [ 88] proposes to enforce IoT devices to acquire only important data instead of
    everything. Also, effective knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining
    techniques [ 89, 90] are effective solutions to summarize data collected by IoT
    devices, which can enhance the overall system performance and improve quality
    of service yet preserve user privacy. These methods are essential in IoT scenarios,
    in which large amounts of collected data can seriously impact the privacy of individuals
    and compromise the security of economic entities and government institutions.
    6. Privacy Preserving IoT Environments Applying existing Internet standards to
    smart devices can simplify the integration of the envisioned scenarios in the
    IoT contexts. However, the security mechanisms in conventional Internet protocols
    need to be modified or extended to preserve user privacy in IoT applications.
    In this section, we discuss privacy preserving at different layers of the IoT
    stack. We build our discussions based on a three-layer IoT stack as shown in Figure
    3.    Figure 3  IoT three-layered architecture. 6.1. Privacy Preservation in IoT
    Device Layer The IoT device layer (also known as perception layer) contains all
    physical resources that collect/control data (sensors and actuators). However,
    these resources are highly heterogeneous and resource-constrained. Such constraints
    pose unique challenges on applying privacy preserving techniques. Thus, IoT devices
    are subject to several attacks discussed in [ 99] including node capture, fake
    node, malicious data, denial of service attack (DoS), timing attack, routing threats,
    replay attack, side channel attack (SCA), and mass node authentication problem.
    Therefore, several security measures must be considered when designing this layer
    as follows: (i) Access control and authentication: to prevent user privacy leaks
    from open and unauthorized access. Juels et al. [ 100] present a good solution
    to implement Selective RFID Jamming as an access control scheme on low-cost tags
    (ii) Data encryption: to secure data exchange and guarantee safe delivery. Wang
    [ 101] presents a nonlinear key algorithm based on displaced calculation to provide
    data encryption. This key algorithm requires low computational power to provide
    high security and good data transmission rate (iii) Secure channel using IPSec:
    the IPSec protocol [ 102] offers both authentication and encryption. Raza et al.
    [ 103] present a 6LoWPAN/IPsec extension to provide security for IoT devices.
    The authors demonstrate that IPSec outperforms the standard IEEE 802.15.4 link
    layer security in IoT environments (iv) Cryptography technology: to offer privacy
    protection, confidentiality, authenticity and data integrity. Secure communication
    protocols include digital signatures and hash values are used to ensure data integrity
    6.2. Privacy Preservation in Platform/Infrastructure Layer The platform layer
    represents the classical network layer in the OSI model [ 104]. This layer integrates
    intelligent data preprocessing to reduce resource requirements at the application
    layer. The network layer poses some general security problems related to data
    integrity and confidentiality such as unauthorized access to networks, eavesdropping,
    confidentiality and integrity damage, DDoS attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    Although existing network protocols implement highly secured measures, they are
    not robust enough for M2M communications in resource-constrained environments.
    As such, existing security mechanisms are weak/inapplicable on IoT devices and
    may lead to creating barriers rather than connections between different machines.
    Therefore, the heterogeneity of these networks makes security, interoperability,
    and coordination of networks becoming worse, leading to security vulnerabilities.
    New IoT-oriented security mechanisms must be designed from the ground up to fit
    IoT environments, taking into consideration the following security measures: (i)
    Set up an end-to-end authentication and key agreement mechanism, PKI (Public-Key
    Infrastructure), WPKI for wireless, Security routing, IDS, etc. (ii) Utilize network
    virtualization to reduce the network management complexity and the likelihood
    of improper operations. (iii) Adopt IPv6 as a standard network layer protocol
    to support inherited security mechanisms [ 105]. 6.3. Privacy Preservation in
    Application Layer The application layer encompasses 2 parts: the support layer
    where the edge computing and analytical services run and the application service
    layer that provides necessary support from the IoT infrastructure. IoT applications
    are also highly versatile and heterogonous with varying needs, which makes it
    a challenge to offer a standard support. Different applications target different
    domains with unique data collection requirements, which may require different
    security measures. Therefore, the application layer security considerations/requirements
    differ from the previous two layers in the following sense: (1) Nontechnical:
    (a) Privacy awareness: makes users aware of private data collection, potential
    risks, and how to safely use IoT services and avoid private information leakage.
    (b) Security management: strengthens resources, physical security information,
    password management, etc. (2) Technical: (a) Cryptography: fingerprint technology,
    digital watermarking, anonymous authentication, and homomorphic and threshold
    cryptography. (b) Key agreements: incorporate symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems
    and certification transfer technology. 7. Conclusion The Internet of Things has
    the potential to change the world, just as the Internet did two decades ago. Nevertheless,
    any new technology faces several technical and nontechnical challenges. The highly
    diverse IoT application domains, resource-constrained IoT devices, and heterogeneity
    of both devices and platforms hinder the development of a standard IoT framework.
    However, privacy stands out as a critical concern that inhibits the widespread
    adoption IoT. The vulnerabilities of IoT devices can lead to huge security breaks
    and significantly hurt user privacy by exposing personal data. To promote IoT
    adoption and relieve user concerns, platforms, applications, and infrastructures
    must seriously take privacy into consideration. In this survey paper, we outline
    the major privacy threats in IoT environments and discuss the impact of IoT evolution
    on each threat. Privacy concerns such as user identification lead to a much bigger
    threat such as profiling. We surveyed the proposed solutions that overcome various
    privacy concerns and security threats in IoT environments. Most of the proposed
    solutions fall into one of the following categories: (1) authentication and authorization,
    (2) edge computing mediators, (3) data anonymization, and (4) data summarization.
    Consequently, several efforts were focused on providing lightweight authentication
    and keying establishment mechanisms, implementing frameworks based on device fingerprinting
    techniques, and introducing context-aware access control models. Although the
    proposed solutions can relieve some of the privacy concerns in IoT scenarios,
    there is a clear lack of performance evaluation and assessment in real-life scenarios.
    Furthermore, there is a conflict between protecting user privacy and the granularity
    of data access needed to provide better services. This raises the challenge of
    how to support consumer-specific privacy preferences while maintaining the same
    level of service. Such a challenge could be addressed using data anonymization.
    The paper then points out the required measures to preserve privacy in the different
    layers of the IoT stack. Our recommendation for IoT-oriented privacy preservation
    in IoT environments is as follows. First, take security measures into consideration
    at the device layer including access control and authentication, data encryption,
    secure channel based on IPSec, and cryptography. Second, reduce network management
    complexity, set up cohesive authentication mechanism, and adoption of IPv6 must
    be considered in the platform layer. In conclusion, privacy preserving is a shared
    responsibility in which all parties much actively engage and cooperate to provide
    safe IoT environments yet enjoy what IoT may offer. Technology manufacturer must
    design IoT devices with integrated privacy and security measures. Infrastructures
    must implement IoT-oriented mechanisms to prevent privacy leaks and address security
    threats from the ground up. IoT applications must notify users of what data is
    collected and the purpose of collection. IoT users must take extra cautions when
    they authorize access to their private data and better understand the potential
    consequences of any associated risks resulting from any misuse of such data. Conflicts

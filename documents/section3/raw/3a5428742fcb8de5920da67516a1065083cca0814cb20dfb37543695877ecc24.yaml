  description: Changes in water availability have a substantial impact on the sustainability
    and maintenance of agriculture, with water footprint (WF) being a robust methodology
    to assess these transformations. The Guadalupe Valley is one of the places with
    the highest agricultural production in Mexico. Despite its semi-arid climatic
    conditions, it provides high-quality crops that are well-positioned in the world.
    The historical trend of rainfall and temperatures between 1987 and 2017 was analyzed
    to identify climatic patterns in the territory. Through the calculations of the
    water footprint of Grapevine and Olive crops, the sensitivity of the crops to
    recurrent water deficit and their adaptation in their yields to drought episodes
    was identified. The reduction in precipitation and occurrence of extreme temperatures
    have contributed significantly towards augmenting crop evapotranspiration and,
    consequently, intensifying crop irrigation demands. As a result, there has been
    an apparent increase in the consumption of WFagricultural since 2007. Thus, the
    period of highest WFagricultural consumption was 2014 (Extremely dry), as opposed
    to 2011 (Very wet). In particular, the lowest WFgreen consumptions were observed
    in extremely dry years, that is, > 20% of the WFagricultural intensifying drought
    events. Therefore, these periods were compensated with higher uses of WFblue and
    WFgray, which are inversely correlated with precipitation, where vine crops consume
    73% more WFagricultural compared to olive plantations, showing greater interannual
    variability. These results contribute to analyzing the temporal evolution of water
    consumption for agriculture, providing a basis for rational water use strategies.

    Metrics Abstract Changes in water availability have a substantial impact on the
    sustainability and maintenance of agriculture, with water footprint (WF) being
    a robust methodology to assess these transformations. The Guadalupe Valley is
    one of the places with the highest agricultural production in Mexico. Despite
    its semi-arid climatic conditions, it provides high-quality crops that are well-positioned
    in the world. The historical trend of rainfall and temperatures between 1987 and
    2017 was analyzed to identify climatic patterns in the territory. Through the
    calculations of the water footprint of Grapevine and Olive crops, the sensitivity
    of the crops to recurrent water deficit and their adaptation in their yields to
    drought episodes was identified. The reduction in precipitation and occurrence
    of extreme temperatures have contributed significantly towards augmenting crop
    evapotranspiration and, consequently, intensifying crop irrigation demands. As
    a result, there has been an apparent increase in the consumption of WFagricultural
    since 2007. Thus, the period of highest WFagricultural consumption was 2014 (Extremely
    dry), as opposed to 2011 (Very wet). In particular, the lowest WFgreen consumptions
    were observed in extremely dry years, that is, > 20% of the WFagricultural intensifying
    drought events. Therefore, these periods were compensated with higher uses of
    WFblue and WFgray, which are inversely correlated with precipitation, where vine
    crops consume 73% more WFagricultural compared to olive plantations, showing greater
    interannual variability. These results contribute to analyzing the temporal evolution
    of water consumption for agriculture, providing a basis for rational water use

    Open access 13 December 2021 Introduction At present, droughts are one of the
    extreme socio-natural hazards that pose the greatest severity or threat to social
    stability and biophysical resilience of the environment, due to their repercussions
    on agricultural production and economic growth1. Moreover, drought processes develop
    progressively within a given territory due to a continuous and cyclical period
    of water stress, resulting from the abnormal decrease in precipitation, together
    with fluctuating temperatures and eco-hydrological changes2. It is essential to
    consider that the water cycle in environments affected by drought is characterized
    by high evapotranspiration rates and reduced precipitation, resulting in deficient
    surface runoff and low groundwater recharge. The latter leads to decreased soil
    moisture storage, increased erosion, and deteriorated vegetation cover in areas
    far from river sources3,4,5. In addition, droughts can be categorized into meteorological,
    agricultural, hydrological, and socioeconomic types based on their periodicity.
    They often lead to water shortages or deficits, particularly severe in arid or
    semi-arid regions6. These regions constitute 41% of the global area and are experiencing
    trends in water availability that fall below historical averages7. It is projected
    that dryland extent will increase by 4% to 10% by 2100 compared to the 1961–1990
    period under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change8,9. Water scarcity is a significant
    issue in various parts of the world. The critical areas affected by it include
    the western USA, Mexico, the west coast of South America, sub-Saharan Africa,
    Pakistan, the Middle East, and Central America5,8. Nevertheless, the highest percentage
    of drylands is concentrated in Latin American and Caribbean countries, that is,
    Argentina (69%), Mexico (65%), and Chile (58%)10. Furthermore, the combination
    of climate change, climate variability, and inefficient water usage11, along with
    irrational consumption habits12, intensified agriculture, and changes in land
    use13, have significantly impacted the load capacity of water resources and their
    security. This has led to a severe water crisis in arid areas14. As a result,
    conflicts related to socio-environmental issues have become more severe in various
    regions, hindering the achievement of the United Nations'' Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs). Specifically, it is making it difficult to achieve the targets of
    Zero Hunger (Target 2), Clean Water and Sanitation (Target 6), and Life on Land
    (Target 15) by 203015,16. However, it is not only about the amount of water that
    is limited by climatic variables or overexploitation of water sources, but also
    about the repercussions in geographical and temporal dimensions that influence
    the hydro-social cycle17. As agriculture is one of the main productive activities
    globally, extreme droughts have had an impact on the loss of agricultural land,
    estimated at approximately 21 t−1 ha−1 average, which is up to 16 times higher
    than the weathering process of rocks14. Understanding freshwater consumption in
    agriculture is crucial18 to establishing resilience and food security strategies.
    Therefore, broadening the concept towards an environmental water flow approach
    becomes necessary. This approach will help in identifying water-saving routes
    in regional crop production. The assessment of water resources appropriation needs
    to broaden the criteria for integrated resource management. The focus should be
    on determining the various environmental sources or flows of water for effective
    and sustainable management of water resources19. It is essential to consider not
    only the use of blue water (water resources extracted from surface water runoff
    and groundwater infiltration) but also the use of green water (precipitation temporarily
    stored in the soil or intercepted by vegetation and exported to the atmosphere
    as evapotranspiration), along with their interactions20. The distribution of seasonal
    precipitation, combined with evapotranspiration, directly influences water availability
    patterns, affecting regional hydrology and crop yields21. Consequently, the main
    functions of green water are productive (i.e., maintenance of up to ~ 65% of overall
    crop production) and regulatory (i.e., energy balance and convective conditions)22,
    where green water flow is composed of about 59% transpiration, 21% plant interception,
    10% soil interception, and 6% soil moisture evaporation23. Similarly, blue water
    serves a multitude of functions, including but not limited to supply, transport/chemical
    loading (nutrients and pollutants), regulation/control, and production24,25; furthermore,
    irrigation accounts for about 70% of the world''s blue water use26. A complex
    interaction of these variables (climatic and productive) has led water-scarce
    regions to produce more water-intensive but higher-value crops. In regions where
    water resources for agricultural purposes are scarce, a potential reduction of
    56% in water usage can be achieved by cultivating crops better adapted to the
    area''s green and blue water availability27. At the same time, it is essential
    to acknowledge that soils in arid regions are fragile (eroded or degraded). This
    is because they have less natural primary production, organic matter, nutrients,
    water retention capacity, and fertility. As a result, plant growth and biomass
    are negatively affected. Therefore, before adding excessive amounts of chemical
    fertilizers, it is essential to assess the volume of grey water needed to assimilate
    the pollutants generated during the cultivation process28. Considering the previously
    mentioned, prioritizing the evaluation of water abstractions is crucial for understanding
    the relationship between productive activities, the water cycle, and the pressure
    on water resources to ensure sustainable development in agriculture. Comprehensive
    indicators such as estimating the water footprint can help achieve this goal20.
    In addition, the agricultural water footprint (WFagriculture) is a measure that
    indirectly evaluates the impact of aridity by considering the local water demands
    and supplies23. It considers atmospheric water requirements such as evaporation
    and evapotranspiration, as well as temperature, precipitation, and irrigation.
    The measure also considers soil moisture, soil characteristics, and crop yield21,29.
    WFagriculture studies distinguish between the use of different water sources—blue
    (WFblue), green (WFgreen), and gray (WFgray)—where the amount of precipitation
    before the growing season can reduce the need for irrigation during crop growth.
    This can lead to a significant decrease in the use of blue water up to 96% for
    some crops8,20,30. However, during drought events, scarcity affects water flows
    equally, becoming crucial to increase irrigation to compensate for crops'' deficit
    or green water requirements (CWUgreen). Nevertheless, more than blue water requirements
    (CWUblue) are required, constituting deficit irrigation at the expense of environmental
    flows and/or groundwater reserves30,31,32. Thus, to contribute to land management
    programs for irrigated crops in water-stressed basins, it is crucial to have accurate
    information on how agricultural water footprints have changed over time. This
    requires refined estimates over extended periods, which can be used in decision-making
    to reduce the latency of input data and improve future projections. By incorporating
    the influence of intra- and inter-annual climate variability in drought mitigation
    or action plans, we can make more informed decisions based on water footprint
    results33. Our research lies in understanding water use in agriculture, considering
    that in Mexico, approximately two-thirds of its territory is located in arid or
    semi-arid areas facing natural water scarcity, where the pressure on water resources
    has experienced a severe drought condition, which has persisted in the last 27
    years, associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and by the increase
    in water demand (up to 35%), especially after the mid-1990s34,35,36. The water
    deficit is particularly severe in northern Mexico, where semi-arid areas cover
    about 50% of the total surface37. The central forecasts correspond to a 10–20%
    decrease in mean annual precipitation, a 1.5 to 2.5 °C temperature increase, intensified
    incidence of heat waves, and a reduction in aquifer recharge38. The Valle de Guadalupe
    is a semi-arid rural area in the Ensenada municipality in Baja California. Despite
    the critical water situation, it is one of Mexico''s highest producers of olives
    and grapevines, with about 46.6% of the total cultivated area dedicated to high-quality,
    high-value grapes39. The area produces 75% of Mexico''s wine and 30% of its olive
    oil, making export crops and by-products the primary economic and tourism livelihood
    source. However, the limited water resources and agricultural land make the continuity
    of these industries vulnerable. Different crops require varying amounts of water,
    and it is crucial to assess their water footprint to understand the factors that
    influence these differences. This helps promote the efficient use of water in
    agricultural production. To this end, this study examines the water footprint
    for olive and vine cultivation, two of the most predominant crops. Additionally,
    the impact of climate variability on agricultural WFagricultural consumption is
    analyzed through temporal analysis. This analysis is based on the climatic variables
    recorded for very wet, wet, normal, dry, and arid years. Results Determination
    of climatic variability The interannual precipitation of the Guadalupe Valley
    for the 29 years analyzed shows a historical mean of 250 mm, with 62% of the analyzed
    years below this mean. The years 1989, 1999, 2002, 2007, 2009, and 2014 recorded
    amounts between 59–133 mm, which is significantly lower precipitation compared
    to the other years (F(30,341) = 1.03; p = 0.001) (Fig. 1a). That is, years with
    a deficit between 76 to 47% of precipitation regarding the 1987–2017 average,
    with a negative trend starting in 2005 (Fig. 1a). Figure 1 Precipitation behavior

    Full size image In the annual cycle, the behavior of seasonal cycles and extreme
    values in daily and monthly observations indicate greater variability and rainfall
    amounts during the winter period (December-March), where about 74% of precipitation
    occurs (ANOVA F(11,360) = 16.8, p = 0.001), with a prolonged dry period in June–August
    (Fig. 1b). According to the percentile analysis, extreme conditions of very dry
    years were observed in 1989, 1999, 2002, 2007, 2009, and 2014 with 0—20% of the
    precipitation percentile, with 1989 being the most extreme. Contrary to the years
    1987, 1992, 1993, 1998, 1998, 2004, 2010, and 2011 which showed a very wet condition,
    between 80–100%. Only five years of the analyzed series were classified as normal
    (Fig. 2). Figure 2 Climate classification according to the precipitation thresholds
    in the Guadalupe Valley. Full size image Regarding temperature, annual mean values
    ranged from 15° to 19.5 °C, with the years 2006 and 2014 being the warmest with
    recorded temperatures above 19 °C, that is, positive anomalies of + 1.4 °C to + 1.8
    °C above the climatological average in 1987–2017 series (30 years), where it is
    possible to observe a dominance of the natural climate variability signal, as
    opposed to ENSO years (contributing to warmer temperatures, overlapping with the
    El Niño period 2005–2006 or 2014–2015) (Fig. 3a). Figure 3 Evolution of the average
    temperature of the Guadalupe Valley. (a) Absolute anomalies of the average annual
    temperature for the 1987–2017 period (red bars indicate warming, and blue bars
    indicate cooling) and annual average, (b) monthly average. Full size image The
    evolution of the monthly mean temperature shows significantly higher values in
    the summer period (July, August, September) compared to other months of the year
    (ANOVA F(11,360) = 170.2, P = 0.001) (Fig. 3b). Lastly, the precipitation and
    temperature data series are moderately inversely correlated (r = − 0.66; p < 0.05),
    i.e., precipitation is lower in the months where temperature increases, decreasing
    water availability in the Guadalupe Valley in the warmer periods. In summary,
    high climatic variability of the Guadalupe Valley can be observed from 1996, increasing
    both ‘very dry’ and ‘very wet’ years, thus intensifying extreme weather conditions.
    As a result, the occurrence of extreme meteorological droughts has been evident
    every 3 to 5 years since 1999. The annual precipitation trend has decreased over
    the last 12 years; however, 1989 stands out for its low rainfall and high temperatures.
    Meanwhile, the changes identified in the annual temperature result in an amplification
    of the thermal oscillation. Water footprint of the Guadalupe Valley for the agricultural
    sector Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) in 2007–2017 was estimated between 573 and
    830 mm. It is observed that ETc values decreased in 2010–2011, i.e., 596—573 mm
    respectively, unlike 2014, where it reached the maximum amounts. The temporal
    behavior of ETc is correlated with ETo (r = 0.99; p < 0.05) and irrigation requirements
    (IR) (R = 0.93; p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). Figure 4 (a) Annual variation percentage of
    WFagricultural regarding the previous year. (b) Annual distribution in WFblue,
    WFgreen, and WFgray consumptions. c) Accumulated WFagricultural of the Guadalupe
    Valley basin, Mexico, crop evapotranspiration (ETc), irrigation requirements (IR),
    reference evapotranspiration (ETo), annual precipitation (Prec.) and effective
    precipitation (Eff. Prec.) from 2007–2017. Full size image Similarly, the IR of
    the crops is inversely correlated with precipitation and effective precipitation
    (r = − 0.84; p < 0.05), which were higher in 2010–2011. With the increase in precipitation,
    ETo and ETc values were drastically reduced, combined with the decrease in temperatures,
    as in the case of 2010–2011. In contrast, in 2014, although it was not the only
    extremely dry year with a precipitation deficit, the extreme temperatures recorded
    led to an increase in ETc and IR. The WFagricultural of the crops analyzed in
    the Guadalupe Valley presented estimated consumptions between 645 and 1121 m3/ton.
    Although there was some interannual variability, a slight incremental trend was
    identified in the 11 years analyzed, and the year 2014, which had extremely dry
    rainfall, had the highest WFagricultural consumption. On the other hand, 2011,
    which was a very wet year, had the lowest consumption estimated (as shown in Fig.
    4). Thus, WFagricultural is significantly correlated with ETo (r = 0.86; p < 0.05),
    ETc (r = 0.88; p < 0.05), IR (r = 0.90; p < 0.05), WFblue (r = 0.95; p < 0.05),
    and WFgray (r = 0.93; p < 0.05), and inversely correlated with precipitation (r = −
    0.85; p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). The highest consumption of WFgreen was observed in 2010,
    2011, and 2015 (Extremely humid and normal), with 35%, 38%, and 27% of the total
    WFagricultural, being found in these periods the precipitation and soil moisture
    necessary for crop growth, a variable that is inversely correlated with IR (r = −
    0.78; p < 0.05). While the highest uses of WFblue were calculated for Extremely
    dry years, when the need for irrigation increased, that is, the years 2007 (620
    m3t−1), 2009 (571 m3t−1), 2014 (752 m3t−1) and 2017 (620 m3t−1), volumes corresponding
    to 64—68% of the WFagricultural. Additionally, WFblue trends are correlated with
    ETo (r = 0.81; p < 0.05), ETc (r = 0.80; p < 0.05), IR (0.97; p < 0.05), and WFgray
    (0.95; p < 0.05) and inversely correlated with precipitation (r = -0.87; p < 0.05).
    Meanwhile, the highest uses of WFgray were determined in 2007, 2009, 2014, and
    2015 (Extremely dry and normal) with consumption above 200 m3t−1, a variable correlated
    with irrigation requirements (r = 0.82; p < 0.05), and inversely correlated with
    precipitation (r = − 0.91; p < 0.05) (Fig. 4). Water footprint by crop type Significant
    differences were observed in the WFagricultural consumption of the evaluated crops,
    with higher consumption in grapevine plantations by 73%, corresponding to an average
    of 127.4 ± 11.8 m3t−1 between 2007 – 2017 (F(1,20) = 185.1; p = 0.001), as well
    as the consumptions of WFgreen, WFblue, and WFgray, which are significantly higher
    in grape production compared to olive, that is, 67%, 84%, and 43%, respectively
    (F(3,30) = 129.7; p = 0.001) (Fig. 5). Figure 5 Average of WFagricultural (WFgreen,
    blue, gray) the grapes and olives crops, series analyzed for the Valle de Guadalupe,
    Mexico. Full size image Grapevine crops show high interannual variability, that
    is, an average of 3% ± 22.5 in WFagricultural consumption, with a maximum of 922.1
    m3t−1 in 2014 (Extremely dry), presenting a higher use of WFgreen in 2010, 2011,
    and 2015, which is above the 170 m3t−1 uses of WFblue in 2007, 2014, and 2017,
    exceeding 500 m3t−1, and WFgray in 2007–2014, exceeding 150 m3t−1. Maximum water
    uses of CWUgreen crops were evinced in the 2011 period (Extremely humid) (1883
    m3ha−1) and for CWUblue in 2014 (Extremely dry) (4601 m3ha−1) (Fig. 6a). Figure

    analyzed in 2007–2017 for the Valle de Guadalupe, Mexico. Full size image On the
    other hand, olive crops presented a lower interannual variability of WFagricultural,
    that is -1% ± 5.3, with amounts up to 199 m3t−1 recorded in 2014 (Extremely dry).
    The highest consumptions of WFgreen were in 2010, 2011, and 2013, above 55 m3t−1;
    WFblue in 2014–2017 with values above 95 m3t−1; and WFgray in 2016 with more than
    74 m3t−1. In addition, in the 2010 period, the maximum uses of CWUgreen (1414
    m3ha−1) and 2014–2017 of CWUblue (> 2000 m3ha−1) were estimated (Fig. 6b). Crop
    conditions in the Guadalupe Valley reported yields below 10 t−1 ha−1 for grapevine39,40and
    12 t−1 ha−1for olive41. Therefore, the net crop production and annual WFagriculture
    consumptions, when compared to the amount of water granted (25 × 106 m3 according
    to the Drinking Water Committee), it is possible to identify the annual use of
    36.4 to 82.7% of the available water (Table 1), where the maximum Total WFgrapes
    were evinced in 2012, 2013, 2014 and for Total WFolives in 2010, 2013, 2016 (Table
    1). Both crops accounted for an average of 55% ± 12 of the water available for
    agriculture in the study period. Table 1 WFgrapes and WFolives consumption according
    to annual production and water availability in the Guadalupe Valley, Mexico. Full
    size table Discussion Currently, drought management comprises measures aimed at
    restricting water supply, reducing demand, and minimizing impacts. These measures
    have multiple effects on the maintenance and conservation of ecosystems, optimization
    of water supply, availability, and recharge within watersheds4. In order to use
    resources efficiently, it is important to understand the consequences of climate
    variability on hydrological responses. In terms of precipitation in the Guadalupe
    Valley, in the last 30 years analyzed, 62% of the period is below the historical
    average of 250 mm, i.e., a deficit of 76—47% of precipitation, with a clear negative
    annual/seasonal trend since 2005. The yearly variation in precipitation levels
    can be attributed to the impact of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific
    Warm Decadal Oscillation (PDO) events42. Our analysis has identified extreme conditions
    such as very dry or wet years and their alternation as evidence of these events.
    Therefore, it is important to note that the transition from El Niño during 1998
    (the rainiest year in the hydro-climatic record, classified as very wet) to the
    La Niña event (the following year) (Fig. 1), which marked the beginning of prolonged
    drought periods, in which extreme drought became even more severe later, that
    is, in the years 1999, 2002, 2006, 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2014 (P < 140 mm), being
    possible to observe a dominance of the natural climate variability signal, versus
    ENSO years, contributing to warmer temperatures as El Niño in the 2005–2006 or
    2014–2015 periods observed, with positive anomalies from + 1.4 °C to + 1.8 °C.
    El Niño is linked to the increase in surface water temperature in the central
    Pacific Ocean, inducing severe droughts in Indonesia, Australia, and northeastern
    South America5,43. La Niña, on the other hand, occurs when the surface water temperature
    drops off the coast in the Pacific Ocean, contributing to drier than normal weather
    in the North and South American regions, which also influences drought episodes,
    with a more complex impact on weather patterns than El Niño5,43,44. Although El
    Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Sea Surface
    Temperatures (SST) of the tropical Atlantic have played an important role in recent
    drought in northern Mexico44,45. However, global warming has increased the demand
    for atmospheric humidity and has probably altered circulation patterns, contributing
    to sustained episodes of drought in the northwestern region of Mexico, observed
    since 199434, where recurrent dry years have significantly diminished water resources,
    in which high interannual climate variability through changes in precipitation
    and temperature, aggravating the present situation in the Guadalupe Valley10.
    Temperature and precipitation are the main climatic factors that produce changes
    in soil water content and, therefore, directly regulate crop growth. By including
    these variables, the water footprint analysis reflects the water requirements
    in agriculture and the sensitivity of the results, where the precipitation deficit
    and extreme increase in temperatures conditioned the increase in ETo, ETc and,
    IR46. Therefore, of the 11 years evaluated and considered as the present conditions
    (2007–2017), a slight incremental trend of water consumption was observed, despite
    the interannual variability, where the highest consumption of WFagricultural (grapevine + olive)
    was in the year 2014, classified as Extremely dry. This trend was also identified
    in the high WFblue consumption in 2007, 2009, 2014, and 2017, since during drought
    years, there was an increase in crop ET related to climatic variables and irrigation
    requirements. In contrast, in the years classified as extremely wet and normal,
    i.e., 2010, 2011, and 2015, more WFgreen was consumed; being essential to include
    the evapotranspiration flux link between the ecological and hydrological systems,
    understanding that biological water use is inexorably linked to ecosystem productivity
    (Fig. 7). Figure 7 Summary of the agricultural water footprint of the Guadalupe
    Valley (Reference: Author’s elaboration). Full size image The reported results,
    as described in Marston and Konar25 in the California Valley, differences in WFagricultural
    during periods of drought are also attributed to reasons for changes in crop area
    and yields, increases in ETc, irrigation demand to compensate for precipitation
    deficits, and increased groundwater consumption due to reduced surface water availability47.
    In these wine and fruit growing regions, in addition to the seasonal climatic
    changes described above, it is also necessary to include the influence of climate
    on an intermediate geographical scale (< 50 km) since these local climatic differences
    can cause considerable changes in crop physiology and phenology. Therefore, it
    is suggested to grow deep-rooted plants in drylands, due to the lower probability
    of suffering stress due to effects or changes in soil moisture, compared to shallow-rooted
    crops with less root coverage48,49. However, crops can also modify their water
    needs through physiological adjustments, that is, in the regulation of stomatal
    conductance and leaf area transformation50, being crucial to the adaptation of
    plants to changing hydrological regimes, where their growth depends on whether
    the altered water supply is sufficient. Thus, the highest water requirements per
    hectare of crops were recorded in 2011 (1883 m3ha−1) for CWUgreen and 2014 (4601
    m3ha−1) for CWUblue, with olive crops being the best adapted to interannual variability
    according to WFagricultural. As WFagricultural is associated with both yield and
    seasonal water consumption, grapevine growing conditions in the Guadalupe Valley
    are limited by low yields, i.e., less than 10 t-1 ha−1, compared to the main wine
    producers, for example, Italy, France, and Spain (over 80 t-1 ha−1). For olives,
    yields are even more extreme, reaching maximums of 23.40 t−1 ha−1 and minimums
    of 0.10 t−1 ha−1, respectively35,37. Excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers is
    common in sandy soils such as those in the Guadalupe Valley. As a result, the
    soil contains nitrate levels of more than 15 mg kg−1, while nearby aquifers show
    levels of 10 mg L−151. This has led to severe contamination problems by leaching
    and accumulation of macronutrients, especially during extremely dry periods when
    more irrigation is needed. As a solution, significant uses of WFgray were established
    to prevent further contamination52. For agriculture to be a sustainable activity
    over time, it is necessary to include all approaches for mitigation and adaptation
    to water-scarce environments, from broadly tolerant crops to the introduction
    of climate and disease-resistant seed varieties, diversification, and crop calendars.
    In addition to the above, better information on droughts and climate variables,
    planned and comprehensive agricultural relocation, support for land use changes,
    and marketing strategies53 become necessary, with productive land and fertile
    soil being the most important natural capital asset27. Therefore, soil preparation
    is essential, such as zero tillage and composting, the introduction of cover crops,
    intensive grazing management, and reduction in the use of chemical and synthetic
    inputs. Banwell54 insist that such measures should consider the participation
    of various stakeholders, especially with a bottom-up approach. Indeed, only by
    modifying the cropping pattern could water scarcity be significantly reduced and
    production increased. According to Davis56, it is possible to reduce green and
    blue water consumption by 13.6% and 12.1%, respectively, only by growing the crops
    recommended for the area. First, however, farmers and decision-makers must be
    aware of the problem. Since drought or water scarcity are dynamic, multiple indicators
    for their monitoring have been established57. Although initially, the water footprint
    is a tool for the evaluation of water consumption in production chains, in this
    study, it is possible to establish the sensitivity of crop water consumption results
    to changing weather conditions58,59,60, contributing to be the starting point
    for timely monitoring of water deficit and agricultural development in the area,
    for adequate preparation of responses according to the effects on the environment,
    agriculture, and local economy, understanding that the beginning and end of dry
    periods are perceived in retrospect. However, food security and water availability
    need immediate action48,61. Lastly, we must not forget that the water resource
    is a priority requirement on which we depend, fulfilling its function through
    its cycle, storage, transport, hydroclimatic and ecological regulation, in which
    water flows, in all its states (blue, green, and gray), intervene in energy balances
    and biogeochemical cycles, for example, critical ecosystem services require 90%
    of global evapotranspiration for their functioning62,63. Conclusion The increase
    in precipitation in the Guadalupe Valley has a significant impact on the drastic
    reduction in ETo and ETc values, also influenced by the decrease in temperatures.
    However, this situation was contrary to the precipitation deficit and extreme
    temperatures that caused an increase in ETc and IR in crops. A clear incremental
    trend in the consumption of WFagricultural was identified during the 11 years
    analyzed. Moreover, 2014 (Extremely dry) was the period with the highest WFagricultural
    consumption, as opposed to 2011 (very wet), where the lowest consumption was estimated.
    The quantification of green water flow must necessarily be included in the evaluation
    of water resource security since the lowest consumption of WFgreen was observed
    in extremely dry years, that is, > 20% of the WFagricultural, due to the limitation
    in the availability of green water, intensifying and aggravating drought events.
    Periods compensated with higher uses of WFblue, corresponding to 64—68% of the
    WFagricultural, periods where the need for irrigation increases. The dissolution
    of fertilizers (nitrogen) decreases in periods of water scarcity, thus increasing
    the probability of contamination of environmental matrices, where the highest
    WFgray was determined in Extremely dry years with a consumption of over 200 m3/ton,
    a variable correlated with the irrigation requirement and inversely correlated
    with precipitation. Grapevine crops consume 73% more WFagricultural compared to
    olive plantations and also showed greater inter-annual variability, in other words,
    less adaptation to climate variability. Nevertheless, the commercialization and
    water productivity of these crops is responsible for the continuity of their production.
    The results obtained are a significant step towards reducing water waste in agriculture
    in arid regions with limited resources and fragile ecological environments. Despite
    the efforts made so far, such as the National Program Against Drought, the Mexican
    Drought Monitor, and the Programs for Drought Prevention and Mitigation Measures,
    these measures are considered insufficient. We must formulate strategies involving
    the rational use of agricultural water to tackle this issue effectively. Materials
    and methods Site of study The Guadalupe Valley basin (32°03’N—116°37’W) is located
    northeast of the municipality of Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico (2380 km2).
    Its population reaches 6,924 inhabitants, concentrated in 0.4% of the basin’s
    territory, 38.7% of the inhabitants live in poverty, and 35.5% are vulnerable
    due to social deprivation. Economic activities are mainly related to livestock,
    tourism, and agriculture64. Similarly, the little of the land in this area is
    used for agriculture (cultivated lands), accounting for 2.7% of the total land
    area (6272 hectares). Out of this, 60% is dedicated to grapevine and olive production.
    Other land uses include scrub (94.3%), forest (1.8%), grassland (1%) and water
    bodies (0.02%)64,65 as seen in Fig. 8. Figure 8 Location, land use, and water
    bodies identified in the study area, Guadalupe Valley, Mexico (Reference: ArcGIS
    9.3 software developed by ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute), https://www.esri.com)66.
    Full size image The Guadalupe Valley is classified as a semi-desert region with
    a semi-arid Mediterranean climate, directly influenced by the Pacific Ocean coastal
    system, which is only 25 km away, exposing Guadalupe Valley to dense fogs, breezes,
    and marine humidity. Climatic conditions resulted in mild temperatures year-round,
    with an average of 18 °C annually from 1986–2016. Monthly temperatures range from
    5.4 to 31.6°C67. Precipitation is a consequence of the weakening of the North
    Pacific system in the winter, which allows the entry of convective and frontal
    systems; average annual rainfall amounts reach 298 mm (1992—2016)68. Precipitation
    variations are mainly associated with El Niño/Southern Oscillation and the Pacific
    Decadal Oscillation (PDO). These hydroclimatic phenomena bring unusual precipitation
    events to the region, as under warm conditions during El Niño and the PDO, the
    precipitation rate tends to increase. In contrast, under cold conditions during
    El Niño and the PDO, the precipitation decreases45,69. The research methodology
    was developed in 3 stages. In the first stage, the climatic behavior of the Guadalupe
    Valley basin was analyzed. During the second stage, the database was developed,
    and the classification of the drought cycles was conducted. Finally, the crops’
    water footprint was calculated. Determination of climatic variability The meteorological
    input data were selected from 2 meteorological and pluviometric stations maintained
    by the Information System for Irrigation Water Management of Baja California (Fomento
    Agropecuario de Baja California) and the meteorological network CICESE-CLICOM
    (Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education at Ensenada). These stations
    are located in the Guadalupe Valley, that is Agua Caliente (32°04''N–116°37''W)
    and Porvenir (32°06''N–116°27''W) stations, considering a 31-year data (1987–2017
    period). Monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation and temperature data were
    used. Exploratory and consistency analyses of the data were carried out using
    the double-mass curve method70. Boxplots were used to visualize the behavior,
    which provided information on the trend of seasonal cycles and extreme values
    in the observations. The classification of dry, normal, and wet years was made
    using the percentile method, which defines five categories: very dry (0–20 percentile),
    dry (20–40 percentile), normal (40–60 percentile), wet (60–80) and very wet (80–100)71.
    Calculation of the water footprint of olive and grapevine crops (WFagricultural)
    In the WFagricultural analysis, climate variables were included with georeferenced
    information from 2007—2017, with primary values of precipitation (mm/month), temperature
    (°C), wind (km/day), insolation (hrs), humidity (%), and secondary values of effective
    precipitation (mm/month), evapotranspiration (mm/day), solar radiation (MJ/m2/day),
    as well as standardized soil properties data. In addition, grapevine and olive
    crop data were used, such as Kc values, stages, and critical depletion fraction
    by development period, along with estimates of crop evapotranspiration and irrigation
    requirements. To estimate the WFagricultural, the methodology proposed by Hoekstra72
    was used, which considers the sum of its components: WFblue, WFgreen, and WFgray,
    of the assessed crops grapes (WFgrapes) and olives (WFolives) (Eqs. (1) and (2).
    The determination of WFblue and WFgreen was made from Eqs. (3) and (4), where
    Y corresponds to crop yield (t ha-1) and CWUblue, CWUgreen green and blue crop
    water use, according to its source (precipitation or irrigation), expressed in
    m3 ha−1. For the calculation of blue and green crop water use (CWUblue, CWUgreen),
    they were estimated based on the relationships of Eqs. (5) and (6). In the equations,
    Σ represents the crop growth cycle, that is, which starts from sowing (day 1)
    and ends at harvest. In addition, Igp represents the length in days of each cycle
    stage. ETblue is blue water evapotranspiration, and ETgreen is green water evapotranspiration.
    We use a conversion factor 10 to convert the water depths in millimeters into
    water volumes per land surface area in m3/ha. $${\\text{WF}}_{{{\\text{agricultural}}}}

    The water demand of grapevine and olive crops was determined considering the crop
    water requirement (CWR) using the CROPWAT 8.0 software73,74. This software allows
    the calculation of water supply for different crop patterns, amount of irrigation
    according to their typology, and crop yield, both under irrigated and non-irrigated
    conditions75. The crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was calculated based on irrigation
    requirement (IR), assuming that water losses due to irrigation remain and return
    to the basin. Where ETc (mm/dec) is adjusted to decadal values (dec), in relation
    to irrigation efficiency throughout the crop growing season, under ideal growing
    conditions, it is assumed that the water requirements of the plantations are met76,
    so that the sum of ETgreen and ETblue equals ETc. ETblue was estimated according
    to Eq. (7), an equation that included the determination of I.R. (Eq. (8). the
    program calculated Effective Precipitation (Peff) according to the USDA S.C. method.
    This parameter refers to the fraction of the total precipitation used to meet
    the irrigation needs of the crop. If (Peff) is higher than the total evapotranspiration
    of the crop, ETblue is equal to zero indicating that no additional water is needed.
    The value of ETgreen was determined using Eq. (9), which considers the ETc values
    calculated in Eqs. (10) and (11). The crop coefficient, Kc, considers the crop
    characteristics and the average effects of soil evaporation. The reference evapotranspiration,
    ETo (mm month−1), was calculated using the Penman–Monteith method with the CROPWAT
    8.0 program. Climate data based on the latitude and analyzed period was also considered
    in the calculation29. Calculation of the gray water footprint of crops (WFgray)
    The WFgray is defined as the amount of water necessary to assimilate the residues
    and dilute them so that their concentration remains within the quality ranges,
    according to the regulations38. WFgray was estimated according to Eq. (12), where
    AR corresponds to the applied amount of fertilizer, α represents the leaching
    and runoff fraction of the product expressed as a percentage, Cmax is the maximum
    acceptable concentration defined by quality standards, Cnat is the natural concentration
    of the pollutant, Y is the yield of agricultural production, and the agent used
    corresponds to nitrogen for each agricultural crop (AR) 72. The leaching fraction
    of this agent was 10%, and the Cmax was 0.03 kg m3, based on NOM-001-SEMARNAT
    Mexican Emission Standard. The Cnat was set at 0.00001 kg m3 through the best-case
    scenario assessment according to the methodology of Hoekstra72. Statistical analyses
    Correlation analyses were performed for the hydrological variables according to
    the Pearson coefficient using STATISTICA 8.0. In addition, for the WFagricultural
    ANOVA tests were computed. Data availability This entire data set, or specific

  description: Unsustainable agriculture and fisheries due to their association with
    pollution, global warming, and high energy demand warrant effective mechanisms
    to reverse the trends. Fine bubble technology (FBT) has emerged as a groundbreaking
    solution for addressing critical challenges related to climate change, environmental
    sustainability, cost, and energy efficiency in production processes. By reviewing
    the literature on FBT application in the two sectors, this article builds a case
    for FBT as a fundamental technology for sustainable and resilient food production
    systems with minimal environmental impact. Results indicate the potential of FBT
    in reducing fertilizer use by about 20%, methane gas emissions in paddy rice by
    approximately 20%, reducing pesticides and pharmaceuticals use, energy saving
    due to improved efficiencies in irrigation, seed germination, and higher stocking
    densities in fisheries. FBT also offers options for managing cadmium-contaminated
    soils. Despite challenges in the generation of fine bubbles and associated costs,
    FBT benefits including a positive economic performance indicated by a benefit-to-cost
    ratio of greater than one would be the driving force towards further optimization
    of FBT to enhance its adoption and commercialization towards sustainable and resilient

    The escalating global population, projected to reach 9 billion by 2037 (United
    Nations, 2022) has intensified the demand for food, necessitating a corresponding
    increase in the food supply systems (Falcon et al., 2022). Agriculture and fisheries
    as primary food producers have responded by intensifying production to meet the
    dietary needs of the growing population. Intensified food production has brought
    significant environmental challenges impacting negatively on water pollution,
    human health, and global warming (FAO, 2002). Water pollution emanates from excessive
    use of chemicals including mineral fertilizer and pesticides. Excess nitrates
    and phosphates from mineral fertilizers either wash into natural water systems
    causing eutrophication or sip into and contaminate groundwater resources. Excessive
    use of nitrogen fertilizer poses extra challenges including soil acidification,
    air pollution (NH3 and NOX emissions), and greenhouse gas emissions (N2O) (Wang
    et al., 2023). Extensive utilization of pesticides is linked with carcinogenic
    and other toxicity effects that impact humans and various wildlife species (Rajmohan
    et al., 2020). Intensive aquaculture production establishes situations where farmed
    fish may face continuous exposure to pathogens, necessitating regular use of pesticides
    and pharmaceuticals (Mavraganis et al., 2020). The use of antibiotics in aquaculture
    has induced antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria causing harmful effects on
    the health of humans and animals (Hossain et al., 2022). Agriculture produces
    around 10% (Rehman et al., 2020) to 24% (Hafeez et al., 2020) of global greenhouse
    gases (Rehman et al., 2020) mainly methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide.
    Methane is emitted from rice paddies among other agriculture practices, while
    nitrous oxide emanates from nitrate fertilizer. The current food production system
    is energy intensive exemplified by nearly 14.4% of energy in the United States
    being used in agriculture in the year 2002 (Mohareb et al., 2017). UNEP (UNEP,
    2021) estimated a global environmental cost of $3 trillion annually due to unsustainable
    agriculture practices, while Hafeez, Yuan (Hafeez et al., 2020) indicated a positive
    correlation between agriculture intensification and environmental degradation.
    China, the largest global consumer of nitrogen fertilizer, exhibits a loss of
    approximately half of the applied nitrogen through volatilization, and an additional
    5 to 10 percent through leaching (FAO, 2002). Though the nitrogen use efficiency
    had improved by 28% in 2018 (Shen et al., 2024) due to reduced mineral fertilizer
    applications and improved crop management, the global mineral fertilizer application
    rate is still very high estimated at 185.95 million tons (FAO, 2022). Continued
    use of pesticides in controlling weeds and pathogens notwithstanding maintaining
    the quality of perishable products is rampant (Aktar et al., 2009). Pesticide
    sales surged to 370 million kilograms in 2018 within the EU (Jacquet et al., 2022).
    Pesticides and pharmaceuticals used in aquaculture are also significant. Recently,
    Zhou, Yu (Zhou et al., 2021) revealed the presence of pharmaceutical residues
    in both fish feeds and pond sediments from some fish farms in southern China.
    These included quinolones, tetracyclines, florfenicol, and salicylic acid. Wang,
    Liu (Wang et al., 2021a) study in China revealed antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)
    in aquaculture ponds while revealing a medium-high ecological risk. Studies on
    greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture present a risk of failure to meet the
    global warming limit of 1.5 °C by 2050, even with significant progress in curbing
    fossil fuel emissions (Leahy et al., 2020). On energy consumption, agriculture
    and fisheries still rely on non-renewable sources of energy with only 15.5% renewable
    energy utilization in 2020 (REN21, 2023). The status quo presents a case of unsustainable
    agriculture and fisheries due to their association with chemical pollution, global
    warming, and high energy demand. This calls for effective and efficient advanced
    technologies to reverse the trends (Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2018) without compromising
    agricultural and fisheries outputs (Leaver, 2011). FBT entails aeration with fine
    bubbles which possess unique properties including, mass gas transfer including
    oxygenation and ozonation (Agarwal et al., 2011a), a high zeta potential coupled
    with Brownian motion (Temesgen et al., 2017), and a long stay in water. FBT is
    chemical-free and unleashes energy efficiency in industrial and environmental
    applications (Foudas et al., 2023) while increasing production (Ebina et al.,
    2013). This makes it a cutting-edge technique for promoting environmental sustainability.
    FBT therefore could offer potential solutions to sustainable agriculture and fisheries
    systems noting the heightened need for techniques towards cleaner production systems.
    Hence, the objective of this review is to establish a case for FBT as a fundamental
    technology for sustainable and resilient food production systems with minimal
    environmental impact. Limited reviews comprehensively articulating the role of
    the novel FBT towards attaining such ends exist. By analyzing existing literature,
    this study seeks to investigate. - Generation and characterization of fine bubbles
    in agriculture and fisheries, - The comparative aeration characteristics of fine
    bubbles with other methods, - The role of fine bubbles in agriculture and fisheries
    in enhancing sustainable production, promoting low carbon and energy-saving practices,
    - FBT economic performance, - The challenges associated with FBT''s widespread
    adoption and propose possible solutions. This thorough review will pave the way
    for informed decision-making and map research outlooks. 2. Methodology Data for
    this critical review was sourced from published articles using two search engines:
    Web of Science and Google Scholar™. The search parameters were fine bubbles, microbubbles,
    and nanobubbles in distinctive combinations with agriculture, aquaculture, and
    fisheries. A total of 789 journal-published articles were sourced together with
    their metadata. Fig. 1 shows the number of sourced articles by their publication
    year. Screening of the sourced articles was done based on containing evidence
    supporting sustainable food production upon which 103 articles were chosen for
    writing the review as shown in the Supplemental Fig. S1. Fig. 2 shows a map of
    the most cited articles in the fields. Download : Download high-res image (153KB)

    and fisheries. The map shows that more discussion in the published papers has
    been on microalga culture, aeration, shelf-life extension, pesticide removal,
    seed germination, and wastewater treatment. 3. Generation and characterization
    of fine bubbles in agriculture and fisheries The International Organization for
    Standardization (ISO) defines fine bubbles as enclosed voids with a volumetric
    diameter smaller than 100 μm (ISO, 2017). It further outlines two distinct types
    of encapsulated cavities: nanobubbles and microbubbles. Nanobubbles have a void
    diameter of less than 1 μm while Microbubbles have a void diameter of 1–100 μm.
    3.1. Fine bubble generation methods Fine bubbles are produced in a process known
    as cavitation, which is classified into four categories: acoustic, hydrodynamic,
    optic, and particle cavitation (Agarwal et al., 2011b). All these techniques have
    similar mechanisms of generating pressure using tension and energy deposits (Temesgen
    et al., 2017). Acoustic and hydrodynamic cavitation reduces liquid pressure below
    a certain critical value by applying an acoustic field and pressure variation
    in the flowing fluid. Optic and particle cavitation, entails local energy deposit
    induced by laser photons and elementary particles, respectively (Fan et al., 2010).
    Many researchers in agriculture and fisheries use hydrodynamic cavitation to generate
    fine bubbles, and this is achieved by various methods including pressurized saturation,
    bubble shearing, splitting, and mechanical agitation as shown in Table 1. The
    table shows that nano-scaled bubbles are preferred in the sectors. Aeration characteristics
    for some devices used in aquaculture are shown in Table 2, which also shows FBT
    superiority in the standard aeration efficiency (SAE), standard oxygen transfer
    efficiency (SOTE), and standard oxygen transfer rate (SOTR) values. Table 1. Fine

    3.2. Properties of fine bubbles Fine bubbles exhibit unique properties, which
    are the basis for their wide applications (Agarwal et al., 2011b). One of the
    unique properties is the ability to stay longer in the liquid, because of having
    a lower buoyancy (Agarwal et al., 2011a). Another unique property is having a
    high oxygen mass transfer efficiency due to their smaller size and a corresponding
    high internal pressure which is inversely related to the size of the bubbles (Uchida
    et al., 2011). Fine bubbles possess a large surface area within the liquid, which
    enhances mass transfer efficiency by facilitating extensive contact with the liquid
    phase (Agarwal et al., 2011a). Physical and chemical functions done by the bubbles
    including; adsorption, chemical reactions, and the ability to transfer mass between
    the liquid-gas interphase are enhanced by the large contact surface area. Another
    property of fine bubbles is the ability to generate free hydroxyl radicals (•OH)
    when they implode (Li et al., 2009). Finally, in the pH range of 2–12, fine bubbles
    exhibit a negative electrical charge called the zeta potential, which is approximately
    between −20 and −50 mV (Temesgen et al., 2017). The zeta potential is an electrical
    potential difference between the mobile particles dispersed in the medium and
    the dispersion layer of the medium (Wu et al., 2015). The unique properties of
    fine bubbles have resulted in their broad range of applications in agriculture
    and fisheries, as outlined in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (498KB)

    the significance of FBT in agriculture, demonstrating several novelties towards
    cleaner and sustainable crop production while improving produce quality, shelf-life
    extension, energy-saving, bioremediation, and reducing the use of chemicals, and
    methane emissions. 4.1. Stimulation of seed germination Fine bubbles have demonstrated
    the ability to stimulate the germination of seeds (Purwanto et al., 2019a). The
    seed germination process impacts yields and the cost of replanting in case of
    seed germination failure (Tuan et al., 2019). Factors including air, water, and
    temperature are crucial in seed germination (Biswas et al., 2019). FBT enhancement
    of seed germination has been attributed to fine bubbles'' ability to produce free
    •OH when they implode (Liu et al., 2016). The free •OH produced induces the production
    of Gibberellin Hormone (Wang et al., 2021b) through stress-related mechanisms
    (Ishibashi et al., 2012) and the produced Gibberellin hormone is linked to seed
    germination activation (Miransari et al., 2014a). Seed germination stimulation
    by fine bubbles has also been linked to their synergetic effect with potassium
    (K+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl−) availability. Kim, Shoji (Kim et al., 2023)
    observed that this synergetic effect is significant and the role of fine bubbles
    in this synergetic effect could be ionic transportation because of their high
    zeta potential. This aids in the transportation of ions including K+ into the
    seed where it facilitates enzyme activation leading to better germination success.
    The role of fine bubbles in mass gas transfer and consequent enhancement of seed
    germination has also been demonstrated. Ahmed, Shi (Ahmed et al., 2018) showed
    that the type of gas encapsulated in the fine bubbles affects the seed germination
    process, with oxygen and carbon dioxide posing a weaker influence than nitrogen
    gas (Ahmed et al., 2018). Nitrogen as NO3 triggers seed germination and is also
    required during post-germination physiological development (Miransari et al.,
    2014b). The formation of NO3 from the nitrogen gas encapsulated in the bubble
    can be accelerated by treating the nitrogen bubbles with cold plasma (Sritontip
    et al., 2019). A significant highlight in seed germination enhancement by FBT
    lies in the ability to enhance the germination of aged seeds, such as wasabi,
    as shown in Table 3. Wasabi seeds lose germination potential within three weeks
    (Kim et al., 2023; Nakamura et al., 1990). Fine bubble application enhances the
    germination of these seeds by 70%, even after 1.5–2 years in storage. Similarly,
    dormant oil palm seeds have demonstrated an 8-day faster germination rate with
    FBT, and it potentially substituted heat-soaking pretreatment (Arif et al., 2023).
    This entails the ability of fine bubbles to support long storage of seeds and
    removing the need for heat pretreatment of seeds which is important in saving
    energy costs. Table 3. Seed germination enhancement. Seed type Seed state Bubble

    (2016) Barley Normal 405 Air – 30.66 85.33 Oh et al. (2016) The discussion here
    shows that fine bubbles enhance seed germination which translates into reduced
    environmental impact associated with seed production, transportation, and heat
    pretreatment besides offering a solution for long-term seed storage. This would
    transcend into the sustainable use of resources. However, there is limited literature
    on how •OH excites the production of Gibberellin Hormone, and if the impact is
    the same with different fine bubble sizes, gas types, and plant species. This
    calls for more research. 4.2. Enhancing physiological development in plants Plant
    physiological development relates to dynamic processes including growth (David
    et al., 2017). Enhancing physiological development translates into plant resilience
    and high yields. Currently, more focus has been on using artificial fertilizers
    to improve yields leading to environmental pollution due to excessive use (Aldaya
    et al., 2020). FBT demonstrates eco-friendly plant physiological development enhancement.
    This includes total chlorophyll amount, nutrient upregulating genes, plant anti-oxidant
    capacity, active root absorption area, specific leaf area (SPAD), net photosynthesis
    rate, and peroxidase activity as shown in Table 4. These improvements are mainly
    attributed to the free •OH formed due to fine bubble implosion. The •OH has a
    significant impact on upregulating nutrient absorption genes (Wang et al., 2021b)
    and enzymes (Kim et al., 2023) responsible for enhancing plant physiology. The
    improved physiology due to FBT gives plants an advantage in resilient growth performance
    and productivity. A major highlight of FBT application is its impact on enhancing
    plant resilience in stressed ecologies including soils with limited nutrients
    (Iijima et al., 2020), saline-alkali soils (Zhang et al., 2024), and droughts
    (Hirooka et al.) as shown in Table 5. Table 4. Fine bubbles impact on plant physiological

    with FBT is further enhanced through fine bubble high zeta potential (Temesgen
    et al., 2017) that enables the adsorption and Brownian motion supported even distribution
    of positively charged nutrients in the soil (Azevedo et al., 2016). The high zeta
    potential also entails a negative hydrophobic interaction with water which is
    a polar substance (Ushida et al., 2012) and this interaction reduces water surface
    tension, making it easier for roots to absorb nutrients (Wang et al., 2021b).
    Additionally, FBT is known to increase DO concentration (Subhan et al., 2021).
    This ensures adequate oxygen supply to enhance the microbial decomposition of
    complex organic matter into plant nutrients (Zhou et al., 2020). This makes FBT
    a suitable candidate in supporting nutrient recovery as it has been widely used
    in wastewater treatment systems. This concept has been demonstrated in aquaponics
    by Marcelino, Wongkiew (Marcelino et al., 2023) who introduced fine bubbles in
    an aquaponic unit consisting of lettuce and fish (Fig. 4). The study showed that
    FBT aeration raised DO concentrations to 9.31 mg/L against 6.32 mg/L in conventional
    aeration. High DO levels due to FBT increased nitrate concentrations due to enhanced
    actions of nitrifying bacteria. This resulted in an increase in the overall yield
    of lettuce per plant by 35%. Fish excreta and feed remains in the aquaponic provided
    nutrients for plants after microbial decomposition, and plants assisted in cleaning
    the water for the fish by absorbing pollutants after microorganisms acted upon
    them. In aquaponics, water from the lettuce culturing tank can be disinfected
    by ozone fine bubbles to control pathogens before pumping it back into the fish
    tank as shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (521KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 4. Fine bubble-fueled aquaponic system. Oxygen fine
    bubbles provide adequate oxygen for fish growth and microbial conversion of harmful
    wastes to nitrate required for plant growth. Ozone fine bubbles disinfect the
    water for fish safety. Despite the positive results on fine bubble-led plant physiological
    development, results have been contradicting. Some researchers documented the
    inhibitory effects of FBT on the growth of submerged macrophytes where the •OH
    induced the production of hormones responsible for triggering senescence (Wang
    et al., 2020a). Despite suppressing submerged macrophytes being useful in controlling
    aquatic weeds in fish ponds and irrigation dams, this technique would cause problems
    in integrated water restoration systems where submerged macrophytes are key such
    as in Lake Donghu, China (Qiu et al., 2001). This leads to the conclusion that
    the growth-promoting effects of fine bubbles depend on plant species. The discussion
    in this section shows the superiority of FBT in enhancing crop physiological development
    and consequent improvement in productivity. Enhancement of key physiological markers
    as reported makes plants well adapted to grow even with limited resources, including
    nutrients, compared with plants lacking such enhancements. Wang, Wang (Wang et
    al., 2021b) successfully demonstrated using 25% less fertilizer in combination
    with FBT and managed to get similar yields as traditionally cultivated rice. Hydroxyl
    radical enhancement on nutrient uptake genes improved the ability of the rice
    to utilize the limited nutrients and produce better yields. Similarly, He, Liu
    (He et al., 2022) demonstrated improved yields in watermelons (44.9% in spring
    and 45.6% in fall), and musk melons (31.46% in spring and 11.37% in fall) using
    20% less fertilizer while employing FBT in comparison with conventional sub-surface
    drip irrigation. Cherry tomatoes showed a 9.1% increase without fertilizer and
    FBT assisted by enhancing expression of genes involved in the transportation of
    nutrients (Li et al., 2024). The ability of plants to excel in stressed ecologies
    is another novel as this could enable the development of farming techniques that
    withstand such stresses including drought, dry spells, and nutrient limitations.
    FBT therefore showcases a huge potential in supporting cleaner, resilient, and
    sustainable production. 4.3. Reducing post-harvest loss The management of post-harvest
    losses, which are estimated to account for 50% of fruits and vegetables lost before
    consumption, is necessary. Microbial-led decay is significant (Elik et al., 2019)
    and it induces off-flavors (Kim et al., 2009). Current control methods primarily
    involve the use of conventional chemical pesticides which have raised concerns
    regarding their impact on environmental sustainability and human health. FBT demonstrates
    a huge potential in extending the shelf life of perishable commodities without
    using chemicals. Ozone fine bubbles have proven to extend the shelf life of produce,
    including vegetables (Beltrán et al., 2005) and cereals (Dhillon et al., 2009).
    Ozone is a strong oxidant and has a high impact on neutralizing pathogens through
    oxidation and hydroxyl formation when ozone disintegrates to form oxygen (Girgin
    Ersoy et al., 2019). These actions destroy the cell membrane integrity of microorganisms
    leading to cell lysis. Ozone gas is poorly soluble in water thus, FBT assists
    in its solubility in the bulk for effective treatment. Ozone fine bubble application
    however shows a minimal impact on the disinfection of cereals except when combined
    with other methods such as acetic acid, chlorine, and alternating flow (Ushida
    et al., 2017). The discussion in this section asserts the importance of FBT in
    reducing pesticide use in controlling post-harvest losses. This could in turn
    reduce the trends in pesticide use documented by Rajmohan, Chandrasekaran (Rajmohan
    et al., 2020) and Jacquet, Jeuffroy (Jacquet et al., 2022). FBT therefore echoes
    with principles of sustainable agriculture and environmental conservation. The
    combination of ozone with chemicals to disinfect cereals, though results in reduced
    chemical use is not an environmentally friendly practice, and thus, further studies
    on cleaner preservation techniques should be pursued. 4.4. Suppressing accumulation
    and translocation of heavy metal cadmium Cadmium (Cd) contamination poses challenges
    in fields irrigated with Cd-contaminated water. Cd is a toxic heavy metal with
    a half-life of 25–30 years and poses health hazards as it causes cancer and osteoporosis
    (Liu et al., 2020). Human exposure to Cd is largely through contaminated food
    (Genchi et al., 2020) mainly rice (Tsukahara et al., 2003). Cd emanates from manufacturing
    and mining activities (Liu et al., 2020). Rice plants absorb Cd from contaminated
    soils and accumulate it in tissues including grains. Fine bubbles have been demonstrated
    to suppress Cd uptake by rice grown in contaminated soils. Irrigation with oxygen
    fine bubbles on Cd-contaminated soils treated with iron–manganese (Fe–Mn) plaque
    leads to the inhibition of Cd accumulation and translocation in the rice plants
    (Zhang et al., 2021). Fine bubbles assist by mass transferring the Fe–Mn ions
    into the vicinity of rice roots due to their high zeta potential and constant
    Brownian motion. The high Fe– Mn plaque concentration in the root vicinity inhibits
    Cd accumulation and translocation into the rice plants. Contrary to fine bubble-aided
    hindrance of cadmium by plants, a study by Yan, Xue (Yan et al., 2023) demonstrated
    that cadmium uptake by A. philoxeroides is enhanced by 17.39% due to fine bubbles.
    This enhancement was secondary to a 25–50% boost in the plant growth rate in such
    soils. The finding supports the notion of using fine bubbles in enhancing Cd-contaminated
    soil phytoremediation. The discussion here portrays the potential of FBT in ensuring
    human health by reducing their exposure to Cd which is linked to the infamous
    itai-itai disease (Rafati Rahimzadeh et al., 2017). This agrees with the principles
    of clean production and sustainable development. FBT nuance is further vindicated
    by their ability to support phytoremediation efforts by enhancing Cd removal efficiency
    as shown by Yan, Xue (Yan et al., 2023). However, further studies are needed to
    ascertain if the presence of Fe–Mn plaque can affect the uptake of other nutrients
    by plants as the application of Fe–Mn plaque can affect the soil chemistry, especially
    where Fe–Mn dynamics play a crucial role in influencing plant nutrient availability.
    4.5. Inhibiting clogging development The occurrence of clogging in drip irrigation
    systems reduces the system''s efficiency. Clog development results from biomass
    causing biofouling (Ravina et al., 1997; Shen et al., 2022). Current practices
    in managing clog development entail using chemical biocides which further contribute
    to environmental pollution (Xiao et al., 2020). Fine bubbles inhibit clog development
    in water supply systems. Oxidative free •OH produced during bubble collapse leads
    to reducing fixed-biomass and curtailing mutualistic interactions among microbial
    species. This decreases extracellular polymers and biofilm biomass resulting in
    improved emitter performances by increasing the working time by 130% (Li et al.,
    2020). The discussion here showcases FBT as a panacea for improving efficiencies
    in irrigation systems thus saving energy and costs. FBT has also showcased a huge
    potential in reducing the use of chemicals by substituting biocides used in controlling
    biofouling. These observations are in line with the aspirations of sustainable
    agriculture where optimal production can be attained with fewer and environmentally
    friendly inputs. Agriculture is a heavy consumer of energy (Mohareb et al., 2017)
    which mainly comes from non-renewable sources (REN21, 2023). 4.6. Removal of chemical
    residues in plants after treatment Crop quality is one attribute that affects
    marketing in competitive markets. Given the wide use of pesticides in agriculture,
    and the tendency of some pesticides to persist on the produce as residues, farm
    produce on the domestic and export markets is required to meet maximum residue
    limits (MRLs) to be sold (Haviland et al., 2012; Palou, 2016). Prolonged exposure
    to these chemical residues poses a health hazard to people (Vuthijumnonk et al.,
    2019). Fine bubble water has demonstrated the ability to remove such chemical
    residues. This includes organophosphate pyrethroid (Vuthijumnonk, 2020), Cyfluthrin
    (Vuthijumnonk et al., 2019), and fenitrothion (Ikeura et al., 2011) pesticides
    in fruits and vegetables. The removal occurs irrespective of the gas used. The
    mechanism for their removal is through oxidation by free •OH to produce different
    species of acids (Vuthijumnonk et al., 2019). Another mechanism is the physical
    impact of micro jet impingement and floatation process (Jin et al., 2022). During
    the breaking down of fine bubbles, micro jet impingements are created, and these
    physically detach pollutants that adhere to surfaces. On floatation, the fine
    bubbles adhere to the surface of the contaminants, reducing their density and
    making them float. Fig. 5 illustrates the removal mechanism of contaminants by
    fine bubbles. Download : Download high-res image (462KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Chemical residue removal by fine bubbles Discussion in this section
    highlights FBT''s novelty in controlling residual chemicals and its consequent
    contribution to safeguarding human health. 4.7. Reduction of seasonal methane
    (CH4) emissions in rice paddies Applying fine bubbles through oxygation in paddy
    soils shows the ability to control the emission of methane from the soil. Methane
    is one of the greenhouse gases responsible for global warming and the yearly release
    of methane from rice paddies is approximately 100 tera-grams (Tg) (Matthews et
    al., 1991). Fine bubble application reduces methane emission by 20–28% compared
    to traditional farming methods (Minamikawa et al., 2020). Minamikawa, Takahashi
    (Minamikawa et al., 2015) also documented a 21% reduction in seasonal methane
    emissions from paddies employing fine bubbles. These studies suggest a shift in
    the redox conditions in the soil towards more oxidizing conditions which makes
    it less conducive for methane production. In this section, FBT shows novelty in
    reducing the environmental impact of rice farming by reducing methane emissions.
    Full-scale adoption of fine bubble oxygation in rice paddies would therefore suppress
    the global methane atmospheric release by up to 28 Tg annually based on the estimate
    on methane production from paddies by Matthews, Fung (Matthews et al., 1991).
    However, researchers in this field need to incorporate other practices such as
    new rice varieties, non-continuous flooding, and straw removal strategies that
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions from paddies by 24%, 44%, and 46% respectively
    (Qian et al., 2023). 5. FBT application in fisheries This section outlines the
    significance of FBT application in fisheries, demonstrating its role in cleaner
    and sustainable production. Reduction of drugs, pesticides, and other chemicals
    usage, reducing feed inputs, and maximizing utilization of production resources
    through supporting high stocking densities are highlighted in this section. 5.1.
    Enhancing growth rates of cultured organisms The enhanced growth rate of cultured
    organisms in aquaculture is a critical parameter in optimizing the cost of production
    and management of supply chains amidst increasing demand for food. Embracing FBT
    in aquaculture improves growth rates. FBT has demonstrated better aquatic organisms''
    growth performance. Where FBT is applied, significant improvements in the Average
    Daily Weight Gains (ADWG) for both fin fish (Naomi et al., 2020) and shrimp (Lim
    et al., 2021) have been observed. The improvements in ADWG are attributed to several
    factors, including increased DO concentration in the culture facility, improved
    Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR), and removal of organic wastes that otherwise accumulate
    and stress fish. On DO concentration improvement, fish growth is promoted because
    fine bubbles have a high gas transfer efficiency, which increases DO concentration
    in water for use by cultured aquatic organisms (Galang et al., 2019). DO levels
    limit the growth and survival of aquatic organisms in water with levels below
    5–6 mg/L being fatal (Ali et al., 2022). On removal of organic waste, fine bubbles
    can remove organic waste by floatation, enhancing microbial activities and oxidation
    by free •OH. Since organic matter accumulation in water stresses and inhibits
    fish growth, their removal by fine bubble treatment imperatively enhances growth.
    This understanding also helps to explain the observed significant FCR improvements
    in organisms cultured in fine bubble aerated systems. On FCR improvement, organisms
    that are not stressed have good health, with metabolic activities, including nutrient
    utilization, at their peak (Lim et al., 2021). FCR measures the efficiency in
    converting feed into the body weight of cultured organisms, and it is an important
    indicator of how efficient resources are utilized in the production process. Lower
    FCR values are desired. Employing FBT, outstanding FCR of up to 0.8 have been
    achieved in shrimp against conventional methods that show poor FCR of 1.41 and
    higher (Lim et al., 2021). The excellent FCR observed due to FBT reflects an optimum
    environment for cultured organisms to utilize feed, and enhanced plankton production
    which cultured organisms consume. Fig. 6 shows FCR values in FBT versus macro
    bubble aeration. Download : Download high-res image (301KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. FCR values in fine bubble versus macro bubble aerated
    systems. Fine bubbles have also been applied in microalgae production in closed
    systems. Microalgae is important in larviculture as it is food for the hatchlings.
    The outdoor culture of microalgae is constrained by challenges in controlling
    parameters necessary for growth (Iqbal et al., 1993). Exposing H. lacustris and
    B. braunii to fine bubble water significantly increased their growth, with the
    maximum increase being 44% and 26%, respectively (Zhu et al., 2019). The discussion
    in this chapter illuminates the future of aquaculture towards sustainability.
    FBT-led novelties including improved daily weight gains, efficient feed conversion,
    and enhanced microalgae yield are the small steps needed toward sustainability
    goals. Reducing FCR while enhancing ADWG entails the reduction of aquaculture
    footprint on the environment, reducing resource use and waste. Microalgae offers
    a promising alternative to traditional feeds used in aquaculture that mainly use
    fish meals, thus protecting wild fish populations (Olsen et al., 2012; Luthada-Raswiswi
    et al., 2021). 5.2. Supporting high stocking densities In the pursuit of improved
    productivity, aquaculture intensification explored higher stocking densities as
    a possible solution. One of the limiting factors in such pursuit is DO levels
    in the system. Thus, aerators as shown in Table 1 are employed. Limitations in
    oxygen transfer efficiency by these aerators confine their usage in high fish
    stocking density culture. Many studies have documented the ability of fine bubbles
    to increase DO concentration in water (Mahasri et al., 2018) to levels higher
    than aquatic organisms require to support metabolism (Galang et al., 2019; Subhan
    et al., 2018). This entails a huge potential for increasing stocking densities
    because of breaking the DO concentration limitation. The even distribution of
    fine bubbles due to their constant Brownian motion implies an even distribution
    of oxygen in the culture unit. This is especially important because dead areas
    would be detrimental at high stocking densities where each volume is inhabited
    (Chen et al., 1992). Consequently, the high-density culture of striped catfish
    larviculture in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) has been demonstrated
    with high growth and survival rates, and improved FCR (Subhan et al., 2022). Improved
    air circulation and strengthened immune systems in aquatic organisms, courtesy
    of FBT, have also contributed to successes in supporting high stocking densities.
    Culturing saline Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in a system with fine bubbles
    demonstrates to improve the number of erythrocytes and leucocytes within the recommended
    range of 20,000–3,000,000 cells/and 20,000–150,000 cells/mm3 respectively (Gunanti
    et al., 2019), as illustrated in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (481KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Pond dynamics with fine bubble aeration.
    Numbers represent; 1 fine bubble mass gas transfer, 2 respiration, 3 increased
    number of leukocytes, 4 increased number of erythrocytes, 5 photosynthesis. AOB
    and NOB converts NH3 to NO3 for plant use as outlined in section 5.6. Decomposition
    is an aerobic process. Conflicting results on FBT support in high stocking densities
    exist. Other scientists documented that the FBT application did not support a
    higher density culture of table-sized fish production when stocking densities
    varied between 15 and 60 individuals per liter. Growth favored the lowest stocking
    density treatment (Firman et al., 2019). Higher stocking levels exhibited poor
    growth rates due to presumed space-related stresses. This calls for more research
    to clarify discrepancies in these research findings. This section showcases FBT''s
    role in attaining higher stocking densities in aquaculture. Increasing stocking
    densities coupled with better ADWG, FCR, and reduced waste production as shown
    in section 5.1 promises a more sustainable aquaculture production model due to
    the efficient use of resources including energy. The positive association of fine
    bubbles with an increase in the number of leukocytes is another big novelty in
    this model. This would improve fish immunity thus supporting a higher stocking
    density culture where the risk of disease outbreak is higher. In terms of environmental
    sustainability and cleaner production, this phenomenon could reduce the use of
    antibiotics in aquaculture as documented by Hossain, Habibullah-Al-Mamun (Hossain
    et al., 2022). 5.3. Controlling aquatic predators Utilizing fine bubble cavitation
    treatment shows the capability to manage small planktonic crustaceans in aquaculture
    units (Kurita et al., 2017). Cavitation refers to the formation and collapsing
    of fine bubbles in a liquid due to rapid changes in pressure. Fine bubble cavitation
    has proven to be fatal to small planktonic crustaceans, reducing their population
    by up to 60%. This treatment does not impact cultured organisms like juvenile
    sea cucumbers (Apostichopus japonicus) and sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus intermedius).
    This section highlights FBT as an environmentally friendly method for controlling
    certain predators in aquaculture. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on
    chemicals, this technique aligns with the principles of sustainable production
    by avoiding their use. 5.4. Controlling fish pathogens Infectious diseases in
    aquaculture are the largest factor responsible for multibillion-dollar losses
    annually in the sector (Assefa et al., 2018). Several methods are currently used
    to control the challenge, including drug and vaccine administration of which their
    use contributes to the emergence of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (AMR) in the
    environment due to unmanaged residual medicines (Preena et al., 2020). Fine bubble
    technology has demonstrated huge potential in controlling fish diseases in the
    most environmentally friendly way without using drugs. The use of fine bubbles
    of hydrogen (Li et al., 2022b; Nghia et al., 2021) and ozone (Jhunkeaw et al.,
    2021) has shown good results in this aspect. Hydrogen fine bubble treatment reduces
    the death of cultured aquatic microorganisms by 40% when applied (Li et al., 2022b).
    This reduction results from mitigated inflammation response and decreased viral
    loads in infected organs. Fine bubbles increase hydrogen solubility in water due
    to fine bubbles'' high gas transfer efficiency. The increased hydrogen concentration
    results in more protection for fish from pathogens. The application of ozone bubble
    treatment causes a significant reduction in fish culture bacterial concentrations,
    with a range of 26 to 48-fold decrease (>96%) (Jhunkeaw et al., 2021). This reduction
    is scientifically adequate to prevent disease outbreaks. Additionally, ozone fine
    bubble 10 min exposure to juvenile Oreochromis niloticus shows a certain degree
    of safety (Jhunkeaw et al., 2021). However, any treatment repetition in a day
    causes physical injuries to the gills. This implies strict compliance to set standards
    when using ozone in controlling pathogens. This section showcases the potential
    of FBT in reducing the use of antibiotics in aquaculture. Antibiotic use in aquaculture
    is a serious environmental concern due to the associated proliferation of AMR
    genes as documented by Preena, Swaminathan (Preena et al., 2020). FBT is therefore
    a panacea to reverse this drawback and make aquaculture environmentally sustainable.
    5.5. Improving transportation of live fish One of the critical factors in fisheries
    is the availability of high-quality brooders and fingerlings, as these improve
    yields. Thus, brooders and fingerlings move between farms for breeding and stocking
    purposes. During long-distance transportation, chemical anesthetics such as MS-22
    and quinaldine are used as anesthetizers (Berka, 1986). Most of these chemicals
    are not environmentally friendly. FBT has demonstrated environmentally friendly
    techniques in fish transportation. Utilizing fine bubbles of oxygen and carbon
    dioxide in water during fish transportation causes an anesthetizing effect on
    fish for up to 22 h. The anesthetized fish successfully wakes up within 2–3 h
    after cessation of anesthesia (Kugino et al., 2016). The high levels of carbon
    dioxide initiate fish anesthesia while oxygen fine bubbles enable efficient oxygen
    diffusion across the fish brachia organs into the circulatory system to support
    respiration during anesthesia. The technique offers a safe and environmentally
    friendly method for long-distance live fish transport. Similarly, FBT improves
    the survival rates of shrimp seeds during 24-h transportation (Anggoro et al.,
    2022). This success is attributed to high DO levels in the transportation unit
    impacted by fine bubbles. The discussion here showcases FBT ability in promoting
    sustainable aquaculture by reducing chemical anesthesia that could have been used
    during fish transportation. 5.6. Water quality and pollution control Water quality
    is a critical factor in determining its suitability for various uses. Water with
    good quality is characterized by the absence of pollutants (Zaghloul et al., 2019).
    Such type of water is associated with better yields in aquaculture as it reduces
    the risk of fish stress (Boyd and Jeney, 2017), and transferring pathogens (Granger
    et al., 2010). One of the key sustainable ways of utilizing water resources is
    through recycling wastewater using different technologies. Some steps in conventional
    wastewater treatment require the use of chemicals and these chemicals are not
    environment friendly and require further physical-chemical monitoring (Crini et
    al., 2019). Fine bubbles have demonstrated the ability to control water pollution
    without using chemicals but rather through applying processes such as flotation,
    aeration, and disinfection (Khan et al., 2020). Some steps in wastewater treatment
    require active aeration to supply more oxygen to microorganisms required in the
    decomposition process. Fine bubble application in wastewater treatment shows the
    potential to increase DO concentration in the range of 7.9 mg/L (Subhan et al.,
    2021) and 25 mg/L (Mahasri et al., 2018). This is attributed to the high gas transfer
    efficiency of fine bubbles. Increased DO concentration in some fish culture systems,
    such as ponds and bio flocs, is important in balancing the organic load. One such
    balance is controlling ammonia, produced from fish excreta, and organic matter
    decomposition including uneaten feed. Ammonia is highly toxic to fish, with mean
    toxicity values of 2.79 mg NH3/L and 1.86 mg NH3/L (Randall et al., 2002). Oxygen
    is a vital requirement for Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacteria (AOB) and Nitrite-Oxidizing
    Bacteria (NOB) which play a combined role in converting ammonia to nitrate in
    the nitrogen cycle as shown in Fig. 7. Fine bubble application has also demonstrated
    huge potential in reducing turbidity and total dissolved solids (TDS) levels from
    35 to 11 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) and 124.9 to 101.5 ppm TDS, respectively
    (Subhan et al., 2021) in a turbid paddy field. Similarly, another study showed
    turbidity level decrease to at most 2 NTU within 3 days (Ueda et al., 2022). Reducing
    turbidity is vital because it makes integrating rice and fish farming, possible.
    Water turbidity can influence the light-dependent behavior of fish such as foraging
    and mating (Huenemann et al., 2012). Fine bubble-led diminishing of turbidity
    in liquids is through processes including flocculation, and flotation. This section
    showcases FBT''s importance in keeping optimal conditions in grow-out facilities
    while reducing waste in effluent. Controlled turbidity helps the fish maximize
    their evolutionary behavior in feeding and finding mates for breeding purposes
    by enhancing visibility. 6. Economic performance of FBT FBT application shows
    excellent economic performance in different industries. In waste water treatment,
    Sander, Behnisch (Sander et al., 2016) demonstrated a cash value saving of about
    25% in a moving bed biofilm reactor integrated fixed-film activated sludge. This
    was attributed to the reduced energy costs of 22% observed in FBT aeration. Though
    literature is limited on this aspect, the summary in Table 6 suggests the economic
    feasibility of applying FBT in agriculture and fisheries. FBT novelty in the table
    is highlighted through increasing yields and benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) even
    when fertilizer was reduced by 20% as this was compensated by enhanced plant physiology
    effect. Table 6. Economic performance of FBT in agriculture and fisheries. Enterprise

    solutions, and the outlook 7.1. FBT challenges and proposed solutions Despite
    FBT benefits in agriculture and fisheries, their use has been constrained by several
    challenges related to their generation and application. This limits commercialization.
    Generation related difficulties constrain the production of stable fine bubbles
    in large quantities as the current methods often require specialized equipment,
    which has cost implications (Nazari et al., 2022). Furthermore, costs are incurred
    during the operation and maintenance of such equipment. Another obstacle is the
    lack of a clear grasp of the regulatory mechanism for bubble size which constrains
    achieving a manageable index in fine bubble functions, including floatation and
    gas transfer index (Wang et al., 2020b). If the bubbles are too big, they might
    not be able to oxygenate the water enough deep down as they could easily float.
    Contrary, if the bubbles are too small, they might not be able to reach the surface
    quickly enough to add oxygen to the water. Another implication of the size of
    the bubbles is the association with the mineral particles in the floatation process
    as this affects the rate of the process. Therefore, the size regulation gap might
    impact efficiency in agriculture and fisheries establishments, requiring further
    optimization research before the technology can be widely adopted. 7.2. FBT outlook
    Based on the unique properties of fine bubbles and their demonstrated abilities
    in agriculture and aquaculture, several other potential uses could be explored
    in the two fields to maximize productivity, profitability, and environmental sustainability.
    FBT can help enhance the phytoremediation of nutrients in aquaculture sediments.
    Of late, the aquaculture sector has come under heavy criticism because of the
    generation of organic waste discharged into the environment emanating from uneaten
    feed and fecal materials (Holmer et al., 2005). These settle in pond sediments
    by gravity (Boyd et al., 2010) and they contain a high amount of nitrogen and
    phosphorus, which plants do not efficiently take up (Gale et al., 2006). As described
    in section 4.2, fine bubbles are good at mass-transferring ions (nutrients), and
    up-regulating nutrient uptake genes which would enhance the removal of such nutrients.
    Zhang, Bleeker (Zhang et al., 2015) recommended adopting nutrient use efficiency
    as an indicator for sustainable aquaculture development. FBT can also assist in
    enhancing micro-pollutants including residual drugs and sex reversal hormones
    in aquaculture effluent. These micro-pollutants negatively impact the environment
    and human beings (Cole et al., 2009). Residual sex-reversal hormones disrupt the
    endocrine system in humans and researchers have reportedly isolated such hormones
    in wild-caught fish (Guedes-Alonso et al., 2017) and fish from commercial outlets
    (Wang et al., 2012). Plasma technology degrades organic pollutants due to plasma
    active particles (PAP) generation (Minamikawa et al., 2020) and this could apply
    to drugs and hormones because they are all organic compounds. However, the PAP
    effectiveness is limited due to localization effects in the bulk volume. This
    gap can be filled by applying fine bubbles, which have an excellent mass distribution
    effect. Therefore, combining fine bubbles and plasma technology could help in
    PAP delocalization. 8. Summary and conclusions The findings from the review show
    that FBT could significantly assist in attaining sustainable agriculture and fisheries.
    The ability of FBT to reduce chemical fertilizer use by at least 20%, paddy methane
    emission by 20%, pesticides, and pharmaceutical use, and promote energy saving
    due to improved efficiencies in irrigation, seed germination, and higher stocking
    densities in fisheries are important strides towards sustainable agriculture and
    fisheries attainment. The association of FBT with good economic performance and
    positive plant physiological development even in stressed ecologies including
    droughts, could be key to achieving cleaner and resilient food production systems
    in the context of climate change. FBT is therefore highly recommended for achieving
    sustainable agriculture and fisheries, and the identified gaps need to be solved
    through research. CRediT authorship contribution statement William Chirwa: Writing

    • Water availability is studied in relation to its users in an agricultural land
    reform. • A rise in the number of water users negatively affects irrigation water
    availability. • The negative impact depends on irrigation types, infrastructures

    In early 1990s, a land reform in the transitioning period from a centralized economy
    to a market-based economy was a top-priority agenda for many countries, such as
    those in the former-Soviet Union, Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Asia. The
    objective of such land reforms was to ensure rural employment, food security and
    economic growth by restructuring and privatizing large state and collective farms.
    The reforms have had different methods and orientations of land redistribution
    across countries depending on historical ownership, collective farm members, land
    availability and auctions. In some cases, land has been redistributed to precollectivization
    or individual owners, and consequently, land fragmentation is reported to occur
    and bring some side effects, such as a conflict between historical owners and
    new ones due to an issue in social equity, a decrease in economic growth, unemployment,
    rural poverty and challenges related to water allocations (Swinnen, 1999, Rembold,
    2003, Thomas, 2006). Land reforms are generally known to impact not only agriculture
    but also economic growth in countries spanning agricultural development, crop
    diversification, occupational choices, technological advancements and demographics
    through a change in the number of water users and allocations (Lerman, 2008, Hartvigsen,
    2014, Ciaian et al., 2018, Adamopoulos and Restuccia, 2020, Wang et al., 2020).
    In particular, land fragmentation through agricultural reforms in these countries
    is expected to have significantly affected water users and water availability.
    This paper addresses the relationship between the number of water users and irrigation
    water availability (IWA) in land-reform fragmentation processes. In the last few
    decades, land reforms have been studied in social science and interdisciplinary
    studies, using various methods of both qualitative and quantitative approaches.
    Specifically, these studies focus on examining land reforms’ performances by implementing
    case-method studies, modeling methods, policy reviews, quantitative approaches,
    scoping studies and socioecological analyses, identifying the causalities and
    relationships with economic growth, agricultural productivity, diversification,
    employment and rural development (Lerman, 1998, Swinnen, 1999, Rembold, 2003,
    Vitikainen, 2004, Margaret and Patricia, 2006, Ghatak and Roy, 2007, Deininger
    et al., 2009). In the literature, two common concepts associated with the land
    reforms are land consolidation and land fragmentation. Land consolidation generally
    involves the redistribution of land titles from individuals to groups and/or communities
    at large and considered one of the instruments to ensure sustainable land management
    and reduce agricultural production costs (Crecente et al., 2002, Haldrup, 2015,
    Hartvigsen, 2015, Jiang et al., 2022). Land fragmentation generally involves the
    redistribution of land titles from a group or a community to individuals and is
    considered one of the instruments to allow individual land ownership through finely
    partitioning the areas (Gorton, 2001, Pottier, 2006, Sklenicka, 2016, Ntihinyurwa
    et al., 2019). A number of studies have examined the impacts of land reforms on
    some economic performances and indicators (Lerman and Sedik, 2008, Deininger et
    al., 2009). In particular, agricultural production is empirically studied in relation
    to land reforms with a focus on land fragmentation (Lerman, 2008, Rahman and Rahman,
    2009, Nguyen, 2012, Ciaian et al., 2018). A study by Lerman and Sedik (2009) examines
    the relation between agricultural productivity and land sizes, finding that small-sized
    farms are more productive than large-sized corporate farms in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.
    Another group of works has shown some negative impact of land fragmentation on
    collective actions and performances, especially when the fragmentation is implemented
    through policy changes or development processes (Gorton, 2001, Niroula and Thapa,
    2007, Nhundu and Mushunje, 2010, Pavsakarnis and Maliene, 2010, Manjunatha et
    al., 2013, Hartvigsen, 2014, Hiironen and Riekkinen, 2016, Postek et al., 2019,
    Wang et al., 2021). A recent study by Wang et al. (2020) evaluates the impact
    of land fragmentation on irrigation management by conducting a questionnaire survey
    with 3895 households in China and reveals that the fragmentation is negatively
    associated with irrigation collective actions. Overall, the literature establishes
    that land reforms can have positive or negative outcomes depending on political,
    socioeconomic and environmental conditions, particularly implying that land fragmentation
    is an influential factor for agricultural production and productivity (Christensen,
    1968, Dorner and Thiesenhusen, 1990, Ntihinyurwa et al., 2019). Previous studies
    have primarily focused on examining whether the goals of land reforms, such as
    rural employment, food security and economic growth, are achieved or not. However,
    little is known about how land fragmentation (consolidation) in land-reform processes
    affects water availability or about the externality of land reforms on water allocations.
    Given this paucity in the literature, we examine how the post-Soviet land reform
    influences irrigation water allocations through a temporal change in the number
    of water users by taking the case of Tajikistan. To this end, we develop a conceptual
    framework and utilize panel-data regression methods for addressing the relation
    between the number of water users and irrigation water demand (IWD) as well as
    IWA in a land reform. This research seeks to pose a question: How is the number
    of water users related with irrigation water allocations in land reforms? Specifically,
    it is hypothesized that an increase in the number of water users through land
    fragmentation poses negative threats to irrigation water allocations through the
    mediation of irrigation types. Answering this question and hypothesis will be
    useful for the development of land policies on irrigation water allocations in
    not only Tajikistan but also other nations facing similar contexts in consideration
    to sustainable development goals (SDGs). 2. Land reform and water availability
    in Tajikistan The agricultural sector is one of the leading sectors in the economy
    of Tajikistan, forming approximately 24% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and
    employing approximately 46% of the working population (World Bank, 2021). The
    agricultural sector is the largest water user in the country, accounting for approximately
    90% of extracted water resources. More than 80% of agricultural production is
    produced in irrigated land (MEDT, 2013). The critical factor in the country’s
    socio-economic development is the agricultural sector contributing to the national
    development strategy for 2030 and the national development program for 2016 to
    2020. The sustainable development of agricultural and irrigation sectors plays
    an essential role in economic growth, social development, food security, poverty
    reduction and the prevention of migration through employment in the country. The
    water resources in Tajikistan come from glaciers, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and
    groundwater. The total renewable annual average long-term flow of rivers in the
    country is approximately 64 billion m3, consisting of 62.9 billion m3 from the
    Amu-Darya River basin and approximately 1.1 billion m3 from the Syr-Darya River
    basin (MEWR, 2015). This is equal to approximately 55% of the water resources
    in the Aral Sea basin. The renewable annual groundwater resources in Tajikistan
    are estimated to be approximately 18.7 billion m3, and more than 2.8 billion m3
    are confirmed through hydrogeological explorations (MEWR, 2015). The annual volume
    of water from all sources is diverted for 762000 ha irrigated land, amounting
    to 8 to 10 billion m3. The land is covered by 26700 km irrigation and 11400 km
    drainage networks that had been mostly developed during the Soviet period (ALRI,
    2020). Following the economic reform to increase agricultural output based on
    the rational use of natural resources in mountainous areas, such as land and water
    resources, Tajikistan’s government has started a land reform since 1995. To develop
    high-income and profitable farm production, freedom of product prices, liberty
    to plant crops and ensuring food security, the president decree was enacted in
    1996. The agricultural reform program from 2012 to 2020 aimed to strengthen agricultural
    production and improve the export environment (Babu and Akramov, 2022). Along
    with the land reform, the former collective and state farms were reorganized and
    agricultural land was redistributed to households, individuals or groups of farms
    and agricultural enterprises. As a result, the number of water users in irrigated
    land increased from 11500 in 1996 to 187220 in 2020 (SCLMG, 2020). Accordingly,
    the irrigation sector has also been gradually transferred to the self-sufficiency
    principle by introducing irrigation service fees. The irrigation water supply
    at the off-farm level is the responsibility of the Agency for Land Reclamation
    and Irrigation (ALRI) and its regional departments. To ensure water conservation,
    efficient operation and maintenance of the on-farm irrigation system, the water
    user associations (WUAs) were established. However, the volume of annual supplied
    irrigation water in Tajikistan has decreased from 8 billion m3 to 4 billion m3
    over the last 25 years wherein the irrigated land area remains unchanged (ALRI,
    2020). In addition, irrigation water management organizations have been facing
    several problems, such as debts, electricity, wages and operation-maintenance
    costs in the systems. The water-sector reform program in Tajikistan from 2016
    to 2025, which was approved by the government on December 30, 2015, aims to introduce
    advanced and sustainable institutional and legal mechanisms for water management.
    The main goals are to sustain the water supply, and to achieve economically and
    environmentally sustainable water allocations under integrated resource management.
    To achieve these goals, the government has initiated amendments in legal frameworks
    and implemented development programs as well as institutional changes. According
    to Tajikistan’s Water Code, water resources are the state property. Ensuring sustainable
    management and rational use of water resources is regulated by the water legislation
    of the Republic of Tajikistan (MEWR, 2020). Specifically, the authorities of the
    recognized state bodies are in charge of regulating water allocations, water usage
    plans, water supply and development of new irrigated land (MEWR, 2020). This implies
    that Tajikistan’s water allocations with its supply and demand is not driven by
    the market. Rather, it is the responsibility of the state organizations in Tajikistan.
    Despite governmental efforts to implement a series of state-funded programs and
    strategies, subsidies and substantial amounts of loans and grants in both agriculture
    and water sectors, the quality of irrigation services in Tajikistan has been declining.
    Due to severe economic conditions, the implemented reforms tend to focus only
    on short-run economic performances without considering medium- and long-run sustainable
    irrigation water supply at the individual and society levels. Consequently, irrigation
    service providers face various problems with respect to water supply shortages,
    operation, maintenance of the irrigation system, collection of irrigation service
    fees and accumulation of debts. For instance, WUAs still face challenges in terms
    of financial, technical, operational and management capacity to fulfill their
    responsibilities (Sehring, 2007, Balasubramanya et al., 2016, Shenhav et al.,
    2019). Development of the appropriate irrigation system and land reforms according
    to a temporal change in the number of water users are necessary and urgent. To
    this end, it is essential to study and understand the externality of land reforms
    on irrigation water allocations, especially when the number of water users changes
    over time in the reform processes. 3. Methodology 3.1. Study areas and data collection
    The study areas include 13 regions of Sughd province, which are located in the
    northern part of Tajikistan (Fig. 1). These areas are considered continental with
    relatively cold winters and dry-hot summers. The annual average precipitation
    in these areas varies from 150 mm to 300 mm and the maximum temperature in summer
    reaches 47∘C (UNDP, 2012). Due to limited precipitation in the vegetation period,
    irrigation facilities are important to maintain soil moisture and create favorable
    conditions for the full potential of agricultural crop production. Irrigated areas
    in the Sughd province are around 290000 ha and include more than 60% of pump irrigation
    facilities, and the remaining areas are gravity irrigation facilities. Pump stations
    were constructed during the Soviet period to irrigate mountainous and hilly areas
    and lift water several times as cascades. In 2020, an irrigated area per capita
    accounted for 0.1 ha in Sughd province, which is the smallest among Central Asian
    countries. However, one third of Tajikistan’s irrigated land belongs to this province,
    contributing to 40% of the country’s agricultural production. Download : Download

    in Tajikistan. During the land reform from 1996 to 2020, state and collective
    farms were reorganized to be individual small farms in Sughd province. Fig. 2(a)
    shows that the number of water users increased from 1500 to 60000 in this period
    (SCLMG, 2020). Although IWA decreased in the land reform period, cultivated areas,
    including double-cropping ones have slightly increased in both gravity-irrigated
    areas and pump-irrigated areas, as shown in Fig. 2(b) (ALRI, 2020). The increase
    in cultivation is because farmers have continued to plant crops for survival even
    when they receive less water than is actually needed. The payment for irrigation
    service fees had been fluctuating during the land reform processes, and the fluctuations
    can be explained by farmers’ economic situation and ability to pay that reflect
    seasonal changes in their agricultural revenues (see Fig. 2(c)). The irrigation
    and drainage systems in Tajikistan, which were constructed during the Soviet period
    under the assumption that farming was conducted on large plots, remained unchanged
    after land fragmentation. Therefore, the increase in the number of water users
    creates challenges for IWA. For instance, Fig. 2(d) demonstrates that IWA has
    decreased from 2.8 billion m3 to 1.5 billion m3 from 1996 to 2020 (ALRI, 2020).
    On the other hand, IWD has increased from 1.7 billion m3 to 2.5 billion m3 during
    the period (ALRI, 2018, AS, 2021). Download : Download high-res image (397KB)

    gravity-irrigated areas, pump-irrigated areas, payment fraction, irrigation water
    demand (IWD) and irrigation water availability (IWA) from 1996 to 2020 in Sughd
    province. In Tajikistan, IWA is an annual volume of irrigation water received
    by farmers through water allocations, while the water allocations is a series
    of water distribution processes that consist of regulations and rules documented
    and guided by the “Water Code,” “WUA Law” as well as community-based traditional
    principles.1 The examples include setting irrigation-service fees and controlling
    the water supply for each farm depending on crop types and irrigation areas. The
    detailed processes of the water allocations are as follows: (i) collection of
    information from each farmer on their cultivation plans by crop types and areas
    with locations by water intake points, (ii) IWD calculation with the irrigation
    water norms adopted by ALRI for each farm considering the water intakes and canal
    levels, (iii) determining water supply to each farm for every 10 days and (iv)
    controlling, monitoring and supervising water use and payment. The regulations
    and principles aim to ensure fair water distribution, water-use efficiency, control,
    monitoring, infrastructure operation & maintenance, sustainability, compliance
    and the ability to adapt to changing conditions. The most rigorous IWD calculation
    must take into account water losses in canals and agricultural fields due to percolation,
    crop evapotranspiration, climate conditions and geographical factors. However,
    due to the lack of such detailed farm-level information and experienced irrigation
    specialists in Tajikistan, the ALRI has adopted a simplified average seasonal
    irrigation norm for each crop types and calculates IWD by multiplying it with
    the cultivated areas accounting for double or multiple cropping ones.2 The regional-level
    IWD data with the ALRI method is considered the best approximation in the context
    of Tajikistan. Fig. 3 illustrates the land fragmentation in the reform process
    in B. Gafurov region of Sughd province from 2007 to 2020. For instance, a 650
    ha consisted of 74 plots with an average size of 8.7 ha, being part of one collective
    farm in 2007 (Fig. 3(a)). This area becomes so fragmented in the reform process
    with an increase in the number of plots up to 917 with an average size of 0.7
    ha in 2020 (Fig. 3(b)). At the same time, the irrigation systems remain unchanged,
    including the main canals, distribution canals and water intakes, during the reform
    period (Fig. 3(c)). While each plot had direct access to a water intake point
    in 2007, it sharply declined in 2020, and only 25 plots currently have access
    to a water intake point. Overall, it is evident that plot sizes become approximately
    12 times as small as those in the pre-land reform period under the same irrigation
    systems. Download : Download high-res image (810KB) Download : Download full-size

    Earth images for B. Gafurov region. This study uses panel data from 1996 to 2020
    comprising IWD, IWA, the number of water users, gravity-irrigated areas, pump-irrigated
    areas and payment fraction in Sughd province, Tajikistan (See Table 1 for the
    description of the variables). Out of the 15 administrative bodies in Sughd province,
    13 farming regions are selected as cross-sectional units because agricultural
    and irrigation activities are carried out in these regions. We apply panel-data
    regression models to investigate the relationship between the number of water
    users in the post-Soviet land reform and IWD as well as IWA along with irrigation
    areas. In the analyses, both time-specific factors and regional differences are
    considered. To control time-specific factors, we consider year-fixed effects in
    the regression models, such as deterioration and rehabilitation of irrigation
    infrastructure, agricultural practices, policies and institutional changes, which
    may affect IWD and IWA by including year-fixed dummy variables. To control for
    regional differences, we consider regional-fixed effects, such as geography, climate
    and demography, by including region-fixed dummy variables. Table 1. Descriptions

    3.2. Conceptual framework and statistical analysis Fig. 4 displays a conceptual
    framework for our empirical analysis, being developed on the basis of the fact
    that IWD and IWA in Tajikistan are not driven by markets but are controlled by
    the government. Specifically, the variables except IWD and IWA in the framework
    are determined by the central agencies, and water users respond to the changes
    in the variables through IWD and IWA. Therefore, an empirical framework for market
    demand and supply in economic theory cannot be directly applied to our study on
    water allocations in Tajikistan. Given this state of affairs, the conceptual framework
    is believed to provide comprehensive view for understanding the complex relations
    among different factors, variables and interactions that affect IWD and IWA in
    the study. The panel-data regressions estimate parameters s for i = 1, 2, 3, 4,
    5, 6 and K = {IWD, IWA} in Fig. 4, each of which corresponds to the relationship
    between IWD (or IWA) and a key variable, after the effects of all other independent
    variables are netted out (Wooldridge, 2010). In particular, we focus on reporting
    the relationships “how IWD and IWA are related to the number of water users and
    irrigation types” that correspond to according to the research question and hypothesis.
    The regression specifications are expressed as (1) where subscripts i = 1, …,

    A conceptual framework that describes the relationships between the variables

    water availability (IWA) by s for K = {IWD, IWA} and i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, respectively.
    The conceptual framework in Fig. 4 and regression specifications in Eq. (1) enable
    us to identify the key determinants for addressing the research question and hypothesis
    in our study. To this end, we proceed with taking the following steps to estimate
    the parameters. First, we apply panel unit root tests for our variables to confirm
    that they are stationary at the level or not by the Levin-Lin-Chu test (Levin
    et al., 2002), indicating that they are stationary. Second, we apply the Hausman
    test (Hausman, 1978) to determine whether a fixed-effects or random-effects model
    is appropriate for this analysis, suggesting the fixed-effects model. Third, we
    estimate four different regression models for a robustness check: Model 1 includes
    only the number of water users along with an intercept as the independent variable.
    Model 2 includes the number of water users, irrigation types and irrigation service
    fees along with an intercept. In models 3 and 4, we additionally introduce the
    interaction terms between the number of water users and irrigation types along
    with year-fixed and region-fixed dummy variables. 4. Results The summary statistics
    of the variables in our analysis indicate that 325 observations are collected
    for the IWD, IWA, gravity-irrigated areas, pump-irrigated areas and payment fraction,
    and 300 for the number of water users (see Table 2). The minimum and maximum values
    of the IWD variable are 12.2 million m3 and 370.1 million m3, respectively. The
    minimum and maximum values of the IWA variable are 1.4 million m3 and 587.7 million
    m3, respectively. These differences highlight the substantial diversity in IWD
    and IWA among the regions in our panel dataset. The number of water users ranges
    from 7 to 14627 across the 13 regions, while the mean is 1884 and the median is
    700. The minimum value of zero for the gravity-irrigated areas indicates that
    those regions solely rely on pump irrigation, and the minimum value of zero for
    the pump-irrigated areas indicates that those regions solely rely on gravity irrigation.
    Regarding the payment fraction, a minimum value of zero indicates that water users
    do not pay the irrigation service fees for a given year, while a maximum value
    of 300 implies that water users paid irrigation service fees for the overdue years.
    Overall, the extensive gaps between the minimum and maximum values of the variables
    demonstrate that Tajikistan’s agricultural and water systems are highly heterogeneous
    due to the wide range of crops and diversity in geography as well as climatic
    conditions. Table 2. Summary statistics for the data from 1996 to 2020. Variables

    The estimation of the panel-data regressions for the IWD reports the coefficients,
    marginal effects and their respective standard errors of the independent variables
    along with their statistical significances (see Table 3). Models 3 and 4 include
    the marginal effects for an interpretation of the relationships between our independent
    variables and their interactions with IWD. We find that the coefficients of gravity-irrigated
    areas and pump-irrigated areas on IWD are positive and statistically significant
    at 1% level in model 2. These findings remain consistent after incorporating interaction
    terms between the number of water users and irrigation types in model 3 and a
    year-fixed dummy variable in model 4. We mainly focus on reporting marginal effects
    in model 4, which is considered a full specification of our regressions. The marginal
    effect in model 4 indicates that IWD tends to increase by 4970 m3 with one additional
    hectare in gravity-irrigated areas, holding other independent variables fixed
    at their sample means. Similarly, the marginal effect in model 4 shows that IWD
    increases by 7851 m3 when the pump-irrigated areas increase by one hectare, holding
    other independent variables fixed at their sample means. Overall, a rise in IWD
    is estimated to be 1.6 times larger in pump-irrigated areas than in gravity-irrigated
    areas. This result can be attributed to the fact that farmers tend to grow specific
    crops (cotton, fruits, rice and vegetables) with high water requirements in pump-irrigated
    areas due to the local geography and environment compared to those in gravity-irrigated
    areas in Tajikistan (Abdullaev and Rakhmatullaev, 2016, Theesfeld and Klümper,
    2016, Klümper et al., 2017). Table 3. Estimation of the panel regression for irrigation

    the panel-data regressions for the IWA shows the coefficients, marginal effects
    and their respective standard errors of the independent variables along with their
    statistical significances (see Table 4). We find that the coefficients and marginal
    effects of the number of water users are statistically significant with a negative
    sign at 1% level in a robust manner, irrespective of the models. This relationship
    holds true even when interaction terms between the number of water users and irrigation
    types are included in model 3 and a year-fixed dummy variable is included in model
    4. In model 4, the marginal effect indicates that IWA tends to decrease by approximately
    3246 m3 when the number of water users increases by one, holding other independent
    variables fixed at their sample means. Overall, the result suggests that the increasing
    number of water users through land fragmentation processes in Tajikistan poses
    negative threats to IWA. The irrigation infrastructure and system in Tajikistan
    were developed during the Soviet period under the assumption that collective farming
    is conducted on large-sized farms. They are neither necessarily optimized nor
    designed for ongoing agriculture practices in Tajikistan, where the number of
    small-sized farms (or water users) has increased through land fragmentation. Therefore,
    the finding shall be explained by the fact that the current irrigation infrastructure
    and system do not provide sufficient control, monitoring and supervision, being
    ineffective at sound water allocations, especially when the number of water users
    increases (Theesfeld and Klümper, 2016). Table 4. Estimation of the panel regression

    are in parentheses. In model 4, the inclusion of a year-fixed dummy variable is
    crucial to account for unobserved factors that may vary over time during the land-reform
    processes. For instance, irrigation infrastructure conditions, agricultural practices,
    climate as well as policy and institutional modifications are unobserved factors
    that can be considered to change in a year-specific manner as year-fixed effects
    (see Fig. 4), and they are controlled by including the corresponding year-fixed
    dummy variable in the analysis. We find that the coefficient and marginal effect
    of gravity-irrigated areas and pump-irrigated areas exhibit statistical significances
    from 1% to 5% levels with positive signs in model 4. Focusing on the marginal
    effect in model 4, the result implies that IWA tends to increase approximately
    by 3810 m3 with an additional hectare in gravity-irrigated areas, holding other
    independent variables fixed at their sample means. Similarly, the marginal effect
    in model 4 indicate that IWA tends to increase approximately by 3870 m3 when cultivation
    in pump-irrigated areas increases by one hectare, holding other independent variables
    fixed at their sample means. The estimated coefficients of interaction terms between
    the number of water users and irrigation types on IWA are statistically significant
    at 1% level (see model 4 of Table 4). The magnitude in coefficient of interactions
    with pump-irrigated areas (− 0.0008) is higher than the coefficient of interactions
    with gravity-irrigated areas (− 0.0004). This reflects the heterogeneity of the
    effect for IWA depending on irrigation types when the number of water users increases.
    The effects of interaction terms are identified as significant in a coherent manner,
    playing a crucial role in characterizing IWA. To quantitatively demonstrate the
    heterogeneous effects, we have considered three scenarios and plotted how IWA
    changes over the number of water users under each scenario for a “typical region”
    with 23837 ha cultivated area in Tajikistan (holding other independent variables
    at their sample mean) based on the estimated results in model 4 of Table 4.3 Scenario
    1 assumes that 35% and 65% of 23837 ha are the gravity and pump-irrigated areas,
    respectively, to represent a “pump-irrigation dependent region.” Scenario 2 assumes
    that 50% and 50% of 23837 ha are the gravity and pump-irrigated areas, respectively,
    to represent an “equally-distributed region.” Scenario 3 assumes that 65% and
    35% of 23837 ha are the gravity and pump-irrigated areas, respectively, to represent
    a “gravity-irrigation dependent region.” In each scenario, the domain for a number
    of water users is set to be from 10 and 14000 according to the summary statistics.
    That is, the minimum and maximum numbers of water users are 7 and 14627, respectively
    (see Table 2). For simplicity, we round the numbers to be 10 and 14000. Fig. 5
    shows the predicted IWAs over the number of water users under the three scenarios,
    demonstrating that the slopes are idiosyncratic by a mix of irrigation types.
    The prediction under scenario 1 for “a pump-irrigation dependent region” shows
    a sharp decrease in IWA when the number of water users increases. It can be associated
    with specific infrastructure, geography and environment in pump-irrigated areas,
    such as unsuitable pumping systems and management for the large number of water
    users, as well as the uncertainty associated with water distribution and lifting
    stages. In particular, the lack of control, monitoring and supervision is reported
    to allow farmers in early pumping stages to overuse water in pump-irrigated areas,
    and many farmers in late stages are likely to face water shortages. According
    to Mr. Shafoat Nazifov, who has been working as a chief of Basin Land Reclamation
    and Irrigation Department of ALRI, farmers who have faced water shortages several
    times under pump-irrigated areas tend to overuse water once it becomes available
    (Nazifov, 2023). The predictions under scenario 2 for “an equally-distributed
    region” and scenario 3 for “a gravity-irrigation dependent region” show moderate
    and slight decreases in IWAs, respectively, compared to scenario 1. By comparing
    the slopes of the predictions across three scenarios, it becomes evident that
    the proportions of pump and gravity-irrigated areas are influential in characterizing
    IWA over the number of water users, suggesting that the magnitude in IWA reduction
    through an increase in the number of water users under pump-irrigated areas is
    more significant than that under gravity-irrigated areas. Download : Download

    in Sughd province. Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 represent the pump-irrigation dependent,
    equally-distributed and gravity-irrigation dependent regions, respectively. The
    estimated coefficients of interaction terms between the number of water users
    and irrigation types on IWD and IWA in models 3 and 4 have opposite signs (see
    Tables 3 and 4). The positive signs in the coefficients of interaction terms between
    a number of water users and irrigation types for IWD can be explained as follows:
    when a water user receives a one-unit land and is engaged on agriculture under
    pump-irrigated areas, they tend to plant, grow and cultivate crops with high water
    requirements compared to those under gravity-irrigated areas (Theesfeld and Klümper,
    2016). This suggests that farming practices depend on irrigation types, reflecting
    a positive sign for the interaction terms on IWD. In contrast, the negative signs
    in the coefficients of interaction terms between the number of water users and
    irrigation types can be explained as follows: when a new water user receives a
    one-unit land and is engaged on agriculture under pump-irrigated areas, they tend
    to overuse water due to possible uncertainties and problems in pump stations and
    pumping stages compared to those under gravity-irrigated areas. This implies that
    water overuse depends on irrigation types, reflecting a negative sign on IWA.
    We summarize the estimation results associated with IWD and IWA in Tables 3 and
    4 and provide answers to our research question (how is the number of water users
    related to irrigation water allocations in land reforms?) and hypothesis (an increase
    in the number of water users through land fragmentation poses negative threats
    to water allocations through the mediation of irrigation types) in the introduction.
    As indicated in our conceptual framework, IWD and IWA are characterized by the
    number of water users, irrigation types and their interactions as the main determinants
    in economically and statistically significant manners (Fig. 4). The main difference
    between the two regressions is that the number of water users does not play a
    significant role in explaining IWD, while it emerges as an important predictor
    by interacting with irrigation areas for IWA. Our research establishes that the
    increasing number of water users along with irrigation types through land-fragmentation
    processes pose negative threats to irrigation water allocations in Tajikistan.
    While the literature has identified both positive and negative impacts of land
    fragmentation on agricultural production and rural development (Lerman, 2008,
    Robinson et al., 2008, Lerman and Sedik, 2009, Hartvigsen, 2014, Jürgenson, 2016,
    Mutambara et al., 2016, Postek et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2020, Tesfaye et al.,
    2021, Wang et al., 2021), our results appear to be on the “negative-impact” side.
    The precondition of this conclusion shall be the inappropriate irrigation infrastructure
    and system as well as the associated water scarcity for Tajikistan farmers, reflecting
    the culture, semiarid (or arid) geography and histories. In contrast, some water-rich
    countries with sound irrigation infrastructures and systems, such as Japan, are
    known to have improved agricultural performances even with the increasing number
    of water users through land fragmentation (Christensen, 1968, Dorner and Thiesenhusen,
    1990). Land fragmentation is an ongoing global event driven by some external forces,
    such as population growth or governmental decisions. Irrespective of these forces,
    this research suggests that decisions regarding land fragmentation must be made
    in consideration of the number of water users, environments, irrigation infrastructure
    and system. It is crucial to consider whether or not they are suitable for plot
    scales with the number of water users under land fragmentation, since the scales
    characterize farmers’ empowerment, enabling individuals and organizations to control,
    monitor and supervise water allocations. In Tajikistan, nobody expected that such
    a negative result would be realized, when land fragmentation was adopted as a
    national policy. Now, we must admit that the irrigation infrastructure and system
    are not suitable for allowing an increase in water users through land fragmentation.
    Lifting water up to an elevation of several hundred meters is a common practice
    through multiple pumping stages under the current irrigation infrastructure and
    system in Tajikistan, and the number of lifting stages increases with the number
    of water users. Water users in the early stages tend to overuse water due to the
    lack of control, monitoring and supervision, while those in the late stages suffer
    from shortage and uncertainty problems of water availability. Consequently, pump
    irrigation will more profoundly decrease IWA for a large number of water users
    than gravity irrigation. A series of temporal changes in Tajikistan agriculture
    and the environment, such as crop diversification, local water-sharing rules,
    climate, commodities’ scheduling and distribution, have been reported in relation
    to the number of water users (Theesfeld and Klümper, 2016). However, the irrigation
    infrastructure and system have remained the same as in the Soviet period, being
    neither updated nor customized for such changes. Overall, the increase in water
    users through land fragmentation exacerbates IWA due to the unchanging infrastructure
    and system depending on irrigation types and environments. Notably, the negative
    impact shall be even worsened by specific environments of semiarid and arid climates,
    such as Tajikistan, where water is a bottleneck for agriculture and many other
    economic activities. Our research suggests some possible policy recommendations
    to improve irrigation water allocations through land-reform processes. One is
    to consolidate small-scale farms at the level of former collectivization parcels
    where at least one parcel should be shared by several farmers through creating
    community collaborative management, especially when a proper irrigation infrastructure
    (or an environment) for land fragmentation is not available. If they collectively
    grow one type of crops in each parcel, water availability, production, water supervision
    and monitoring will improve by land consolidation even in the absence of proper
    infrastructure and environment. Another is to newly adopt a technically efficient
    and proper irrigation distribution system, such as a piped distribution system
    for small-scale farms, when land fragmentation is moving forward or unavoidable
    due to pressures from population growth or the general public. The piped distribution
    system is reported to reduce the costs of land acquisition, operation, maintenance,
    supervision, water losses due to evaporation, seepage as well as water logging
    issues, and consequently, an accurate volumetric irrigation water supply can be
    ensured. However, we must note that adopting such a system comes with enormous
    financial burden on the budget of developing nations. Given such a financial challenge,
    it is advisable to reassess the trade-off between promoting land consolidation
    and adopting a new irrigation infrastructure to accommodate small-sized plots.
    This reassessment should also consider the interaction between the number of water
    users and irrigation types for food security and sustainability in agricultural
    sectors, as demonstrated in this paper. 5. Conclusion This study examines how
    the number of water users under post-Soviet land reform is related to irrigation
    water in Tajikistan, hypothesizing that an increase in the number of water users
    through land fragmentation poses negative threats to water allocations through
    the mediation of irrigation types. We utilize panel data from 1996 to 2020 from
    13 regions of Sughd province, collecting secondary data on irrigation water demand
    (IWD), irrigation water availability (IWA), gravity-irrigated areas, pump-irrigated
    areas and payment fraction. The analyses reveal that the irrigation types are
    key determinants for IWD compared to any other factors, and the impact under pump-irrigated
    areas is approximately 1.6 times as large as that by gravity-irrigated areas.
    The finding also shows that the increasing number of water users through land
    fragmentation in Tajikistan tends to reduce IWA, and the magnitude in reduction
    under pump-irrigated areas is more significant than that under gravity-irrigated
    areas. Overall, this research establishes that irrigation types and the number
    of water users through land reforms matter for a change in irrigation water allocations,
    and the interactions particularly pose idiosyncratic threats to the IWA. Our results
    imply that decisions about land fragmentation should be carefully evaluated and
    implemented in consideration of the possible negative impacts on water availability
    along with the increasing number of water users, and the negative impact shall
    be highly dependent on infrastructure, i.e., irrigation types, as well as the
    environment. In other words, the interplay of water users with irrigations matters
    for optimal land reform. We note some limitations of our study and directions
    for future research. First, in this research, IWD is calculated based on the available
    information (mainly crop types and areas), which is considered the best approximation
    we can make in the context of Tajikistan. However, future studies should be able
    to collect and use good-quality IWD data that incorporate irrigation system losses
    and other minute factors. Second, this research does not address the detailed
    processes of why the magnitude of IWA reduction under pump irrigation is more
    significant than that under gravity irrigation when the number of water users
    increases. To clarify the details, future studies should consider water-use efficiency
    (or water balance) in regard to the farm plot sizes and technical conditions under
    each irrigation type. To this end, a water modeling approach with field measurements
    is recommended. Third, this research employs secondary data without fully integrating
    the analysis with geoinformation. However, in the future, it is desirable to collect
    primary data at each plot level and conduct geoinformation system analysis with
    the data in a unified manner following the approaches by Garrido-Rubio et al.
    (2020), Bawa et al. (2022) and Filippelli et al. (2022). These approaches enable
    us to clarify the details of water allocations in agriculture. Finally, we acknowledge
    that our research may have some other limitations, however, it is our belief that
    this study is an important first attempt at understanding the relationship between
    the number of water users and irrigation water availability in land-reform processes,
    and further studies on the same issue will ensue in the future. CRediT authorship

    and supervision under the current infrastructure, it is almost impossible to induce
    all farmers to follow the regulations and rules. In such cases, local principles
    tend to play a crucial role in resolving problems, which cannot be generalized
    in reality. In one local area, the WUA members may negotiate with one another
    and seek to resolve the problems case by case. In another local area, people may
    have some consensus regarding water allocations in advance. For instance, people
    agree to share water equally irrespective of their locations in canals by uniformly
    reducing the frequency of watering or making a quotation on water use. In the
    worst-case scenario, people may not follow local principles. Consequently, upstream
    farmers overuse water and downstream farmers face shortages. 2 The simplified
    norms are also used for water-use plans and irrigation water distributions at
    the national level. For instance, the irrigation water norms per ha for some crops
    are as follows: rice - 37000 m3, alfalfa - 12500 m3, vegetables - 12000 m3, cotton
    - 10000 m3, orchards - 9500 m3, potatoes - 6500 m3, maize grain - 9500 m3, maize

    1. Introduction The steady increase in the global population drives the demand
    for agricultural products. The demand is further intensified by biofuel production
    and the shift in tastes and preferences toward higher-calorie diets, which can
    be attributed to elevated income levels and enhanced living conditions [1]. By
    the year 2030, there is an anticipated 50% surge in the demand for food, a figure
    that is projected to escalate to 80–100% by 2050 compared to current levels [2].
    Ensuring a consistent and equitable provision of agricultural commodities is vital
    for the preservation of food security, the promotion of sustainable development,
    and the maintenance of economic and social stability. The agricultural sector
    is closely linked to several sustainable development goals, including the promotion
    of good health, the eradication of hunger, the reduction of poverty, the improvement
    of human well-being, and the mitigation of inequalities [[3], [4], [5], [6]].
    However, the growing demand for the agriculture sector is aggravating the existing
    supply limitations. Nevertheless, addressing this increased demand poses difficulties,
    such as the scarcity of cultivable land, the worldwide influence of climate change
    on agriculture, and the changing food habits resulting from the growing per capita
    incomes in developing countries [7,8]. The fertility of agricultural land is jeopardized
    by factors such as a large population, fast urbanization, and considerable industrial
    development. Moreover, the difficulties posed by climate change and global warming
    impede endeavors to improve agricultural productivity by intensifying the strain
    on resources [9]. In addition, the agricultural sector is confronted with internal
    challenges such as the significant strain of fierce global competition on smallholder
    farmers, escalating input costs, and imbalanced resource utilization. Besides
    all this, the conventional approach of augmenting production through methods like
    increased chemical fertilizer usage poses potential drawbacks. The aforementioned
    circumstances require the implementation of more inventive approaches to enhance
    agricultural production. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has emerged
    as a highly promising advancement in recent times [10,11]. China has experienced
    significant difficulties in providing sustenance for its vast population, which
    is the largest in the world, while also ensuring food security despite several
    limits and hurdles. Thus, this study aims to investigate the many factors that
    influence grain production in China, with a specific focus on ICT. The results
    of the study have the potential to deliver valuable policy recommendations. The
    agricultural sector has long been of utmost importance to China, as it is responsible
    for providing sustenance to a significant portion of the global population. Ensuring
    the dietary requirements of around 22% of the global population, while utilizing
    only 7% of the cultivated land worldwide [12], presents a significant challenge
    and national security concern for the people of China [13]. The COVID-19 outbreak
    and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have made food security an increasingly
    significant issue for China. The fact that there are many smallholder farmers
    in China is another unique aspect of the country''s agricultural sector. It is
    critical to make sure these farmers can access contemporary farming techniques
    and sell their products. Because of its massive scale, China''s agricultural sector
    is also vital to the security of the worldwide market for agricultural goods.
    Grain holds an important place within the context of China and in different regions
    of the world (see Fig. 1). During the 1950s, China embarked on a reform initiative
    aimed at augmenting grain production and enhancing agricultural infrastructure.
    The implementation of these changes led to a sustained growth in grain output
    over an extended period. However, there was a temporary fall in 2015, followed
    by a subsequent recovery that culminated in the attainment of the highest recorded
    level of grain production in 2022 [14]. The utilization of chemical pesticides
    and fertilizers has significantly contributed to the increase in productivity
    [15]. China has emerged as the world''s foremost grain producer, accounting for
    over 25% of worldwide production. Furthermore, the country''s production per unit
    is 1.3 times the world average [16]. However, China''s grain output remains inadequate,
    leading to a substantial reliance on grain imports [17]. China must augment grain
    production to uphold the equilibrium between supply and demand. Nevertheless,
    the agricultural industry is currently encountering numerous challenges. Download

    Cereal production in various regions of the world. Urbanization and increased
    per capita income have led to a growing demand for agricultural products, resulting
    in increased pressure on the supply. Moreover, the agricultural sector is progressively
    impacted by worldwide atmospheric fluctuations, posing a threat to grain cultivation
    in China [18]. The substantial disparity between precipitation and evaporation
    in a considerable portion of China necessitates the reliance on irrigation for
    crop cultivation [19]. The majority of the country''s grain output, exceeding
    70%, is derived from irrigated farms [20]. Water resources are becoming insufficient
    due to population expansion, urbanization, and environmental degradation, exacerbating
    their already limited and uneven distribution [21]. In addition, the utilization
    of groundwater as a result of insufficient surface water supplies has a detrimental
    impact on the environment [20]. The increasing gap between the demand and supply
    of water in China is posing an impending threat of water scarcity. Moreover, China,
    the predominant global consumer of pesticides and chemical fertilizers since the
    1980s, has faced severe scrutiny for the detrimental impact it has on the atmosphere
    and human health [22]. The reliance of the agricultural industry on environmentally
    detrimental chemicals presents a risk to the long-term viability of sustainable
    agricultural practices. China is also criticized for its inefficient utilization
    of chemical fertilizers [23]. This situation necessitates investigating the consequence
    of fertilizer use on grain productivity in China. China is confronted with two
    formidable objectives: firstly, to guarantee food security through the augmentation
    of agricultural output while adhering to predetermined resource limitations; and
    secondly, to accomplish this while minimizing the adverse externalities associated
    with agricultural production and employing environmentally sustainable practices.
    An analysis of the Chinese agricultural sector reveals that the country''s long-standing
    strategy of increasing output through input intensification will not be sufficient
    to achieve the stated targets [24]. China should consider implementing measures
    to substantially decrease the utilization of chemical pesticides and fertilizers
    in agricultural practices, while concurrently promoting the adoption of technology
    advancements to enhance agricultural production. Grain yields in China''s main
    producing regions are displayed in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image

    major producing regions of China for 2010 and 2020. Countries worldwide are recognizing
    the crucial significance of digital technologies in transforming agricultural
    practices and procedures. Farmers are benefiting from several advancements, such
    as the extensive adoption of precision farming techniques, which provide them
    with immediate information regarding soil quality, weather patterns, and crop
    conditions. Agricultural practitioners are integrating cutting-edge technologies
    to enhance soil cultivation methods and agricultural procedures, resulting in
    enhanced efficiency and productivity. For instance, Talaviya et al. [25] investigated
    different automated systems in agriculture, emphasizing the importance of AI in
    advancing the agro-based sector and addressing challenges in irrigation, weeding,
    crop monitoring, and spraying through automated robotic systems. According to
    Zhang [26], precision agriculture, utilizing smart and digital technologies, optimizes
    resource usage for increased efficiency and reduced environmental impact. This
    involves real-time monitoring of crop conditions through sensors and IoT devices,
    enabling data-driven decisions. Furthermore, digital technologies like data analytics
    and machine learning enhance crop planning, yield prediction, and disease detection
    in agriculture Agricultural companies are also using the latest tech to improve
    their supply chains, logistics, and overall effectiveness. The deployment of Internet
    of Things (IoT) applications establishes a connection between agricultural equipment,
    enabling seamless communication and collaboration. These progressions facilitate
    the anticipation of crop yields, identification of illnesses, and advocacy for
    sustainable practices through the reduction of resource wastage. The advent of
    digital technology has ushered in a new era in Chinese agriculture, with remarkable
    prospects for innovation and productivity, thereby making significant progress
    in China as well. To comprehend the substantial alteration occurring in China''s
    agricultural and technology integration, it is imperative to grasp the most recent
    advancements that propel this process. China''s initiatives are in line with the
    worldwide trend where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a crucial
    role in driving significant changes in the agricultural sector. ICT has the potential
    to offer novel and inventive approaches to establish a more intelligent, streamlined,
    and environmentally sustainable agricultural industry. China is making significant
    progress in the adoption and utilization of ICT. As of July 2022, the total number
    of Internet users has reached 1.051 billion [27]. Additionally, the number of
    Internet users in rural areas amounted to 297 million, with a corresponding rural
    penetration rate of 59.2% [28]. The expeditious proliferation of ICT has a substantial
    influence on the agriculture industry and the socio-economic circumstances of
    rural households. ICT possesses significant potential to bring about dramatic
    changes within the agricultural industry. The proliferation of applications has
    yielded expeditious and efficient resolutions to the specific challenges encountered
    by agricultural practitioners. Information and communication are essential components
    of agriculture due to their inherent characteristics [29]. ICT facilitates the
    acquisition of high-quality information by farmers about crucial aspects such
    as meteorological conditions, moisture levels, and the health of plants. Moreover,
    the availability of ample location-specific data facilitates the adoption and
    implementation of “Precision Agriculture” [30]. Besides, ICT is one of the most
    effective ways to integrate and participate especially small-scale disconnected
    farmers, into the market. ICT enables farmers to reduce search costs, make price
    comparisons, bargain [31], buy input cheaper, and sell their products at higher
    prices, thus increasing profitability and sales volume. ICT facilitates farmers''
    access to public information [32], financial services, insurance, convenient credit
    opportunities, agricultural technology and research, and e-commerce opportunities.
    ICT also affects the structure of the markets and the economy. It provides market
    efficiency [33], reduces uncertainty, creates an incentive for more production
    [34], and reduces price dispersion spatially and over time [35]. Hence, ICT contributes
    to affordable food prices, remunerative agriculture, sustainable production, and
    agricultural income increase by addressing many challenges of agriculture. The
    emergence of computer technology led to its rapid utilization in various fields.
    Agricultural producers, however, initially lagged behind other industries in adopting
    and incorporating computers during the 1980s. Nevertheless, in the 1990s, the
    increasing affordability of computers and enhancements in their performance facilitated
    a rise in their usage within the agricultural sector. Academic investigations
    into the utilization of computer technology gained prominence during this period,
    with the initial academic studies in this domain beginning to surface in the late
    1980s. These early works predominantly took the form of survey studies, focusing
    on the determinants of computer usage in agriculture [36]. Amponsah [37] noted
    that computer usage had not yet become widespread enough. Ascough et al. [38]
    argued that the insufficient use of computers in the agricultural sector was a
    rational choice given the prevailing conditions of the time. As an early attempt,
    Day [39] provided examples of how computer technology could be employed in agriculture.
    The 2000s marked a period of rapid increase in both the use of computers in agriculture
    and the corresponding academic research on the subject. Batte [40] highlighted
    the swift growth of computer usage in agriculture, attributing it, in part, to
    the significance of Internet technology. The proliferation of ICT usage in agriculture
    was further propelled by increased computing power, personal computers, management
    software, various business models, e-commerce platforms, and smartphones. There
    is an abundance of empirical evidence suggesting these technologies significantly
    enhanced the efficiency of the agricultural sector and led to meaningful increases
    in production [41,42]. Academic studies provide ample evidence of the positive
    consequences of the use of ICT. Lezoche et al. [43] claimed that ICT can support
    the holistic transformation of the country''s agricultural sector. Ma et al. [35]
    found that ICT facilitates the agricultural sector''s access to credit. Moreover,
    the opportunities brought by using ICT increase rural households'' income [44].
    Deng et al. [45] claimed that Internet use increases green agricultural productivity.
    Besides, Li and Zhao [46] stated that using the Internet promotes technological
    innovation. Kaila and Tarp [47] found that the Internet increases efficiency in
    using fertilizers and agricultural production in Vietnam. Ma et al. [35] stated
    that the use of the Internet is effective in choosing more environmentally friendly
    organic fertilizers as a substitute for chemical fertilizers. However, the impact
    of ICT on cereal production in China has not been adequately studied. Numerous
    scholarly investigations have previously explored the effects of climate change
    on the production of cereal crops [[48], [49], [50]], the interrelationship between
    energy consumption and agricultural productivity [51], the nexus between greenhouse
    gas emissions and agricultural output [52], as well as the connection between
    technological progress, climate change, and soybean yields [53] specifically within
    the context of China. Nevertheless, the aforementioned research overlooked the
    crucial significance of computer utilization in the overall framework of grain
    production. Hence, the current paper contributes to the ongoing literature in
    three ways: Firstly, to the best of our research knowledge, no empirical paper
    assessed the impact of computer utilization on grain production in the case of
    China. Secondly, the current empirical paper utilized the various panel data estimation
    techniques such as FGLS and D-K methods to explore the long-run impact of computer
    use and other production factors on grain production. The robustness of the long
    run is verified by using the panel autoregressive distributed lag (PARDL) model.
    In addition, this work utilized advanced estimate techniques, specifically the
    Westerlund ECM panel cointegration test and the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality approach,
    to investigate the long-term cointegration relationship and causal interaction
    among the variables under examination. The dynamic nexus between the variables

    also provides effective policy recommendations that target sustainable development
    of the Chinese agricultural sector. Furthermore, it is imperative to address some
    research questions in the present study, which are outlined as follows: • Does
    the utilization of computer technology contribute to the enhancement of grain
    production? • Is there evidence of a long-term cointegration relationship between
    the variables? • What is the nature of the directional causation between grain
    production and all the regressors? The subsequent sections of this research study
    are given in the following ways The subsequent section of the paper delves into
    a comprehensive exploration of our data and methodology, elucidating the strategic
    choices made in the research design. Subsequently, we intricately unfold the empirical
    findings and engage in in-depth discussions, systematically connecting the outcomes
    to the broader research questions and objectives. This section aims not only to
    present results but also to provide the logical progression of our argument. Finally,
    the concluding section encapsulates the synthesis of our study, drawing together
    key insights, and discussing their implications. 2. Data and methodological procedure
    2.1. Data The present study draws an empirical relationship between computer usage
    and grain yields in the main grain-producing provinces of China: Henan, Hunan,
    Hebei, Hubei, Neimenggu, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui,
    Shangdong, Sichuan. In addition, this study also considered technical inputs such
    as fertilizer consumption, pesticide usage, the total power of agricultural machinery,
    irrigated area, and rural labour force as important factors of grain production.
    The data for studied variables are gathered from the National Bureau of Statistics
    of China (NBSC) (see Table 1). The trend plots of the considered variables are
    presented in Fig. 4. The descriptive statistics of candidate variables are displayed

    The empirical model linking the long-term influence of computer usage, fertilizer
    utilization, pesticide usage, the total power of agricultural machinery, irrigated
    area, and rural labour force on grain yields is required to light the aims of
    this research. Hence, the following function is constructed as: (1) By transforming
    the studied time series of Equation (1) into the log form, the baseline function
    is explained as follows: (2) Where GY denotes the grain yields, while i represents
    the cross-section of the individual province, t represents the period from 2002
    to 2020, and denotes the intercept term. to are the coefficients of variables:
    computer usage, fertilizer consumption, pesticide usage, the total power of agricultural
    machinery, irrigated area, and rural labour force. The flow of panel data estimation

    dependency tests The analytic method in this paper unfastens with a vital inspection
    of the nominated panel long-run range of datasets for deliberation of their connected
    properties. These vital investigating spot plainclothesmen for the creation of
    a conversant valuation on the issue of selections of the precise procedures and
    methods regarding the compatibility of connected approaches with specific panel
    series structures and data features. Quantified the current interlinked between
    nations all over the world that common consequences in the communication of comparable
    trends, financial drawbacks, economic shocks, and similar patterns and trends
    amongst other concerns between economies, an inspection of potential cross-sectional
    dependency (CD) in their linked errors between the mixed applied dataset turn
    into obligatory. In this pursuit, Chudik and Pesaran (2015) highlighted the importance
    of concentrating on this approach as it is identically significant for approximating
    reliable and vigorous findings simultaneously as favoring the suitable heterogeneous
    estimators of longitudinal panel data analysis. To do this, this research syndicates
    and performs the scaled LM test [54], bias-corrected scaled LM test [55], Lagrange
    multiplier test [56], and Pesaran [57] to control the occurrence of potential
    CD issues. The criticality of these approaches has been additional durable in
    some earlier empirical works [58,59]. The practical results relating to such tests
    authorize the CD occurrence in the variables. The practical mathematical form
    of Pesaran''s [60] CSD approach can be approached as: (3) T = (1, 2, 3, 4, … …
    50, … … N) (4) Where explores the coefficient of correlation for stochastic residual
    estimates approximated through simple ordinary least squares. 2.2.3. Panel second-generation
    stationary tests Quantifying the appropriate approach to the possible existence
    of potential CD, the panel stationary approach to be espoused for series and matching
    long-run cointegration examination should be applied for tackling the possible
    CD problem. Individually, the cross-sectionally augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF)
    and Cross-sectionally augmented Im, Pesaran, and Shin (CIPS) approaches proposed
    by Ref. [61] were employed to influence the unit root properties of the nominated
    time series. These stationary tests are consistent and convenient for perceiving
    changes within the particular panels and the abovementioned approaches also propose
    indispensable attributes for perceiving the second-order generation in an idiosyncratic
    analysis of panel data [62]. The panel CADF stationary test statistics can be
    reported as follows: (5) The function form of the CIPS stationary test can be
    articulated as: (6) where here, and shows the cross-section averages. Further,
    the present research shows mathematically expression of the CIPS test as: (7)
    2.2.4. Panel long-term westerlund cointegration approach In the very next phase,
    comportment in attention to the possible CD issue of the variables and applied
    a panel stationary approach that offers the nominated panel characteristic, the
    consequential long-run panel cointegrating test to be employed also taken into
    understanding the CD problem in the designated sample examination. Subsequently,
    the traditional and first-generation long-run cointegration approaches could produce
    inconsistent and ambiguous results under the long-run cointegration examination
    for rejecting a null hypothesis (H0) of the no long-run cointegration. Accordingly,
    the 2nd generation Westerlund [63] approach was employed to confront the problem
    of conceivable CD and afterward validate precision with a gaze to the validity
    of the verdict on the H0. The Westerlund [63] long-run association approach is
    demonstrated after the rectification procedure in error term as presented in the
    below equation to control the long-run connection between time series in assessment
    with the estimated group (Gt, Gα) statistics and panel (Pt, Pα) statistics. (8)
    £ Where presents the modification and convergence adjustment speed that hindrance
    the steady balance from short-to long-run system dynamics. The Westerlund-based
    error correction model (ECM) shows the 2nd generation that includes four assorted
    test equation statistics, for example, two mean group cointegration (Gt, Ga) statistics,
    and two Panel long-run cointegration tests (Pt, Pα) statistics are explored as:
    (9) (10) (11) (12) 2.2.5. Panel long-run elasticity estimates For the estimation
    of longitudinal data analysis, this research employed the Driscoll and Kraay regression
    (D–K) developed by Ref. [64]. The standard error-based D–K method has been comprised
    beforehand in the interconnected literature [65,66]. This approach competently
    tackles the possible issues of CD, serial error correlation, and heteroscedasticity
    [65]. Another advantage of this approach is standard D–K error tackles the most
    usual problem of missing values whereas it is more appropriate for the analysis
    of both unbalanced and balanced analysis of panel data. This approach is also
    consistent and robust in contradiction of slope heterogeneity and CD in the panel''s
    series. To sum up, this study grasps the benefit and assimilating standard error
    D–K edifice for Pooled Ordinary Least Square (POLS) test throughout a multiple
    linear regression model that will be presented as follows: (13) Where: i = 1,
    2 …. …. N, and t = 1, 2 …. ….. T (T denoted time dimensions, and i presents the
    panel countries). denoted the dependent variable); presents the independent panel
    of the series, and is the random error term. This approach is the primarily suitable,
    dependable, consistent, and common pragmatic method in very up-to-date studies
    [65,66]. Moreover, Reed and Ye [67], proposed the Feasible Generalized Least Square
    (FGLS) method to tackle numerous longitudinal data examination problems for instance
    FGLS is proficiently employed in the occurrence of serial correlation, heteroscedasticity,
    imaginable CD, and slope heterogeneity together employing the Monte Carlo simulation
    from the panel research. This test performs more competently and generates consistent
    results when the cross-section number (i) is fewer against the time dimensions
    (N < T) in the dataset as this is impeccably fit in this study case. The parameters
    and variables for the FGLS estimators’ parameters are presented in the subsequent
    equation as follows: (14) € € (15) € In Eq. (15), € includes latent conjecture
    regarding potential CD, serial correlation, and heteroskedasticity in the contemporaneous
    error term. 2.2.6. Panel non-causality Dumitrescu and Hurlin(D-H) approach When
    the detection of the long–run connection of the selected panel series validates
    in the estimation of the panel dataset, it is important to determine the direction
    of causality association among variables. To do this, the present research used
    the panel non-causality approach developed by Dumitrescu and Hurlin [68] to determine
    the causality–direction association between the panel-selected time series. Newly,
    this approach is extensively applied in recent literature [58,62,65]. This causality
    approach has many advantages for example it accounts for the potential problem
    of slope heterogeneity and CD in the dataset. The D-H approach accomplishes spectacularly
    in the case of smaller data et . Moreover, Dumitrescu and Hurlin [68] approach
    also can be worked efficiently in both unbalanced and balanced datasets. The Dumitrescu
    and Hurlin [68] test can be expressed as follows: (16) While presents the optimal–lag–length
    selection, and to examine the H0 is “Z does not Granger cause X” for all i (cross–sections).
    3. Empirical findings and discussions The existence of a correlation and unit
    root between units should be tested to ascertain which of the first and second-generation
    long-run relationship approaches applies to the study. To ensure whether disturbances
    in the panel series are CD or not, we first employed cross-sectional dependence
    tests. The results of Pesaran''s [57] CD test and Pesaran''s [61] cross-sectionally
    augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) approaches are demonstrated in Table 3. According
    to the results, it is evidenced that the CD test strongly rejects the null hypothesis
    of no CD, confirming the CD across the selected provinces in China. CADF test
    results also indicate that all series are non-stationary at level but stationary
    at first difference. Based on these findings, panel Pedroni [69,70], Kao [71],
    and Westerlund cointegration tests [63] are performed to investigate the long-run
    relationships as the next step. Table 3. Findings of CD and CADF unit root tests.

    Table 4 displays the outcomes of the Pedroni panel and Kao residual-based cointegration
    tests. At a significance level of 1%, the null hypothesis of no cointegration
    connection is rejected by four out of the seven panel tests. The results obtained
    from the Kao residual cointegration test provide evidence supporting the presence
    of a long-term cointegration relationship among the variables included in the
    model. Based on the findings from the Westerlund ECM panel cointegration tests,
    the null hypothesis cannot be rejected using either the Ga or the Pa test. However,
    it can be rejected using the Gt and Pt tests at the 10% and 1% significance levels
    respectively. These results confirm a cointegration relationship between grain
    yields, computer usage, fertilizer, pesticide, power, irrigated area, and rural
    labour in China, as shown in Table 5. Table 4. Findings of cointegration tests.

    the cointegration relationship, two estimators, namely the Feasible Generalized
    Least Squares (FGLS) approach and the D-K method, are utilized to manage the long-term
    equilibrium association in the co-integrated panels. Table 6 displays the estimated
    evidence for both the FGLS and D-K approaches. All the variables, except irrigated
    area, were articulated in natural logarithms, so the coefficients projected from
    both methods can be construed as elasticity. The results obtained using the FGLS
    estimator indicate a significant positive relationship between computer usage
    and grain yields. Specifically, the findings suggest that a 1% increase in computer
    usage is associated with a corresponding 0.04% increase in grain yields. The utilization
    of smart farming technologies and farmers'' computer proficiency can enhance the
    efficiency of decision-making processes and facilitate the identification of optimal
    crop management strategies [72]. In recent times, there has been notable progress
    in the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in enhancing crop production,
    agricultural monitoring systems, real-time weather monitoring, harvesting processes,
    resource utilization, and the overall efficiency of agro-based businesses. Artificial
    Intelligence (AI)-enabled technology, including computer control systems, deep
    learning algorithms, and smart-farming techniques, can be employed to predict
    future crop yields and optimize agricultural conditions. To optimize crop planning
    and cycles, farmers must possess knowledge regarding the soil properties of their
    fields and farms during the stages of planting and harvesting. According to a
    report published by the McKinsey Company [73] in 2022, the field of agriculture
    exhibits a lower level of digitalization in comparison to several other industries
    on a global scale. The aforementioned findings align with recent empirical research
    that has reached comparable conclusions on the positive impact of computer usage
    [74], Internet usage [47,[75], [76], [77], [78]], Internet technology [28], broadband
    connections [79], and ICT [80] on the efficiency and productivity of agricultural
    production. Table 6. Findings of long-run elasticity estimates. A) Cross-sectional

    NS Denotes non-significant. Moreover, it is worth noting that the application
    of fertilizer and the expansion of irrigated areas both contribute positively
    to the enhancement of grain yields. This implies that a 1% increase in fertilizer
    consumption and intensification of irrigated areas leads to a corresponding increase
    in grain output by 0.01% and 0.07% respectively. The utilization of fertilizers
    to enhance soil fertility constitutes a fundamental aspect of contemporary agricultural
    practices. The expansion of agricultural land experienced a constrained growth
    of 15% from 1961 to 2015; however, the application of nitrogen fertilizers witnessed
    a substantial increase of over eightfold over the same time frame. Chemical fertilizers
    have a significant role in enhancing agricultural output, particularly in developing
    nations. According to Adhikari and Ramana ([81], it has been asserted that chemical
    fertilizers have contributed to around 50% of the rise in agricultural output
    in emerging nations. Nevertheless, the overutilization and unselective use of
    fertilizers give rise to challenges with ecosystem services. Furthermore, the
    estimated results indicated that the consumption of pesticides and the utilization
    of power have a negative effect on grain yields. Based on the findings, it can
    be observed that a marginal increase of 1% in pesticide consumption and electricity
    usage results in a reduction of grain output exceeding 0.03%. The findings showed
    that there is no statistically significant relationship between rural labor and
    grain yields. The results of the D-K test exhibit comparable outcomes with the
    results obtained from the FGLS analysis. The estimated evidence of the D-K method
    exhibits a high degree of similarity to the results obtained by the FGLS approach.
    The effects of a 1% increase in computer use, fertilizer use, and irrigated areas
    are 0.04%, 0.02%, and 0.15% increase in grain yields, respectively. However, though
    pesticide and power use reduce grain yields by approximately 0.02%, the coefficients
    are not significant. In contrast to the FGLS test results, the effect of rural
    labor on grain yield was found to be adverse but significant in the D-K test.
    The results of our study align with previous research conducted in various countries,
    which also examined the relationship between control variables and agricultural
    productivity. For instance, a study conducted in Pakistan [9] found a significant
    impact of fertilizer consumption on cereal productivity. Similarly, research conducted
    in China [53] demonstrated the influence of pesticides and chemical fertilizers
    on soybean yields. Additionally, studies conducted in ASEAN countries [82] highlighted
    the impact of cropped areas and rural labor on cereal production and agricultural
    value-added. Furthermore, research conducted in Asian countries [83] explored
    the influence of total fertilizer usage on agricultural value-added. The computer
    usage elasticity acquired through the ARDL technique is found to be within a similar
    range as the coefficients obtained through the FGLS and D-K estimations, as demonstrated
    in Table 7. This comparison serves as a robustness check for the ARDL method estimations.
    Consequently, the utilization of computer by 1% exhibits a notable enhancement
    in grain yields, resulting in a 0.04% increase. The primary impartial for ensuring
    food security should be the enhancement of technological accessibility, as agricultural
    efficiency is crucial in enabling a majority of farmers to produce commodities
    with limited and scarce resources. This, in turn, can lead to reduced unit costs
    and decreased agricultural prices. Furthermore, the ARDL model''s results about
    the impact of variables such as fertilizer use, pesticide use, power consumption,
    irrigated areas, and rural workforce on grain output were found to be congruent
    with the findings of the FGLS and D-K techniques. Additionally, Fig. 6 illustrates
    the long-term results. Table 7. Robustness check (ARDL method). Variables Coefficient

    full-size image Fig. 6. Long-run outcomes of FGLS, D-K, and ARDL methods. We test
    the causal interaction among our dependent and selected regressors using Dumitrescu
    and Hurlin [68] panel Granger non-causality approach, as can be seen in Table
    8. There is a strong causal relationship between grain yields and all of the model''s
    regressors, which means that each agricultural input plays a key role in the production
    of grain yields. The causality test findings also reveal a bilateral causal association
    between grain yields and fertilizer use, grain yields and pesticide use, and finally,
    between grain yields and rural labor. The causality findings are intriguing because
    they support the FGLS and D-K estimates of the results. What inferences may be
    made regarding causality based on these findings? In addition to disseminating
    meteorological data and facilitating the adoption of innovative agricultural practices,
    the utilization of computers assists farmers in the management and maintenance
    of records. Agricultural management information systems can be highly beneficial
    due to their ability to deliver up-to-date information on environmental conditions.
    The influence of diverse technical improvements on the agricultural industry is
    evident, as it is anticipated to affect agricultural performance in both direct
    and indirect ways. As indicated by Ma et al. [75], investment in ICT adoption
    in the agriculture industry can enhance the probability of obtaining loans. Farmers
    can employ programming techniques to automate the adjustment of fertilizer quantities,
    taking into account the specific requirements of both the crops and the soil.
    This practice contributes to the enhancement of soil quality and the augmentation
    of crop productivity. The results of the study provide strong evidence in favor
    of the positive impact of fertilizers on enhancing crop yield. Farmers can enhance
    crop output and optimize land usage by adopting a strategic approach to planting
    seeds. By planting seeds more sparsely in low-productivity agricultural areas
    and more thickly in high-productivity fields, farmers may effectively increase
    their crop yield. This practice not only enables farmers to produce more food
    on a smaller land area but also offers protection to crops against pests, diseases,
    and weeds. Table 8. Results of the D-H causality tests. Null Hypothesis W-Stat.

    is increasingly acknowledged as a powerful tool for improving profitability and
    sustainability in the field of agricultural development. The use of computers
    is widely acknowledged as a crucial factor in generating significant progress
    in agricultural sustainability in the face of climate change. The use of computer
    technology into agricultural production systems has profoundly transformed the
    techniques utilized in food production. Technology has enabled farmers to monitor
    and improve various aspects of their agricultural practices, including soil quality,
    irrigation, and insect management. Farmers can optimize their decision-making
    processes for crop planting, fertilizing, and harvesting by employing sensors,
    drones, and other advanced technology. These instruments facilitate the gathering
    and examination of data, hence promoting enhanced agricultural practices. Moreover,
    computer technology has enabled farmers to have easier access to markets, increased
    communication with consumers, and more efficient financial management. Through
    the utilization of e-commerce platforms and mobile applications, farmers may directly
    sell their products to consumers, bypassing intermediaries and effectively reducing
    their expenses. Furthermore, individuals have the opportunity to access financial
    services, such as loans and insurance, which can help reduce risks and support
    investment in their endeavors. Hence, the main objective of this research is to
    assess the importance of taking into account computer usage as a technological
    advancement regarding processing grain yield in China. By handling key control
    variables as inputs and accounting for the importance of computer use during the
    grain production process, we used sophisticated econometric techniques. To this
    end, we employed grain production data covering the main grain-producing regions
    of China for the period 2002–2020. As per the results, a significant estimate
    of the implied yield-computer usage response elasticity is about 0.04. Besides,
    the short-run and long-run effects between grain yield and other agricultural
    inputs proxied by control variables such as fertilizer and pesticide usage, power
    usage, irrigated area, and rural labor were also examined. Consequently, the findings
    show that fertilizer usage and irrigated areas positively impact grain yield,
    while pesticide usage, power usage, and rural labor significantly reduce grain
    production in China. While our study has given us valuable insights, we need to
    be aware of some limitations that come with the territory of studying how technology
    and farming connect. Our focus on how using computers affects grain production,
    in line with what Lezoche et al. [43] and Ma et al. [75] talked about, might miss
    out on other things influencing farming outcomes. While we''re filling a gap in
    what we know, not looking at how computers connect with other technology or outside
    influences, as Lezoche et al. [43] pointed out, is a limitation we should think
    about in future research. Lastly, what we found might only apply directly to China,
    as suggested by Kaila and Tarp [47] and Li et al. [29]. These limitations show
    us where our study might fall short and give us ideas for future research. Our
    research extends from a substantial body of existing literature that has investigated
    the potential for transformation through the use of information and communication
    technology (ICT) in agriculture within the context of China. The literature has
    consistently emphasized the positive impact of ICT on various facets of agricultural
    practices, corroborated by studies such as Lezoche et al. [43], Ma et al. [75],
    and Deng et al. [45]. These prior investigations underscored the potential of
    ICT in enhancing agricultural productivity, fostering technological innovation,
    and increasing income for rural households. However, our study takes a distinctive
    step forward by concentrating specifically on the relationship between computer
    utilization and grain production, an aspect that, surprisingly, has been overlooked
    in the existing literature. While existing literature broadly supports the positive
    consequences of ICT adoption in agriculture, our findings suggest a nuanced relationship
    between computer utilization and grain production in China. Our study agrees with
    what Lezoche et al. [43] and Ma et al. [75] suggested - that using computers can
    help make farming more productive. However, our specific focus on grain production
    unveils complexities not previously addressed in the literature. Methodologically,
    our study aligns with the existing literature''s emphasis on robust econometric
    techniques. Similar to studies such as Deng et al. [28] and Ma et al. [75], we
    employed advanced panel data estimation techniques, including FGLS and the D-K
    method, to ensure the robustness of our results. The application of the panel
    autoregressive distributed lag (PARDL) model, as well as tools like the Westerlund
    ECM panel cointegration test and the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality approach, contributes
    methodological depth to our analysis, aligning with the methodological sophistication
    observed in the literature. In considering future directions, a more in-depth
    exploration of regional variations within China could yield valuable insights
    into context-specific factors influencing the relationship between ICT adoption
    and grain production. How exactly do these findings contribute to agricultural
    development? The implementation of sophisticated computer systems, specifically
    those powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables precision agriculture.
    By integrating computer systems into the agricultural process, it is possible
    to forecast environmental conditions and precipitation, maximize irrigation efficiency,
    minimize surplus labor, and optimize all other external inputs. All of these enable
    producers to maximize yield at the lowest possible cost by maximizing the utilization
    of all available resources. However, there are several drawbacks to using computer
    technology in agriculture. It necessitates large investments in hardware, software,
    and training, which may be prohibitively expensive for small-scale farmers. When
    lending to farmers, financial institutions should consider computer technology
    investments. Improving finance access as an agricultural policy instrument can
    undeniably improve the adaptive capacity of agricultural processes and all other
    farming systems affecting long-term investments in agri-business sectors. In general,
    sustainable farming systems rely on the adoption of appropriate technologies in
    the face of global warming, particularly in high-risk locations. Farmers'' long-standing
    issues should be mitigated by agricultural transformation, primarily through the
    use of technical advancements such as computer use, robots, GPS technology, and
    all other information systems. Further study is needed to evaluate these technologies
    in varied farming and market systems under varying finance availability conditions
    and government intervention scenarios. Declaration of interests The authors declare

    1.1. Motivation Scarcity of water resources has become one of the most compelling
    issues hindering sustainable development of river basins, especially in arid regions.
    Growing demands of population growth and economy expansion have caused excessive
    water withdrawal from rivers, impeding downstream water availability and stability
    of the ecosystem. According to United Nations (UN), the global water demand is
    projected to be 6900 billion m3 in 2030, which is over 40% higher than the existing
    water supply; about 700 million people in arid regions may be displaced arisen
    from intense water scarcity by 2030 (UN 2022, 2022). Such issues may be even grim
    in transboundary river basins in absence of unified regulation for water use.
    In Central Asia, irrational water withdrawal for agricultural and energy production,
    and disordered competition among upstream and downstream states have posed the
    shrinkage of river runoffs, leading to ecosystems destruction in the delta zone
    and the large-scale desiccation of the Aral Sea (Zhang et al., 2019a, Wine and
    Laronne, 2020). To ensure energy security and agricultural sustainability in the
    future, there is an urgent need for decision makers to manage water, agriculture
    and energy in a coordinated and efficient way. In real-world practices, water,
    agriculture and energy are closely linked with inextricable interrelationships,
    forming a complex water-agriculture-energy nexus (WAEN) system. Agricultural irrigation
    that sustains food production, and energy generation related to hydro- and thermos-electric
    processes (e.g., cooling system), depend fundamentally and heavily on water availability.
    Besides, energy is essential for various processes, including water extraction,
    treatment, transportation, and food supply chains (Del Borghi et al., 2022, Akbari
    Variani et al., 2023). The nexus thinking can capture the complex linkages as
    well as facilitate managers analyzing the synergies and tradeoffs when co-managing
    water, energy and food resources. However, WAEN system is not only plagued with
    internal interactions, but also affected by multiple external factors, such as
    environmental, economic and technical changes. For example, drastic climate change
    has altered water availability and impacted the dynamic of water demand and supply
    (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2022, Pizarro et al., 2022). Many uncertain parameters in
    the nexus system could be highly complicated and furtherly bring about decision-making
    risks (Bakhtiari et al., 2020, Forouli et al., 2020). Therefore, it is necessary
    to optimize water resources allocation for water, agriculture and energy nexus
    under uncertain condition and climate change. 1.2. Literature review Previously,
    numerous studies put water, agriculture and energy into a comprehensive nexus
    framework. Methods of system dynamic analysis, agent-based model, life cycle assessment,
    and deterministic optimization were applied to identify planning strategies of
    resources allocation (Sušnik et al., 2021, El-Gafy and Apul, 2021, Del Borghi
    et al., 2022, Almulla et al., 2022, Akbari Variani et al., 2023). For example,
    Huang, Chang (2021) employed a system dynamics model to capture the dynamic concatenation
    of the water, energy and agriculture nexus for a rooftop farm; results found that
    the effectiveness of crop production and the efficiency of resource use could
    be enhanced by utilizing solar power and harvesting rainwater. Del Borghi et al.
    (2022) proposed a life cycle assessment based precision agriculture model to improve
    the water-energy-food nexus performance of four preserved vegetables products;
    results showed a strong correlation between the crop yield and diesel consumption
    under future climate change. Hasanzadeh Saray et al. (2022) developed a mixed-integer
    linear optimization model to plan water-energy-food nexus for a farm in northwest
    Iran; appropriate mitigation strategies for optimal cropping patterns were generated
    under the interactions between water, energy, and agriculture subsystems by focusing
    on CO2 emissions. Mirzaei et al. (2023) applied an agent-based model to analyze
    the resources allocation patterns based on the water, food and energy nexus in
    arid regions, where the cooperative behaviors of farmers under incentive policy
    options were evaluated. WAEN system often involves various uncertainties in system
    parameters and their relationships, which intensifies the complexities of management
    and brings system risks during the decision-making process. A number of researchers
    employed chance-constrained programming (CCP) for risk analysis under random environment.
    Wang and Guo (2021) introduced chance-constrained programming into a multi-objective
    water management model, where the random streamflow with the known probability
    distribution in the right-hand side constraint was determined by its cumulative
    distribution function. Arya and Bandyopadhyay (2022) integrated chance-constrained
    programming method into a water conservation network, where violation risks of
    right-hand-side probabilistic constraints were analyzed for determining optimal
    water allocation alternatives. However, above models are incapable of dealing
    with left-hand side stochastic parameters due to the nonlinear forms of the deterministic
    equivalents. In a practical management system, randomness may exist in both left-hand
    and right-hand sides of the constraints. For example, water availability is affected
    by random stream conditions, and loss coefficient is determined by canal operation;
    they are usually presented as stochastic variables with probability distributions
    and exist in double-hand sides of system constraints (Wang and Guo, 2021, Liu
    et al., 2023). Double-sided chance-constrained programming (DSCP) is deemed as
    a promising method for better accounting for such complex uncertainties by allowing
    the left-hand side randomness integrated into the algorithm of linear transformation
    (Zhang et al., 2019b, Jia et al., 2020). Apart from random features of system
    components, the uncertainties derived from climate projections and their potential
    impacts would also bring about difficulties for managers taking decisions on adaption
    measures. Water resources are found to be sensitive to these uncertainties and
    difficult to be exactly predicted in changing climate. Several studies have been
    carried out to analyze the impacts of climate change on water resources allocation
    based on global climate models (GCMs) (Ashrafi et al., 2022, Marques et al., 2022,
    Shayanmehr et al., 2022). For example, Hemati and Abrishamchi (2021) linked GCMs
    and a bargaining game model into one integration for assessing climate change
    impacts on water distribution schemes; results can be adopted as a basis for designing
    adaptive solutions in response to changed available water resources in Zarinehrood
    river basin. Shayanmehr et al. (2022) constructed a climate-hydrological-economic
    model to generate sustainable strategies for the agriculture system in an arid
    region of Iran; three climate scenarios derived from downscaling GCMs outputs
    were examined to analyze the impact of future climate change on water resources
    and crop production. 1.3. Research gaps Summarily, there are many research works
    on exploring management strategies of water, agriculture and energy nexus under
    uncertainty. However, some research gaps remain to be filled. First, although
    previous studies developed some optimization methods (e.g., CCP and DSCP) to capture
    uncertain information in nexus system, they mainly take a maximized system benefit
    or minimized system cost as a single-objective function to achieve optimal resource
    allocation patterns. With the aim of sustainability, managers often prefer to
    optimize the efficiency of resources utilization (i.e., marginal benefit) rather
    than a single cost- or benefit-oriented objective, especially for some water-stressed
    regions (e.g., the Syr Darya River basin of Central Asia). Fractional programming
    is proposed for addressing the ratio optimization problems by weighing two targets
    from different aspects but lacks the ability of uncertainty analysis (Larsen and
    Drews, 2019, Kapitza et al., 2022). There is still lacking research on the application
    of an integrated approach to planning sustainable strategies for water-agriculture-energy
    nexus system both considering system efficiency and uncertainty reflection. Second,
    most of previous studies on water-related nexus system planning neglected the
    crucial role of climate change and simplified the impact of uncertainty in climatic
    projection models on water resources and agricultural production. Thus, there
    is a gap in developing a robust optimization model to maximize system efficiency
    and reflect system risk in water, agriculture and energy nexus systems in adapt
    to future climate change. 1.4. Objective and contribution To fill above research
    gaps, this study aims to develop a novel double-sided stochastic fractional programming
    (DSFP) method by integrating FP and DSCP methods to optimize system efficiency
    under uncertainty. Each technique offers unique contribution towards the enhancement
    of DSFP capabilities of WAEN management. In detail, compared with traditional
    CCP and DSCP methods, DSFP has the advantages in balancing conflicting objectives
    with an optimal marginal benefit. In comparison with previous FP models, DSFP
    can effectively handle random uncertainties in both right-side and left-side hands
    of constraints, as well as detail the relationship between marginal effectiveness
    and system-failure risk. Then, a DSFP-based WAEN management (DSFP-WAEN) model
    has been formulated for planning sustainable WAEN schemes in the Syr Darya River
    basin, where the objective is to improve the system efficiency of nexus management
    by allocating available water resources to different sectors in twelve states.
    Two representative concentration pathways (i.e., RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) based on the
    outputs of GCM are considered for predicting future water availability and examining
    the influence on WAEN management. The main novelty and contribution of this study
    can be listed as: i) developing an innovative method of DSFP for planning WAEN
    system, which can strike the tradeoff between economic development and resources
    conservation and reflect uncertain water-supply conditions; ii) generating adaptable
    WAEN management schemes with considering the impact of climate change throughout
    a long planning horizon of 2026–2050; iii) providing flexible alternatives of
    water supply, economic investment, and ecological restoration, which can help
    managers remit water crisis from the perspective of regional cooperation and sustainability
    in the future. 2. Methodology In a practical WAEN management system, random uncertainty
    may exist in both sides of the system constraints. For example, due to changed
    hydrological processes and canal operation, water resource availability and the
    loss rate during water conveyance usually express as random parameters with their
    individual distributions, which may result in double-sided randomness. With ongoing
    water shortage, managers are responsible for allocating minimum water resources
    with maximum economic return (i.e., marginal effectiveness). By integrating stochastic
    mathematical programming method into s ratio optimization framework, a double-sided
    stochastic fractional programming (DSFP) method as: (1a) (1b) (1c) (1d) (1e) where
    xj are decision variables, , and are constants; and are random variables defined
    on a probability space W; represents a given risk level for violating double-sided
    probability constraint i; and are standard variations of and . If and follow normal
    distributions, inequality (1b) can be converted into approximated linearization
    form as: (2a) (2b) (2c) (2d) (2e) where denotes the inverse cumulative distribution
    function of a standard normal random variable with the linear combination of and
    variables. When and , we have: (3) and (4) Based on (4), inequality (5) can be
    regarded as one of the sufficient conditions of (2b): (5) By introducing , model
    2 can be converted into a linear version as: (6a) subject to: (6b) (6c) (6d) (6e)
    (6 f) where are the new decision variables, and the original variables equal to
    . Generally, the detailed resolution procedure can be summarized as: Step 1: Formulate
    a DSFP model. Step 2: Collect model input parameters and identify the uncertain
    variables with their individual probability distributions. Step 3: Convert double-sided
    stochastic chance constraints into deterministic ones through the DSCP method
    by giving a certain constrained-violation level (pi) for each constraint i. Step
    4: Transform the deterministic model into the linear version through the linear
    fractional programming method. Step 5: Solve the deterministic model and obtain
    solutions. Step 6: Repeat Steps 3–4 under different constrained-violation levels.
    3. Case study 3.1. Study area The Syr Darya River is the second longest river
    in Central Asia with a basin area of around 300,000 km2, which is shared by four
    countries including Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan (Fig. 1).
    Originated from the Tien Shan Mountains, the river flows through four countries
    including Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kazakhstan with an averagely
    annual flow of 37 km3. The Syr Darya River basin is characterized by a cold and
    moist climate in the upstream regions of high mountains and, a hot and arid climate
    in the downstream plains (Yegemova et al., 2018). During past decades, the warming
    climate has caused melting glaciers and ice sheets of the Tien Shan Mountains,
    which has disturbed the whole hydrological dynamics of the river basin (e.g.,
    the total and seasonal streamflow) (Zhang et al., 2019c). These changes eventually
    have brought about a lower runoff and induced negative influences on the available
    water resources in the Syr Darya River basin (Bissenbayeva et al., 2021). Download

    assigned for agricultural irrigation. Approximately 3.4 million ha of arable land
    was irrigated with 90% of the regional total water withdrawal in 2011 (Gaybullaev
    et al., 2014, Zou et al., 2019). Poor canal infrastructures and outdated irrigation
    modes are prevalent with conveyance and infield water application efficiencies
    of less than 50%; significant improvements in irrigation and conveyance techniques
    could be achieved in the river basin (Bekchanov and Lamers, 2016). In addition,
    considerable water resources are consumed by hydropower generation in the Syr
    Darya River basin. Upstream Kyrgyzstan controls several multipurpose reservoirs
    that generate hydropower, while downstream countries control extensive irrigation
    activities (Shi et al., 2020). Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, water-use
    conflicts among independent Central Asian states have become frequently due to
    their own purposes and demands of water resources (UNRCCA, 2021). As a result,
    border skirmishes have become frequently occurred and the runoff of the Syr Darya
    River has experienced a drastically decline from more than 20 km3 to less than
    10 km3 in 2021 (Munia et al., 2020, Solovey et al., 2023). The rapid decrease
    in runoff has led to a reduction in the basin''s water discharge into the Aral
    Sea, thereby impacting ecology and environment in the Aral Sea (Bekchanov et al.,
    2016). Water scarcity and environment deterioration would be furtherly amplified
    due to climate uncertainty and unknown consequences on water availability. Competing
    water needs of different sectors with transboundary water resources have posed
    challenges and triggered serious water crises in the river basin (Chen et al.,
    2021, Leng et al., 2021, Yang et al., 2023). With the aim of sustainable development,
    it is imperative to balance water conflicts and enhance water-use efficiency with
    effective management plans under uncertain socio-economic and climate changes.
    3.2. Development of DSFP-WAEN model A DSFP-WAEN model is developed for planning
    water resources allocation in the Syr Darya River basin under climate change over
    a long-term horizon (2026–2050). The framework of DSFP-WAEN model is shown in
    Fig. 1. For balancing the conflict of water demand and enhancing the efficiency
    of water use, the objective of the DSFP-WAEN model is to maximize system benefit
    per unit of water allocation, where sixteen water users and twelve states in the
    river basin are involved. The detailed objective function can be formulated as
    follows: (7) Benefit from water allocation for agriculture: The net benefit from
    agriculture water allocation includes the main profits of crops (e.g., wheat,
    cotton and corn) and livestocks, fixed cost of crop planting and stock farming,
    and cost of water pumping and conveyance. (7a) Benefit from water allocation for
    domestic sector: The net benefit from domestic water allocation includes the net
    profits of municipal and domestic use, and the cost of water pumping and conveyance.
    (7b) Benefit from water allocation for industry sector: The net benefit from industrial
    water allocation includes the profits of industry production (e.g., manufacture
    of automobile, processing of petroleum, and chemical products), and costs of operation
    equipment and labor fee. (7c) Benefit from water allocation for electricity generation:
    The net benefit from power generation involves selling prices of electricity and
    fixed costs of power plants. Two representative kinds of power generation in the
    study basin (i.e., hydropower and thermal power) are considered in this model.
    (7d) Benefit from water allocation for ecology sector: The net benefit from ecology
    sector derives from in-stream and off-stream ecological service values. The off-stream
    ecological assets are mainly provided by water allocated to ecological land (i.e.,
    grasslands, woodlands and wetlands) based on the ES assessment measure (Lv et
    al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2021). According to Bekchanov (2014), the instream ecological
    benefit is calculated based on the aggregate function of environmental water use
    from different ecosystem services (i.e., recreation, transportation, human health
    and fishery). In detail, water transportation benefits were estimated through
    bounded quadratic relationships between shipping benefits and environmental inflow
    based on the cargo traffic volume in the surroundings of the Aral Sea. Recreation
    benefits were estimated through the piece-wise linear functions based on tourism
    income losses due to the desiccation of the sea from 1960 and 1990. Health benefits
    were assessed by the approximate bounded linear relationships for health benefit
    and environmental flow based on health degradation losses resulting from the desiccation
    of the Aral Sea and consequent spread of dust storms. Fishery benefits were evaluated
    by the bounded exponential function functions between water inflows and fishery
    benefits based on fish production cost-benefit data (Timirkhanov et al., 2010).
    (7e) (6) Total water allocation for the WAEN system: (7 f) The constraints of
    DSFP- WAEN include: (1) Constraints for water supply: The allocated water amounts
    must be less than the availability of surface water in the Syr Darya River basin.
    (8) (2) Constraints for water demand: The final water demands of different users
    ought to be satisfied across the region. (9) (3) Constraints for hydropower resources
    availability: The amounts of power generation must be less than energy availability
    from hydropower stations. (10) (4) Constraints for electricity demands: The demands
    of electricity should be satisfied with the amounts of electricity generation
    considering electricity import and export among four countries. (11) (12) (13)
    (14) (5) Constraints for energy demand of water collection and delivery: The electricity
    consumption for water collection, pumping and delivery process should be less
    than the permissible amounts for the Syr Darya River basin. (15) (6) Constraints
    for arable land resources for food production: The total area of crop planting
    should not exceed the maximum arable area in the study region. (16) (7) Constraints
    for food demand-supply balance: For ensuring food security of the whole region,
    the total yield of food crop should meet the food requirement in each country.
    (17) (18) (19) (20) (8) Constraints for ecological water requirement: The lower
    limits of environmental flows must be guaranteed for satisfying the requirement
    of ecological security in the Syr Darya River basin. (21) (9) Constraints for
    salinity control: The total water allocation for salt leaching must be less than
    the permissible amounts. (22) (10) Constraints for ecological land coverage: These
    constraints are set for ensuring that the area of grassland, wetland and forestry
    should be not less than the minimum requirements for green protection. (23) The
    detailed nomenclatures of parameters are shown in the Appendix A. The data of
    water demand, electricity generation and food production are derived from the
    website of CAwater (http://www.cawater-info.net) and statistical yearbook (UNRCCA,
    2020). The instream ecological water demands for Syr Darya River and the outflow
    into the Aral Sea are set based on published reports (Aktymbayeva et al., 2021,
    Zhai et al., 2021). According to literature investigation, average values of three
    widely-used GCMs outputs (i.e. CanESM2, CNRM-CM5 and MPI-ESM) from the website
    of NASA NEX-GDDP are calculated to minimize the uncertainty, and Hydrologiska
    Byrans Vattendelning (HBV) model are integrated to predict future upstream inflow
    under climate change from 2026 to 2050 (https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-gddp).
    The specific climatic and hydrological projection results from above models can
    be found in Zhai et al. (2021). The data related to infield irrigation modes and
    water conveyance coefficients are extracted from related literatures (Jalilov
    et al., 2018, Sun et al., 2020). Due to the inherent stochastic features in response
    to socioeconomic and climatic changes, statistical analysis is conducted to obtain
    the discretization values of water availability and conveyance efficiency with
    the normal distributions (Sun et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2019b). 4. Result analysis
    For analyzing the impacts of water-supply condition, irrigation mode and climate
    change on WAEN system, four p levels of violating water-supply constraints associated
    with stochastic water availabilities and conveyance coefficients, six irrigation
    schemes corresponding to six irrigation efficiency levels (abbreviated as S1 to
    S6 and shown in Table 1) are designed under two emission scenarios (i.e., RCP4.5
    and RCP8.5), leading to a total of 48 scenarios. Table 1. Scenario design. Scenario

    WAEN schemes in response to climate change Fig. 2 presents the results of marginal
    benefit and water allocation across 48 scenarios. Marginal benefits under RCP4.5
    would range from 1.53 $/m3 (p = 0.01, S1) to 1.63$/m3 (p = 0.20, S6), and those
    under RCP 8.5 would range from 1.57 $/m3 (p = 0.01, S1) to 1.63 $/m3 (p = 0.01,
    S6). The amounts of water allocation under RCP4.5 would fluctuate between 873.92 × 109
    m3 and 957.42 × 109 m3, and those under RCP8.5 would fluctuate between 767.52 × 109
    m3 and 941.20 × 109 m3. When p = 0.01, marginal benefits under RCP8.5 would be
    much higher than those under RCP4.5. The variation of optimal results is related
    to the temporal change of water availabilities under different climate scenarios.
    As shown in Table 1, the amounts of water availability under all climate scenarios
    would first increase and then decrease. Due to significant warming trend and snowmelt
    runoff under a high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water availability in RCP8.5
    would reach peak value around 2031–2035 (t = 2), which is earlier than RCP4.5.
    In addition, lower conveyance efficiency during t = 1 and t = 2 would result in
    larger water requirements. Compared with RCP4.5, higher available water resources
    in the initial stages of RCP8.5 can better alleviate the pressure of water supply
    under severe water scarcity (i.e., p = 0.01), and bring about higher marginal
    benefits with relaxed decision domain. Adaptive strategies should be conducted
    in response to climate change and the consequent variation of water availability
    in the future. Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Marginal benefits and system benefits under different
    scenarios. 4.2. The influence of system uncertainty and irrigation efficiency
    on WAEN Constraint-violation risk and irrigation efficiency levels (i.e., p and
    θ) exhibit notable influence on water allocation patterns and system efficiency.
    As shown in Fig. 2, marginal benefit would increase with p and θ levels. Different
    p levels are associated with varied system conditions (i.e., conveyance coefficient
    and water availability). An increased p level corresponds to a higher conveyance
    coefficient and higher water availability, leading to decreased strictness for
    the water-supply constraints and an increased system-failure risk. Besides, promoting
    irrigation efficiency would contribute to the increases in water-use efficiency
    and system benefit. In detail, agriculture would gain priority in water allocation
    with the enhanced irrigation efficiency, especially under the condition of severe
    water deficit. From S1 to S6, agricultural profit would arise by 11.87% under
    p = 0.01. System benefits from energy and ecology sectors would decrease by 19.14%
    and 0.67%, respectively. Spurred by the substantial improvements in irrigation
    modes, agriculture production would be expanded with the increased water allocation
    to cropland planting due to its high profit per unit water allocation. 4.3. Synergistic
    management of water, agriculture and energy 4.3.1. Water allocation schemes Fig.
    3 presents optimized water allocation in twelve states. Uzbekistan occupies 66.4–68.0%
    of water allocation across all scenarios. By 2050, water allocated to Uzbekistan
    would shrink by 4.35%, but would still rank in first place in all the regions.
    Water allocation to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan would both increase with p and θ
    levels. As p level decreases from 0.20 to 0.01, allocated water resources to Uzbekistan
    and Kazakhstan would decrease by 56.8 × 109 m3 and 23.2 × 109 m3, respectively.
    This can be down to the growing food demand and extensive irrigation area of the
    two countries, which can be further explained in Fig. 4. Water inflow to the Aral
    Sea (WAS) would highly depend on water availability under the impact of climate
    change. Under RCP8.5, inflows to the Aral Sea of different scenarios would reach
    the highest values during 2031–2035, ranging from 65.7 × 109 m3 (p = 0.01) to
    125.4 × 109 m3 (p = 0.20). When p = 0.01, WAS would decline by 15.0% and regional
    water use (i.e., water allocated to the agriculture, industry, domestic use and
    ecology across the twelve states) would increase by 6.6% when irrigation efficiency
    rises from S1 to S6. However, WAS and regional water allocation would respectively
    increase by 5.0% and 2.7% with rising irrigation efficiency under p = 0.20. Results
    disclose that regional water use would sacrifice the ecological flow of the Aral
    Sea under severe pressure of water supply, however, when the water stress is released,
    regional production and ecosystem protection can realize synergic growth, corresponding
    to the increases of WAS and regional water allocation. Download : Download high-res

    in four countries (109 m3). Fig. 4 illustrates water allocation patterns in four
    countries under different scenarios. From S1 to S6, water allocation to each country
    would increase in the following order: Kazakhstan (14.85%) > Uzbekistan (4.33%)
    > Kyrgyzstan (1.76%) > Turkmenistan (1.03%). The regional economy structure manifests
    a great impact on water allocation. Crop planting domains the economic production
    with the largest share of water use in Kazakhstan (i.e., accounting for 88.30%
    of total water consumption). When irrigation efficiency is enhanced, arable land
    in Kazakhstan would be more competitive in water allocation, especially for cash
    crop cultivation. Similar variation can be observed under different p levels.
    From p = 0.20 to 0.01, water allocation for each country would decrease in the
    following order: Kazakhstan (20.93%) > Uzbekistan (13.37%) > Kyrgyzstan (7.21%)
    > Turkmenistan (2.17%). Although Uzbekistan possesses the largest crop area across
    the river basin, the highest proportion of crop planting would bring about the
    highest water-saving potential in Kazakhstan. Under severe water shortage and
    poor conveyance condition, water allocation for Kazakhstan should be firstly constricted.
    Comparably, both p and θ levels have remarkable influences on water loss (including
    infield irrigation loss and conveyance loss). As shown in Fig. 4, from p = 0.20
    to 0.01, infield irrigation loss would decrease by 13.5% and conveyance loss would
    decrease by 13.8% due to the reduction of total water use. With the enhancement
    of irrigation efficiency, infield irrigation loss would decrease by 11.3% even
    under severe water scarcity (i.e., p = 0.01). Strategies related to quota management
    from demand side and water conservation during supply process should be more widely
    considered in the practices, such as irrigation mode advancement (e.g., promoting
    drip irrigation), and canal system improvement. 4.3.2. Agricultural cultivation
    and land allocation Fig. 5 displays the proportion of each water user under different
    periods. The water-use proportion of agriculture would decrease and that of energy
    sector would increase over time. From period 1 to period 5, agricultural water
    allocation would decline from 54.5% to 43.2%, and water allocation for energy
    generation would increase from 25.8% to 37.9% under S6 (p = 0.20). When irrigation
    efficiency is enhanced, agricultural and ecological water allocation would simultaneously
    increase. By 2050, livestock water allocation would increase from 13.7% (S1) to
    20.4% (S6) with the reduction of irrigation water. With the improvement of irrigation
    scheme, more water can be saved from crop planting, and livestock farming would
    be an effective choice of water allocation considering its high benefit and moderate
    water demand. From 0.20 to 0.01, agricultural and ecological water would slightly
    increase with the shrinkage of electric water allocation (i.e., declining from
    41.1% to 30.1% by 2050 under S1). Confronted with limited water supply conditions,
    water allocation for electricity generation would be squeezed for guaranteeing
    agricultural production and ecology requirement of the Syr Darya River basin.

    5. The proportion of each water-user under different periods. Fig. 6 presents
    land allocation in five periods under 48 scenarios. From t = 1 to t = 5, the area
    of cash crop, food crop, forage crop and grassland would averagely increase by
    9.4%, 45.4%, 53.9% and 13.8%, respectively. Cropland expansion exhibits a large
    relationship with water availability and conveyance efficiency, which would increase
    by 7.4 × 106 ha from p = 0.01 to 0.20. Climate change would also alter crop planting
    structure across the river basin. During 2026–2030, food crop irrigation would
    domain the water allocation for ensuring food security amid limited water resources.
    In period 1, the proportion of food crop under RCP4.5 would be averagely 70.1%
    and that of RCP8.5 would be 52.2% when p = 0.01. Compared with RCP8.5, water shortage
    of RCP4.5 would be more serious at the beginning of planning period (i.e., t = 1),
    rendering the lower shares of cash and forage crops. By 2050, food crop would
    no longer be the top priority for cultivation with a decreased share of 16.2%
    and cash crop would increase to 70.7%. The adjustment of planting structure would
    be conducive to combating water crisis under climate change. As typical water-intensive
    crops, cash crop (e.g., cotton and cucurbits) planting would highly depend on
    water-supply condition. Over the planning horizon, the total proportion of cash
    crop under RCP4.5 would be higher than RCP8.5 due to more water availability under
    low greenhouse gas emission. In detail, Kyzylorda and Narin (Kazakhstan) would
    be the two most sensitive states to varied system risks. From 0.20 to 0.01, the
    share of cash crop in Kyzylorda would reduce from 78.0% to 3.3%, which in Narin
    would decrease from 99.6% to 18.9%. Therefore, managers should take emphasis on
    adjusting the crop-planting structure in Kazakhstan, such as scaling back cash
    crop production in Kyzylorda and Narin under extreme water scarcity. Download

    Land allocation in twelve states under different scenarios. 4.3.3. Tradeoff between
    agricultural production and energy generation Fig. 7 shows the total amount of
    electricity generation would ascend from [26.4, 28.9] × 109 kWh in period 1 to
    [27.6, 86.2] × 109 kWh in period 5. The proportion of thermal power generation
    would decline by 22.4% over the planning horizon; however, it would seldom change
    with different scenarios. In contrast, increased water availability, conveyance
    efficiency and irrigation efficiency would stimulate hydropower generation. This
    is because thermal power would consume a larger amount of water resources with
    a lower unit water benefit compared with hydropower. When p = 0.01 and 0.10, hydropower
    generation would increase with enhanced irrigation efficiency, which presents
    an adverse change with θ level when p = 0.15 and 0.20. The competition between
    agriculture and energy generation would be intensified under optimistic water-supply
    conditions (i.e., p = 0.15 and 0.20). Such phenomenon illustrates a synergetic
    effect of different p and θ levels. From p = 0.01 to 0.20, hydropower generation
    amount would increase by 81.4 × 109 kWh under S1, and such variation would be
    34.7 × 109 kWh under S6. Although the relaxed water-supply constraint brings about
    an increase in water allocation to electricity, system tends to assign more water
    resources to crop cultivation with the advancement of irrigation scheme. As the
    main contributor to water consumption in energy sector, novel water-saving techniques
    and compulsory policies should be enacted for hydropower considering its sensitivity
    to the variations of water availability and conveyance levels. Download : Download

    generation amounts and water allocation. 5. Discussion 5.1. Sensitivity analysis
    The impacts of system risks, irrigation efficiency and climate change on water
    resources allocation have been examined. Compared with RCP8.5, marginal benefit
    under RCP4.5 exhibits a larger range of variation with different p and θ levels,
    resulting from more water availability under lower GHG emissions and warming trend.
    In detail, marginal benefit would increase by 6.33% with p level under S1 and
    arise by 0.63% with irrigation efficiency under p = 0.01. Results find that system
    risk associated with double-hand side constraints has more obvious effects on
    marginal benefit and water-use patterns than irrigation efficiency levels. Sensitivity
    analysis is performed to test the uncertainty in water availability (right-hand
    side) and conveyance efficiency (left-hand side) and their impacts on optimizing
    system efficiency and water use. Without considering left-hand-side random uncertainties,
    the DSFP model can be simplified to the right-hand-side stochastic fractional
    model (RSFP), where the random parameters in the left-hand sides of constraints
    were simplified into deterministic values. A left-hand-side stochastic fractional
    model (LSFP) can be also formulated by replacing determined water availability
    on the right-hand sides of constraints. As shown in Fig. 8, solutions from the
    RSFP model are more sensitive to the change of p level than the LSFP model. From
    p = 0.01 to 0.20, the water allocation from RSFP would increase by [95.8, 126.7]
    × 109 m3 and marginal benefit would rise by [0.026, 0.042] $/m3 under RCP4.5,
    which is much higher than that from the LSFP model. Such results indicate that
    water availability is the most sensitive factor that influences water allocation
    patterns compared with conveyance and irrigation efficiencies. Download : Download

    of DSFP, LSFP and RSBP models. 5.2. Comparison with conventional DSCP, LSFP and
    RSFP models When the managers lay more emphasis on maximizing economic benefits,
    the DSFP model can be converted into a double-sided stochastic linear programming
    (DSCP). As shown in Table 2, system benefit from DSCP would be higher than DSFP,
    however, it may consume a large amount of water resources and result in lower
    water-use efficiency. Under p = 0.20, compared with DSCP, 32.3% of total water
    allocation can be reduced by the DSFP model and marginal benefit can be improved
    by 3.4%. Higher water-use efficiency and water-saving potential of the DSFP model
    could facilitate managers to make the best use of limited water and further achieve
    sustainability. Besides, the DSFP model is an effective model to deal with random
    uncertainty compared with conventional chance-constrained models. As shown in
    Fig. 8, marginal benefit and water allocation from the double-sided model are
    slightly lower than those from the right-side model; more water resources would
    be allocated due to the looser water-supply constraints of the right-side model
    under all p levels. Planning water allocation with double-sided method makes the
    management alternatives more practicable and reliable. Besides, optimal objectives
    from the double-sided model show the largest variation with system risk because
    the sensitivities of both left- and right-hand side parameters can be involved
    in the double-sided model. Therefore, the double-sided programming method can
    better reflect the system complexity and handle system-violation risk with flexible
    solutions. Table 2. Results comparison of DSCP and DSFP under RCP4.5. Scenario

    results can help generate management strategies to address water crises under
    climate change and support sustainable development. First, the structure and area
    of agricultural crops in the basin should be optimized. Due to the dominant agricultural
    economy, over-cultivation of crops in Kazakhstan could aggravate water shortage
    of other countries or regions in the study basin. Future management strategies
    should focus on adjusting Kazakhstan’s crop structure, such as reducing cash crop
    production in Kyzylorda and Narin in the face of extreme water shortages. In addition,
    climate change can also affect the temporal and spatial changes of water resources,
    in the case of high GHG emissions and significant climate warming trend (i.e.
    RCP8.5), the allocation of water resources to cash crops should be reduced to
    ensure food security. Second, the transition of renewable energy is desired with
    a high generation efficiency and low resources intensity. As electricity becomes
    cleaner, policies to replace thermal power (e.g., the expansion of hydropower)
    can be implemented to ensure the security of energy supply in the study basin.
    In the case of severe water shortage, in order to ensure the agricultural production
    and ecological needs of the Syr River basin, water allocation to power generation
    would be squeezed. In order to alleviate the fierce competition for water resources,
    due to the sensitivity of hydropower to available water resources and delivery
    levels, the power system should adopt advanced water-saving technologies and mandatory
    water-limiting policies. Third, management strategies from both sides of water
    supply and demand should be conducive to synergetic growth of economy production
    and ecological restoration (e.g., increasing ecological flow into the Aral Sea).
    In practice, demand-side strategies related to quota management and water conservation
    should be considered more broadly, such as the promotion of irrigation patterns
    (e.g., drip irrigation) and the improvement of drainage systems. Market mechanisms
    oriented towards natural resources trading (e.g., water rights trading and green
    credit) can also be introduced, and cooperation between countries and regions
    can be strengthened to alleviate demand-side pressures from water shortage, power
    insufficiency and food crisis. 5.4. Limitation and extension DSFP-WAEN model has
    proven its effectiveness and applicability in planning WAEN system towards a collaborative
    way; it can also be extended to other efficiency-oriented management issues involving
    socioeconomic and climatic changes, especially for some arid regions. However,
    there are still several potential limitations that should be addressed in future
    research. For instance, this study simplified the hydrodynamic and chemical processes
    of irrigation based on general coefficients and empirical formulas due to insufficient
    data sources. As one of the most critical interactions between the crop cultivation
    and water, it is suggested that future research focus on the quality and quantity
    of water returned from farmlands. In addition, some crop growth simulation models
    (e.g., WOFOST and APSIM) can be combined with the optimization model for the precise
    simulation and estimation of growth cycle and process under various meteorological
    and hydrological conditions (Dewenam et al., 2021, Sarkar et al., 2023). Besides,
    for the real-world planning problem, the ambiguous and vague information would
    also lead to fuzzy and interval uncertainties, which is beyond the capacity of
    DSFP method (Nematian, 2023). Thus, the fuzzy programming methods and interval
    programming methods can be introduced to strength the robustness of the optimization
    method. 6. Conclusions A double-sided stochastic fractional (DSFP) method has
    been developed for supporting sustainable WAEN management under future climate
    change by integrating double-sided chance-constraint programming and fractional
    programming methods into a general framework. Then a novel DSFP based WAEN model
    has been formulated for planning water resources allocation in the Syr Darya River
    basin, where 48 scenarios are designed to analyze the impacts of global climate
    change, infield irrigation efficiency level and constraint-violation level over
    a long-term horizon (2026–2050). Several findings can be revealed: (i) Kazakhstan
    is the most sensitive country to the changed water-supply conditions (e.g., shrinking
    by 20.9% when p level decreases from 0.01 to 0.20), therefore water allocation
    to Kazakhstan should be firstly constricted under sever water shortage and poor
    conveyance condition; (ii) water inflow to the Aral Sea and regional water allocation
    would simultaneously ascend with rising θ levels (i.e., respectively increasing
    by 5.0% and 2.7%), implying that the improvement of irrigation efficiency can
    be conducive to realizing synergic development of regional production and ecosystem
    protection; (iii) considering the temporal variation of water resources in the
    future, cash crop should be primarily cut down under high GHG emissions scenario
    (RCP8.5) and, electricity generation would be restrained for guaranteeing agricultural
    production and ecology requirement under limited water supply. Therefore, it is
    recommended to promote advanced irrigation infrastructure to reduce conveyance
    and infield water losses, as well as propel the transition to clean energy with
    water-saving technologies, such as cooling water recirculation. Market trading
    mechanism of natural resources can be also introduced to strengthen the corporation
    among four countries on demand side, such as water rights and green credits. In
    comparisons with conventional chance-constrained programming methods and single-objective
    methods, the developed DSFP model has proven its superiorities in optimizing water-use
    efficiency and reflecting the system complexity with flexible solutions. In the
    future studies, some crop growth simulation models (e.g., WOFOST and APSIM) and
    uncertain analysis techniques (e.g., fuzzy programming and interval programming
    methods) can be integrated into the nexus model for the precise simulation of
    crop growth process, as well as enhance the applicability of optimization method
    in other environmental management problems. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    both in terms of quantity and quality, agricultural renewal is becoming more essential.
    Consequently, agricultural machine learning is required to increase production.
    The most important activity that farmers must complete is cultivating their fields.
    Agriculture must adhere to strict water resource usage guidelines. Precision irrigation
    locates and fulfils the irrigation needs of plants. Understanding the dynamics
    of soil humidity requires sophisticated models of soil–plant-atmosphere systems,
    which are complicated systems. In light of this, the objective of this article
    is to assess the recent modifications to growing-season characteristics that are
    significant to agriculture, such as the commencement of the growing season, the
    length of the growth period, and the region of the season’s maximal elevation.
    According to the season and region they wish to sow their seeds in, the suggested
    strategy helps farmers choose the right crops. Using support vector classifier
    and KNN classifier 99% and 97% experimental results of soil humidity deficit demonstrate
    that the recommended. We were able to differentiate the distinct influences of
    humidity based on the country or location at the start of the season, identifying
    both positive and negative trends globally. We investigated the association between
    the amount of food produced and the peak of the growing season in irrigated agriculture.
    The electrochemical sensors, which track changes in the soil, environment, and
    plant directly, impact plant growth. Soil moisture sensors were positioned at
    10, 20, and 35 cm depths to forecast the amount of water in the soil throughout
    a crop. This unique research and its promising results give a crucial contribution
    to the answer to the problem of anticipating and controlling groundwater for farmed

    review Article Open access 05 September 2022 1 Introduction Using crop growth
    stimulation, environment, management, and plant genetics influence crop development
    at the plot and field sizes. Depending on the intended purpose, simulation methodologies
    are more sophisticated and need more data to physically based crop development
    models quantify the factors that underlie crop development and growth (Thaler
    et al. 2018). Satellite data and ground segments continually collect data on cloud
    cover, wind speed, and temperature and collect real-time data. As a result, machine
    learning (ML) algorithms usually may leverage a wide range of data from diverse
    sources to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts. It’s possible to study and
    adequately anticipate various weather occurrences because of the large quantity
    of data that can be processed and the need for enhanced now casting methods. Meteorological
    data (radiometer, satellites, and atmospheric measurements) and geographical data
    are used in existing now casting algorithms to provide reliable forecasts. Climate
    and weather monitoring to dedicate, the satellite system is a kind of satellite
    Data is gathered by scanning Earth using radiometers carried by the weather satellites
    themselves. Unmetered agricultural water usage is unmetered globally, despite
    the significance of surveillance for crop management. Unmetered surface water
    abstractions account for roughly 30% of total surface water abstractions in the
    Murray–Darling Basin Commission’s latest report (Hanemann and Young 2020). Relative
    humidity, obtained from temperature and precipitation, has been discovered to
    impact insect population dynamics strongly. This is particularly true during the
    early phases of insect development. Some insects have reported quicker embryonic
    development and egg hatchability when relative humidity increases (Tamiru et al.
    2012). Although that may impair crops growth performance at both extremes of relative
    humidity, high humidity may induce crop death via drowning and pathogen infection.
    In contrast, low humidity can prevent plants from emerging due to water deficiency
    from moisture loss (Norhisham et al. 2013). To increase crop yields, farmers decide
    not to test their soil as a result. As a result, farmers still lack knowledge
    about meteorological variables like temperature and air relative humidity (RH),
    as well as the qualities of soil like porosity, type, and pesticide concentrations.
    Because of this, farmers apply varying amounts of irrigation and fertilizer in
    relation to the specific amounts needed for a given crop in a given soil and environmental
    situation. Applying fertilizer insufficiently can negatively impact crop yield
    and cause farmers to lose money (Awasthi and Reddy 2013). The issue of mass cancer
    is brought on by over fertilization, which contaminates ground water and affects
    several parts of Punjab state (Mittal 2013). some farmers may take soil samples
    to a lab for examination; however this sample will not accurately represent the
    soil of a big field spanning hundreds of hectares. Additionally, the characteristics
    of the soil fluctuate. As an outcome, soil measurements collected experimentally
    once are not reliable for long agricultural seasons. To accurately apply agricultural
    inputs, detailed spatial–temporal data from farm regions regarding soil and atmospheric
    conditions must be acquired on a regular basis (Fig. 1). Such data enables the
    accurate application of necessary crop inputs, such as herbicides or irrigation.
    Precision agriculture is the technique of precisely regulating agricultural demands
    with information and technology to maximize rewards for farmers (Kone et al. 2015).
    Fig. 1 Precision agriculture WSN Full size image Measuring the airspace inside
    the plant canopy is often used to create empirical disease models. Most weather
    sensors are placed above the top and outside the field when a model is predicting.
    The impacts of distant measurements within the canopy may be minor, but as the
    crop grows, they become more significant (Gumestad et al. 1995). According to
    research, the accuracy of the forecast for out-of-field substitutes degrades with
    a range from fields to meteorological data (Gillespie and Sutton 1979). While
    remote sensing may offer a solution to the problem under discussion (Fig. 2),
    it is not a cost-effective method, and the information gathered is regional in
    nature, not accurately reflecting local conditions (Seelan et al. 2023). Our goal
    was to estimate global agricultural output fluctuations using seasonal climate
    forecasts. An eco-physiological procedure growth and yield model was combined
    with a dynamic seasonal humidity model to forecast crop growth in worldwide areas
    (Table 1). Fig. 2 Temporal data for atmospheric and soil conditions Full size

    About 70% of Indians work in agriculture. The research (Gowda and Reddy 2020)
    focuses on estimating and predicting agricultural yields using historical data
    from the farmed area. Developing a forecasting model using machine learning methods
    considers several elements such as moisture, humidity, soil conditions, and other
    things. Decision Tree, Random Forest and Polynomial regression are utilised as
    machine learning methods. The system improves by mixing it with other sectors
    like cultivation, horticultural, etc. 2.1 Humidity sensors in PA Humidity is the
    measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. Relative humidity (RH%), which
    is the ratio of partial water vapour pressure to saturation vapour pressure, is
    the most often used indicator of atmospheric humidity. Relative humidity is influenced
    by the system of interest’s pressure and temperature. The probability of precipitation,
    dew, fog, and rain is indicated by humidity. Since most crops are particularly
    sensitive to these climatic conditions, precision agriculture significantly relies
    on accurate and highly sensitive relative humidity sensors (Pelegrí-Sebastia et
    al. 2012). Humidity sensors find significant applications in contemporary industries
    such as the pharmaceutical, paper, and printing sectors; museums; cold chain applications;
    and green house applications, among others. Humidity (RH) sensors have been incorporated
    by the majority of researchers in their precision agricultural studies. 2.2 Humidity
    sensor designs and modeling Three categories can be used to group electric Humidity
    sensors according to how they sense. There are three types of humidity sensors:
    thermal conductivity based, resistive, and capacitive. Two metallic resistors
    are used in thermo conductivity-based humidity sensors; one is shut off from the
    environment and the other is exposed to it. By using the same electrical biasing
    (Fig. 3), the resistors are heated (Fig. 4). The exposed resistor cools to a lower
    temperature as a result of the humidity in the surrounding air, and its thermal
    conductivity changes with humidity. Humidity is sensed using the signature created
    by the differential in thermal conductivity between two metal resistors (Ruiz-Garcia
    et al. 2009). Fig. 3 Block diagram of wireless sensor node Full size image Fig.
    4 Thermo conductivity–humidity sensors Full size image Thick and thin film conductors
    coated in polymers, such as nafion and polyvinyl alcohol, are used by resistive
    humidity sensors; the number of these conductors can be adjusted in response to
    the relative humidity of the environment (Fig. 4). Capacitive humidity sensors
    are essentially capacitors with electrodes printed on thin polyimide sheets. The
    lectric constant of polyimide thin films is influenced by humidity. The limitations
    of resistive and capacitive humidity sensors stem from their nonlinear transmission
    characteristics. An analog front end circuit and a subsequent signal processing
    circuit must be built in order to take nonlinear factors into consideration. In
    recent times, artificial neural networks have been used to linearize sensor features.
    Humidity thermo sensors exhibit long-term stability, low hysteresis, and linear
    response. However, because metal resistors must be heated to the proper temperature,
    they are not power-efficient. Capacitive humidity sensors are efficient in terms
    of power usage, sensitivity, and reaction time. However, the variation in the
    surrounding temperature negatively impacts their linearity. 2.3 Statistical techniques
    involvement Using the UST dataset of 10 years of field experiments over US states
    and Canadian provinces, (Pant et al. 2021) constructed a model that can forecast
    soybean production during the growing season. To predict crop production, proposing
    a system using LSTM and temporal attention, 30 weeks of meteorological data each
    year, and a simplified representation of the genotype to capture changes in various
    responses to environmental factors. That evaluated the efficiency of the suggested
    Temporal Attention mechanism to the layered LSTM model in two variants of each
    model’s input time step count. This study also examined LASSO regression, SVR-RBF,
    and the USDA’s latest model. The study (Soode et al. 2015) aims to maximise agricultural
    yield while decreasing the likelihood of incorrect crop selection. An ensemble
    model as learners was developed to bring forth harvesting for the site-distinct
    parameters, with naive bayes, random forest and KNN serving as learners. Future
    improvements to the research collection will be strengthened by an increase in
    the number of characteristics. Warm climates get more sun than cold regions. In
    warm temperatures, that may open field cropping all year if water is not a problem.
    So protected cropping hasn’t gotten much attention in the past. In recent years,
    authorities and farmers in dry and warm climate zones have begun investigating
    protective farming, and it is critical in hotter regions with unpredictable rainfall
    and significant water absorption. India’s agricultural industry uses a lot of
    water. Groundwater levels are declining, and climate change is causing changes.
    Many Indian states disagree on how to use river water for agricultural purposes.
    In order to combat water scarcity, smart farming uses sensors to track soil temperature,
    fertilizer content, water level, and weather predictions. The EDYN Garden sensor
    is another (Gupta 2016). 3 Proposed methodology Agriculture has always been the
    foundation of our nation. Conditions often change nowadays. So knowing the weather
    is challenging to develop crops. We need to employ technology to analyse crop
    data and advise farmers to establish crops properly (Fig. 5). The nutrient is
    also an essential role in crop growth. Considering just one or two factors while
    developing an appropriate prediction model may not be adequate. A wide range of
    data on elements such as humidity, temperature, rainfall, and other variables
    are gathered and evaluated. Input for the prediction model will come from this
    analysis. Fig. 5 Proposed work of crop prediction Full size image 3.1 Dataset
    collection This study relied only on publicly available data from the Government
    of India. Since 2011, this has been procured for use in the Kharif and Rabi seasons
    of agricultural productivity. This study will focus on a few characteristics that
    have the most significant influence on agricultural production from the first
    dataset. 3.2 KNN algorithm When it comes to machine learning (ML), the k-nearest
    neighbour (k-NN) approach is regarded as one of the best. Each feature in our
    training dataset is treated as different dimensions in a particular place. The
    values each observation has for this feature are taken as its coordinates in that
    dimensions, so we end up with a collection of spatial points. The distance between
    two points in this space uses to measure their similarity, as long as the metric
    is adequate. The data allocating to clusters is based on their proximity and the
    Euclidean distance between them. Even though the data in this cluster are diverse,
    they are also comparable. $${\\text{D}}\\left( {{\\text{X}},{\\text{Y}}} \\right)
    = \\sqrt {\\sum\\nolimits_{{{\\text{i}} = 1}}^{{\\text{N}}} {\\left( {{\\text{X}},{\\text{Y}}}
    \\right)^{2} } }$$ (1) The formula for euclidian distance shows in Eq. (1). It
    uses to figure out how far apart two points on a plane are from one another. As
    far as I can tell, there isn’t a learning phase with KNNs. A simple distance calculation
    determines which training rows are closest in the distance to the test set. The
    records are more comparable when set at a more relative distance. The lazy learner
    approach or analogy learning is a term for this method. Despite this, it is still
    regarded as the most efficient. Algorithm steps (1) To begin, open the data file.
    (2) Set the \"k\" value to zero. (3) This step should be repeated as many times
    as necessary to get the desired class. (4) Examine each training line''s distance
    from the test data, and then calculate the distance. The Euclidean distance chose
    using this method since it is the most common. Chebyshev, cosine, and other similar
    measures are among the options. (5) Calculate the distances between the two points
    and sort them in ascending order of increasing distance. (6) For each categorised
    row, get the top k rows. (7) Select the line with the most significant degree
    of continuity. (8) Returns the classes you expected. KNN may be used in various
    ways, including as a grouping tool like the one pictured above. 3.3 Support vector
    classifier This method is used in both regression and classification situations.
    It handles many categorical and continuous well. Using SVC, a class may be separated
    by a hyper plane in 3D space SVC iteratively builds an ideal hyper plane to reduce
    error. With SVC, the goal is to discover the optimal MMH to classify the data.
    Equations (2)–(5) provides an approximation of the classifier for linear and polynomial
    with forward current node. $${\\text{Linear}}\\;{\\text{Equation}} - {\\text{K}}({\\text{X}},{\\text{Y}})
    = {\\text{K}}({\\text{H}}_{{\\text{X}}} ,{\\text{H}}_{{\\text{Y}}} )$$ (2) $${\\text{Polynomial}}\\;{\\text{Equation}}

    experiment number of iteration respectively. 3.4 Optimization of hyper-parameter
    Data pipelines often include tasks like hyper parameter tweaking and cross-validation,
    two of the most common. Specific information and understanding are required to
    create a project for the hyper-parameters, usually obtained through the investigation
    process. To achieve better accuracy in a model, parameter tuning picks values
    for a parameter that are more accurate than the default value. In examining the
    various kernel, the following criteria are taken into consideration. Algorithm
    steps 1. The normalization of data 2. Train and test data are splitted 3. Hyper-parameter
    tuning is initialized 4. Test and Train data model is operation by hyper-parameter
    tuning 5. Optimization of model is analyzed, if it’s not optimized step 4 is processed
    6. The forecasting model for crop production 7. Output is predicted for this anticipated
    model 3.5 K-NN and SVC modeling for crop yield prediction Using the K-NN and SVC
    approach for agricultural production prediction, this paper surveys the field’s
    current knowledge. To predict an unknown parameter from known values, K-NN and
    SVC analysis is employed. The input parameters studied in this study include temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture and rainfall, which are the primary characteristics for
    a decent crop yield. Still, several more aspects may be considered (Gowda and
    Reddy 2020). A prediction for an unknown crop yield may be made using the closest
    measured values of both the nearest neighbours by calculating the Euclidean distance
    between them and the unknown crop yield. 3.6 Data pre-processing and feature selection
    Pre-processing is required after selecting the dataset. Formatting, cleaning,
    and sampling are among the stages. Initially, the data is formatted to suit your
    needs. Cleaning data is removing or repairing jumbled data. A tiny random sample
    of the chosen data may be explored considerably quicker than the whole dataset.
    The last stage is converting the data that was picked. Various engineering aspects,
    such as scaling, feature aggregation, and so on, are used to turn the preprocessed
    data into data suited for machine learning algorithms. Several features are consolidated
    into a feature that is much more relevant to the issue you are attempting to address
    the confusion matrix (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 Confusion matrix for remote sensing and
    soil data Full size image 4 Results and discussion It was necessary to conduct
    this experiment to learn how the KNN algorithm works and how this can use it to
    estimate yields based on three different inputs. The following is a list of the
    input data Tamil Nadu (India’s) province. Alkaline, sandy, chalky and clay: 1395
    cents per acre. Millet was predicted as a possible crop by the algorithm with
    97% accuracy. They found laterite soil in Salem’s district, and an area of 1395
    cents was granted for testing. The method anticipated that the region would have
    a laterite soil type (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 a and b Model accuracy and loss for KNN
    and SVC Full size image This paper compares the accuracy, execution time (in seconds)
    and Accuracy scores of KNN and SVC algorithms, which are implemented in Python.
    In a classification report, the accuracy of predictions is assessed. The Precision
    is a classifier’s ability to not misclassify a negative instance as a positive
    one in Fig. 8a and b. Fig. 8 a and b Model accuracy and Loss for KNN and SVC Full
    size image 5 Comparison chart For scientific and statistical analysis (Gümüşçü
    et al. 2019), such variables are documented. It’s possible to anticipate agricultural
    production using data mining methods from various places. They expect wheat, jute,
    T-Aman, and mustard yields in this research. We had to spend six years gathering
    information on the medium- and high-land soil properties in different Bangladeshi
    sub districts. We used several data mining methods to conduct our research. Reduce
    the amount of features using a genetic approach, and eliminate (Afrin et al. 2018)
    excessively high processing time caused by the high dimension of the data set
    to increase estimation performance. Take into account environmental factors like
    temperature and soil nitrogen levels while developing and cultivating crop plans
    using energy estimation to achieve greater yield efficiency and resource conservation
    (Sakthipriya and Naresh 2022). In comparison to current models in a variety of
    domains, the experimental results of soil nutrient of humidity, temperature, and
    97% and 98% show that the proposed method may be used to automatically find the
    most efficient KNN and SVC model. For the estimations performed using both components
    and the parts selected with a genetic algorithm, the highest accuracies were obtained
    using the method with classification. Overall, the results showed that wheat planting
    dates could be determined successfully from climate information obtained in the
    first 300 days with the help of machine learning techniques combined with feature
    selection using genetic algorithm, which will prevent low productivity, financial
    and labor loss as a result of inaccurate planting date (Table 2 and Fig. 9). Table

    more to explore as new algorithms and methodologies emerge in the future. In our
    paper, we manage crops. We intend to publish additional articles on certain States
    and encourage more scholars to pursue study in agriculture since it is the primary
    source of food in India. It provides 60% of the GDP. However, since 2022, its
    per capita water supply has decreased, causing several crop losses. There are
    also several farmer suicides throughout India, who work extremely hard yet do
    not get the desired outcomes owing to various causes. This document is a minor
    contribution to the agricultural industry, devoted to all farmers, to assist them
    profit from a new technology they are unaware it. Finally, as engineers, we must
    assume responsibility and contribute to the advancement of our community or nation.
    By using ambient, pH, and soil moisture sensors, crop prediction accuracy can
    be increased. This might suggest an appropriate crop based on the location’s market
    needs and neighboring farmers. Availability of data and materials The dataset

    Climate-induced declines in snowpack storage have profound consequences for snowmelt-dependent
    river basins in arid and semi-arid areas globally, including those in the western
    United States (US) (Dettinger et al., 2015, Hale et al., 2023). These river basins
    face the risk of economic losses in agriculture and environmental damage when
    climate change induces disruptions in snowmelt-derived streamflow (Sturm et al.,
    2017, Viviroli et al., 2020). Climate water stress is projected to exert considerable
    economic losses to relatively lower-valued irrigated agriculture in the western
    US (Brown et al., 2019). Classic strategies to mitigate these potential economic
    losses to agriculture include building new reservoirs or expanding existing ones,
    increasing groundwater use, and removing minimum instream flows (Brown et al.,
    2019). However, over the decades, upstream overexploitation of water resources
    in snow-fed endorheic basins has resulted in groundwater depletion and degraded
    terminal lakes with very little to no opportunities to develop new or expand existing
    reservoir capacity. Well-known examples of these basins include the Aral Sea Basin
    in Central Asia (Varis, 2014), the Heihe River Basin and the Tarim River Basin
    in Northwestern China (Bao et al., 2017, Li et al., 2021, Zheng et al., 2020),
    the Great Salt Lake Watershed, and the Walker River Basin (WRB) in the western
    US (Davies and Naranjo, 2022, Wurtsbaugh and Sima, 2022). The WRB (Fig. 1a) has
    received considerable attention in the literature and policy debates due to heightened
    competition for water between Nevada’s important agricultural valleys and the
    basin’s terminus lake – Walker Lake (Davies and Naranjo, 2022, Niswonger et al.,
    2014, Tracy, 2004). For decades, upstream agricultural diversions and groundwater
    pumping have affected the basin’s hydrologic regime (Davies and Naranjo, 2022,
    Lopes and Allander, 2009, Niswonger et al., 2014). Consequently, Walker Lake has
    lost 50 % of its surface area, and 90 % of its volume with lake salinity levels
    elevated by more than 400 % since 1868 (Niswonger et al., 2014, WBC, 2020). The
    basin is heavily reliant on unsustainable ground pumping – pumping rates exceeding
    recharge rates (Carroll et al., 2016, Davies and Naranjo, 2022, NDWR, 2022) with
    concomitant increased flow losses and reduced deliveries prompting the Nevada
    Division of Water Resources (NDWR) consideration of policies to restrict groundwater
    pumping (NDWR, 2022). Download : Download high-res image (466KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. (a) Map of Walker River Basin and Figure 1b: Walker River
    Basin Schematic. The prior appropriation doctrine governs water allocation in
    the basin where the first user that puts water to beneficial use obtains the decree
    amount and the highest priority right to that water(Sharpe et al., 2008) and there
    are arrangements such as temporary storage water rights and permanent decree natural
    flow rights transfers (Koebele et al., 2022, Richter et al., 2020). In the absence
    of competitive water markets, farmers with junior water rights may not get to
    exercise their rights in times of shortages and may adapt to the shortages either
    by growing a less economical, drought-resistant mix of crops or going out of business
    (Cobourn et al., 2022). One study shows that only 84 % of agricultural water rights
    in the Walker Basin can be satisfied during an average snowpack year(Sharpe et
    al., 2008); enough water for full agricultural water rights allocation in the
    basin can be achieved in a year of at least 130 % of normal snowpack (Borgen et
    al., 2014, Sharpe et al., 2008, Tracy, 2004). Another study found that during
    the period 1981–2010, only 64 % of water demands in the basin were satisfied (Camp,
    2013). For many years, not enough water has been available for simultaneous deliveries
    to irrigated agriculture and Walker Lake to maintain lake levels (Davies and Naranjo,
    2022, Niswonger et al., 2014, Sharpe et al., 2008). Numerous studies have provided
    insights into the importance of hydrologic and policy options for water management
    improvements for snow-fed endorheic basins. However, very few studies (Li et al.,
    2021, Zheng et al., 2020) have employed integrated frameworks to provide insights
    into efficient and sustainable water management policies in the face of climate
    change. In the WRB for example, some works have examined the importance of cloud
    seeding (Boyle et al., 2015), water markets (Koebele et al., 2022), crop shifting
    (Curtis et al., 2010), and integrated hydrologic modeling (Boisramé and Carroll,
    2023, Borgen et al., 2014, Niswonger et al., 2014). Others have analyzed the impact
    of environmental water purchases on instream flow quality and protection (Borgen
    et al., 2014, Elmore et al., 2016, Kendy et al., 2018, Null et al., 2017). However,
    these works typically lack the economic analysis and information that could inform
    policy debates on climate adaptation measures. Recent climate-induced snowmelt-driven
    streamflow variability in the WRB has renewed the interests of managers of the
    Walker River Irrigation District (WRID) in expanding existing reservoir capacity
    or adding small off-stream regulatory reservoirs to the system (WRID, 2018a, WRID,
    2018). Important policy analytic questions remain unresolved. • Basin-level impact
    of reservoir storage upgrade is ambiguous and depends on several factors such
    as costs, location, time, operation decisions, water allocation rules, and hydrologic
    regimes (Gonzalez et al., 2020, Maas et al., 2017, Nover et al., 2019, Ward, 2022).
    What is the basin-scale impact of reservoir storage upgrade on the economic value
    of irrigation water use in the WRB under changing snowmelt-driven inflows? • How
    would the impact of reservoir capacity upgrade on the economic value of irrigation
    water use change with potential groundwater pumping restrictions and instream
    flow requirements? To address these questions, this work formulates and presents
    results of a calibrated integrated hydro-economic framework for which optimized
    baseline results reflect historically observed and estimated data on surface water
    deliveries, gauged river flows, groundwater table depth, aquifer recharge, pumping,
    crop water application, consumptive use patterns, and associated economic values
    for irrigators at various locations in the WRB. The calibrated model permits the
    assessment and discovery of efficient water use and allocation patterns for adapting
    to a predicted future shifted and reduced snowmelt-driven inflows at the basin’s
    headwaters (Pohll and Garner, 2018) under alternative combinations of a range
    of surface reservoir storage levels subject to a set of groundwater pumping, Tribal,
    and terminal lake inflow constraints. Given that water management changes could
    be costly or politically difficult to do, this work examines a mix of policy options
    that water managers could apply when confronted with shifts in streamflow timing
    and volume reduction based on stakeholder-suggested scenarios. Conducting such
    policy experiments can bring out valuable information on the distribution and
    size of gains and losses produced by the proposed policy changes and shape future
    policy debates. This work quantitatively analyzes the potential gains and losses
    from changes in storage policy designs subject to the various constraints on irrigation
    water availability in a free water leasing market. Our approach considers only
    a suite of surface storage policies that have the potential to alter the relationship
    between upstream snowmelt-driven river inflows and water deliveries for farmers
    subject to constraints on groundwater pumping, the Walker River Paiute Tribe (WRPT)
    water rights as well as water rights for instream flows to the basin’s terminus
    lake. We formulated our model for a single growing season and ran it with a monthly
    time step to investigate the role of storage capacity in coping with streamflow
    changes within a year. Our work abstracts from the impact of end-of-year carryover
    storage because stored water rights holders are not required to leave any water
    in storage at the end of the irrigation season to benefit the common pool for
    the next year (California Water Resources Control Board, 2014). Historical data
    show that, on average, total storage starts at the beginning of the irrigation
    season at 49 % and 16 % of total capacity in wet and dry years, respectively.
    However, wet years have occurred only 25 % of the time since 2000 (U.S. Geological
    Survey, 2023). The costs of storage capacity upgrades are also not considered
    in our analysis since we are considering a long-term “average year”, and the costs
    would be spread for taxpayers over several years. The dynamic impacts of long-term
    groundwater pumping on future surface flows are also not considered. Our model
    is limited to the search for a policy mix to mitigate irrigation water shortages
    that could occur from changing snowmelt-derived headwater inflows, not comprehensively
    treating climate change impacts such as high crop water demand (ET) and increased
    reservoir evaporation. 2. Method of analysis 2.1. Study area Covering approximately
    4,270 square miles, about 75 % of the basin area is in Nevada while 25 % lies
    in California (Fig. 1a). Basin headwaters originate as snowmelt from the Sierra
    Nevada and enter Nevada from the West Walker River, flowing through Smith Valley
    and the East Walker River coming from the East Walker Valley (Kendy et al., 2018).
    The confluence of both tributaries occurs in Mason Valley before the mainstem
    flows northeasterly and turns south transiting the Walker River Paiute Indian
    Reservation (WRPIR) before terminating into Walker Lake (Niswonger et al., 2014).
    Rain dominates precipitation in the lower elevations in the eastern parts while
    most of the annual precipitation at higher elevations in the western parts, closer
    to the crest of the central Sierra Nevada, falls as snow in the winter months.
    Average annual basin-wide precipitation ranges from eight inches in the eastern
    portions to over 40 in. in the mountainous western areas (Tracy, 2004). The seasonal
    cycle of precipitation governs streamflow patterns with flows peaking in late
    spring from snowmelt (Boyle et al., 2015, Pohll and Garner, 2018). Basin river
    flows and groundwater are hydraulically connected (Allander et al., 2014, Carroll
    et al., 2016) with long-term increased groundwater pumping increasing surface
    flow losses and reducing surface flow deliveries which also induces increased
    pumping in a circular cumulative causation fashion (NDWR, 2022). As a snow-fed
    endorheic basin, water leaves the basin through open water evaporation and riparian
    plant and irrigated crop evapotranspiration (ET). The largest consumptive use
    in the Nevada part of the basin is irrigated agriculture. The two main irrigated
    regions of the WRID are in the Smith and Mason Valleys which are served by the
    Topaz Lake and the Bridgeport reservoir constructed in the 1920 s and the WRPIR
    served by the Weber reservoir, completed in 1935 (Fig. 1b). Several off-stream
    irrigation demand nodes within ditch service areas, river pump areas, and primary
    groundwater pumping-only areas make up the WRID. Ditch service areas are treated
    as water use areas in our model since each farmer within a ditch area shares in
    water rights appurtenant to the irrigated lands (decree surface water or primary
    groundwater) as a group with appurtenant supplemental groundwater rights and ancillary
    storage and flood water rights. Water rights in the WRB are allocated based on
    the doctrine of prior appropriation with arrangements for permanent decree water
    rights and temporary storage water rights transfers (Koebele et al., 2022, Richter
    et al., 2020). Administratively, in the WRID, the Federal Water Master allocates
    available decree natural surface water (flows not supported by upstream reservoir
    storage) based on seniority by priority date (“first in time, first in right”)
    (Koebele et al., 2022). Decree water rights are appurtenant to irrigated lands
    and most senior right holders get to exercise their rights first before recent
    right holders. Storage water rights are rights to use water stored in reservoirs
    and reservoirs can store water if decree natural flow rights are set full - no
    unmet demand for decree water while flood water rights are rights to use excess
    natural river flow when there are no unmet decree water rights (WRID, 2018b).
    Storage and flood water rights are allocated by the WRID for supplemental use
    on irrigated lands with appurtenant decree water rights. Groundwater rights are
    allocated by the Nevada State Engineer’s Office and are of two types - primary
    and supplemental. Holders of primary groundwater rights apply water to the land
    to which the rights are appurtenant and do not receive surface water. Supplemental
    groundwater rights holders can pump groundwater to either supplement irrigated
    lands with appurtenant decree water rights with storage and flood flows rights
    or irrigated lands with appurtenant primary groundwater rights, but the combination
    of all water rights sources – surface water (decree, storage, flood) and groundwater
    (primary, and supplemental) cannot exceed 4.0 acre-feet per acre annually (NDWR,
    2022). The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) maintains and operates the WRPIR irrigation
    system to support the agricultural activities of the WRPT, the most senior water
    rights holder (Allander et al., 2014). Decades-long upstream in-basin water diversion
    and use as well as groundwater pumping have culminated in a critical environmental
    threshold for Walker Lake. The Walker Basin Conservancy (WBC), a nonprofit organization,
    was established in 2015 to administer the Walker Basin Restoration Program, a
    program established by the US Congress in 2009, aimed at protecting agricultural,
    habitat, and environmental interests in the Walker Basin while restoring and maintaining
    Walker Lake (WBC, 2023). The WBC has currently acquired approximately 53 % of
    the water necessary to restore the Lake to the target level and has stewardship
    of 15,000 acres of previously agricultural land. The WBC is poised to continue
    to work with willing sellers to acquire sufficient water to reach its restoration
    goal of 50,000 acre-feet per year of increased inflows into Walker Lake (WBC,
    2023). 2.2. Data The foundation of this work’s integrated analysis depended on
    hydrologic and economic data obtained from several sources. Monthly gauged headwater
    inflows and streamflow as well as reservoir volume data for the year 2011 were
    sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Aquifer storage capacity,
    starting storage and average depth, plan view area, and porosity data were obtained
    from various sources (Carroll et al., 2010, Sharpe et al., 2008). Historical surface
    water diversions were obtained from the WRID (as described in Collopy and Thomas
    (2016)). The irrigation water requirement for each crop was obtained from Huntington
    and Allen (2010). They estimated this demand based on potential evapotranspiration
    for each crop while accounting for monthly precipitation and soil moisture. The
    total applied water needed at each field was calculated using an assumed irrigation
    efficiency of 0.53 for Mason Valley and 0.65 for Smith Valley. Based on these
    observed diversions and estimated applied water requirements, historical groundwater
    pumping volumes were calculated by assuming that any shortages in applied water
    requirements were met by pumping groundwater, up to the legal limit of 4 acre-feet/acre/year.
    Applied water above the amount needed for evapotranspiration was then partitioned
    into return flows (35 %) and seepage to the aquifer. These irrigation efficiency
    and runoff/seepage proportions were determined during the calibration of a water
    allocation model for the Walker River Basin described in Collopy and Thomas (2016)
    to best match observed streamflow and surface water diversions. Irrigated land,
    reservoir evaporation, and precipitation fluxes were sourced from Boyle et al.
    (2013). Economic data on crop yield, non-water production costs, and crop output
    prices were gathered from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA-NASS,
    2012) and Northwestern Nevada crop production and return studies. The marginal
    cost per unit depth per volume groundwater pumped estimates were obtained from
    Jon Lee of pump check. Table 1 presents the most relevant estimated data on various
    historical water sources for agricultural production by hydrographic region –
    historical surface diversion from decree natural flow and storage and flood flows,
    groundwater pumping from primary and supplemental sources, and crop water application
    in the basin. The table also shows irrigated land in production, crop water use,
    and associated total net farm income by region and crop category. The net farm
    income was estimated based on crop water requirement, acreage in production, crop
    prices, crop yields, and cost of production (water and non-water costs) (see Section
    3 of the Supplementary Information (SI) for crop-specific parameters). Table 1.

    with associated seasonal crop ET of about 177,060 acre-feet generating a total
    net farm income of about $51.858 million from all producers in the entire basin.
    The WRID had more than 97 % of the basin’s crop ET, producing 96 % of total basin
    acreage with 98 % of total basin net income. Mason Valley is the most important
    agroeconomic region in the basin producing about 64 % of total basin crop acreage
    and 84 % of total net income with about 64 % of total basin-wide crop water use.
    Table 1 shows most of the groundwater pumping and surface water diversion occurred
    in Mason Valley. Mason Valley depended on water from all sources - decree natural
    surface flow, storage, flood, primary and supplemental groundwater pumping – almost
    80 % of surface water came from natural flow while supplemental groundwater pumping
    constituted 80 % of groundwater sources. Smith Valley is the second highest water
    user in the basin whose water also comes from all sources. The WRPIR is the lowest
    water user in the basin with a water right of streamflow of about 9,370 acre-feet
    to irrigate 2,100 acres. Crops irrigated in the basin in 2011 are grouped into
    alfalfa hay, field crops (grain, corn, and oats), other hay crops (including grass,
    pasture, and other forage), and vegetables (including onions, lettuce, garlic,
    and wine grapes). Alfalfa hay accounted for more than half of the area of crops
    grown and most of the water used (70 %), followed by other hay crops (23 % water
    used), field crops, and vegetables at the time of cropland survey in all the basin’s
    hydrographic regions. Vegetable crops were grown in only Mason Valley. 2.3. Hydrology
    A hydrologic mass balance principle is enforced in a complex network flow model
    for river flows, levels of surface reservoirs, and aquifers. Based on this principle,
    water is represented as stocks and flow nodes (locations in the watershed at which
    water''s demand or supply is affected). Stocks tracked by the model are the reservoir
    and aquifer storage levels. Flows tracked are headwater inflows, river gauged
    flows, surface water diversions, reservoir releases, groundwater pumping, crop
    water applications, crop consumptive use, and return flows to rivers and aquifers.
    The model simulates the water routing processes through the hydrologic system
    from changes in headwater inflows at each monthly time step. A simple coarse-scale
    basin model that optimizes all major water uses, sources, and sinks by maximizing
    basin-level net farm income is developed and applied. Section 1a of the SI shows
    a detailed description of the formulation of the hydrologic component of our model.
    2.4. Snowmelt-driven headwater inflows Snow contributes about 83 % of mean annual
    precipitation into the WRB, thus the basin’s stream flows for agricultural production
    are primarily driven by snowmelt (Collopy and Thomas, 2016, Tracy, 2004). Pohll
    and Garner (2018) have applied the Thornthwaite water balance model (WBM) (McCabe
    and Markstrom, 2007) to assess the climate change impact on streamflow in the
    Walker River Basin. They simulated the runoff response of the WBM to future precipitation
    and temperature from the NCAR Community Climate System Model Version 4 (CCSM4)
    – IPCC Scenario 20C3M + RCP 8.5 to produce an alternative streamflow scenario
    called the Delta scenario compared to a Baseline scenario based on historical
    Parameter elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) precipitation
    and temperature. They found that climate change would shift runoff earlier in
    the spring at both headwater inflow locations in the Walker River Basin with a
    more pronounced effect on the inflows into the Bridgeport Reservoir on the East
    Walker River with noticeably reduced peak flow occurring one month earlier in
    the year due to temperature warming. The peak flow at the Coleville gauge (which
    measures inflows from the West Walker River) will shift earlier but not change
    significantly due to higher elevations in the West Walker watershed making it
    less susceptible to temperature-induced precipitation phase changes. We generated
    an alternative river headwater inflow scenario based on the Pohll and Garner (2018)
    Delta scenario and another scenario Drought (persistent drought) assuming an “average”
    water year in the future where the timing and quantity of snowmelt runoff have
    changed due to climate change. The Drought scenario is based on the historical
    and future multi-year period of scanty snowmelt-driven runoff due to climate change.
    Historical inflow data shows that drought in the WRB could be quite severe with
    observed inflows to the West and East Walker Rivers declining by 70–77 % and 77–82
    % of observed 2011 inflows, respectively, in recent drought spells 2007, 2012–2015
    and 2020–2022 (NDWR, 2022). An index, that changes the monthly distribution of
    inflows, is created and multiplied by the observed 2011 inflow to generate the
    Delta scenario (representing a future wet year but earlier snowmelt-driven flow
    timing) while maintaining the total annual observed inflow volumes. The Drought
    scenario (representing a future dry year – significantly reduced inflow volumes)
    is generated as the Delta inflow reduced by 50 % for the West Walker and 55 %
    for the East Walker River inflows. Figures showing the different inflows by scenario
    can be found in Section 2 of the SI. 2.5. Model calibration The holistic hydro-economic
    model developed for this work typically requires special calibration to generate
    predicted optimized behavior that is consistent with actual observed water users’
    behavior. Both the hydrologic and economic components are calibrated and solved
    simultaneously in one integrated framework, with endogenous relationships. The
    hydrologic component was calibrated by adjusting model parameters so that optimized
    hydrologic variables such as monthly river inflow, gauged flows, reservoir storage
    levels and releases, river water diverted and groundwater pumped, crop water application,
    consumptive use, and return flows under the baseline scenario are broadly consistent
    with observed monthly river inflow, gauged flows, reservoir storage levels and
    releases data, as well as estimated diverted river water and groundwater pumped,
    crop water application, consumptive use, and return flows data. In the calibration
    process, we introduced slack variables representing unmeasured water sources or
    uses representing evaporation from open water surfaces, groundwater discharge,
    and percolation not measured with stream gauges and other use nodes excluded from
    our model to balance demand and supply at each stream gauge node. Section 1.5.2
    under Section 1a and Appendix Figure 4 of Section 2 of the SI show detailed information
    on the hydrologic calibration where actual gauged flow matches optimized baseline
    gauged flows compared to two other alternative gauged flows due to space limitations.
    The economic component of our model was calibrated using the Positive Mathematical
    Programming (PMP) method originally developed in 1995 by (Howitt, 1995). The PMP
    method is a policy-oriented modeling approach that deals with the uncertainty
    of potential divergence between predictions of economically optimized behavior
    based on crop water production or cost functions and actual water users’ behavior
    (Ward, 2021). We built an optimization model for which historically observed privately
    optimized water use behavior is utilized to infer the underlying parameters of
    crop water production function so that the solution of our optimization model
    for the baseline conditions replicates historical conditions. We then predict
    future water use behavior under a range of potential future policies as against
    current policies. Following Dagnino and Ward (2012), our PMP approach assumes
    that farmers allocate water and land to maximize their net income subject to water
    and land constraints, and thus historically observed water use by crop and cropland,
    are solutions to the net income maximizing problem under the baseline scenario.
    The PMP method develops a system of optimality conditions essential to our objective
    function by fixing land and water allocation at their historical levels of allocation
    and solves the system optimality conditions for the parameters of the model. It
    finds a response surface (the net income function) in essence that is optimum
    (highest) at the historical levels of land and water allocation observed. It provides
    a means of accounting for unobserved sources of nonlinearity such as unobserved
    agronomic or socio-economic constraints or heterogeneity in land quality that
    could account for the divergence between average and marginal conditions in the
    optimization problem. In our PMP implementation, we used the first-order necessary
    conditions (Intriligator, 2002) for maximization of net farm income to estimate
    the parameters of a crop-water production function that shows falling crop yields
    with increased cropland based on the Ricardian rent principle. We used a fixed
    water use per unit land to estimate the crop yield Y(use,c,k) for each water-use
    region (use), crop (c), and irrigation technology (k) in equation (1) as: (1)
    where α(use, c, k) and β(use, c, k) are estimated as described in Section 1b of
    the SI. Total seasonal crop irrigation water use for a given crop in production
    equals the irrigation water requirement per acre for that crop (for full irrigation)
    multiplied by the amount of acreage in the production (L(use,c,k). Given fixed
    crop irrigation water use per acre, changes in total water use imply changes in
    acreage in production assuming fixed irrigation technology or no regulated deficit
    irrigation. Several studies have assumed a fixed water requirement per unit land
    for optimization modeling at the basin scale (Baah-Kumi et al., 2022, Baccour
    et al., 2022, Dagnino and Ward, 2012, Ghosh et al., 2014, Kahil et al., 2016,
    Ward, 2023). Competing uses of water create economic value, which is measured
    by the water users’ willingness to pay. In our model, economic value comes from
    the uses from which the basin’s water is put to sustain crop production and farmers’
    income. For a profit-maximizing irrigating farmer, the contribution of water to
    the farmer’s net income measures the economic value of water. Net income per acre
    (πʹ(use,c,k)), expressed in equation (2), is crop yield (production per acre)
    multiplied by crop prices Pc(use) (selling amount received by farmers from commercial
    crop sales) minus production cost per acre (both water per acre (Pw(use)w(use,c,k))
    and non-water cost per acre (C(use,c,k)), where Pw(use) is water price per acre-feet
    and w(use,c,k) is water requirement per acre. (2) Total net farm income, which
    equals net income per acre multiplied by crop acreage in production(the decision
    variable of our income maximization problem) summed over crops, irrigation technologies,
    and use regions. The optimization problem is set at the irrigation district scale,
    subject to a set of constraints (technical, resource, environmental, and institutional).
    Our model solves the farm net income maximization problem given below: (3) Subject
    to (4) (5) (6) where NFI is net farm income, TW is total water available, and
    TL is total land in production. Eqs. (4), (5) represent water and land constraints,
    indicating water and land available. The non-negativity constraint on land, which
    can become binding as water availability falls adequately below historical levels
    is represented in Equation (6). Cropland is not binding under baseline conditions.
    Water constraints are all constraints, be it hydrological, technical, institutional,
    and environmental interests that limit crop water application and consumptive
    use. One important institutional allocation constraint in the Walker River system
    is the respect of the most senior water rights of the WRPT on the WRPIR, who are
    at the most downstream of the basin by ensuring a minimum streamflow of 26.25
    ft3/s (about 9,370 acre-feet per year) into the WRPIR to irrigate about 2,100
    acres. Another critical constraint that could shut down a significant share of
    agroeconomic activities in the upstream irrigation areas in the WRID is the environmental
    instream flow acquisition of river flows into Walker Lake by the Walker Basin
    Conservancy (WBC, 2023). In the absence of ecological response functions to water
    flows and the economic valuation studies to specify economic benefit function
    for flows into Walker Lake, a useful alternative is to represent the environmental
    purpose of the lake water inflows by minimum environmental flow requirements (Crespo
    et al., 2019, Ward, 2021). A constraint of minimum flow, based on historically
    observed gauged inflows into the Lake, is set at the most downstream gauge - the
    mouth of Walker Lake (at the USGS gauge no. 1032025). PMP’s versatility and desirability
    as a calibration method for farm income-maximization behavior lie in its ability
    to predict behavioral outcomes that map smoothly from water policy space to farm
    behavioral response space. Substituting information on the parameters of the yield
    function into the net income function makes it quadratic and the maximization
    of that quadratic objective function subject to no constraints produces farm behavioral
    results that reproduce observed crop yield, acreage, water use, and net income.
    Our model calculates a range of yield under a range of net income maximizations
    that would occur under a range of counterfactual future hydrologic scenarios and
    water policies. Several works have used this PMP calibration method for assessing
    climate adaptation policies for irrigated agriculture (Baah-Kumi et al., 2022,
    Baccour et al., 2022, Lauffenburger et al., 2022, Rodríguez-Flores et al., 2019,
    Ward, 2023). The PMP method shows that based on crop acreage in production, yield
    and given fixed water use per acre, net farm income depends on total seasonal
    water use and farmers maximize net income by expanding irrigation water applied
    and use to the point where the value of the marginal product of one more acre-foot
    water used equals water price per that acre-foot. Our model captures two ways
    in which farmers can adapt crop production to face water availability or water
    price changes. First, the total amount of cropland irrigated can change with water
    price or availability, and second, the mix of crops grown can change so that the
    net farm income per acre-foot of each water used is increased. For example, farmers
    can reduce less profitable, high water-intensive crops and grow more profitable,
    less water-intensive crops. An observation of the net farm income per crop ET
    – a measure of the economic productivity of irrigation water consumed, by crop
    category from Table 1 shows that vegetables contribute the most to income but
    use less water, followed by field crops, alfalfa hay, and other hay crops. The
    income per acre-foot data represents the average economic value of water showing
    variability among crops for land in production under the baseline scenario. Microeconomic
    theory provides insights that net farm income is not maximized, under the baseline
    scenario, unless the value of the marginal product of additional water use (shadow
    value) equals the water price. Thus, our model uses a mathematical programming
    approach that helps us to calculate a set of parameters to make observed farm
    behavior reflect optimized income-maximizing behavior for which the shadow value
    or shadow price or the marginal economic value per unit water can be imputed.
    The marginal economic value of irrigation water, defined as the value of crops
    that can be produced by an extra acre-foot of water consumed, can provide critical
    information to stakeholders on the incremental benefit of expansions in water
    supply or the incremental cost of water supply limitations. Considerable attention
    has been given to the estimation of shadow price in the literature and could be
    beneficial in predicting future economic value of irrigation water in climate-stressed
    conditions and adaptation policy designs. In an irrigation area with a high variation
    of shadow prices for crops, water reallocation between crops equalizes shadow
    values of water that relate to the efficiency gain from the reallocation (Baccour
    et al., 2022, Bierkens et al., 2019, Ward, 2023). The shadow price measures the
    change in the optimal objective function value (net farm income in our case) due
    to a small unit change in water availability, ceteris paribus. It represents the
    dollar value of each additional acre-foot of water in added farm income if it
    were made available by policies that increased supply. The economic value derived
    from additional flows into the WRID comes from putting water to its optimal use
    somewhere in the district while respecting all the constraints imposed on water
    application and water use. Shadow price also refers to the additional economic
    value gained by relaxing restrictions on water availability to the irrigation
    district by one unit. For each irrigation water user, bringing more acreage into
    production, reducing acreage, or taking acreage out of production is influenced
    by water price or water availability changes resulting from streamflow changes,
    policies on reservoir capacity, groundwater pumping restrictions, Tribal, and
    environmental instream flow requirements. Through water application, water use,
    and return flows to river, and aquifer (seepage) per acre specific to each irrigation
    water source and crop, the economic model caters to the complex hydrologic relationships
    as shown in Fig. 2. Crop water requirement in the agronomic component comes from
    water application with return flows to river and aquifer back to the hydrologic
    component while the part of water application consumptively used by crops enters
    the crop production function in the economic component. Download : Download high-res

    2.6. Integrated optimization framework Fig. 2 shows the essential elements of
    our model: scenario configuration, headwater inflow conditions, reservoir capacity
    levels, groundwater pumping policies, and predicted crop production and farm income
    outcomes. Each element is explained as follows: • The headwater inflow scenarios
    describe the historically observed inflows into the basin at the headwaters in
    a typical wet year (2011) (historical), while future climate-induced snowmelt-driven
    inflows into the basin reflect a runoff timing shifted earlier with a minimal
    reduced peak flow (delta) and drought – low headwater inflow (drought) as explained
    in section 2.4. • The impact of reservoir storage capacity on farmers’ water availability
    is evaluated for four capacity levels. The first is current total basin storage
    capacity (labeled Current capacity) (112,640 acre-feet). Topaz Lake has 59,440,
    Bridgeport Reservoir with 42,455, and Weber Reservoir with 10,700 acre-feet. The
    second is no storage (run-of-the-river) – complete removal of current storage
    contribution to surface water diversions. The third is the addition of new smaller
    capacity to existing capacity (labeled Plus small reservoirs) – six off-stream
    regulatory reservoirs at various locations downstream of Topaz Lake and Bridgeport
    Reservoir in the WRID, and the fourth is upgraded capacity of existing reservoirs
    (labeled More capacity (1.5))– increasing existing total capacity by 1.5 % at
    their current upstream location in the WRID (i.e., 1.015*Current capacity). The
    small storage with a total capacity of 1,255 acre-feet, about 1.1 % of current
    capacity, is expected to hold water and release for use on demand. A typical irrigation
    season begins on March 1 and ends on October 31. Storing water in the Topaz and
    Bridgeport reservoirs typically begins on November 1 and continues until March
    1 with more refill rights until or around mid-July as long as decree (natural
    flow) is set at full (WRID, 2018b). The study used antecedent storage values for
    existing reservoirs as initial storage values at the beginning of the optimization
    exercise and new reservoirs are empty at the start of the season. • Groundwater
    pumping policy is evaluated as historically observed actual pumping, capped pumping
    – an average pumping level that causes no change in average groundwater level
    and pumping with primary groundwater rights only (no supplemental pumping). A
    pumping constraint is enforced in the model for each groundwater policy such that
    users are limited to available groundwater and cannot over-pump when facing reduced
    surface diversion under both the historical, delta, and drought inflows for the
    historical pumping, capped pumping, and no supplemental pumping scenarios. • The
    economic performance of these policies is evaluated on the assumption of a prior
    appropriative water allocation system within an unrestricted water-leasing regime
    in the WRID – where an optimal allocation under a water market occurs with no
    transaction costs and prices determined endogenously (Pulido-Velazquez and Tilmant,
    2022, Ward, 2023). An efficient water right distribution can be assumed since
    the climate-stressed (delta and drought) inflow represents an average water year
    in the future when the timing and quantity of snowmelt-driven inflows have changed
    due to climate change. Our model allocates water for the prime objective of achieving
    economic efficiency while non-economic goals are set as mathematical constraints
    (Ward, 2021). Economic values from water use will be greatest when water is allocated
    to its most productive uses (Schwabe et al., 2020, Ward, 2023). Our model of the
    Walker River system expresses the economic objective of maximizing farm income
    algebraically and has known parameters (read data) and several unknown variables
    (hydrologic, agronomic, institutional, environmental, and economic). Numerical
    values of each of the unknown variables are sought to produce a single overall
    economic optimum – the total net farm income (Pulido-Velazquez and Tilmant, 2022,
    Ward, 2021). It is formulated to discover water allocation and use patterns that
    maximize the objective of net farm income summed over all irrigators subject to
    a range of hydrologic, institutional, and environmental constraints. The model’s
    language is written in GAMS® and solved using a non-linear optimization solver
    (Ward, 2021). Model runs are conducted for thirty-six scenarios. These include
    snowmelt-derived inflow scenarios (3 runs), reservoir capacity levels (4 runs),
    and groundwater pumping policies (3 runs) giving a 3 × 4 × 3 configuration (a
    total of 36 optimization model runs). The baseline scenario (historical inflow,
    storage, and pumping) describes the historically observed characteristics of the
    basin. The optimal solution for the base scenario replicates the baseline hydrologic
    (headwater inflow, gauged flows, reservoir storage levels and releases, surface
    water diversion, historical pumped groundwater, aquifer storage, and depth, crop
    water application, consumptive use, and return flows) as well as the economic
    behavior (historical crop choice and crop mix, yield, cost, acreage in production,
    and net farm income). For the other thirty-five alternative scenario combinations,
    important variables such as monthly gauged flows, reservoir storage levels and
    releases, surface diversion and pumped groundwater, aquifer storage levels and
    depth, crop water application, consumptive use and return flows) as well as crop
    mix, crop yield, cost, acreage in production, and net farm income are unknown
    until solved by the model. The optimal solutions for the alternative scenario
    model runs depend on the imposition of a series of technical, hydrologic (surface
    flows and groundwater pumping), institutional (Tribal water rights), and environmental
    instream flow (inflow to Walker Lake) constraints. Tribal water rights and environmental
    instream flow are imposed as constraints in all model runs (see Constraints under
    Section 1a of the SI). 3. Results Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5 present detailed
    findings from our analysis. Findings are reported for the WRID since water for
    the WRPT on the WRPIR is a hard constraint on all optimization model runs as the
    most senior water rights holder assumed to not participate in water leasing. Meanwhile,
    flows at the mouth of Walker Lake (at the USGS gauge no. 1032025), not shown here,
    see no reduction from historical levels for any water supply scenario since a
    constraint based on historical gauged Lake inflows is imposed for all optimization
    model runs. That constraint chiefly contributes to increases in marginal economic
    values for upstream irrigators in times of higher shortage and scarcity conditions.

    Crop water application and crop water use Table 2 presents the total seasonal
    crop water application from surface water (decree natural flow and reservoir releases)
    and pumped groundwater as well as the total seasonal crop water used (crop ET)
    for the WRID, summed over all growers, irrigation season months, and technology
    in thousand acre-feet (TAF). The total amount of crop water used by crop category
    for the district is shown in Fig. 3. Each of the 35 alternative scenarios (counterfactuals)
    is compared to the baseline scenario (snowmelt-driven inflows, current storage
    capacity, and historical pumping). Table 2 reports the percent water shortages
    that would occur with each of the 35 alternative scenarios compared to the baseline
    scenario. Percent shortages are defined as the difference between historical water
    demand measured as net irrigation water requirement divided by irrigation efficiency
    and modeled water supply/application from surface diversion and/or groundwater
    pumping. It is calculated as the modeled or simulated water supply subtracted
    from historical water demand, then divided by historical water demand, and expressed
    as a percentage. No shortages are assumed under the baseline scenario since modeled
    supply equals historical demand. Future water supply (diversion and/or pumping)

    image Fig. 3. Crop water use by headwater inflow scenario, reservoir capacity
    level, and groundwater policy and crop type, Walker River Irrigation District,
    Walker River Basin, Nevada, USA (Percent of crop in production). Table 2 shows
    that percent shortage varies considerably depending on the configuration of headwater
    inflow, reservoir capacity level, and groundwater pumping policy. Percent shortages
    are generally higher under drought (reduced snowmelt-driven inflow) compared to
    historical and delta inflows and even higher with water supply restriction policies.
    A no storage under the delta inflow would have produced about 24 % shortage and
    about 39 % shortage under the drought inflow scenario, with historical groundwater
    pumping. This would translate to crop water use falling to about 71 and 52 % of
    base use, respectively, implying that about 50 and 83 TAF of the WRID’s historical
    crop water use would have been lost under the early season and reduced snowmelt-driven
    inflows had the existing storage capacity not been in the basin. Table 2 reveals
    that there could be a capacity constraint with the current capacity under the
    early season snowmelt-driven inflow scenario, producing a 0.7 % shortage that
    would have reduced crop water use by just over a TAF of base use with historical
    pumping. Reservoir capacity upgrades could ease potential capacity constraints
    under the delta inflow scenario and produce no reduction in base water use with
    historical groundwater pumping. However, crop water use could fall by about 1/5
    of base level even with reservoir capacity upgrades under drought inflow conditions
    though groundwater pumping would compensate for some surface water shortages.
    Table 2 also shows that if water managers implemented a pumping cap policy that
    reduced the average pumping level that causes zero change in average water table
    depth, pumping would reduce to 90.53 % of historical pumping. This would generate
    higher percent shortages with no storage under all snowmelt-driven inflow scenarios.
    Water supply constraints with current capacity could increase under the delta
    inflow scenario to about 3.8 % shortage, with crop water use falling to 96 % of
    base use. Table 2 displays that reservoir capacity upgrades could ease constraints
    under the delta inflow scenario and groundwater sustainability pumping cap with
    minimal crop water application shortage and crop water use losses. However, crop
    water use could fall by about 26 % of base use under the drought scenario even
    with reservoir capacity upgrades when groundwater pumping has to reduce to ensure
    aquifer sustainability. The highest percent shortages would occur in the drought
    inflow scenario if there were no surface storage and no supplemental pumping with
    water supply falling short of demand by about 64 % translating into crop water
    use falling to about 17 % of historical use. No supplemental pumping with no storage
    would also produce about 48 % shortage under historical and delta inflow scenarios.
    Existing capacity would have reduced the percent shortage to about 43 % under
    the drought scenario. Likewise, reservoir capacity upgrades could not have completely
    reduced shortages to zero and restored water use to base levels even with higher
    reservoir drawdown levels far below historical levels (see Section 2 of the SI).
    Under the drought scenario, the reservoirs never fill to their capacity and are
    quickly drawn down to their minimum levels by irrigation calls. Percent shortages
    in water application are similar to percent reductions in irrigation water use
    since irrigation technology is fixed and total crop water use is an empirically
    determined proportion of total crop water applied. Results from Fig. 3 highlight
    that alfalfa and other hay crops, which have historically been the dominant crops
    in the district, would bear the lion’s share of water use reductions as climate
    induces snowmelt-driven shift and decline in streamflow at headwaters, especially
    with no surface storage and no supplemental groundwater pumping. Field crops (grain,
    corn, and oats) and vegetables with lower water requirements per unit land would
    see minimal or no reduction in water use. This is because of the assumption of
    future efficient water distribution by an unrestricted water-leasing market in
    the district, which heightens competition among crop use when there are water
    supply reductions, reallocating water based on use efficiency and economic values.
    Fig. 3 shows that climate-induced snowmelt runoff with no storage and groundwater
    pumping restrictions would reduce mainly hay crops like pasture, forage, grass,
    and some alfalfa hay, reallocating the scarce water to maintain grain, corn, oats,
    and vegetable production. This reallocation would improve the economic efficiency
    of irrigation water use especially when large water use reductions are imposed
    by environmental, institutional, and climate-stressed snowmelt-induced water supplies.
    3.2. Crop acreage Table 3 shows the amounts of cropland by crop category summed
    over all growers, in the irrigation district measured in 1000 acres. Again, we
    compared each of the 35 counterfactual scenarios to the baseline scenario. Table
    3 revealed similar percent reductions in acreage cultivated as percent water shortages
    or reductions in crop water use. Crop acreage would fall to 71 and 52 % of base
    land under the early season and reduced snowmelt-driven inflow scenarios with
    no storage and historical pumping implying that 17,000 and 28,000 acres would
    have been out of production in the WRID under those scenarios had the current
    reservoirs not been in the basin. Acreage would fall to 99 % of the historical
    level with the current storage under the early season snowmelt scenario with historical
    groundwater pumping. With reservoir capacity upgrades, no reduction in acreage
    would be seen under the early snowmelt timing scenario with base groundwater pumping.
    However, cropland would fall by about 23 % under the drought scenario with either
    current reservoir capacity or upgrades even with base groundwater pumping and
    26 % with capped groundwater pumping. Table 3 shows that generally, higher acreage
    reduction would occur under a more restricted groundwater pumping policy of no
    supplemental pumping and no reservoir storage under drought inflows. Reservoir
    capacity increase could keep acreage in production at historical levels under
    the delta snowmelt runoff scenario with a 3 % reduction under capped groundwater
    pumping. Results from Table 3 reveal key messages: irrigated crop acreage changes
    are based on how climate-induced snowmelt-driven inflows at basin headwaters interact
    with management policies on surface storage and groundwater pumping to affect
    water availability to irrigators in an unrestricted water leasing market setting.
    Reduced water availability from climate-stressed water supplies, insufficient
    storage, and restricted pumping would change crop choice and crop mix at the irrigation
    district level in a free water leasing market. Alfalfa and other hay crops’ historical
    dominance of the crop acreage would mostly reduce with more water shortages (Fig.
    3). For example, Table 3 shows almost a 100 % reduction in other hay crop acreage
    and more than 80 % reduction in alfalfa acreage but a 0 % reduction in vegetable
    acreage under the drought inflows with no storage and no supplemental groundwater
    pumping. With a freer water-leasing regime, acreage with high crop water requirements,
    less efficient irrigation technologies, and low profitability per acre-foot would
    be reduced with scarce water reallocated to high-valued crops. Table 3 shows that
    projected future inflows with insufficient or no storage and groundwater pumping
    restrictions would reduce mainly hay crops like pasture, forage, grass, and some
    alfalfa hay, maintaining grain, corn, oats, and vegetables. 3.3. Net farm income
    Table 4 presents net farm income from crop production by crop category, summed
    over all growers in the irrigation district measured in $1000. We assessed how
    each counterfactual scenario deviates from the baseline scenario of historical
    snowmelt-induced inflows, current storage capacity, and historical pumping with
    respect to the generation of net farm income. The findings from Table 4 show three
    important messages. First, vegetable crops and field crops would produce the lion’s
    share of net farm income. Table 4 shows that under the historical baseline scenario,
    46 % and 12 % (a total of 58 %) of net income came from vegetable and field crop
    sales, respectively though these crops used 7 % of base crop ET. Alfalfa and other
    hay crops produced 42 % (about 38 % for alfalfa and about 4 % for other hay crops)
    even though they accounted for 90 % (66 % for alfalfa and 24 % for other hay)
    of acreage in production and 92 % (68 % for alfalfa and 24 % for other hay) of
    total crop water use. Vegetables would have 0 % income and water use losses while
    field crops would suffer minimal losses in income from the most water-limiting
    scenario – drought – reduced snowmelt runoff with no storage and no supplemental
    aquifer pumping while alfalfa and other hay crops would experience 83 %- and 97
    %-income losses, respectively. The free water-leasing market’s reallocation of
    scarce water to vegetables and field crops would ensure those crops’ water use
    and acreage as well as income preservation. Second, an unrestricted water-leasing
    regime could minimize losses in total net farm income from climate-induced snowpack
    declines, with no storage and pumping restrictions. In the drought inflow with
    no storage and no supplemental pumping scenario, a water shortage of 64 % translates
    into more than an 80 % reduction in acreage and water use but not more than a
    42 % reduction in total net income. In an irrigation district such as the WRID,
    a future economically efficient water distribution from an unrestricted leasing
    market in a seniority-based water allocation system could incentivize conservation
    by allowing water to move from low-value older water rights users to high-value
    recent water rights users depending on differences in marginal values across crop
    uses and users. Third, upscaling storage capacity from the status quo (current
    capacity) to current upstream capacity in addition to small regulatory storage
    downstream of current reservoirs or increasing current capacity by 1.5 % could
    complement a future improved water-leasing market to protect farm income from
    potential future climate-induced earlier snowmelt-driven inflows at the basin’s
    headwaters regardless of the pumping restriction scenarios. The advantages of
    upscaling current capacity to include small regulatory storage or upgrading existing
    capacity by no more than 1.5 % of current capacity within a free water-leasing
    market appear most striking under the climate-induced earlier snowmelt-driven
    inflows, as this upgrade eliminates farm income losses due to changing inflows
    under all groundwater pumping policy scenarios. However, reservoir capacity upgrades
    have limited benefits for increasing water availability for farmers under persistent
    drought since reservoirs have to fill up as long as the decree (natural flow)
    is set at full (after all decreed water right holders have had their water deliveries),
    and reduced inflows never fill reservoirs up to their capacity. Findings from
    Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 show that given future early season snowmelt-driven
    inflows and basin groundwater and terminus lake inflow constraints, increasing
    existing capacity by not more than 1.5 % of current capacity could protect farm
    incomes with improved future water leasing market. Considering the ratio of the
    basin’s storage capacity to the mean annual volume of snowmelt-derived stream
    inflows, our simulation shows that the marginal gains from reservoir capacity
    upgrades would increase at a decreasing rate as it grows more than 114.33 TAF
    (about 1.69 TAF additional to the current 112.64 TAF). The 114.33 TAF capacity
    would be 2.79 times the predicted mean delta annual (early season) snowmelt-derived
    inflows. The current capacity would be 2.75 times the predicted mean delta annual
    (early season) inflows. Beyond this threshold, the gain in storage regulation
    would be offset by corresponding increases in evaporative losses, seepage losses,
    and sedimentation. Updating the total reservoir capacity level from the current
    112,640 acre-feet to about 114,330 acre-feet (1.5 % increase) could be achieved
    by dredging sediment or raising current dam height to reduce the current reservoir
    storage losses (Randle et al., 2021). Alternatively, adding small downstream reservoirs
    with a total capacity of 1,255 acre-feet would increase the current capacity of
    112,640 acre-feet to about 113,895 acre-feet (about 1 % increase) and could improve
    regulation and maximize system-wide net farm income under predicted future early
    season snowmelt runoff in an improved water trading regime under terminal lake
    inflow and Tribal water rights constraints and aquifer sustainability constraints.
    3.4. Marginal economic value (MEV) of irrigation water use Table 5 shows the marginal
    economic value of an extra unit of irrigation water use in the WRID if it could
    be made available from policies that would increase its supply, by snowmelt-driven
    inflows scenario, reservoir capacity level, and groundwater policy. MEV estimates
    the added net farm income from making an additional acre-foot of water available
    in the WRID for crop irrigation, or put differently, it is the net farm income
    lost from decreasing the irrigation district’s water supply by one more acre-foot.
    It indicates the opportunity cost, measuring net farm income that would be lost
    by not taking actions that could have generated one more crop usable acre-foot
    of water supply. Examples of actions that could increase supply include mitigating
    streamflow variability with storage, additional groundwater pumping, development
    of brackish groundwater or seawater, water conservation, recycling and reuse,
    water importation, rainwater harvesting, etc. Hydrologic, environmental, and institutional
    constraints on the river system such as climate-induced reduced and variable snow-fed
    river inflow volumes, instream flow water requirements, groundwater pumping cap,
    etc., reduce or limit irrigation water supply relative to demand and increase
    the MEV since MEV takes into account the cost of water for environmental protection
    and aquifer sustainability (Bierkens et al., 2019). Irrigation district managers,
    administrators, farmers, and extension professionals may wish to know whether
    it pays to add capacity for finding additional usable water supply in their irrigation
    area. From Table 5, under the calibrated baseline scenario (historical snowmelt-driven
    inflow, current capacity, and groundwater pumping), marginal values are zero since
    historical demand equals modeled supply (no shortages) indicating no economic
    incentive to trade water among growers. In an unrestricted water-leasing market
    setting, water exchanges would lead to equalized marginal values of water across
    irrigators (Bierkens et al., 2019, Ziolkowska, 2015). The MEVs in Table 5 are
    equalized marginal values across all growers in the WRID. In our optimization
    exercise, growers are allowed to exchange water in a free market in the district
    until their marginal values are equalized, thus water moves through market exchanges
    to growers for which outcome produces an equal marginal value reflecting efficiency
    gains from water reallocation across uses, moving water to more productive uses.
    Table 5 shows that the MEVs are consistently higher where either snowmelt-driven
    inflow, surface storage policy, and/or groundwater policy occasion a lack of water
    availability in the irrigation district (i.e., water supply from surface water
    diversion and groundwater pumping shortfall relative to demand increases). The
    higher MEVs, under all inflow scenarios with no storage but historical pumping,
    indicate the importance of the current reservoir storage in reducing economic
    losses from water shortages that would have occurred had the current reservoir
    capacity not been in the basin. With the current storage, the MEV is $4.00/ac-ft
    under the early season snowmelt-derived inflow scenario which increases uniformly
    to $83.80/ac-ft under the drought scenario. Reservoir capacity upgrades would
    produce higher MEV under the drought scenario but zero MEV for the historical
    and early season snowmelt runoff scenarios with historical pumping; however, capping
    historical pumping to stabilize aquifer level and no supplemental pumping would
    increase MEVs to $12.53/ac-ft and $125/ac-ft, respectively. The high MEVs under
    the drought inflow with reservoir capacity upgrades explain that the performance
    of the reservoirs would be limited in a drought year since reduced flows would
    never fill up reservoirs (Section 2 of the SI). However, a future widespread water
    leasing market than historically experienced could complement these capacity upgrades
    and produce MEV of $110/ac-ft under the aquifer sustainability scenario. 4. Discussion
    This work has contributed to the literature by demonstrating a method of identifying
    opportunities for protecting farm income in agriculturally dominated snow-fed
    endorheic basins facing climate-induced declines in snowpack, hydrologic, environmental,
    and institutional constraints. Our model permitted the analysis of a range of
    reservoir capacity levels and groundwater pumping policies under different snowmelt-driven
    inflow scenarios related to the economic consequences of each policy mix. Our
    findings show that, under a free water trading setting, adding small new off-stream
    regulatory reservoirs downstream to the current upstream capacity in the WRID
    or increasing current capacity by not more than 1.5 % could be a capacity upgrade
    that could stabilize flow rates in the system and increase water supply reliability,
    with more flexible and nimble response times to irrigators’ water demand by water
    managers when the WRB faces earlier snowmelt runoff timing in an irrigation season
    given restrictions on groundwater pumping and environmental flows. Our simulation
    shows that considering the ratio of the basin’s storage capacity to the mean annual
    volume of snowmelt-derived stream inflows, the marginal gains from expanding the
    basin’s current storage capacity by more than 1.5 % (either expanding existing
    upstream capacity or adding more capacity downstream in addition to existing ones),
    would increase at a decreasing rate due to seepage and especially evaporation
    losses in a semi-arid climate (Brown et al., 2019, Langbein, 1959). Our findings
    also reveal that the impact of the reservoir capacity upgrades is limited when
    inflow volumes into the reservoirs decline by more than 50 % in a dry year. Our
    results can help policymakers identify and implement the economically best policy
    mix for adapting to climate-induced snowpack declines. As others (e.g., Boisramé
    and Carroll, 2023, Gharib et al., 2023) have found, our findings reveal that reservoir
    capacity upgrade can buffer the impacts of climate-induced early-season snowmelt-driven
    streamflow timing on agriculture and protect basin-wide farm income in the face
    of aquifer sustainability and instream flow requirements. However, our results
    show that in persistent droughts, i.e., reduced snowmelt-driven streamflow, reservoir
    capacity increase has a very limited effect on agricultural water shortages, as
    others (e.g., Brown et al., 2019, Kim et al., 2019) have found. In this instance,
    our results provide insights that reservoir storage capacity increase with increased
    and more flexible water trading regime in the future would reduce economic losses
    to farmers in the WRID, especially under groundwater pumping and instream flow
    constraints. Currently, permanent water trading involving decree natural flow
    and primary groundwater rights appurtenant to irrigated lands with associated
    supplemental groundwater rights remains limited; there is an active temporary
    storage water leasing market which also remains limited (Koebele et al., 2022).
    This study has several limitations. Several simplifying assumptions were made
    in our analysis. One example is the assumption of the time period of our analysis.
    The impact of reservoir and groundwater storage on water use was analyzed for
    only one irrigation season using potential future long-term “average year” climate
    data. In a hydraulically connected basin, the dynamic (inter-annual) impacts of
    long-term groundwater pumping on future surface flows should be considered (Zheng
    et al., 2020). Also, in a multiple-year analysis, different reservoir capacity
    thresholds might be established based on predicted climate-induced long-term mean
    annual volume of snowmelt-driven inflows and the cost of capacity expansion (Gharib
    et al., 2023). Another example is the assumption of no transaction costs in a
    free water leasing market. Our model only assesses water market gains at the irrigation
    district level, with no transaction costs and endogenously determined water price.
    Individual water agent trading behaviors and transaction costs are not represented.
    Models of water market have to involve an approach that allows for detailed and
    realistic representation of transaction costs (Erfani et al., 2014). Transaction
    costs can hinder water trading expansion (Womble and Hanemann, 2018). Another
    limitation is the assumption of no irrigation technology improvements in the future
    and modeling aquifers as simple underground reservoirs using a simple bucket aquifer
    model, which assumes uniformity of water table depth across the entire aquifer
    plan view (Baah-Kumi et al., 2022, Ward et al., 2019). Our analysis assumed fixed
    irrigation technology and used a simple coarse-scale bucket model that contains
    a network flow system connecting headwater inflows, three current and four future
    surface storage buckets, two aquifer buckets, areas of crop water application
    from surface water diversion and groundwater pumping and crop water uses, and
    an outflow water requirement. Improved irrigation efficiency can reduce water
    application, and increase water use and farm income but reduce groundwater recharge
    (Pérez-Blanco et al., 2021). In addition, our work does not exhaustively represent
    all the economic activities that depend on the basin’s water resources. Other
    water uses and purposes such as household, livestock, industrial and commercial
    uses, recreation, and mining, among others, using about 6 % (NDWR, 2022) of the
    basin’s water, were not considered in our model. A full assessment of the competition
    in the basin will benefit from the inclusion of all these sectors as their future
    demand increases to guide the broader scope of relative efficiency analysis under
    future climate-stressed river flows. Future research could consider the economic
    performance of the dynamic impact of groundwater and streamflow in an inter-annual
    analysis of groundwater and surface storage in the basin using MODFLOW (Harbaugh
    et al., 2000) which incorporates realistic dynamic groundwater-surface water interactions
    according to the well-known Darcy’s Law. We based our future climate-induced snowmelt-derived
    flows on predicted future flows from the East and West Forks of the WRB by Pohll
    and Garner (2018) to determine early flow timing impact in a wet year and used
    historical drought spell flow volume data to estimate drought (dry) year inflows.
    Future works can consider various climate model-generated flows in determining
    potential reservoir capacity thresholds in the face of groundwater restrictions.
    Actual water market transaction data in the WRB could be used to analyze realistic
    water markets. The impact of future irrigation technology improvements could also
    be analyzed on potential reservoir capacity development. 5. Conclusions Assessments
    of strategies to manage water resources to sustain irrigated agriculture and prevent
    further degradation of terminal lakes in closed basins with long-term aquifer
    drawdown continue to see attention from water and environmental scholars. This
    work’s contribution has been the assessment of the economic performance of storage
    capacity upgrade in the WRID to adapt to climate-induced snowmelt-generated river
    flows in the face of potential restrictions on groundwater pumping and flow requirements
    to the Walker Basin’s terminal lake. We formulated an empirical integrated hydro-economic
    optimization model for which optimized baseline scenario matches historically
    observed and estimated data on consumptive water use and associated economic values
    for several farmers in the WRID. Counterfactual scenarios of different levels
    of storage capacity and groundwater pumping restrictions with historical, early
    timing, and reduced inflows at the basin’s headwaters are compared with the baseline
    scenario. Findings show that upgrading existing capacity by not more than 1.5
    % in a free water leasing market could protect upwards of 94 % and 83 % of baseline
    agricultural economic value when the basin faces future climate-induced early
    season, and reduced snowmelt-driven inflows, respectively while managing the basin
    for hydrologic and environmental constraints. Our model provides insights into
    a mix of built reservoir storage capacity and groundwater management policies
    that could be pursued to protect farm income and improve the efficiency and performance
    of water management and allocation under climate stress, hydrologic, and environmental
    constraints. CRediT authorship contribution statement Bernard Baah-Kumi: Conceptualization,

    1. Introduction 1.1. Agriculture – food security, gross domestic product, world
    population, and climate change Agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring food
    security and has a significant impact Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country.
    With the projected increase the global population, there will be a greater need
    for agricultural production (FAO et al., 2022). The need for food will in-fact
    rise significantly as the world''s population continues to grow. Also, it is expected
    that the world population will surpass 10 billion by 2050. To fulfil the increased
    demand caused by population growth, food production must increase by almost 70
    % (Giller et al., 2021). For agriculture to satisfy this need, it must adapt and
    expand. However, due to additional difficulties brought about by climate change
    and water constraints, existing agricultural methods are no longer enough to supply
    this expanding need (Elijah et al., 2018). 1.2. Smart agriculture – sustainability,
    production, and resources Smart agriculture is rapidly implementing contemporary
    technology to address these issues and boost production and sustainability (Ahmed
    et al., 2018, Lindgren et al., 2018). For instance, a recent scientific field
    called “smart irrigation” employs data-intensive techniques to maximize water
    consumption and boost agricultural production. Farmers may gain useful information
    from sensors and data analytics in agriculture to better understand how their
    actions affect the soil. Farmers may use data gleaned from environmental parameter
    monitoring and analysis to improve practices, make well-informed decisions about
    resource use, and identify crop problems early on. This improves sustainability
    and creates a deeper comprehension of the link between farming and land (Idoje
    et al., 2021, Ojha et al., 2015). Technology in agriculture is essential for resource
    conservation, reducing the environmental effect of farming operations, and feeding
    the world''s population. With the advent of the digital age, sophisticated technologies
    are replacing old farming techniques. These systems provide enormous quantities
    of data that may be used to optimize resources used and boost agricultural output.
    Hence, the use of technology and data-driven decision-making in agriculture will
    boost productivity, decrease waste, and protect the planet''s natural resources
    (Weersink et al., 2018, Khan et al., 2021). Agriculture, not only plays a crucial
    part in providing food security and sustainability, but it also significantly
    contributes to a nation''s economic development (Beckman and Countryman, 2021).
    As was already established, agriculture has a big influence on a country''s GDP.
    1.3. Agriculture, economic, innovative technology, scope, and possible potential
    of the paper In reality, throughout history, agriculture has been a key factor
    in the economic success of numerous nations. In rural regions, especially agriculture,
    not only produces food but also, opens doors to employment. For farmers and those
    who work in the agricultural value chain, such as processors, marketers, and exporters,
    it is a significant source of revenue. As a result, agriculture has the ability
    to promote economic expansion, reduce poverty, and improve living conditions.
    Investments in innovative agriculture technology have the potential to accelerate
    economic growth. Farmers can boost their earnings, produce more food with fewer
    resources, and open new markets for their goods with the aid of modern agricultural
    systems and smart technology (Bathaei and Štreimikienė, 2023, Blakeney, 2022).
    In light of the economic considerations and the imperative to optimize the use
    of this vital resource, the implementation of computerized smart systems in North
    Africa and worldwide has become crucial (Assouli et al., 2018). The proposed paper
    presents an advanced smart irrigation system that aims to revolutionize agricultural
    efficiency and increase yields. With a broad scope that includes innovative irrigation
    technologies and cutting-edge technological applications such as the Internet
    of Things, cloud computing, and embedded system, the paper focuses on improving
    food security. Through potential stability and the promotion of sustainable agricultural
    practices, the study also envisages a future in agriculture contributing to the
    promotion of global food stability. 1.4. Intelligent irrigation – internet, deep
    Learning, Machine Learning, and motivation of this work The intelligent irrigation,
    utilizing state-of-the-art technology like Internet-integrated systems, plays
    a pivotal role in collecting precise data (such as temperature, humidity, and
    soil moisture), this helps in demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications,
    and facilitating remote control (Rahman et al., 2020, Pramanik et al., 2022, Abba
    et al., 2019, Munir et al., 2021). Consequently, the utilization of the Internet
    in recent years reflects significant advancements in integrated systems, particularly
    in developed nations, leading to remarkable improvements in water conservation
    and production efficiency (Abi Saab et al., 2019, Pasika and Gandla, 2020). Additionally,
    the emergence of cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning, machine learning,
    and artificial intelligence in agriculture contributes further to the maintenance
    and boost of the outcome (Talaviya et al., 2020, Saleem et al., 2021, Subeesh
    and Mehta, 2021). Motivated by global food security concerns, this research focuses
    on irrigation. Meeting the food needs of a growing population while preserving
    water resources is of paramount importance. Current traditional irrigation practices
    affect yields and food security. The study proposes an intelligent irrigation
    system that integrates IoT and cloud technologies. This innovation makes it possible
    to conserve water efficiently, increase yields, and feed crops well. With broad
    global application, this approach advances smart farming, helping to improve food
    security and sustainability. 1.5. Smart irrigation, Internet of Things, ThingSpeak,
    and focus of this work Numerous cutting-edge technologies, including the IoT,
    have broad applications. It is hard for farmers to personally visit and monitor
    every part of the farms they oversee, which might result in inconsistent watering.
    Losses in money and poor crop quality are consequently a result of this. In order
    to solve this problem and streamline the agricultural process, the research papers
    (Ayaz et al., 2019, Habib et al., 2023), suggest an intelligent irrigation system
    that makes use of cutting-edge IoT technology. These studies (Kamienski et al.,
    2019, García et al., 2020), also introduce the concept of “smart agriculture,”
    which makes use of data technology to increase agricultural output and raise the
    overall quality. Furthermore, the mentioned works (Pathak et al., 2019, Ndunagu
    et al., 2022), make use of the ThingSpeak platform, which provides a complete
    solution for gathering and storing data acquired from agricultural sensors and
    controllers, to meet the needs of farm operators. This portal is a useful resource
    for collecting and preserving important agricultural data. Wireless sensor networks
    are utilized by these papers while creating autonomous plants. By using a smart
    irrigation system, irrigation settings may be managed automatically (Tiglao et
    al., 2020, Lloret et al., 2021, Zervopoulos et al., 2020, Morchid et al., 2022,
    Morchid et al., 2021). In these studies (Olisa et al., 2021, Hussen Hajjaj et
    al., 2020, Hanan et al., 2019, Tham et al., 2022), a water level sensor was utilized.
    Specifically, The HC-SR04 device of the real-time water level monitoring system
    is used to accurately measure the water level as a key component. Further, this
    study presented a review of applications of IoT and sensor technology to increase
    food security and agricultural sustainability (Morchid et al., 2024). The focus
    of this study is to provide a smart irrigation system that that would use cloud
    computing and embedded IoT technologies to optimize water utilization and make
    sure plants get the right quantity of water. The research shows how this method
    might increase agricultural yields, decrease water waste, and assist offset the
    problem of food security. The system''s feasibility for application in many places
    around the world is also emphasized in this paper, supporting the progress of
    smart agriculture. 1.6. Main contribution of this work The main contribution of
    this paper is expressed as follows. Fig. 1 also shows the graphical abstract of
    the proposed scheme based on these contributions. • A smart irrigation system
    is proposed using new technologies like the IoT, embedded systems, and cloud computing
    as a groundbreaking strategy to improve food security through the implementation
    of advanced agricultural technology. • The proposed system supervises real-time
    monitoring of crucial environmental factors such as moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and water levels in smart agriculture practices. • The proposed system also employs

    module (DHT22), (2) water level sensor, and (3) moisture sensors. All these sensors

    ThingSpeak cloud to enable wireless communication between the device and the farm
    owner, enhancing their interaction. • Farmers can access comprehensive farm data

    Paper framework of the paper. 2. Architecture of the proposed scheme Smart irrigation
    systems gather information on soil moisture and other parameters using several
    IoT devices and sensors. These sensors can detect the moisture content of the
    soil, temperature, humidity, and even water level. They can also capture images
    of the crops to track their development and general health. Remote control of
    an irrigation system using data obtained from sensors and wireless communication
    with a cloud-based platform for analysis. The data is processed and analyzed on
    a cloud-based platform which makes use of models and algorithms to find the best
    watering plan depending on the information gathered. The irrigation system is
    connected to a small computer called an embedded board which can regulate the
    irrigation system''s water flow depending on instructions. Through a mobile application,
    farmers can access and monitor the system, which gives them real-time information
    on the soil moisture, weather, and irrigation schedule. Through the app, they
    may manually operate the irrigation system or modify the watering schedule. Farmers
    can increase agricultural yields and optimize irrigation thanks to this. As it
    only supplies the crops with the water they require, this technology also conserves
    water resources and lowers expenses. Furthermore, crop planning and research may
    be done using the data gathered by the smart irrigation system. Farmers, for instance,
    might spot trends in crop growth and pinpoint the perfect circumstances for a
    certain crop by examining data collected over time. Future agricultural yield
    optimization and crop planting schedule decisions may both be made using this
    knowledge. In the context of smart irrigation, wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    enable autonomous plant management through functions such as environmental monitoring,
    nutrient management, disease detection, automated irrigation, and communications.
    Wireless sensor networks provide real-time data on factors such as temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, water level, and nutrient levels. They support adaptive
    control systems, use low-power nodes for greater energy efficiency, and enable
    remote monitoring and control through cloud integration. Overall, WSNs contribute
    to the creation of autonomous plants by facilitating data-driven decision-making
    and optimizing plant conditions to improve crop productivity and sustainability.
    On the other hand, the integration of various sensors into WSNs is essential for
    plant autonomy. The most common sensors are those measuring temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, light, nutrients, pests, water levels, and wind. Collectively,
    these sensors help improve plant-related processes. The integration of various
    sensors improves the accuracy and efficiency of autonomous plant management systems,
    enabling informed decisions to be made to improve crop productivity and sustainability.
    2.1. The architecture of the system This section describes the structure of the
    smart irrigation system shown in Fig. 3. The system is made up of three essential
    parts: IoT devices, cloud computing, and application interface. Internet connectivity
    enables consumers from all around the world to view and track their farm data.

    Fig. 3. The smart irrigation system''s IoT architecture. The irrigation system
    is an automated electronic system that is intended to efficiently manage irrigation
    scheduling. Its primary goal is to accommodate the changing needs of plants as
    they develop. Through the analysis of soil moisture content, the system determines
    the precise percentage of water necessary for irrigation, ensuring accurate scheduling
    for various agricultural seasons and crop varieties. The key aims of smart irrigation
    encompass optimizing water consumption to reduce costs, enhancing agricultural
    productivity, benefiting farms, fostering energy efficiency, and ensuring food
    security through utilizing new technologies like the IoT, cloud computing, embedded
    systems, and sensors. The IoT architecture of the proposed system, shown in Fig.
    3, comprises three fundamental components: (1) IoT devices, (2) cloud computing,
    and (3) the application interface. The components of IoT devices include sensors,
    actuators, a control unit, and a gateway, among others. These sensors are in charge
    of monitoring critical environmental factors including air humidity, air temperature,
    soil moisture, and water level within the smart farm. The soil moisture sensor
    is used to measure the soil moisture content. In addition, the DHT22 device, which
    is famous for its accuracy, was used, which is a two-in-one combined sensor to
    measure humidity and temperature. In addition, the HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance
    sensor is used to detect water levels. The ESP32 microcontroller-powered control
    unit receives sensor readings and coordinates the actuators to make sure that
    the plants are watered on schedule. The ESP32 microcontroller is appropriate for
    larger-scale applications since it has adequate memory capacity and improved processing
    capability. The smart irrigation system''s actuators are essential for carrying
    out instructions from the ESP32 controller. In our system, a water sprinkler is
    used to water the plants, and a water pump is used to fill the tank. The next
    development in the IoT device architecture is the addition of a gateway. The gateway
    gathers sensed data from the control unit and carries out critical data processing
    operations to enable intelligent aggregation, optimize network traffic, and lower
    energy consumption. It effectively bundles the essential components of the particular
    process model and sends them to the cloud, leading to appreciable decreases in
    latency and costs at higher levels. The data is continually processed by conventional
    cloud computing systems when it is received from the gateway. Cloud computing
    is the focus of our system architecture''s second component. Farmers now have
    access to a huge variety of data that was gathered through the control unit and
    delivered over the gateway console, thanks to this layer. Farmers may gather,
    view, and analyze real-time data streams by utilizing the cloud-based IoT analytics
    platform ThingSpeak. ThingSpeak is a complete data management platform that enables
    farmers to design unique data visualizations using their own technology. The platform
    allows for the collection, visualization, analysis, and derivation of useful insights
    from live data streams. Using the ThingSpeak platform to post data or the ThingView
    app to retrieve data, farmers may communicate with the system. The irrigation
    system architecture is completed by the application interface, often known as
    the front layer. Results of data processing, such as soil moisture, humidity,
    temperature, and water level, are shown in this user-facing component. Farmers
    may get real-time data visualizations using ThingSpeak and use the knowledge to
    guide their decisions. This interface makes it possible for the farmer and the
    system to communicate seamlessly, which makes it easier to monitor and manage
    the irrigation systems. 2.2. Calibration of the water level In this section, the
    sensor calibration method is employed in the proposed work. The HC SR04 device
    was utilized to measure the water level. Several studies (Olisa et al., 2021,
    Hussen Hajjaj et al., 2020, Hanan et al., 2019, Tham et al., 2022), have employed
    an ultrasonic sensor to determine the water level. However, these papers did not
    provide a mathematical calculation for the calibration procedure of the ultrasonic
    sensor used to measure the water level. In the proposed study, a calibration technique
    is utilized to study the water level sensor. This technique involves a linear
    interpolation function, referred to as the water level sensor calibration, which
    establishes a relationship between the sensor''s values and the corresponding
    water level. (1) expresses this relationship in a linear formula. Specifically,
    when the maximum value of the sensor is represented in centimeters, the minimum
    value corresponds to the %, and vice versa. Fig. 4 visually illustrates this relationship
    between the sensor''s values and the water level in %. Download : Download high-res
    image (183KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Architecture of the
    water level calibration. The calibration process was used to accurately adjust
    the input of the ultrasonic sensor. The sensor is connected to the ESP32 Microcontroller
    for seamless integration and data processing. During the system startup, we obtain
    synchronized sensor data for a duration of 2 sec. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough
    analysis of the system, focusing on the highest and lowest values of the sensor
    readings. The HC-SR04 device is capable of measuring distances ranging from 2
    cm to 400 cm. Equation (1) represents the mathematical interpolation function
    used to detect the water level in percentages, such as 5 %, 30 %, etc. This linear
    interpolation representation of our proposed system is as follows: (1) In the
    given linear interpolation (1), the variables used are defined as follows: Y:
    Output of the water level in %. X: Input of the water level in cm. m: Coefficient.
    P: Zero adjustment. The coefficient may be computed as in equation (2) if we assume
    that the difference between the highest and minimum values is equal to the h2
    described in equation (3). Consequently, level Y is equal to 1 when X is equal
    to the maximum value (Max). Further context or computation can be used to calculate
    the value of P, which represents zero adjustments as flow in equation (4). (2)
    (3) (4) In the proposed paper, it has been determined that the maximum distance
    in the water tank is 25 cm, and the minimum reading is h1 = 5 cm. Therefore, based
    equation (3) the difference between the maximum and minimum values (h2) is calculated
    as h2 = Max - Min = 25 cm − 5 cm = 20 cm. Using this information, the coefficient
    (m) can be calculated as m = -99/h2 = −99/20 = −4.95. (4) is obtained as follows:
    (4) For instance, if X  = Min = h1 = 5 cm, the value of the water level (Y) will
    be 99 %. On the other hand, if X  = Max = 25 cm, the water level value will be
    0 %. The discussion of this study towards the linear interpolation has important
    implications for sustainable agriculture, smart irrigation systems, and food security.
    This representation permits precise detection of water levels at various places
    in a tank or reservoir by creating a link between the values of the water level
    sensor and corresponding percentages. This interpolation may be used by smart
    irrigation systems to optimize water use and enhance agricultural operations.
    Farmers and system controllers can plan irrigation and manage water resources
    more effectively by continually monitoring the water levels. The system can deliver
    the proper quantity of water to crops using this real-time data, preventing over-
    or under-irrigation. This strategy offers two advantages. Firstly, it promotes
    sustainability and ensures that just the appropriate amount of water is delivered,
    therefore conserving water resources. Secondly, the representation helps to preserve
    crop health and production, enhancing food security, by precisely determining
    water levels. According to the mathematical calibration technique presented in
    this article, integrating linear interpolation into the smart irrigation system
    offers significant advantages. The accuracy of the water level sensor is significantly
    increased by this mathematical calibration technique, providing reliable information
    for making informed irrigation decisions. By enabling the system to accurately
    assess soil moisture levels, thereby reducing the risks associated with over-
    or under-watering, the use of linear interpolation improves overall irrigation
    planning. In particular, by reducing water wastage and complying with sustainable
    farming methods, this strategy improves resource efficiency. Linearization also
    improves accuracy. In addition, the approach increases the reliability of data-driven
    decision-making of the smart irrigation system, which in turn fosters stakeholder
    confidence in the accuracy of the system to make well-informed and effective management
    decisions. Linear interpolation effectively optimizes agricultural operations
    by precisely calibrating the sensors, particularly water level sensors, in the
    smart irrigation system presented in this paper. This enhancement enables better
    irrigation scheduling, guaranteeing accurate soil moisture measurements and reducing
    water wastage. The result is greater resource efficiency, in line with sustainable
    practices. What''s more, improved precision has a positive impact on crop productivity,
    promoting plant health and increasing overall agricultural output. This section
    includes a method for calibrating the water level sensor that will provide farmers
    with accurate results. This calibration technique optimizes the possibilities
    of seamless and secure soil irrigation management by facilitating effective process
    control. This strategy differs noticeably from the approaches put forward by authors
    (Olisa et al., 2021, Hussen Hajjaj et al., 2020). 3. Algorithm and V-model of
    the proposed scheme The algorithmic aspect of the proposed approach comprises
    three essential elements. It begins with a visual flowchart illustrating how the
    method works. Next, it explains the process of accessing the ESP32 station and
    establishing a Wi-Fi connection. Finally, it presents the pseudo-code, details
    of the system equipment, and V Model. This combination of algorithmic representation
    and equipment information is a valuable resource for researchers, developers,
    and enthusiasts who want to understand how the system works. 3.1. Flow chart of
    the proposed scheme The smart irrigation system algorithm created particularly
    for smart agriculture is shown in detail in Fig. 5. The algorithm encompasses
    all stages of the software code, beginning with the initialization of the sensors
    and ending with the display of sensors data on both the ThingSpeak platform and
    the ThingView application. Download : Download high-res image (369KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Flow chart of the proposed smart irrigation
    system. The initialization of the temperature, humidity, moisture, and water level
    sensors is the first step in our system''s flow chart in order to get correct
    values from these sensors. The sensor parameters are adjusted as needed after
    initialization to ensure accurate readings. Next, the system checks if the ESP32
    microcontroller, the ESP32 used in the system, is connected to the ThingSpeak
    cloud. If not, the system tries connection with the cloud. Additionally, the sensor
    data is printed on the console for monitoring purposes. For the moisture sensor,
    if the reading falls below 40 %, indicating a low moisture level in the soil,
    the watering pump (W-Pump) is activated, and the green LED indicator is turned
    on. Conversely, if the reading exceeds 40 %, the pump remains switched off. The
    DHT22 sensor, responsible for measuring air temperature and humidity, continuously
    reads the values every 2 s while checking for any potential errors. If the temperature
    reading exceeds 45 °C, indicating a high temperature, the yellow LED is illuminated;
    otherwise, the yellow LED remains off. In the case of the water level sensor,
    if the reading indicates a level below 10 %, indicating a low water level in the
    tank, the tank pump (T-Pump) is activated, and the red LED is turned on. Conversely,
    if the reading is above 10 %, the tank pump remains off, and the red LED remains
    unlit. Every 2 s, the suggested smart irrigation system''s data is updated (2S).
    On the LCD, the sensors'' whole output is shown in real time. The system also
    instantly transmits all sensor data to the ThingSpeak cloud and ThingView app.
    In order to provide accurate and current information on the system''s performance,
    the data is updated every 2 s. Overall, this Smart Irrigation System makes sure
    that plants and crops receive enough water, and it runs well with little assistance
    from humans. In addition, this flow chart makes sure that the sensors are working
    properly, checks their readings, and initiates the required actions in response
    to predetermined thresholds, as shown by the activation of pumps and indicators.
    3.2. Accessing ESP32 station and Wi-Fi connection process 3.2.1. Accessing ESP32
    station The embedded system (ESP32) is typically linked to a wireless router,
    which acts as an access point for the ESP32 to connect to the local network in
    these situations. In most cases, the ESP32 is set up as a station, enabling it
    to connect to the router and access the network. In this setup, we would need
    toc be connected to the same local network as the ESP32 in order to control it.
    This implies that we may operate the ESP32 from any device that is also linked
    to the same network, such as IoT embedded systems (including other ESP32 devices),
    IoT gateways (which may include routers), and IoT terminals like PCs or smartphones
    as illustrated in Fig. 6. Our system can access and manage the ESP32 from anywhere
    in the range of that network as long as these devices are linked to it. Download

    is initially initialized to guarantee good operation. The system then confirms
    that the microcontroller is effectively linked to a Wi-Fi network. The information
    is swiftly and in real-time delivered to the ThingSpeak cloud platform after the
    connection has been verified. As shown in Fig. 7, this guarantees that all sensor-generated
    data is easily accessed and shown on the ThingSpeak platform and the associated

    and equipment of the system In order to program, develop, and visualize the algorithm''s
    structure, the pseudo-code is supplied below. The algorithm for the suggested
    irrigation system is shown in Table 1. This pseudo-code defines the simulation
    of intelligent irrigation based on an embedded system that monitors environmental
    conditions, controls pumps, and communicates with the cloud (The ThingSpeak platform
    and the ThingView application). It starts by defining constants for the different
    thresholds in lines 1–2. The program uses variables to represent sensor readings,
    pump states, and connection status in lines 3–11. Initialise built-in devices
    such as ESP32 and sensors in lines 12–13. Table 1. Algorithm 1. Pseudo-code of

    moisture, water level) are (1) simulated, although actual sensor data is used
    in practice. (2) The humidity sensor reading is calibrated on a percentage scale.
    (3) The water level is calculated by linear interpolation. (4) The simulated data
    is sent to the cloud platforms (ThingSpeak and ThingView) for visualization and
    analysis. (5) The state of the connection to the cloud is simulated. (6) Control
    logic evaluates humidity and water levels to determine pump conditions. (7) Pump
    control flags (TonWP, ToffWP, TonTP, ToffTP) are set based on the control logic
    conditions. (8) A simulation delay has been introduced between iterations. The
    code uses placeholder functions to read sensors, set values, and check connectivity
    to the cloud. These functions need to be implemented to interact with real devices
    and services. In general, this pseudo-code demonstrates the logic of the system
    that collects sensor data, communicates with the cloud (ThingSpeak and ThingView),
    and controls pumps according to predefined thresholds. Table 2 briefly gives the
    hardware components used in this design, and explains the particular uses for
    which it was used. It includes the controllers, sensors, pumps, and other devices
    used in this system. Table 2. The equipment of the system. Sr. no Hardware Functions
    1. ESP32 Microcontroller The ESP32 is a flexible microcontroller with a variety
    of features and capabilities. It may be used in combination with a host MCU as
    a secondary device or as an independent system. Reduced communication stack overhead
    on the main application processor is one of its main benefits. The ESP32 can also
    communicate with other systems, allowing the inclusion of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
    features via SPI/SDIO or I2C/UART interfaces. Because of its adaptability, the

    components with electrical energy is the power source''s main duty. This power
    source acts as the system''s main energy source, supplying each component with
    the energy it needs to operate properly, including the sensors, actuators, controllers,
    and communication modules. By providing dependable power, the system can function
    without interruption, making it possible to complete activities like data gathering,
    processing, and communication successfully. 3.4. V Model of the smart irrigation
    system A crucial element of our approach is the integration of sensor and control
    system data into the V model, which guides the development of the best irrigation
    program. Within the framework of the V model, which is a software development
    methodology, we have created an intelligent irrigation system exploiting the IoT
    and an integrated board such as the ESP32. This board transmits data to the cloud,
    including platforms such as ThingSpeak, and enables remote monitoring via the
    ThingView application. As shown in Fig. 8 the exact ways to apply the V model,
    in this case, are as follows: (1) Requirements Gathering and Analysis: The requirements
    for the system are gathered and examined at this stage of the V Model. This involves
    identifying the system''s users, such as farmers and agricultural engineers, their
    requirements and goals (such as automating irrigation based on weather and soil
    conditions and sending data to the cloud for remote monitoring and analysis),
    as well as any limitations that must be taken into account (such as cost, and
    compatibility with existing equipment). (2) System Design: The system architecture
    and general design are developed at this stage. This entails a choice of sensors
    to track soil moisture, temperature, and water level, an embedded board such as
    ESP32 to collect and process sensor data, and a wireless communication module
    such as Wi-Fi to transmit sensor data to a remote server or a cloud-based platform
    such as ThingSpeak. Designing the control system that will be used to create the
    ideal irrigation schedule is also part of this phase. (3) Implementation: The
    integration of sensor and control system data into the Model V is a crucial step
    in the implementation of our intelligent irrigation system. At this stage, the
    system is activated, the control system is configured and the integrated board,
    such as the ESP32, is programmed. A connection to the cloud is established, enabling
    the irrigation system to be monitored and operated remotely. It''s important to
    note that this phase also includes the integration of sensor data into the control
    system, enabling the best irrigation program to be determined. The code practice
    for sending sensor data to the ThingSpeak cloud platform is also implemented during
    this stage. This seamless integration of components guarantees optimum system
    efficiency, enabling precise, responsive management of the irrigation program
    according to environmental conditions and specific crop needs. (4) Verification:
    To make sure the system satisfies the criteria established in step one, this stage
    entails testing it. Functional testing, performance testing, and integration testing
    are all part of this. The communication between the embedded board and the ThingSpeak
    cloud platform as well as the communication between the embedded board and the
    remote server or cloud-based platform are both tested at this stage. (5) Maintenance:
    The deployment of the system and any required upkeep and upgrades are done in
    this final phase of the V Model. This stage also entails keeping an eye on the
    system''s operation and making any required modifications. Additionally, it entails
    testing the connectivity, upgrading the firmware, and making sure that new software
    versions are compatible. This stage also entails keeping an eye on the information
    transmitted to ThingSpeak and resolving any transmission problems. Download :

    model for smart irrigation system. Using an ESP32 microcontroller with large memory
    capacity and enhanced processing capability confers several advantages, especially
    in the area of our smart irrigation system. The selection of an ESP32 microcontroller
    with robust memory capacity and processing capability improves the efficiency,
    responsiveness, and adaptability of our smart irrigation system, supporting the
    optimization of irrigation of crops and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
    4. Results and discussion In this section, we provide a detailed analysis of the
    proposed Smart Irrigation System, including its results and efficiency compared
    to existing scientific papers. We also look at how the system affects agricultural
    sustainability and how it helps provide food security. The innovation of this
    study lies in its integration of cutting-edge technology like embedded system
    cloud computing and the IoT. The system makes it possible to monitor and manage
    irrigation operations in real-time by leveraging IoT devices, sensors, and actuators.
    Utilizing cloud computing enables data storage, analysis, and decision-making,
    which results in enhanced irrigation control and optimum water utilization. This
    novel strategy transforms conventional approaches by improving irrigation operations''
    accuracy, efficacy, and sustainability. Efficiently sent to ThingSpeak platforms
    and the ThingView app, data from simulated sensors represent environmental parameters
    such as temperature and humidity. Data is provided securely regularly, simulating
    sensor updates in real-time, using the MQTT protocol for communication. Cloud
    platforms can be configured to accurately visualize data using graphs and charts,
    enabling real-time monitoring and analysis, just like with field data. 4.1. Experimental
    results The experimental results of the proposed irrigation system are presented
    in Table 3. The table provides continuous measurements of various parameters including
    soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, as well as outputs from the water level
    sensor in centimeters and the water level in percentages. These measurements were
    recorded over a period of seven days. Additionally, Table 3 includes information
    on the status of data transmission to the platform and app, indicating whether
    the data was successfully sent, and the response time of 2 s. It should be noted
    that the weather conditions during the data collection period were normal, with
    no rainfall. These comprehensive measurements provide valuable insights into the
    performance of the smart system, showcasing the variations in soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and water level over the seven-day period. Such data is critical for
    optimizing irrigation strategies and ensuring efficient water management in agricultural
    practices. Cloud computing, in particular the integration of the MathWorks laboratory
    into the ThingSpeak platform of our intelligent irrigation system, improves data
    storage, analysis, and irrigation control decision-making through scalable storage,
    remote access to all data, and real-time analytics on ThingSpeak. This contributes
    to cost-effectiveness, improved security, collaborative management, reliability,
    efficient data processing, collaborative decision-making, and good results. Table

    presents a method for calibrating the moisture sensor used in the research. To
    calibrate the moisture sensor input, a two-point calibration method was used in
    the studies (Ndunagu et al., 2022, Tiglao et al., 2020). Moisture sensor data
    were taken during the first 2 s of the system loop, indicating the lowest and
    maximum predicted values of the readings. The function moisture = map (moisture,
    4095, 2413, 0, 100) was used to do a two-point calibration on the moisture sensor''s
    natural outputs. The function mapping approach is used in the demonstration section
    to calibrate the humidity sensor. A few configurations must be made before the
    ESP32 Microcontroller can be started. The moisture sensor''s minimum and maximum
    readings are defined specifically. Values for the moisture sensor vary from a
    minimum of 4095 to a high of 2413. A function is used to transform the sensor
    value from 0 % to 100 %, with 100 % indicating the maximum value, in order to
    make the reading procedure easier for consumers. The user-friendly interpretation
    of the sensor readings is ensured by this change. Two-point calibration is of
    significant importance in the calibration process of the moisture sensor of our
    intelligent irrigation system. This method involves calibrating the sensor to
    two different moisture levels, typically representing the extremes of the moisture
    spectrum. The importance of using a two-point calibration method lies in its ability
    to improve accuracy, account for variability in soil conditions, account for dynamic
    moisture ranges and allow customization for specific agricultural applications.
    This meticulous calibration approach is fundamental to ensuring the efficiency
    of the smart irrigation system in optimizing water. 4.2. Results on the platform
    in real-time The ThingSpeak cloud receives data obtained by our system. So we
    can use our mobile app or our PC to obtain or download it for free using the platform
    ThingSpeak or the app ThingView. Fig. 9 shows some farm temperature readings displayed
    on the ThingSpeak. The farm owner can now connect to the cloud and see the graphical
    output to check the status of the farm. The maximum value of the temperature read
    is 25.5 °C, and the minimum value is 24.9 °C. On the ThingSpeak platform, Fig.
    10 displays some on-farm air humidity data. The maximum value of the humidity
    read is 35.00 % and the minimum value is 39.4 %. The farm owner may now connect
    to the cloud and examine the farm''s status using the graphical output. Download

    farm is shown in Fig. 11 on ThingSpeak. It shows that the soil was initially dry.
    When the water pump was turned on, the moisture sensor registered around 80 %.
    The range of soil moisture measured ranged from 0 % to 82 %. On the other hand,
    Fig. 12 illustrates how the water level was around 80 % when the irrigation water
    pump was switched on, which caused the water storage to be depleted. The data
    from the moisture sensors combined with the observations of the water level sheds
    light on the dynamic interaction between soil moisture levels, water pump performance,
    and water storage management and offers useful insights into the irrigation process.
    These findings support wise agricultural practices by enabling informed decision-making
    and effective water resource management. Download : Download high-res image (89KB)

    real-time. Every 2 s, the ESP32 microcontroller sends data on the temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and water level to the ThingSpeak IoT analytics platform.
    The farmer may easily access this information via the ThingSpeak channel, giving
    them a simple and precise way to keep an eye on their field. Additionally, the
    data may be exported to an Excel document using the ThingSpeak channel''s “export
    recent data” function, enabling additional analysis and investigation. Additionally,
    an application called ThingView, which is available for free download from the
    Google Play Store, makes it simple to retrieve the data from ThingSpeak on mobile
    devices. The farm owner may remotely access all the data with this smartphone
    application, making it simple and convenient to manage the irrigation system.
    The use of this smart irrigation system is essential because it guarantees precise
    and timely irrigation of agricultural plants, creating the ideal environment for
    plant growth. The field or farm owner''s overall farming experience is considerably
    improved by this method. Further, implementing our smart irrigation system requires
    a high level of technical expertise. The system is designed and implemented by
    specialists before being delivered to farmers. Farmers, meanwhile, benefit from
    a ready-to-use system that requires a minimum of technical knowledge for daily
    operations. The graphical display of the smart irrigation system includes needle
    values that represent the real-time sensor data. Colored sections can be applied
    to various measurement sites (widgets) to improve clarity. A red number on the
    water sensor in the tank, which indicates that the water level is critically low,
    is an example of how red color is used to indicate danger. As illustrated in Fig.
    13, the green color denotes no problems, whereas the yellow color stands in the
    center of problems and no problems, indicating the start of a potentially troublesome
    period. The solution also enables tracking of channel locations and particular
    modifications to channel content. In order to do this, a channel sitemap is created,
    which details the placement of feed data. By inputting the latitude and longitude
    coordinates in the “Channel settings” tab of the channel view, the channel location
    may be displayed. The channel map of our system is shown in Fig. 14, which gives
    a summary of the data''s spatial distribution. These functions and visual representations
    help users gain a deeper knowledge of the system''s data, making it simpler for
    them to recognize urgent circumstances and efficiently monitor channel content.

    a comprehensive display of all the values obtained from our proposed system, including
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water level. The farm owner may simply
    view all the data remotely through their phone thanks to this user-friendly mobile
    application. This strategy is particularly important since watering agricultural
    plants demands close attention. Our Smart Irrigation System seeks to solve this
    by providing an accurate study to guarantee timely and effective plant watering.

    the system''s capabilities, which improve agricultural operations and guarantee
    the health of the farm or field. Download : Download high-res image (468KB) Download

    of observation and testing, it is possible to quantify and demonstrate the decrease
    in water use compared to traditional irrigation techniques. Table 4 may be used
    to show how our intelligent irrigation system, which is based on the IoT and embedded
    technology, lowers the water level: Table 4. Calculated the water usage decrease.1
    System Period Water level (%) Traditional 10 days 100 % Smart Irrigation (IoT)
    10 days 30 % 1 IoT is the acronym of the internet of things. The information gathered
    from the conventional and smart irrigation systems was then compared and examined.
    By subtracting the quantity of water used in a smart irrigation system from the
    amount used in a traditional irrigation system and dividing the result by the
    amount used in a conventional irrigation system, the decrease in water consumption
    can be computed. The water usage of the area''s conventional irrigation system
    should first be monitored and documented. The amount of water utilized during
    a particular time period in this paper''s 10 days was measured using sensors.
    The next step is to install and set up a smart irrigation system based on IoT
    and embedded devices. The system has sensors that can monitor temperature, humidity,
    and other environmental variables including humidity, temperature, moisture, and
    water level. An expected 10-day testing and monitoring period are used to compare
    the smart irrigation system to the conventional irrigation system. The same measurements
    and records are utilized to determine how much water is consumed in a smart irrigation
    system as in a traditional irrigation system. The water level decrease is calculated
    by taking the water level used by the traditional irrigation system (100 %) and
    subtracting the water level used by the smart irrigation system (30 %). The result
    is (100–30)/100, which equals 0.7 or 70 % of the original water level. Reducing
    irrigation water consumption by more than 70 % faces challenges such as potential
    impacts on crops, environmental considerations, climate change adaptation, effective
    soil moisture management, technological limitations, and farmer education. This
    research successfully transforms conventional methodologies by articulating a
    breakthrough in irrigation accuracy and efficiency. It presents a smart irrigation
    system that combines cloud computing, embedded systems, and the IoT. It makes
    use of state-of-the-art sensors, such as DHT22 and water level sensors coupled
    to ESP32, for data transfer to the cloud and real-time monitoring. The accuracy
    and operating efficiency of water-level sensors are enhanced by a new mathematical
    function called linear interpolation. By using 70 % less water, the system that
    has been put in place is in line with environmentally beneficial standards. The
    study explores more general implications for agricultural sustainability and worldwide
    food security, highlighting significant advancements in accuracy and efficacy
    achieved by the suggested smart irrigation system. 4.5. Comparison and discussion
    Table 5 provides a comparative analysis of various IoT-based water use monitoring
    systems, highlighting key functionalities, devices, Parameters, calibration approaches,
    v-models, and their ability to reduce water consumption. The articles included
    in the comparison were selected based on their relevance to water usage monitoring
    and IoT applications. Table 5. Comparison of related research.2 Paper ID Year

    (Pramanik et al., 2022) focuses on an IoT-based water usage monitoring system
    using the Croplytics platform with Arduino Uno, LoRa devices, and a GSM model.
    In comparison, our paper (PS) differs by using the ThingSpeak platform and ESP32
    device to monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water level. Unlike
    paper (Pramanik et al., 2022), our system incorporates sensor calibration, which
    improves data accuracy. In addition, your paper introduces the V Model software
    and helps to reduce water consumption by 70 %, presenting a more advanced and
    comprehensive approach to water conservation. The authors of this work (Abba et
    al., 2019), present an IoT system using Arduino Uno and ThingSpeak to monitor
    humidity, temperature, and soil moisture. Our paper (PS) goes further by using
    ESP32 to improve data collection, covering additional parameters (water level)
    and incorporating sensor calibration for soil moisture and water level measurements.
    This increases the accuracy and reliability of your system''s data. In addition,
    our integration of V Model software and the successful reduction in water consumption
    underlines the depth of our approach beyond what work (Abba et al., 2019) offers.
    The authors of this study (Munir et al., 2021), focus on a water consumption monitoring
    system based on an Android platform with GSM and Arduino Uno models. In contrast,
    our proposed scheme (PS) uses the ESP32 device via the ThingSpeak platform. Our
    system (PS) measures temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water level, providing
    a wider range of data points compared to the study (Munir et al., 2021). The addition
    of sensor calibration and V Model software to our (PS) study improves the accuracy
    and robustness of our solution. On the other hand, the authors of this study (Pasika
    et al., 2020), presented an Arduino Mega-based system using ThingSpeak to monitor
    soil pH, turbidity, temperature, humidity, and water level. Our PS extends its
    capabilities by using the ESP32 to monitor temperature, humidity, soil moisture,
    and water level. The integration of sensor calibration, Model V software, and
    a 70 % reduction in water consumption in our PS system represent developments
    beyond the scope of this study (Pasika et al., 2020). The authors (García et al.,
    2020), presented a research paper in 2020 related to a study of the latest smart
    irrigation techniques to determine the factors observed in existing systems. This
    paper does not use the realisation of the irrigation system including the integration
    of sensors and embedded systems to drive the irrigation. However, our PS use of
    ESP32, full parameter coverage, sensor calibration, V Model software, and reduced
    water consumption contributes to a more sophisticated and impactful system than
    suggested by the study (García et al., 2020). The authors [29] presented a paper
    focusing on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture monitoring using ATMega328
    and NRF24L01. Our PS features by integrating an ESP32 to monitor temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and water level via ThingSpeak. The inclusion of sensor
    calibration, Model V software, and a significant reduction in water consumption
    improve the robustness and efficiency of our solution beyond that proposed in
    the study (Tiglao et al., 2020). The studies conducted by the authors (Abba et
    al., 2019, Tiglao et al., 2020), employed the DHT11 device for temperature and
    humidity measurements. However, this sensor exhibits low accuracy when measuring
    temperatures above zero, rendering decimal value transfer unnecessary and impacting
    agricultural productivity. In contrast, our approach involved utilizing the DHT22
    device which offers the capability of measuring temperatures and humidity, with
    a precision of 0.1 units. This kind of sensor enables more precise and trustworthy
    readings, improving data accuracy and encouraging better agricultural results.
    Our intelligent irrigation system is based on the ESP32, known for its outstanding
    features such as low power consumption, ample memory, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and exceptional
    speed. Moreover, ESP32-based boards are cost-effective and offer analog and digital
    inputs and outputs, making them ideal tools for reading numerous analog input
    values in intelligent farming and Smart Irrigation Systems. The estimated total
    cost of the proposed intelligent irrigation system is approximately US $60, making
    it an affordable and cost-effective solution. This low-cost nature of the system
    aligns with our goal of providing a practical and accessible option, particularly
    for low-income farmers, in contrast to the methods described by the authors in
    systems (Pramanik et al., 2022, Abba et al., 2019). In contrast to conventional
    irrigation methods that rely on groundwater drainage and can lead to excessive
    water consumption and crop flooding, our system utilizes innovative technologies
    to provide precise and demand-based soil irrigation. By adapting to the specific
    water needs of the crops, our system has the potential to significantly reduce
    water usage by more than 70 %. This efficient and targeted approach ensures optimal
    resource utilization while promoting sustainable agriculture practices. None of
    the scientific papers referenced in this study have used the V model. In contrast,
    our paper which used the V model software design, presents a methodical and organized
    approach to software development, significantly improving the overall quality
    of our irrigation system. 4.6. Smart irrigation improves food security The use
    of the IoT, cloud computing, and other cutting-edge technologies in Smart Irrigation
    Systems can have a significant impact on food security as seen in the Fig. 16.
    Here are some of the ways this technology enhances food security: (1) Improved
    Crop Yields: By implementing intelligent irrigation systems based on IoT to provide
    crops with the right quantity of water at the right time, crop yields may be boosted.
    This can help ensure a steady supply of food by reducing the likelihood of crop
    failures caused by droughts or other environmental factors. (2) Improved Water
    Efficiency: Smart irrigation systems based on IoT use information from sensors
    and weather stations to choose the best irrigation schedule, reducing water waste
    and maximizing water efficiency. (3) Remote Access and Control: Through a mobile
    application, smart irrigation systems using IoT can be accessed and operated remotely,
    allowing farmers to check on and make adjustments to their irrigation systems
    even when they are not in their fields. Farmers who live in rural places or who
    have access issues owing to physical restrictions may find this to be of particular
    benefit. (4) Making Decisions Based on Data: Intelligent irrigation systems based
    on IoT gather a lot of information on soil moisture, weather, and crop growth.
    This information may be used to make better decisions about crop planning, irrigation
    schedules, and other aspects that impact crop yields. (5) Climate Change Adaptation:
    Smart irrigation systems based on IoT can assist farmers in adapting to the shifting
    weather patterns brought on by climate change. These devices can assist farmers
    in modifying their irrigation schedules and other management measures to take
    into account such as changes in temperature, precipitation, and other environmental
    factors by giving real-time data on soil moisture and meteorological conditions.

    in smart irrigation systems has the potential to have a significant influence
    on food security. In addition to increasing agricultural yields and water efficiency,
    these technologies also enable remote monitoring and data-driven decision-making,
    all of which may help ensure a more reliable food supply. This essay will examine
    how smart irrigation affects food security and how it may help maintain agriculture.
    The research paper highlighted smart irrigation systems as a groundbreaking approach
    to integrating new technologies like the IoT, embedded systems, and cloud computing.
    One notable innovation is the real-time data transmission to the ThingSpeak cloud
    and the visualization of the data through the ThingView app. This implementation
    allows for seamless monitoring and control of the irrigation system. By leveraging
    these technologies, the paper enables farmers and agricultural stakeholders to
    access vital information about soil moisture, temperature, and other environmental
    parameters in real-time. This innovation improves decision-making processes, enhances
    resource management, and promotes sustainable agricultural practices. The utilization
    of the ThingSpeak cloud and ThingView app for data visualization represents a
    significant advancement in smart agriculture, providing a user-friendly interface
    for efficient irrigation management. This paper presented a mathematical method
    for sensor calibration that brings innovation to the field by ensuring precise
    and reliable measurements. Additionally, the V model software design offers a
    systematic and structured approach to software development, enhancing the overall
    quality of our irrigation system. The paper focus on examining the impact of smart
    irrigation on food security. Better resource management in smart irrigation systems
    results in more sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly agricultural
    practices, with observable benefits in terms of water conservation, energy efficiency,
    crop yield, cost reduction, and overall agricultural sustainability. The analysis
    and interpretation of data in smart agriculture transforms the raw data of sensors
    into actionable information through many functions such as data cleaning and integration,
    application of advanced analytics, providing visual representations, interpreting
    models and providing real-time recommendations to farmers for informed decision-making
    and optimized farming practices. 5. Conclusion and future work In conclusion,
    the article proposed the concept of a “smart irrigation system using embedded
    Systems, IoT, and cloud computing” as an innovative solution to enhance food security
    and promote sustainable agriculture. By harnessing advanced technologies, this
    system aims to optimize irrigation practices, conserve water resources, and support
    long-term agricultural sustainability. The system makes use of cutting-edge technology
    like cloud computing, embedded system, and the IoT to provide real-time monitoring,
    control, and data analysis of irrigation operations. This system supervised real-time
    monitoring of crucial environmental factors such as moisture, humidity, temperature,
    and water levels in smart agriculture practices. The system used the ThingSpeak
    cloud to enable wireless communication between the device and the farm owner,
    enhancing their interaction. Furthermore, the ESP32 controller is linked to both
    a watering pump for soil irrigation and a water pump to refill the tank during
    low water levels. The automated control of the two water pumps is based on the
    readings of various environmental factors. Farmers can access comprehensive farm
    data from anywhere in the world as the sensor data is transmitted in real-time
    to both the ThingSpeak cloud and the ThingView application. This capability allows
    for more precise crop irrigation and increased production. Moreover, this will
    also present a mathematical-driven function known as linear interpolation to calibrate
    the water level sensor in percentage. This smart irrigation system was created
    using the V model software development approach. The solution suggested in this
    paper uses 70 % less water for soil irrigation than conventional techniques. In
    addition, this paper addressed the impact of smart irrigation using the latest
    technology on food security and its ability to support sustainable agriculture.
    The implementation of this smart irrigation system has the potential to revolutionize
    the agricultural sector, addressing key challenges and paving the way for a more
    secure and sustainable food production system. The future work of this paper involves
    integrating modern technologies and utilizing an MQTT broker to enhance the Smart
    Irrigation System. By merging multiple nodes, the system can handle increased
    data analysis and control elements for large-scale applications such as smart
    farms spanning thousands of hectares. The MQTT broker can further optimize irrigation
    strategies and resource management. On the other hand, future work of this paper
    will include the integration of the concept of smart agriculture within the framework
    of cyber-physical human systems. Declaration of competing interest The authors

    in both developed and developing countries. By 2050, the world’s population is
    expected to reach 10 billion, requiring a 70% increase in food production. Sustainable
    agriculture principles must be followed to ensure food security for this growing
    population [ 1, 2]. The objectives of sustainable agriculture are to enhance agricultural
    productivity and reduce the negative effects of outdated farming methods on the
    environment. Developing advanced agricultural practices necessitates substantial
    research and development, especially in the field of irrigation, which accounts
    for 70% of the total freshwater resources. Internet of Things (IoT) and machine
    learning (ML) systems can help monitor, control, and plan irrigation for agricultural
    regions, ensuring efficient use of freshwater resources [ 3, 4]. Smart agriculture
    systems utilize IoT and artificial intelligence to collect and transmit autonomous
    data to data centers. Artificial neural networks and clustering evaluate data
    to make informed decisions, improving the efficiency of agricultural systems [
    5, 6]. A range of IoT and ML irrigation systems have been created with the aim
    of monitoring and controlling irrigation systems. An irrigation system prototype
    has been designed that integrates sensors and an energy module at the top of the
    sprinkler [ 7]. Another example connects a soil moisture sensor to the Internet
    to track soil moisture, while a different irrigation system uses ML to assess
    data on air quality, temperature, and humidity to schedule irrigation [ 8]. The
    management of water is extremely important due to its scarcity. As a substantial
    portion of fresh water is needed for irrigation, this influences agriculture as
    well [ 9]. There are many different types of irrigation methods available, such
    as flood irrigation, trickle irrigation, drip irrigation, and spray irrigation
    [ 10]. Irrigation planning involves monitoring agricultural factors such as temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture. Open-source platforms, such as Arduino UNO, are used
    in irrigation management systems. Efficient management of water resources is crucial
    for increasing yields and meeting future food demand in areas with limited resources
    [ 11]. We can irrigate more areas with the same amount of water if we use a controlled
    irrigation system. In this study, we develop a method for irrigation prediction
    to effectively control intelligent autonomous irrigation. To estimate the amount
    of irrigation required for each crop, the suggested method uses the IoT. We took
    the following four steps: (1) Install the sensors for water, rain, temperature,
    soil moisture, wind, etc. (2) Connecting the sensor set to a data collection system.
    (3) Using an IoT server to transfer data to an application after storing it on
    a ThingSpeak cloud server. (4) Various algorithms, including K-nearest neighbors
    (KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), SVM, and logistic regression (LR),
    are used to analyze the data. This automated irrigation method will be extremely
    useful for large-scale irrigation systems. This will both simplify the labor-intensive
    process of irrigation for plants and improve water management. The concept of
    a related study and the proposed automated irrigation system are presented in
    the article. Section 2 presents a state-of-the-art study on ML, precision irrigation,
    automated irrigation systems, and ML algorithms for irrigation prediction, along
    with comparisons with previous research. Section 3 presents the proposed irrigation
    system design. Section 4 displays the results of the system testing and analysis.
    Future work recommendations are provided in Section 5. The conclusions of the
    suggested study are finally summarized in Section 6. 2. Literature Review This
    section covers the contributions of several researchers in the fields of IoT and
    ML for automated irrigation systems for agriculture. In this research, a ML algorithm-based,
    intelligent, adaptable irrigation technique for smart agriculture is presented.
    For the best possible plant development, it uses sensors for temperature, moisture
    content in the soil, and rainfall. A variety of models, including KNN, LR, neural
    networks, SVM, and NB, are utilized to evaluate the data collected using the node-RED
    platform and MongoDB [ 12]. The IoT and cloud-based architecture are used to analyze
    a smart irrigation system in this article. The device detects the humidity and
    moisture content of the soil; ML methods are used to analyze the data. The system
    uses ML algorithms to forecast the ideal amount of fresh water for crop production,
    which results in significant water savings. The agricultural industry is predicted
    to change due to this technology [ 13]. To solve irrigation-related problems,
    the researcher developed a solution that uses ML and the IoT. Pressure, pH, temperature,
    humidity, and other sensor types are included in the hardware. The pH sensor measures
    the pH of the soil and forecasts water requirements. The aim is to develop automated
    irrigation systems and save water for future usage. Improvements in agricultural
    water efficiency and conservation are the objectives of the initiative [ 14].
    In this, a low-cost and intelligent agricultural irrigation system is presented.
    The constructed prototype uses a hardware sensor and a unit to monitor temperature,
    humidity, and water level. To determine whether to turn on or off the motor, the
    study uses a variety of sensors to collect various readings and values. The IoT-based
    automated system uses applications to establish an independent irrigation system.
    It also sends SMS messages to our mobile devices, providing us with remote updates
    on irrigation field details [ 15]. Research has developed a smart irrigation system
    that estimates the depth of crop water (WUD) for tomato planting based on real-time
    soil moisture data. A central irrigation controller was used to collect the data,
    guaranteeing an accurate irrigation depth at every irrigation event. The experiment
    was carried out in a Northern Chinese greenhouse [ 16]. This research suggests
    that instead of using physical sensors in a smart irrigation system, neural networks
    based on long–short-term memory (LSTM) should be used. The system computes transpiration
    in each field by transmitting temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data via
    physical sensors. LM35 is used for temperature, DHT-22 is used for humidity, and
    a bespoke sensor is used for moisture readings. Real-time data were collected.
    The findings indicate that the neural sensor suggested based on deep learning
    has a high degree of accuracy when predicting real-time data, especially those
    related to wetness, temperature, and humidity. This shows that a neural network
    can improve the performance of physical sensors in agricultural settings, increasing
    the dependability of smart irrigation systems [ 17]. In the research, the researcher
    developed a framework that combines IoT with various metrics and methodologies
    to monitor data related to temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. This approach
    offers farmers the ability to analyze data in real-time, allowing them to monitor
    soil moisture, temperature, and automated irrigation systems more efficiently,
    with reduced use of time and energy, and in decision-making analysis specifically
    designed for farmers [ 18]. A method was developed to increase the efficiency
    of irrigation for cotton crops. Researchers have examined a variety of data sets
    to calculate the exact amount of water required for a particular soil combination.
    A mobile application makes the results of analytical research accessible to farmers
    or other users [ 19]. Table 1 illustrates some more previous research on automated
    irrigation systems for smart agriculture. Table 1  Previous research work and
    future recommendations on automated irrigation system. This article focuses on
    research on an autonomous irrigation management system for agricultural fields.
    The system uses a mobile application for data consultation and analysis in real-time,
    as well as a wireless sensor and actuator network. RF produced the best results
    with an accuracy of 84.6% when ML techniques were employed to estimate the optimal
    timing for water administration. An approach is also included in the system to
    figure out how much water is required for field management. Water management technology
    that is both effective and efficient, as shown by the ability of the system to
    save up to 60% of the water used [ 27]. ML and deep learning technologies can
    be used to improve crop yield and manage irrigation in agriculture. These approaches
    exemplify the fast progress of artificial intelligence in the agricultural industry.
    The concept of smart farming encompasses monitoring all agricultural processes,
    predicting diseases, managing agricultural pests, and automated irrigation [ 28].
    The article presents a machine-learning and IoT-based irrigation system that improves
    efficiency. Sensors on a Raspberry Pi measure soil temperature and moisture content
    using the serial peripheral interface protocol. The NB technique is used to train
    a ML model that regulates the irrigation system with an accuracy of 98.33%. A
    prototype project with a water pump and relay is also built to demonstrate the
    precise operation of the system [ 29]. Table 2 illustrates previous research on
    the automated irrigation system for smart agriculture using ML. Table 2  Previous
    research on supervised machine learning models for automated irrigation system.
    3. Proposed Hybrid Irrigation System One of the essential stages in the production
    of agricultural products is irrigation. Agricultural uses account for around 80%
    of the entire water supply, although the amount of water available varies considerably
    from region to region. The adoption of microirrigation technology takes an hour.
    But farmers still adhere to an old irrigation pattern, which causes a huge loss
    of water. Existing sprinkler systems are not suitable for all crops. The height
    of the sprinkler irrigation is 4 feet, so it cannot irrigate crops greater than
    4 feet. In drip and sprinkler irrigation systems, the pipe structure of the system
    spreads throughout the field, making intercultural operations difficult. Binding
    up the system during harvesting and sawing new crops leads to damage to pipes
    as well as to crops and to a highly labor-consuming process. Damage due to rodents
    is more common in fixed-set irrigation systems. The center pivot irrigation system
    and the linear move irrigation system are constructed of heavy pipes and are complex
    structured. They are not suitable for fields of unusual shapes because of their
    high capital and maintenance requirements. Related research and findings are discussed
    in the literature review, and future work recommendations are shown in Table 1.
    To overcome these problems, we proposed a hybrid irrigation system that would
    be able to automatically irrigate different crops from a remote location. The
    objective of the proposed hybrid irrigation system is to overcome the problems
    of existing systems. The suggested smart irrigation architecture is shown in Figure
    1.    Figure 1  Proposed architecture for smart irrigation. This research has
    developed a smart irrigation system that automatically waters crops without human
    involvement. As a center pivot and linear move irrigation system, it also irrigates
    crops with vertical sprinkles, but in a center pivot and linear move irrigation
    system, farmers need heavy machinery, power supply, or human resources to move
    the system in the field to meet the irrigation requirements. The proposed irrigation
    system is a stable and user-friendly model. It is designed in a T shape, which
    is fixed in the field with some distance, and irrigates the field with sprinklers.
    The system uses moisture sensors to measure the moisture content of the soil in
    fields. When the moisture levels drop below the minimum level, the NodeMCU board
    activates the water pump, providing water to the crop. The water sensor also monitors
    the conditions of the water reservoir, sending signals to the NodeMCU when the
    reservoir is empty. Wind speed sensors measure the wind speed on the farm, while
    rain sensors detect the rain status in the field. The data from soil moisture
    sensors are displayed on an LCD screen. Solenoid valves are embedded to control
    water flow in different farms. If soil moisture drops below the threshold value
    for farm field A, the solenoid valves are activated, while the remaining valves
    remain off. This irrigation system helps farmers irrigate their fields with less
    labor and time. The hybrid irrigation system is built with the ability to automatically
    irrigate crops, considering factors such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture. Taxonomy is used to consider the choice of climatic and soil
    conditions, while our sensor network keeps track of factors, such as temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture. In contrast to the three levels of conventional IoT
    design (application layer, network layer, and perception layer), our proposed
    IoT architecture comprises four layers: application layer, processing layer, transport
    layer, and perception layer. Sensors are included in the physical layer, often
    referred to as the perception layer, to collect data such as soil moisture level,
    air humidity and temperature, rainfall level and wind speed. Using networks like
    Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G, and LAN, sensing data that has already been acquired is sent from
    the transport layer to the processing layer. The transport layer sends massive
    amounts of data to the processing layer, which stores, analyzes, and processes
    it. It uses modern tools, such as cloud servers and the IoT. The main goal of
    the application layer is to provide user-specific application services. Our system
    manages the sensors, GSM module, ThingSpeak cloud server, IoT server, Android
    application (Blynk application), and other components. We have been able to prepare
    our system for complete autonomy thanks to these technologies. 3.1. Architecture
    of the Proposed System and Working Principals This research developed a method
    for automatic watering by measuring ground moisture values. This smart irrigation
    system allows farmers to control and adjust irrigation with fewer human resources.
    Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the hybrid irrigation system.    Figure 2  System
    block diagram. The NodeMCU is an open-source platform that utilizes the ESP8266
    to facilitate the connection of devices and enable the transmission of data via
    the Wi-Fi protocol. Different types of sensors are used to control the irrigation
    system and monitor the field. Sensors such as soil moisture sensor, wind sensor,
    water level sensor, rain detection sensor, temperature, and humidity sensor, etc.,
    node MCU 8266 is used in this prototype as main board. A soil moisture sensor
    is used to measure soil moisture content in the field. The required soil moisture
    threshold value is described, and if soil moisture exceeds or decreases from the
    threshold value, the soil moisture sensor will send the current soil moisture
    value to the server through the node MCU. The updated current soil moisture value
    is sent to the application, and the farmer can start irrigation according to the
    minimum water requirements of the crops from a remote location automatically.
    Water sensor is utilized to monitor the water status at the dam. If the water
    dam is empty, then it will send the empty signals to the application, and at the
    same time, a buzzer is used to indicate an empty water dam if someone is around
    the field to shut down the motor manual. A wind speed sensor is used to measure
    the wind speed. Wind speed plays an important role in sprinkler water, so if wind
    speed is high, the farmer can turn off the motor to reduce water waste. Solenoid
    valves control water flow on different farms. If soil moisture decreases below
    the threshold value for a farm field, solenoid valves activate for that farm,
    while the remaining valves remain off for other farms. An LCD screen is used to
    display soil moisture from all fields for quick review of soil moisture at field
    level. This innovative approach benefits farmers who struggle to irrigate crops.
    After the sensors were attached to the board, we started programing the board
    to control the sensors in a way that made it possible for different types of data
    to be collected and transferred in real-time. Then, we utilized the ThingSpeak
    cloud server to ensure data storage, and we used the application to monitor and
    operate the irrigation system. We then aggregated several months of data so that
    we could train it to anticipate when to start or stop pumping and close the valve.
    3.2. System Working Flowchart The flowchart of the proposed system provides the
    basic principles of the system and an overview, as shown in Figure 3.    Figure
    3  Working flowchart system. The working steps are as follows: (1) In Step 2,
    the system analyzes the sensor data. (2) In Step 3, the node MCU esp8266 may be
    used to initialize the system. (3) Step 4: The server/application gets information
    from numerous sensors deployed in the agricultural field, including the soil moisture
    sensor, wind sensor, humidity sensor, rain sensor, and water level sensor. (4)
    In Step 5, the soil moisture sensor continuously measures the soil moisture content.
    If the soil moisture is below the required threshold level, the signals are sent
    to the application and the node MCU. The solenoid valves attached to that soil
    moisture sensor will turn on when the update is transmitted to the node MCU, but
    the solenoid valves connected to other sensors will stay optimal. (5) In Step
    6, the motor that is attached to the relay will be turned on either through the
    application or manually. (6) In Step 7, when the amount of soil moisture reaches
    the required threshold level, the relay will automatically turn the motor off
    and the solenoid valves off. (7) In Step 8, the other sensors continuously read
    the data and transmit it to the server or application. For example, a water level
    sensor monitors the water level in the dam; if the dam is empty, the application
    is updated with an empty status, and the buzzer starts beeping. The wind speed
    sensor and the temperature sensor continuously monitor the wind speed and temperature
    of the field because both factors play an important role in irrigation. High temperatures
    and wind speeds cause water loss during irrigation. By monitoring the field, irrigation
    can be scheduled according to temperature and wind speed. (8) In Step 9, once
    Steps 7 and 8 have been completed, the system will go to Step 2. (9) In Step 10,
    the system reads the data from the field and transmits it to the application.
    This operation will continue until the system’s input power is turned off. 3.3.
    Hybrid Irrigation System Design 3.3.1. Hardware Implementation To develop the
    hybrid irrigation system, few steps are performed: Hybrid irrigation model structure
    is shown in Figure 4.    Figure 4  Hybrid irrigation model structure. (1) The
    material is cut into the desired length dimension of the structure is 1.2 into
    0.17 into 0.4 m. (2) The project structure is designed in upside down U-shape
    structure and T-shape hybrid irrigation system. (3) Eight millimeters water pipe
    is used as a main supply pipe. Six millimeters water pipe is used for subpipeline
    for supply the water to field. (4) T and L shape pipe connectors are used to connect
    the subpipe with main pipes and solenoid valves. 3.3.2. Software Implementation
    As mentioned previously, the NodeMCU requires a supply voltage of 5 V DC to operate
    the circuit components. The DHT 11 sensor data pin is connected to the node MCU
    pin D2 and GND and VCC to (ground, 3.3 V), soil moisture sensor connected to the
    A0 pin of the Arduino Uno and connected with the D4 pin of the node MCU, and GND,
    VCC pin connected with the ground pin, 3.3 V, soil moisture sensor b, connected
    to the A1 pin of the Arduino Uno and connected with the D8 pin of the node MCU,
    and GND, VCC pin connected with the pin ground, 3.3 V. The rain detection sensor
    is linked to the node MCU via pin D5. The water sensor is connected to that digital
    pin of node MCU D6 and the buzzer is connected to the digital pin of node MCU
    D7. If the water level is low, the D7 pin gets a signal and the buzzer will beep
    out. LCD display connected with the digital pins of the Arduino Uno RS = 7, EN = 6,
    D4 = 5, D5 = 4, D6 = 3, D7 = 2. Wind speed sensor connected to the analog pin
    of node MCU A0. To connect the water pump motor and the solenoid valves, we will
    need a relay module. Relay 1 will take the signal input value from soil moisture
    sensor 1 and relay 2 will take the signal from soil moisture sensor2. Relay 1
    is connected to the digital pin of Arduino D8 and relay 2 is connected to the
    digital pin of Arduino Uno D9. Relay 1 will control the two solenoid valves, solenoid
    valve 1A and solenoid valve 1B, and relay will control the two solenoid valves
    called solenoid valves 2A and 2B. The motor is connected to the third relay and
    the relay is connected to the digital pin D1 of the node MCU. Transistors and
    resistors are used to regulate the voltage within a range of 3-5 volts to safeguard
    sensors and equipment from excessive voltage fluctuations. For the operation of
    the system, we used 5 volts of DC power for the node MCU and 2 volts of power
    for the Arduino Uno, along with one USB cable to complete the power supply to
    the Arduino Uno. Twelve volt power supply is connected with the solenoid valves
    and motor and with the relays. To establish the communication between hardware
    and the blink application, we need to establish the communication between the
    hardware and the blink application. We need to set the virtual connection between
    the sensors and the blink application. Data from DHT 11 sensors were sent to the
    blynk server using the virtual connection V0, V1, and V2. The rain sensor connected
    to the virtual pin V6 and the water sensor is connected to the virtual pin V7
    soil moisture one connected to the virtual and pin V8 8 and the soil moisture
    sensor 2 connected to the virtual pin V9. Wind speed sensor pin is connected to
    the virtual pin V4 and V5, and the water pump relay is connected with the virtual
    V3 pin to control the water motor. Sensor’s connectivity with node MCU and Arduino
    Uno R3 is represented in Figure 5. Several tools are included in the software
    design method that are necessary for the system to function properly. A few of
    them are as follows:    Figure 5  Sensors connectivity with node MCU and Arduino
    Uno R3. (1) Firmware developed using C/C++ with the Arduino IDE. (2) The ThingSpeak
    cloud server was used to collect and store data for further analysis. (3) Data
    visualization for field control and monitoring is done using the Blynk application.
    (4) Real-time data are collected and sent to the ThingSpeak cloud server after
    the same code is updated to send data to the Blynk application to control and
    monitor sensor data automatically through the application. (5) To simplify the
    access and control of the system, a Wi-Fi or Internet service provider is used.
    (6) For data analysis, Jupiter Notebook and Anaconda are used. 3.3.3. Hybrid Irrigation
    System Working Application An Android application is being developed for farmers
    to monitor and control the hybrid irrigation system. Input parameters such as
    soil moisture, wind speed, rain status, water, temperature, and humidity are displayed
    in an application. The farmer will be able to monitor and control field conditions
    at any time and from anywhere. With the help of this application, the farmer will
    control the motor switch and irrigate the crop according to the requirements and
    availability of water. The mobile application is shown in Figure 6.    Figure
    6  Blynk smart irrigation application. 4. Machine Learning Analysis Algorithms
    This section presents supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze the performance
    of the automated irrigation system. Supervised learning is a method where models
    are trained on a training data set to produce the desired output. This process
    involves acquiring knowledge and improving performance over time. The model’s
    precision is evaluated using a loss function, and adjustments are made until the
    error is reduced. This research utilizes a set of supervised machine learning
    algorithms such as LR, KNN, support vector machine (SVM), NB, and RF classifiers.
    Table 2 presents the results of previous research studies that utilized supervised
    machine learning techniques to analyze a smart irrigation system. The research
    presents a machine learning-based irrigation strategy for smart agriculture using
    sensors like soil humidity, temperature, and rain. The node-RED platform and MongoDB
    collect data, with KNN achieving 98.3% accuracy. A web application visualizes
    and supervises the environment [ 12]. This study examines a smart irrigation system
    that utilizes the IoT and a cloud-based architecture. This technology is developed
    to monitor the moisture and humidity content of the soil and then use several
    machine learning algorithms for analyzing the data in the cloud. Farmers receive
    accurate information on water content requirements. Intelligent irrigation may
    help farmers use less water [ 13]. In this research, we proposed a new irrigation
    model (T-shaped sprinkler irrigation). Different types of sensors are used to
    collect data from the field, like soil moisture sensors, wind sensors, temperature
    sensors, rain sensors, water level sensors, etc. All sensors are connected to
    the node MCU and UNO to control and collect data from the field. Data collected
    from the agriculture field is stored on the ThingsSpeak cloud server. A total
    of 3,000 lines of data are collected for analysis using machine learning algorithms
    to calculate the accuracy of the working automated irrigation system. From the
    collected data, 80% was used for training purposes, and 20% was used for testing
    the algorithms. After collecting the data for analysis, we developed an application
    for monitoring and controlling the irrigation. The algorithms used for the classification
    of automated hybrid irrigation systems are described below. 4.1. Support Vector
    Machine SVM is a machine learning technique that is used for classification and
    regression tasks and is specifically designed to identify objects within given
    data sets. This method effectively divides n-dimensional spaces into various classes,
    making data entry efficient. The research used the kernel trick mechanism of SVMs
    for classification purposes. This technique includes the transformation of 2D
    nonlinear separable data sets into higher dimensions, such as three, four, or
    10 dimensions [ 30]: 4.2. Naïve Bayes Thomas Bayes (1702–1761) developed the Naïve
    Bayesian approach to probabilistic machine learning, which is based on the Bayes
    theorem. The likelihood of A occurring given that B has already happened can be
    used to describe this theorem. Considering X = (x1,…, xn) is the features, and
    Y is the class variable, in this sentence. The NB algorithm is unique in that
    it assumes that each characteristic is independent of the others and that modifying
    one feature will not affect any other. Despite appearing straightforward, NB has
    turned out to be a useful classification system: 4.3. Logistic Regression LR is
    a supervised machine-learning method used for classification tasks. This method
    is used to determine the probability of the dependent variable. The target variable
    has a binary nature, indicating that it may only assume one of two potential classes:
    success (represented by 1 or yes) or failure (represented by 0 or no). The classification
    of this may be categorized into three main types: binary or binomial, multinomial,
    and ordinal. The equation for linear regression may be expressed as the equation
    of a straight line: 4.4. K-Nearest Neighbors The KNN method is a supervised learning
    approach often used in machine learning. The algorithm operates on the assumption
    that there exists a degree of similarity between the newly acquired data and the
    data that are already accessible. When assigning the newly acquired data to the
    category that exhibits the highest degree of similarity with the existing categories,
    the KNN algorithm uses the Manhattan equation to calculate the distance within
    this framework. The formula for the Manhattan distance is shown in Equation (4)
    [ 12]: 4.5. Random Forest Ensemble learning is a powerful teaching strategy. For
    categorization purposes, RF is commonly used. Each decision tree’s planned output
    is represented by the forest’s output, and the categorization is based on the
    information gathered from the many decision trees created during training. Random
    forest decreases variance in the final model, improves performance, and controls
    overfitting by building decision trees using random samples of the training data
    [ 8]. 4.6. Collecting and Storing Data Automated modeling and continuous collection
    of real-time measurements of environmental factors, such as soil moisture levels,
    temperature, humidity, and pump activity, were taken into consideration when developing
    the hybrid smart irrigation system based on the IoT. To perform the analysis,
    the ThingSpeak cloud server is used to collect data from all sensors. We began
    implementing these devices in various environments with various soil conditions
    in the mass collection process using IoT technologies, which are made up of many
    autonomous devices in the form of sensors capable of self-organization and working
    to collect information. It was built to distribute the data using an algorithm
    to provide an essential interface during the project. This was a practically complete
    implementation of our data set. Data collected from different sensors with different
    ranges are discussed below. (1) Soil moisture data: As shown in Table 3, these
    data are generated by an analog sensor over a range of values between 0 and 1,023.
    We can see that the smallest value is 314.51 and the maximum value is 984.82,
    meaning that the average value is 654.5. (2) Temperature data: A DHT11 temperature
    sensor was used to collect air temperature data from the environment in the form
    of Celsius. We can observe that the average temperature throughout the collected
    months was 26.24, exceeding both its upper and lower limitations. The minimum
    value during this time was 18.00, and the highest temperature during this time
    was 38.99. (3) Data on air humidity: We were able to acquire data on air humidity
    using the same temperature sensor that helped with collecting air temperature
    values, and the following is an analysis of those data. The average was 66.4%
    while collecting the massive amount of data, with the lowest value being 38% and
    the highest value being 81.26%. Table 3  Analysis data set. The study suggests
    an automated design based on the peer-to-peer concept, using data that can be
    classified with values that vary from 0 to 1. The final design was implemented
    to show its feasibility and prevent major problems. The data collected from all
    sensors are shown in Table 3. 4.7. Results and Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms
    Any machine learning method, including KNN, NB, LR, RF, and SVMs, which are all
    classification dilemma handling algorithms, can forecast the degree of irrigation
    demand. In this paper, all the abovementioned techniques are used to analyze the
    collected data. For experimental analysis, a collection of 3,000 data recordings
    was collected. These factors include soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the water pump for irrigation decision-making. Five machine learning algorithms,
    KNN, NB, LR, RF, and SVMs, were utilized in an experimental investigation. Two
    different colors are used to represent the graph. Red colors are used to represent
    0, and blue colors represent 1. To achieve better accuracy and application modeling,
    the data available on soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, and motor working
    status are divided into two sets: the training data set and the testing data set.
    The training set contains 80% of the data, and 20% is used for testing and validation.
    The training data set is used to train the different machine learning algorithms,
    and the testing data set is used to test the models, which will help to find the
    accuracy of their workings and the best machine learning algorithm. Figure 7 represents
    the training data and test data in a graphical view.    Figure 7  Graph displays
    training and test data. The real-time collected data from field are stored for
    analysis using different machine learning algorithms. The data collection process
    is done on a ThingSpeak cloud server and published on Mendeley Data [ 37]. Table
    3 shows the data for making training predictions, looking at presorted data, and
    showing outcomes. After analyzing all five machine learning algorithms, the results
    from the models used in this study are shown together with their accuracy and
    mean square error (RMSE) in Table 4. The same outcome is shown in Figure 8, as
    in a graph.    Figure 8  The output of our models is shown in a graph. Table 4  Models
    anàlisis result. (1) The output of the KNN model is shown in Line 1, where the
    corresponding red and blue colors of the training and testing sets stand in for
    the pumping points between “0” and “1.” All the data points supplied in red and
    green are shown to be integrated into their surroundings by the model, respectively.
    The model’s rate of accuracy in describing the outcomes is 98.3%. (2) Line 2 displays
    a 99.8% accuracy rate and a 0.16 means-square error for the RF model. (3) Line
    3 shows the results of the NB model with a 98.8% accuracy rate and a 0.16 means-square
    error. (4) In Line 4, where the SVM model’s results are displayed and as a result,
    the mean square error is 0.66 and the accuracy rate is 99.3%. (5) Finally, a LR
    model with a mean square error that is very nearly 0.5 and a rate of accuracy
    of 99.5%. The accuracy of ML algorithms is determined through training and validation
    processes. Various machine learning algorithms provide satisfactory results after
    performing analysis of the collected data. As we can see, the accuracy rates of
    the NB and RF model of 98.8% and the MSE of 0.16 are higher compared to KNN, SVM,
    and LR with successive results: (98.3%/1.66), (99.3%/0.66), and (99.5%/0.5), respectively.
    5. Future Work Recommendations To increase the efficiency of the system, some
    recommendations are listed for future research work: (1) To maintain the soil
    quality, there is a need to monitor soil salt rate and pH level of the soil. (2)
    To increase the crop production to fulfill the future needs, controlling and monitoring
    of the fertilization process are required to be utilized with the existing smart
    irrigation process. (3) Improvement of the system is done by adding new controllers
    and sensors to increase the stability, reliability, structure, and working efficiency
    of the system. (4) Artificial intelligent system will be installed with the irrigation
    system to predict the user action, rainfall condition patterns, and time to harvest
    extra. (5) To estimate the water requirement for irrigation process, water meter
    can be installed in the irrigation systems. (6) In this project, motor is controlled
    from mobile application, fully automated motor system should be installed. (7)
    Cameras can be used for detecting the deeds and for controlling and monitoring
    the plant growth. (8) Alarm system can be installed in the smart agriculture system
    for alerting the farmers regarding the fire and the any movement in the agriculture
    field. This can be achieved using the fire sensor and motion detector sensor.
    (9) Decision making can be done using the big data and artificial intelligent
    technologies. These technologies will help the smart irrigation for past and future
    data prediction in the IoT system. 6. Conclusion Increased production is an important
    first step since it will be necessary to meet the projected 70% rise in global
    food consumption by 2050. The management of water consumption for irrigation is
    another aspect of it. In this research, a hybrid irrigation system is suggested.
    Three modules make up our suggested approach to smart irrigation: As the first
    module, the sensor network identifies variables affecting the requirement for
    water. We use sensors such as DHT11, a capacitive soil moisture sensor, a wind
    sensor, a rain sensor, and a water level sensor to measure temperature, soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity in the air, wind speed, rain status, and reservoir water
    level. In the second module, we utilize the ThingSpeak cloud server and the Bylnk
    cloud server as IoT servers to send and receive data. In the third module, we
    used machine learning algorithms to analyze the data and determine how accurate
    the decision-making process was to determine the need for irrigation. KNN, NB,
    LR, and RF were just a few of the models we used to analyze the data we collected.
    When comparing the accuracy rates and mean squared errors of different models,
    the NB and RF models have an accuracy rate of 98.8% and MSE of 0.16. In comparison,
    the KNN, SVM, and logistic regression models have accuracy rates of 98.3%, 99.3%,
    and 99.5%, with corresponding MSE values of 1.66, 0.66, and 0.5, respectively.

  description: Peasant family farming is one of the main suppliers and is responsible
    for guaranteeing food sovereignty. A particular interest is given to the functioning
    of the productive system, which seeks to determine, through the analysis of critical
    points and thresholds, to define sustainable alternatives, translating the general
    principles of sustainability into definitions and operational practices. The objective
    of this study was to valuate family farming production systems through productive
    thresholds with the purpose of proposing sustainable alternatives for the improvement
    of the agricultural system in the Penipe canton. The methodology of this study
    included the establishment and generation of attributes, diagnostic criteria,
    and critical points to make a comparison with the productive thresholds, applied
    to nine farms representative of the three productive typologies. In this study,
    the three production systems of the Penipe canton were evaluated. We proposed
    alternatives for each of them, such as the implementation of new agroecological
    management strategies, the generation of organic fertilizers, the production of
    bio inputs, the strengthening of interdisciplinary approaches through the adoption
    of technological innovations and research, the increased participation of different
    owners throughout the production process, and the promotion of associativity,
    which provides the design of new alternative production systems. In conclusion,
    specialized family farming poses alternatives for improvement in terms of the
    provision of quality seeds, technical management, greater management, and government
    support. Diversified family agriculture will be ontained by government management
    and execution, training, adoption of innovations, dependence on external resources,
    crop risk, yields, access to credit. In the productive aspect, deficiencies were
    found in root development, pending involvement, irrigation water, organic matter,
    soil cover, and subsistence family agriculture, followed by land tenure and occupation,
    social connection, government management and execution, training, adoption of
    innovations, dependence on external resources, crop risk, yields, access to credit,
    as well as productive aspect deficiencies in root development, affectation of
    the slope, irrigation water, drainage, organic matter, soil cover, management,
    and plant development.

    that the world population will reach 9.15 billion by 2050, with an increase of
    another 2 billion, while the area that can be added to arable land will only be
    4% [15]. And according to a paper published in 2018 by the World Government Summit,
    “Population growth = more food. The same paper estimated that the world''s population
    will increase to 10 billion in 2050 [1, 7]. Due to the increasing world population
    and the challenges facing the agricultural sector (which will be discussed below),
    it is not possible to achieve agricultural practices with the required efficiency
    except by using the latest technological solutions, relying on modern agricultural
    techniques to improve resources and increase consumer demand, as well as high
    quality standards such as food safety, security, and traceability. Agricultural
    production needs many activities, such as soil monitoring, temperature, relative
    humidity, vegetation conditions, carbon dioxide levels, pest control, supply management,
    and infrastructure. IoT-based technology can add value in terms of quality, sustainability,
    and production increase as it performs a range of operations and helps with decision-making
    [7]. The goal of this research is to use fuzzy logic to integrate human informal
    knowledge into control techniques for protected agriculture. Early prediction
    of plant disease using an ANN-based system, networking of smart sensors, and IoT
    technology networking to facilitate and control large amounts of data, as well
    as collecting the data from sensors and integrating them in real-time to allow
    monitoring and control from anywhere and at any time by all process participants
    and also calculating biotic and abiotic stresses using UAVs and multispectral
    cameras Smart control of plant irrigation and fertilization using ANN, These It
    is considered one of the main questions of this research. However The main idea
    or focus of the current study program is to implement the Industry 4.0 strategy
    in farming through the integration of Internet of Things (IOT), ANN, fuzzy logic
    and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into the industry''s infrastructure
    to make it possible to achieve the following goals and milestones: Using fuzzy
    logic, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things in agriculture has
    many advantages for helping and developing agriculture, and it will also facilitate
    farms in reducing manufacturing costs and thus increasing profitability and sustainability
    [3]. The research will make it possible to include human informal knowledge into
    the control strategy using fuzzy logic, creating human-like control over the greenhouses''
    parameters. With the combined application of artificial intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of things (IoT), it will be easier to reach a higher level of efficiency
    in the use of resources like water, fertiliser, pesticides, energy sources, etc.
    On the farm, (IoT applications will lead to environmental protection). Also, this
    study dealt with the use of fuzzy logic techniques, which will enable the integration
    of informal human knowledge into the control strategy, thus developing human-like
    control of the parameters of farm entities (greenhouses). Through the joint use
    of AI and IoT, they will facilitate an enhanced level of efficiency in the use
    of water, fertilizers, pesticides, energy sources, etc. on the farm (artificial
    intelligence (AI), and IoT applications will protect the environment). This study
    also focused on the importance of integrating technology. The research enables
    farms to adopt more effective environmental protection strategies. by combining
    fuzzy logic and AI technology. However, IoT is a key component of smart farming
    as well, as this study shows. This is considered one of the main problems in this
    sector, and this study seeks solutions to these problems to enable farmers to
    use modern agricultural industry technology on their farms as well as provide
    practical steps to agricultural companies. It also gives the farmers solutions
    and good ideas for the researchers about how to pay attention to this important
    sector. These are the main issues addressed in this study. Also, the paper presents
    a rationalization of the benefits and useful information about Industry 4.0 as
    well as the obstacles related to the implementation of the latest technological
    solutions in smart agriculture. The importance of this research lies in the fact
    that it provides important technological solutions for the significance of using
    Industry 4.0 in the agriculture sector, particularly using IOT, AI, and fuzzy
    logic in smart farming, as well as recommending researchers pay attention to this
    important sector. It will also enable farms to lead in adopting more effective
    environmental protection strategies through the combined use of fuzzy logic and
    AI techniques. This is one of the most important technical recommendations that
    must be worked on and developed. 2 Previous Research The widespread use of wireless
    communication will raise the bar for agricultural automation, and wireless communication
    will alter communication standards. Sensor networks are defined by a variety of
    IEEE standards, including IEEE 802.15.1 PAN/Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4 ZigBee, and
    many others. These standards must be understood when developing sensor network
    applications. The use of the IPV6 Internet Protocol for wireless communication
    and a significant amount of hardware to establish a WSN are currently under debate.
    Precision agriculture and the creation of optimal strategies are both made feasible
    by using WSN. However, the IoT concept has made it possible to build a network
    of intelligent sensors that can quickly and effectively cover large areas. The
    IOT gateway has been forked by the authors, Sridevi Navulur et al., into various
    nodes such as actuators, sensors, interfaces, and wireless links that enable communication
    between them [26]. To monitor agricultural land and alert farmers via email or
    SMS or if the system detects any anomalies, Kodali et al. presented the Losant
    platform [20, 21]. An automated irrigation system that uses the GPRS module as
    a communication tool was created by Gutiérrez-Rodrguez et al. [10]. The system
    has been programmed into a microprocessor-based gateway that regulates the flow
    of water and has the system encoded into it. It has been shown that the water
    savings are 90% greater than the irrigation technique used traditionally. Kim
    et al. used a distributed wireless network to remotely sense and control irrigation
    processes [27]. To decrease human intervention, time, and cost while improving
    efficiency, productivity, and the global market. Malavade et al. focused on the
    IoT''s impact in agriculture and how it results in smart framing [23]. Artificial
    neural networks (ANN) have recently been used by the agricultural industry due
    to their advantages over conventional control systems. Artificial neural networks
    can predict the behaviour of the system through the training process [11]. Gliever
    and Slaughter utilized ANN to recognize weeds in crops. The authors, Maier et
    al., utilized artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict water resource variables
    [22]. To send data to the server so that domain operators can make appropriate
    decisions [30], Song & He et al. combined expert systems and artificial neural
    networks to estimate the nutritional value of crops, while Ravichandran & Koteshwari
    suggested using ANN algorithms for crop. They also suggested an expert farming
    system that uses IoT to send data to the server so that domain operators can make
    suitable decisions [30]. The effectiveness of the model depended on the number
    of hidden layers. To assess soil moisture in the Badi fields with significantly
    less meteorological data, two ANN models were created. By examining the observed
    and estimated soil moisture values, both models were proven to be accurate. It
    led to a more efficient use of less meteorological data, a lower consumption of
    labor and time, and an accurate and trustworthy estimation of soil moisture in
    rice fields [2]. Hinnell et al. [12], in their discussion of drip irrigation systems,
    mention that ANNs have been developed to predict the spatial distribution of groundwater
    [12]. The membership function of each system variable used in fuzzy logic is an
    effective technique for representing informal knowledge [13, 14]. Sannakki et
    al. created a novel technique for classifying leaf diseases that separates the
    healthy from the diseased portions of the leaf with the help of image segmentation
    and a set of k means [29]. To determine the ideal N fertiliser rates based on
    field and crop variables, Tremblay et al. developed the fuzzy inference system
    (FIS) [25]. Based on the weather data, the model predicted plant illnesses [16].
    The technique was created to prevent diseases in plants because they only appear
    when the temperature and humidity in the atmosphere are within a specified range.
    Wall and King created an intelligent system that uses field temperature and humidity
    sensors to control sprinkler valves [14, 17]. A distributed irrigation system
    that measures soil moisture was developed by Miranda et al. [3, 15], and Greenhouse
    developed a multi-variable fuzzy controller for the Greenhouse system. The developed
    fuzzy inference engine integrates the correlation of input variables and incorporates
    informal knowledge from field experts [14]. 3 Definition of Industry 4.0 A paper
    was proposed in 2011 titled “Industry 4.0: Intelligent Manufacturing of the Future.”
    Industry 4.0 is defined as “the name of the current trend of automation and data
    exchange in manufacturing technologies, including smart factory construction,
    the IoT, cloud computing, cognitive computing, and electronic physical systems”
    [12, 22, 27]. Industry 4.0 refers to the technological evolution from embedded
    systems to electronic physical systems [31]. Note that there are many definitions
    for “industry 4.0”, and not all the definitions are the same, but “industry 4.0”
    is also known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution [1]. Decentralized intelligence
    helps create intelligent networks and manage autonomous operations, with the interaction
    of the real and virtual worlds representing a new and important aspect of the
    manufacturing and production process. The first industrial revolution began in
    the late eighteenth century in Britain, enabling the mass production of water
    and steam power rather than human and animal power. A century after the first
    Industrial Revolution, Industrial 2.0 began, introducing assembly lines and the
    use of oil, gas, and electric power as important energy sources in the industry,
    along with more advanced communications by telephone and telegraph and a certain
    degree of automation of manufacturing processes [28]. The third industrial revolution
    began in the mid-twentieth century, contributing to the manufacture of computers,
    advanced communications, and data analysis [31]. In addition, the digitization
    of factories has started with the integration of control units (PLCs) into machines
    to automate certain processes and collect and exchange data. The world is currently
    experiencing the fourth industrial revolution, which is the latest transformation
    in the industrial sector. (Increasing automation and the use of smart machines
    and smart factories), this data helps produce more efficient and productive goods.
    Flexibility is improved so that manufacturers can meet customer demands with mass
    customization; in pursuit of efficiency, by collecting more data from the factory
    floor and combining it with other enterprise operational data, a smart factory
    can achieve information transparency and better decision-making. The Fifth Industrial
    Revolution (Industry 0.5) is expected to bring humans back to the centre of operations
    through a human-electronic-physical system of value creation [28]. Tables 1 and
    2 show the development roadmap of industrial and agricultural revolutions from
    the 18th century up to date. Table 3 shows the concepts of Industry 4.0 technology
    and Agriculture 4.0 technology. Table 1. The history of industry revolutions from
    steam to sensors [18, 28]. Full size table Table 2. The history of agriculture
    revolutions from 18th century up today [18, 28, 32]. Full size table The agricultural
    revolution brought an important shift in human history and helped in the development
    of agriculture and the domestication of plants and animals. It also enabled people
    to stay in their places and establish permanent and stable settlements, which
    helped civilization development (1960s to the early 2000s). Table 3. The concepts
    of industrial and agricultural revolution technologies [1]. Full size table 4
    Agriculture 4.0 and Food Industry Despite the big evolution in the agricultural
    field, there are many issues and challenges that need to be addressed, such as
    environmental issues, a lack of digitalization, and the issue of food safety.
    Industry 4.0 was marked by the synthesis of all emerging technologies, bringing
    together the IoT (IoT), robotics, big data, and blockchain technology [7], Using
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Autonomous Robotic Systems (ARS), Cloud Computing
    (CC), Simulation and System Integration (SI), Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), Digital
    Twin (DT), and Additive Manufacturing (AM), industry can be digitalized and make
    agriculture smarter. The integration of Industry 4.0 and agriculture provides
    the opportunity to transform industrial agriculture into Agriculture 4.0, or the
    “next generation”, also called “digital agriculture.” Agriculture 4.0 can be achieved
    by collecting precise variables in real-time as well as processing and analysing
    data related to the agricultural industry from food production, processing, and
    distribution to consumer use [1]. Such a smart agro system would greatly improve
    productivity, food supply chain efficiency, natural resource utilization and food
    safety [7, 19]. Sensors are used to detect crop stages, recommend timely inputs
    and treatments, and control the level of irrigation. The food industry needs more
    research on food security, transparency, and the required documentation. Smart
    sensors are used as a tracking system in addition to collecting human and product
    data. Agriculture 4.0 means a transformation of the production infrastructure:
    it contributes to the creation of connected farms, new production equipment, machinery,
    and connected tractors, enabling increased productivity, quality, and environmental
    protection [19]. Smart agriculture concept is shown below in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Smart
    agriculture concept [1]. Full size image 5 From Industry 4.0 Toward Agriculture
    4.0 The methodology behind this study is to develop a smart farm prototype using
    digital technologies, implementing the industry 4.0 strategy in farming. The study
    also identifies challenges and evaluates unsolved problems, potential applications,
    and the uses of AI and architectures for the IoT in the agricultural industry.
    With the help of Internet of Things (IoT), fuzzy logic, and artificial neural
    networks (ANN) technologies, the study will develop an integrated digital tool
    that will allow the agricultural sector to collect, process, and transmit data
    as well as take independent decisions and actions based on incorporated informal
    knowledge obtained through the use of fuzzy logic without the need for human intervention
    [10]. The Internet of Things provides the communications infrastructure required
    to connect and link smart devices to user-mobile devices over the Internet, such
    as sensors, vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles to user-mobile devices [5].
    This study also highlights many of the challenges exposed to contemporary agriculture,
    such as the continually increasing demand for quality food, shortages of labour
    and arable land, increased soil contamination, irrigation water reduction, and
    loss of yields due to plant diseases and pests [7]. Along with this, the agricultural
    sector is currently facing difficulties brought on by climate change, which have
    increased existing inefficiencies in the field. These are besides the challenges
    the agricultural industry currently faces due to global climate change, which
    has added to the inefficiencies of the agricultural industry. In such circumstances,
    to maintain efficiency, quality food, and healthy and sustainable production and
    cultivation of healthy food Environmentally, the agricultural industry needs to
    invest in new techniques and infrastructure to transform into a smart industry
    comprised of smart farms capable of responding to challenges through lean operations
    supported by industrial digital technologies (IDTs), irrigation water reduction,
    increased soil contamination, and yield loss due to plant diseases and pests [4,
    10]. This research can be useful to farmers, researchers, and professionals working
    in agricultural businesses for intelligent farming. Newness/ originality of the
    study: Several prominent researchers have made efforts for smart agriculture using
    IoT concepts in agriculture. But a set of revealed challenges remains in the queue
    for effective resolution. This study makes some effort to discuss previous research
    and open challenges in IoT-based agriculture, artificial intelligence, artificial
    neural networks, and fuzzy logic to develop smart farming. However, using industry
    4.0 techniques in farming will give farmers and agriculture companies many benefits:
    1. By using the Internet of Things in farming, it can make it easier to manage
    and collect large amounts of data from sensors, as well as control and integrate
    them from anywhere and at any time, allowing communication among all participants
    in the process. 2. Using fuzzy logic, the research will allow the incorporation
    of human informal knowledge into the control strategy, resulting in human-like
    control of the farm entities (‘greenhouses’) parameters. 3. With the combined
    of AI and IoT, the farm will be able to achieve a higher level of efficiency in
    the use of water, energy sources, fertilisers, pesticides, etc. 4. Internet of
    Things applications will lead to environmental protection. 5. The research enables
    farmers to adopt more efficient environmental protection strategies by combining
    fuzzy logic and AI techniques. 6. Using Internet of Things (IOT) sensors and AI-enabled
    equipment such as drones and agriculture robots, farmers can increase food production
    by more than 70% by 2050. Figure 2 shows the system''s structure. The central
    unit receives and collects the data from autonomous measurement stations, local
    weather forecasts, professional knowledge from local agronomists, pre-processed
    images received from multispectral crop cameras utilising UAVs, and data obtained
    from mobile device applications. The central unit generates control actions for
    the actuators based on previously collected, processed, and stored data, The central
    unit generates control actions for the actuators. This system is suitable for
    both outdoor and protected agriculture (in greenhouses and indoors). Actions are
    taken in accordance with the type of plant under supervision. The system controls
    the internal temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide enrichment, irrigation,
    and fertilisation in the case of protected cultivation. In the case of outdoor
    cultivation, the system regulates watering and fertilisation and computes the
    severity index to allow for early pest detection. AI-based solutions will also
    be utilised to optimise resource utilisation [32]. 6 Technology-Driven Agriculture
    Industry 4.0 changed the industrial and agriculture sectors and offered several
    advantages across many industries, but especially in agriculture industry fields,
    farmers are now using Industry 4.0 technology in smart agriculture by utilising
    modern devices like agriculture robots, drones (UAVs), sensors, AI, the Internet
    of Things (IoT), etc. Fig. 2. The structure of the proposed system. Full size
    image 6.1 Internet of Things in Agriculture Majority of research publications
    discussed the influence of IoT devices on system automation, including how they
    can determine soil texture, automate irrigation systems, and detect environmental
    change. Such as temperature and humidity, detecting pests and weeds, and assessing
    damage to the soil. Smart agriculture contributed to the development of the agricultural
    sector. Farmers are now utilising modern technologies in agriculture to make it
    smarter and more productive, using IOTs and AI and linking agriculture with satellites,
    the internet, sensors, etc. To increase the benefits of the IoT [5]. The data
    connection varies from sensor to sensor. First, the sensors gather the information,
    share it with the IoT gateway, connect through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to the database,
    and store the data in the cloud. Then the user finally gets the processed information
    (or data) and uses it to make smarter decisions. Wireless Sensor Network (WNS)
    helps make the right decisions in relevant situations, and thus WNS supports decision-making
    to find solutions to problems related to agriculture [1, 18]. Despite technological
    development, many challenges must be faced when using modern technologies in smart
    agriculture. Among those challenges, most people are ignorant of how to use technology
    in the agriculture sector due to a lack of knowledge about dealing with mobile
    devices and a lack of reading and comprehension knowledge. There are also other
    factors, such as a lack of energy supply, changes in weather or climatic conditions,
    and funding sources [1]. But the development of the agricultural field using modern
    technologies has helped to overcome obstacles and solve many problems in modern
    agriculture. In the Agriculture 4.0 sector, the Internet of Things (IoT) is commonly
    utilized in various ways, such as the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
    agriculture, as well as the IOT for monitoring soil and water quality, optimizing
    crop irrigation, employing precision agriculture techniques like remote sensing,
    humidity, and temperature monitoring, and implementing autonomous greenhouses
    and these are the important and common uses of IOT in agriculture [8, 18]. 6.2
    Wireless Sensor Networks in Agriculture Wireless sensor network technology is
    used on the IoT. WSN is defined as a group of spatially dispersed sensors that
    monitor environmental conditions, store data obtained, and send information collected
    to a central point [1]. A wireless communication module connects several sensor
    nodes to form a WSN for smart agriculture. These nodes can self- self-configure,
    self-organize, and self-diagnose [24, 32]. These nodes have a variety of capabilities
    (such as processing, transmission, and acquisition). WSNs can be divided into
    various sorts based on the environment in which they are found. These comprise
    mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs), underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSN),
    underwater wireless sensor networks (WUSN), and terrestrial wireless sensor networks
    (TWSN) [1, 20]. For agricultural applications, TWSN and UWSN sensor networks are
    often used [1, 20, 32]. TWSN nodes are positioned above the surface of the earth
    and consist of sensors to collect surrounding data. A second alternative to WSNs
    is their underground counterpart, WUSNs. Nodes are inserted into the soil, where
    they easily perform low-frequency functions while exhibiting very weak higher-frequency
    capabilities. As a result, it takes a lot of knots to cover a big area. Several
    research publications that have been addressed in the literature have covered
    the use of WSNs for various farm applications, such as irrigation management,
    water quality evaluation, and environmental monitoring. Additionally, there are
    several WSN-related issues that require more focus and attention, including interoperability,
    robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and maintenance [1, 5]. 6.3 Artefactual
    Intelligence in Agriculture 4.0 The agriculture sector is experiencing the rapid
    customization of both artificial intelligence and machine learning in seasonal
    agricultural outcomes and field agriculture techniques. The development of computer
    systems that can carry out tasks that require human intelligence, such as decision-making
    and sensory perception, is known as artificial intelligence [24]. Combined with
    cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things,
    this is seen as one of the main drivers behind the digitization of the agriculture
    industry 4.0. Many smart farming systems that use machine learning [ML] and deep
    learning [DL] algorithms have been developed to determine various parameters such
    as crop and soil control, diagnosing plan. Diseases, detecting weeds, intelligent
    spraying, aerial surveys, and photography that are used to improve crop production.
    In addition to ongoing monitoring, harvesting, processing, and marketing [17].
    Learning and responding to special situations (based on learning) to increase
    efficiency [1]. Providing some of these options to farmers as a service, such
    as Chabot or different conversation principles, will assist them in properly supporting
    the pace of technological improvements, such as identifying similarities in everyday
    farming. Agricultural robotics organizations recognize the value of robots that
    depend on and manipulate themselves to handle key agricultural services such as
    assembly plants on a more prominent scale, at a faster pace, and with more proactivity
    than personal workers [19]. 6.4 Advance Robotic Agricultural robots have been
    developed to perform precision farming operations and to replace humans in certain
    tasks. Advanced robots have been used in recent years for purposes such as cultivation
    and harvesting, water supply, targeted spraying, and environmental control. Robots
    equipped with lasers and cameras are used to identify and remove weeds without
    the need for human intervention. These robots move autonomously through the rows
    of crops, resulting in higher yields when labour is reduced [9]. It can also be
    used in the fields to complete specific farming tasks. Recently, robots for plant
    growth and fruit picking have emerged to bring new levels of efficiency to traditional
    methods. Stationary robots are usually the most popular alternative in industrial
    applications [29]. However, in the context of agriculture, mobile robots may offer
    greater utility, as they can traverse different types of terrain that are not
    otherwise easily accessible, cover large fields, and automate agricultural tasks.
    In the agricultural sector, mobile robots are widely used to improve farm management,
    increase farm efficiency, and reduce labor needs, especially in harsh environments
    inaccessible to humans [19]. These robots perform a variety of agricultural activities,
    such as harvesting, field cultivation, mechanical weeding, precision spraying,
    irrigation management and soil sampling [9]. 6.5 Machine Learning in Agriculture
    Machine learning techniques are classified into three categories: (1) Supervised
    learning (regression trees, linear regression, nonlinear regression, Bayesian
    linear regression, polynomial logistic regression, and vector regression support).
    (2) unsupervised learning (K-group means, hierarchical clustering, anomaly detection,
    neural networks, principal component analysis, independent component analysis,
    prior algorithms, and singular value decomposition) and (3) re-informative learning
    (Markov decision processes and Q learning) [1, 24]. Technologies and algorithms
    implement machine learning in agriculture. Crop yield forecast by sector, diseases,
    weed detection, and weather forecast (precipitation), estimation of soil properties
    (such as moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, calculating
    lawn fertiliser application rates, and livestock production and care of animals.
    Management Rates are used for a wide range of agricultural applications. The analysis
    shows that “crop yield prediction” is a topic that has been extensively studied.
    The most popular ML technologies for smart agriculture are support vector machines
    (SVM), neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and linear regression. There
    have been no reports of commercial applications yet for the listed use cases,
    which are currently in the research stage. Additionally, it has been discovered
    that indoor vertical farming systems, particularly hydroponic, aquaponic, and
    aeroponic systems, are hardly researched using AI and machine learning approaches
    [24]. Technology from ML is applied. Given the difficulties of digital transformation
    in terms of cybersecurity and data privacy, new approaches such as such as federated
    learning and privacy-preserving methods, are being developed to enable digital
    agriculture. And mitigate security issues [1]. 6.6 Drones (UAVs) Technology in
    Agriculture 4.0 Drones (UAVs), known as drones or aerial robots, are widely used
    by farmers to monitor crop growth, and combat hunger, and adverse environmental
    impacts. It is called “unmanned” because there is no human pilot on board [1].
    Unmanned aerial vehicles are used efficiently to take pictures, spray water and
    pesticides, consider rugged terrain, etc. It has proven its value in terms of
    spray speed as well as accuracy, when compared to conventional machines for the
    same purpose, UAV technology can be used for gathering information that helps
    farmers make decisions. With recent developments in drone technology, a group
    of UAVs equipped with 3D cameras and heterogeneous sensors can work together to
    provide farmers with comprehensive capabilities and tasks to manage their lands
    and farms [5]. By using these drones in agriculture, farmers can set their eyes
    on the sky. However, using drones in agriculture can carry out large and difficult
    tasks and reach remote and rugged places with the necessary speed and time, but
    there are still many challenges that need to be addressed to take advantage of
    this technology, especially the integration with other technologies and how to
    use it in bad weather conditions [21]. UAVs, and radio-controlled model aircraft
    can be flown at lower altitudes for increased spatial resolution, possibly at
    a lower cost [19]. The advantage of the image using drones for agriculture is
    their accuracy (very high pixels), compared to other traditional methods [6].
    Drone images are used in many things, including mapping grass types, measuring
    shrub biomass, mapping crop strength, monitoring crop water stress, recording
    crop biomass, and evaluating nitrogen treatments. On crops [21], in addition,
    the UAV is also used as a geo-fence to repel animal attacks by alerting the owner
    in a timely and safe manner [19] (see Fig. 3). Fig. 3. The types of drones used
    in agriculture (https://www.iberdrola.com/web/guest/innovacion/smart-farming-agricultura-precision).
    Full size image 7 The Benefits of Industry 4.0 in Agriculture Using modern technologies
    in the agriculture sector has many advantages related to the economic, social,
    and environmental fields. This paper will briefly cover all the fields mentioned
    above. First, the environmental field: These technologies contributed to reducing
    pollutants (such as agricultural chemicals and various fertilizers), which led
    to the sustainability [1, 3] or increase of soil quality, reduced water pollution,
    reduced carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and reduced air pollution. Secondly, economically,
    it has many advantages, including operational efficiency, maximising resources,
    and providing high-quality product results, such as increased yields, improved
    soil quality, and high selling prices of raw materials. Smart farming systems
    also enable accurate management of demand forecasts and timely delivery of goods
    to market to reduce waste. In addition to the various benefits in terms of efficiency,
    there are lower costs involved, less water consumption, less use of technical
    inputs, and lower overall costs. In terms of social benefits, it reduces time
    and effort (reducing physical labor) and increases quality, as well as reducing
    worker stress and improving their well-being and safety at work. Overall, Agriculture
    4.0 helps reduce costs and improve product quality, quantity, and sustainability
    [18]. 8 Challenges Facing Agriculture 4.0 To introduce the new technology (Industry
    4.0 to Agriculture 4.0) in a specific environment, there are many challenges and
    obstacles, such as technical and technological challenges related to the application
    of smart agriculture, technical problems related to modern equipment, weather
    problems, rugged lands in some areas, and a lack of knowledge for some farmers
    about how to use the modern techniques in agriculture [4, 8]. Agriculture 4.0
    requires great economic effort; financing sources consider it most important to
    farmers. However, funding sources are one of the most important challenges in
    some developing countries. Implementation challenges: Using Agri4.0 in the agriculture
    sector requires skills. Cultural and organisational challenges: Due to the introduction
    of digitalization in agriculture, Agriculture Revolution 4.0 will require skills
    related to introducing digital solutions in companies [18]. However, weather conditions,
    energy sources, and financing, the ruggedness of some areas, and the lack of sufficient
    knowledge to use modern technologies for some farmers is considered the most important
    challenge facing smart agriculture. Moreover, for a successful implementation
    of ANN, fuzzy logic control systems, other artificial intelligence engines, to
    train Artefactual Intelligence (AI) models in the agricultural sector, a huge
    amount of data is needed [4]. 9 Discussions Smart farming depends on advanced
    technology systems in management, analysis, processing, data collection, decision-making,
    etc. to reduce costs and make farming more productive, profitable, sustainable,
    and environmentally friendly. Smart agriculture can contribute significantly to
    meeting the food needs of the world''s population [1]. This study aims to highlight
    the importance of using new technologies in farming. Using Industry 4.0 in agriculture
    can make agriculture smart and available, as well as contribute to solving many
    agriculture problems. We have clarified part of these challenges and solutions
    in this paper, which shows the importance of resorting to researchers, farmers,
    and agricultural companies to contribute to the development of this important
    sector. And shows that it is not as required. And there are many issues and challenges,
    such as the issue of food safety, a lack of digitization, and environmental problems.
    Sources of financing and support, a lack of resources, and the lack of knowledge
    of many farmers on how to use new technologies on farms., which is considered
    one of the most important challenges facing smart agriculture in developing countries.
    (Industry 4.0) was distinguished by doing a lot of things and tasks with less
    effort and in a short amount of time. Industry 4.0 spawned all the emerging technologies,
    bringing together BDMM, IoT technologies, robotics, big data, and blockchain technology
    [7, 8, 18, 19], are making production and supply processes smarter and now more
    autonomous. The integration of smart Industry and Agriculture offers the opportunity
    to transform industrial agriculture into the next generation. Smart farming can
    be achieved by collecting precise variables in real time, in addition to processing
    and analysing data related to agricultural industries from food production, processing,
    and distribution to consumers, through artificial intelligence (AI), Big data,
    sensors, IOTs, (UAVs), agriculture robots), etc. Such a smart ecosystem in the
    agricultural field would contribute significantly to improving productivity, food
    supply chain efficiency, natural resource utilization and food safety. Industry
    4.0 towards Agriculture 4.0 means a shift in production infrastructure: it contributes
    to the creation of connected farms, new production equipment, tractors, and tying
    machines, enabling increased productivity, quality, and environmental protection
    [28], as well as giving recommendations to those who are interested in smart farming
    and to the researchers to combine the use of AI techniques and fuzzy logic, which
    will enable the farms to lead in adopting more effective environmental protection
    strategies. And this point is one of the most important recommendations that must
    be worked on and developed. 10 Conclusions This paper provides a future vision,
    an overview, and objective solutions for Industry 4.0 applications in agriculture.
    It highlights the significance of using modern technologies in agriculture to
    contribute to those interested in developing and knowing the places of imbalance
    in the agriculture sector, as well as identifying the challenges facing smart
    agriculture to find solutions and innovate new ways, contribute to opening research
    and innovation issues, and therefore be useful in identifying prospects and knowledge
    of the gaps in agriculture 4.0. The study''s goal is to respond effectively to
    global climatic changes, fluctuations in the global economy and environmental
    fields, a lack of resources, and an increase in the global population, all of
    which affect agricultural development and prevent us from achieving food self-sufficiency.
    However, the technologies provided by Industry 4.0 for agriculture field refer
    to many creative solutions that can be used to develop this important sector.
    In this paper, the challenges facing farmers are highlighted, and logical solutions
    are presented to meet future expectations and make agriculture more efficient
    and smarter. In this context, Internet of Things, drones, micro-communication
    technologies, agriculture robots, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence
    are discussed. The study introduces our current research in the field of applications
    of AI, IoT, ANN, fuzzy logic, and early detection of plant diseases. In addition
    to IOT for smart communication in data collection, processing, and analysis, it
    is considered one of the powerful tools that enable agricultural management, so
    farmers and researchers should pay close attention to move this sector to a qualitative
    new level. It will provide a new ecological approach to environmental protection,
    although there is still much research to be done. The design above demonstrates
    that the approach enables the integration of expert human knowledge into control
    strategies by using fuzzy logic to facilitate control in protected agriculture.
    Additionally, various expert-based strategies can also be simulated, compared,
    and analyzed [13]. In conclusion, this study also highlights that humans can use
    fuzzy logic to facilitate the integrated control of protected agriculture through
    their formal knowledge. Future work in this research is to combine the uses of
    IOT and AI to achieve the highest level of sustainability, quality, and efficiency
    in the use of water, energy sources, fertilizers, pesticides, soil type, soil
    temperature, etc., on the farm. With the knowledge that IoT applications in the
    agriculture sector will lead to environmental protection. And additionally, the
    study enables the farms to adopt more effective environmental protection tactics
    by advancing the combined use of fuzzy logic and AI technology. References Abbasi,

    Notes Abstract Vertical greenery systems (VGS) have been proposed as a nature-based
    solution to mitigate the adverse effects of urban heat islands and climate change
    in cities. However, large-scale VGS are costly and require ongoing maintenance,
    typically carried out manually through trial and error based on professional experience.
    Advanced management is essential for the sustainability of VGS due to its limited
    accessibility and associated costs. To address these challenges, we examined the
    use of remote sensing methods for outdoor VGS monitoring as a basis for a precision
    agriculture approach for VGS management and maintenance. This study presents the
    first ongoing monitoring of real-scale VGS using thermal, hyperspectral, and RGB

    Keywords: vertical greenery systems (VGS); green wall; monitoring VGS; VGS maintenance;
    nature-based solution; VGS health 1. Introduction Vertical greenery systems (VGS)
    have gained popularity in recent decades as a nature-based solution and adaptation
    method for the adverse effects of urbanization and climate change [1]. In addition
    to their aesthetic benefits, VGS contribute to both indoor and outdoor environments
    by improving air quality [2,3,4], creating a milder microclimate [5,6], reducing
    energy consumption [6,7,8], and noise pollution [9,10]. Furthermore, VGS may enhance
    the psychological well-being of building residents or users [11,12]. However,
    covering buildings with VGS presents significant challenges. The installation,
    operation, and maintenance of VGS can be complex and costly [13]. Issues such
    as irrigation problems or plant damage may necessitate specialists’ expertise
    and the use of cranes, further escalating expenses [14]. Moreover, poorly maintained
    VGS can lead to dissatisfaction among residents and passersby and can increase
    fire risk [15], undermining the potential benefits of using VGS as an adaptive
    solution. Therefore, the continuous monitoring of VGS is crucial, especially since
    the plants are often difficult to access, and conditions may vary significantly
    along the VGS [16]. In situ sensors provide valuable continuous monitoring of
    VGS, but the spatial distribution of the vegetation status cannot be easily achieved
    [17]. The growing demand for efficient VGS monitoring methods to facilitate proper
    maintenance has arisen as VGS becomes more prevalent in urban areas, along with
    other green and blue infrastructures [18]. Currently, irrigation in commercial
    VGS is often determined through trial and error, and VGS health monitoring is
    primarily based on expert observations conducted periodically [19]. To address
    the complexities of large-scale VGS maintenance, information technologies (IT),
    the Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced monitoring technologies may offer valuable
    assistance [20]. Adopting remote sensing and precision agriculture methods for
    VGS can greatly improve ongoing plant monitoring and aid in the early detection
    of plant stress. Early detection of changes in plant health is critical for successful
    agricultural growth [21]. Hyperspectral (HS) and thermal (TIR) imaging are well-established
    methods in agriculture and natural areas [22,23,24]. The interaction of objects
    with light at different wavelengths determines their spectral characteristics.
    For instance, plant pigments exhibit distinct features, such as chlorophyll absorption
    bands in the blue and red regions. Healthy plants generally have lower reflectance
    in the visible bands and higher reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) bands than
    plants under stress. HS imaging can identify subtle differences in vegetation
    that may not be visible to the human eye. This technique has been successfully
    applied to various crops, including estimating biochemical and biophysical properties;
    evaluating nutrient and stress status; classifying or detecting crop types, weeds,
    and diseases; and investigating soil characteristics [25,26]. Nevertheless, HS
    cameras are expensive, and analyzing tens to hundreds of bands in the visible
    and near-infrared regions can be computationally intensive and time-consuming.
    Therefore, vegetation indices (VIs) are commonly used to quantitatively and qualitatively
    highlight specific vegetation features, such as chlorophyll and water content,
    based on a combination of reflectance at two or more wavelengths in the electromagnetic
    spectrum [27]. TIR imaging is often employed to assess temperature differences
    indicating stress derived from diseases [28] or water deficits in crops [29].
    Furthermore, TIR imaging allows targeted interventions and optimization of irrigation
    strategies [30,31,32]. The increasing focus on vertical farming has spurred the
    advancement of IoT smart sensing technology. This includes a range of sensors
    implemented to track variables such as room temperature, light intensity, humidity
    levels, and soil nutrition [33]. Additionally, cable-driven robot prototypes have
    been developed to monitor and care for vegetation in hard-to-reach areas [14,34].
    Some studies have also demonstrated the application of image processing techniques
    to identify fruits [34], employ Machine Learning Algorithms for detecting tomato
    diseases [35], and support decisions on whether the plant can be harvested or
    not using a simple NDVI threshold [36]. Nonetheless, progress in monitoring outdoor
    VGS remains limited. Gunawardena and Steemers [20], conducted a study on the main
    maintenance challenges in outdoor VGS based on 12 European case studies. They
    found that real-time stress detection, and automated response mechanisms were
    not operational in any of the installations inspected, despite the evident need
    for such capabilities. While several studies have estimated the water requirement
    for VGS irrigation management [19,37,38], the utilization of remote sensing in
    VGS studies is limited. Pérez-Urrestarazu et al. [37] found that using a thermal
    camera could be valuable in determining substrate moisture to optimize VGS irrigation.
    Nevertheless, in VGS studies, thermal imaging was primarily performed to assess
    the wall and foliage skin temperatures [39,40], which could affect the outdoor
    and indoor microclimate [6]. While some studies have explored the use of hyperspectral
    imaging in green roofs [41,42], its application in VGS is still at a preliminary
    stage. Yuan et al. [43] monitored the water stress of an indoor green wall using
    the “triangle method”, which includes surface temperature and the normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI). Helman et al. [17] used HS and TIR cameras for spatially
    continuous monitoring as part of an integrated system that examines the benefits
    of an indoor green wall. They utilized HS imaging to separate plant species through
    supervised classification and established correlations between the HS VIs and
    plants’ CO2 assimilation rate. They also demonstrated a negative correlation between
    TIR images and stomatal conductance. To the best of our knowledge, except for
    a few studies that monitored VGS skin temperature, remote sensing tools in VGS
    studies have been applied only to indoor environments, which are much more homogenous
    in terms of illumination and climate. Continual monitoring of VGS holds paramount
    importance for maintenance, encompassing vegetation health and the fine-tuning
    of irrigation and fertilization systems [20]. Automated monitoring can enhance
    performance and facilitate decisions in managing VGS. Detecting issues early in
    vegetated walls can avert irreversible situations necessitating extensive plant
    replacement. The primary objective of this study is to deploy ground-based remote
    sensing methods for the assessment of outdoor VGS health. While hyperspectral
    and thermal cameras offer advanced capabilities, our focus is on demonstrating
    the practical potential of these methods for monitoring VGS. This approach involves
    the establishment of a time series comprising RGB, HS, and TIR indices. Furthermore,
    we used unsupervised classification to detect stressed vegetation in early stages
    as a basis for a spatial decision support system for real-scale VGS. This study
    highlights the potential use of remote sensing in enhancing VGS monitoring. 2.
    Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The study was conducted on real-scale VGS
    as part of the BIU-VGS project at Bar Ilan University (32.067, 34.842) in Mediterranean
    climate Ramat Gan, the central region of Israel (Figure 1). The study site comprised
    three identical buildings in the southern campus, which replicated two east–west
    oriented street canyons. Each building consisted of five floors, with an overall
    height of 20 m. The canyons had concrete walls facing north and south. During
    the period from 3 to 18 November 2019, planters were installed on two parallel
    vertical walls in one of the canyons, covering approximately 450 m2 of vegetated
    area for each wall. Two VGS technologies were utilized—a green/living wall (GW)
    on the eastern shafts and a vertical forest (planter boxes attached to the wall)
    on the remaining walls and the western shafts. The GW was constructed using plastic
    modules containing a blended soil substrate for planting (40% peat, 40% coconut,
    and 20% perlite). The case study focused on the GWs located on two vertical concrete
    walls—one facing north (building 212) and the other facing south (building 213),
    as shown in Figure 1b. Each GW had dimensions of 11 m in height and 2.7 m in width,
    covered with plant species Viola hederacea (Figure 1c) and Hedera helix (Figure
    1d). Figure 1. The study site. (a) Location (yellow star) of the BIU-VGS project
    in the eastern Mediterranean. (b) Close-up of the study site. The location of
    the north and south-facing GWs, as well as air temperature (Ta) and relative humidity
    (RH) sensors (in red circles) are indicated. (c) GW species Viola hederacea. (d)
    GW species Hedera helix. (e) Weekly water accumulation of the six irrigation pipes
    at the north-facing (212) and south-facing GWs (213) and weekly mean air temperature
    (Ta) at the center of the canyon (dotted red line). The irrigation and fertilization
    of the GW were provided through an automated system based on scheduled programs
    planned by an irrigation expert. Each GW contained six irrigation lines, with
    drippers placed every 15 cm along the width of each line. Irrigation was applied
    at midnight either every one day (during summer) or every two days (during winter).
    Figure 1e presents the weekly average water accumulation during the study period.
    The quantities were adjusted based on seasonal variations and, in rare instances,
    an expert made decisions to decrease or increase water amounts based on direct
    observations made on-site. The average weekly quantities during May–October were
    1.18 m3 (north-facing GW) and 1.56 m3 (south-facing GW), while irrigation significantly
    decreased during November–December to weekly average quantities of 0.16 m3 (north-facing)
    and 0.23 m3 (south-facing). 2.2. Data Acquisition This study was conducted over
    8 months between May and December 2020. GWs were monitored every 1–3 weeks using
    HS and TIR cameras. The cameras were mounted on a 1.5 m height tripod and manually
    operated from a fixed point on the ground, approximately 15 m away from the GW
    (Figure 2a,b). All images were collected during midday (11:00 A.M.–2:00 P.M. LT)
    under clear sky conditions. Figure 2. Data acquisition at the study site. (a)
    Locations (rectangles) of the HS and TIR shooting of the north (blue) and south
    (orange) facing GWs. (b) The thermal camera on a tripod toward the north-facing
    GW at the study site. (c) The timing of the data acquisition in this study, including
    the yellowing events that were studied for early detection of stress (see Section
    2.4) and COVID quarantines that affected mainly the collection of TIR data. The
    HS images were obtained using a Specim IQ® camera (Specim–Spectral Imaging, Oulu,
    Finland) with a spectral resolution of 7 nm and 204 bands across the wavelength
    range of 397–1003 nm. Each image from the Specim IQ® camera was a square of 512
    × 512 pixels with a field of view (FOV) of 31°, providing a spatial resolution
    of 3 cm/pixel at the GW. All images were normalized using a 99% barium sulfate
    white reference (provided with the camera). Due to the vertical alignment, large
    scale, and limited accessibility of the VGS, the camera operated in “custom” mode,
    where the white reference was recorded and saved to the camera before the actual
    VGS recordings. The white reference was placed at the lower area of each GW and
    recorded every 15 min. A FLIR A655sc (FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, OR, USA) camera
    was used for collecting TIR images. This camera is an uncooled microbolometer
    with 640 × 480 pixels, sensitive to radiation in the range of 7.5–14.0 µm. It
    is equipped with a lens with a FOV of 45° and provides a spatial resolution of
    4 cm/pixel at the GW. The camera has a noise equivalent temperature difference
    (NETD, i.e., thermal sensitivity) of less than 30 mK and a thermal accuracy of
    ±2 °C or ±2% of the reading. The temperature values acquired by the camera were
    adjusted using FLIR Research IR software (version 4.40.9.30) by setting the air
    temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), and target distance. An emissivity of
    0.95 was used to correct all thermal images. Due to technical issues with the
    thermal camera during COVID-19 quarantine restrictions, intermittent gaps occurred
    in the TIR time series data. Ta and RH were measured at 30 min intervals using
    HMP 155 Vaisala sensors with an accuracy of ±0.2 °C for Ta and ±1% for RH. These
    measurements were stored in cloud-based storage. Sensors were placed in three
    locations: 10 m from the GWs in the middle of the street canyon and 1 m near each
    GW (see red circles in Figure 1b). The timing of the data collection during this
    study is presented in Figure 2c. 2.3. Image Processing Figure 3 illustrates the
    image processing stages. The pre-processing of HS and TIR images involved their
    projection to each other using ArcGIS Pro software (version 3.0) and the extraction
    of Regions of Interest (ROIs) of approximately 13.5 m2 using the raster clip tool.
    The two plant species in the GW were separated (classified) due to their different
    phenological cycles, canopy closure characteristics, and vegetative properties.
    We employed the spectral angle mapper (SAM) supervised classification in ENVI
    software (version 5.6.1) to create a species mask for each GW (Figure 4). An image
    with a full green cover and without visible stress symptoms was selected for this
    purpose (north-facing: 14 September; south-facing: 24 August). Later, this mask
    was utilized to separate species in the HS and TIR time series analysis. After
    these pre-processing stages, the image processing flow was carried out using Python.
    The HS images were normalized (as described in Section 2.3.1), and all images
    (HS and TIR) were resized based on the smallest pixel found in each orientation
    time series. Figure 3. Illustration of image processing stages. Figure 4. Masks
    based on SAM classification for plant separation (ROI in red; mask contour in
    magenta) were used in the HS (NDVI, left) and TIR ( ∆𝑇 , right) time series analysis
    (see Section 2.3.1 and Section 2.3.2). (a) North-facing GW (14 September) and
    (b) south-facing GW (24 August). 2.3.1. Hyperspectral (HS) Image Processing In
    the HS images, the white reference was positioned at the lower part of the GW.
    To eliminate illumination differences along the GW, a pixel-based spectrum normalization
    (sometimes referred to as Norm-1) was performed as follows: 𝑅 ̂ 𝑝 𝑖 =𝑅 𝑝 𝑖 / ∑
    204 𝑗=1 𝑅 𝑝 𝑗 (1) where p is the pixel, and i and j are the bands. In the normalization
    process, each spectral band of a pixel is divided by the sum of all the pixel’s
    spectral bands, ensuring that the sum of all bands for a given pixel is equal
    to 1. This allows for relative comparisons and analysis of spectral information
    for the entire image, considering the proportion of each spectral band within
    a pixel. For each species, 12 vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated, as shown
    in Table 1. The VIs were organized into categories based on their sensitivity
    (pigment; leaf structure; water content) and their band’s range (VIS-RGB; VIS-HS;
    NIR + VIS; NIR). For further analysis, two separate branches were pursued. (a)
    In the first branch, a kernel technique was employed. For each VI image, the standard
    deviation (“STD kernel”) was computed within 10 × 10 pixels moving window. This
    process involved iterating over the entire image, extracting data from each window,
    and generating a time series of the average STD kernel values for all VIs separated
    into species. These time series were used for the ongoing monitoring of the GWs.
    (b) In the second branch, a time series of VIs was built. For noise reduction
    in each VI image, Gaussian Blurring (size of 5 × 5 pixels) was applied. This is
    a smoothing method that removes noise generated by Gaussian distribution [44].
    These time series presented the average value for each VI, separated into species,
    and were used for the ongoing monitoring of the GWs and later to examine the potential
    of early detection of vegetation stress in VGS (see Section 2.4). Table 1. Vegetation
    indices separated into categories according to the VIs sensitivity. 2.3.2. Thermal
    (TIR) Images Processing Water stress is known to be correlated with stomatal closure,
    resulting in reduced transpiration and elevated leaf temperatures above the ambient
    temperature [58,59]. The canopy-to-air temperature difference (∆T) is widely used
    as an indicator of plant health, heat stress tolerance, or drought stress in crops
    [60], and is calculated based on the TIR images as follows: ∆T = Tcanopy − Ta
    (2) where Tcanopy is the temperature of vegetation at each pixel and Ta is the
    air temperature measured in situ, 1 m from each GW. Generally, if a plant has
    sufficient water, ∆T ≤ 0, whereas under water stress, ∆T > 0. Gaussian Blurring
    (5 × 5 pixels) was applied to the ∆T images to reduce noise, similar to what was
    done for the VIs images. The time series of ∆T were separated into species and
    used for the ongoing monitoring of the GWs and later for early detection of vegetation
    stress in VGS using TIR images. 2.4. Stress Detection 2.4.1. Yellowing Index and
    Ground Truth In mid-October 2020 (south-facing GW—213) and mid-November 2020 (north-facing
    GW—212), the Viola hederacea plants along the GWs began to turn yellow and eventually
    died (Figure 5). In contrast, the Hedera helix plants, which are known as less
    sensitive plants, remained green and survived throughout the study and beyond.
    This period coincided with COVID-19 quarantine restrictions in Israel, and irrigation
    and fertilizer were not properly managed, likely contributing to vegetation degradation.
    The yellowing events caused significant damage to the GW, dissatisfaction among
    residents and passersby, and required extensive vegetation replacement using cranes.
    The time series of the Viola hederacea plants’ yellowing in both GWs are referred
    to as “yellowing events” in the study. Figure 5. Study area and yellowing events
    in the north (blue) and south-facing (orange) GWs. To investigate the usage of
    HS and TIR imaging for the early detection of stress events in the GWs, the yellowing
    areas in the time series were detected and delineated. A “yellowing index” for
    Viola hederacea was manually created to quantify the percentage of yellowing at
    each time step. This process involved visual observation of RGB and HS images,
    histogram investigation of yellow and green pixels, and examination of several
    RGB chlorophyll detection indices from the Sánchez-Sastre et al. [61] study (see
    Table A1 in Appendix A). The RGB r index (Table 1) was chosen to represent stressed
    vegetation. By setting a fixed threshold (based on histogram properties and visual
    inspection) of 0.3, the r index, hereafter referred to as the “yellowing index”,
    successfully captured yellow (r index value > 0.3) and green (r index value <
    0.3) pixels. The yellowing index was analyzed for 10 time steps (from 24 September
    to 21 December at the north-facing GW and from 4 September to 1 December at the
    south-facing GW). One image per GW, close to the end of the yellowing event at
    each GW (14 December at the north-facing GW and 24 November at the south-facing
    GW), was selected as the reference image (ground truth) for stressed (yellow)
    pixels. 2.4.2. Stress Detection in VIs and Thermal Index Images To investigate
    the feasibility of detecting stress events before the visual stage (yellowing)
    in VGS, we classified the HS VIs and ∆T thermal index images into stressed and
    green pixels. For each VI (Table 1) and thermal index image in the 10 yellowing
    index time steps, we used an unsupervised Otsu threshold [62] and Multi-Otsu [63]
    to divide each image into two or three groups based on the presence of yellow
    pixels. When minimal or no yellow pixels were detected in the image (yellowing
    index < 0.5%), the data was split into two groups. Conversely, when yellow pixels
    were already present in the image (the yellow index was greater than 0.5%), the
    data was divided into three groups to increase sensitivity and allow for early
    detection of pre-yellowed stressed pixels. Separating into two groups only allowed
    the differentiation of yellow pixels from other pixels but could not detect the
    variance (stressed, non-stressed) in the rest of the image. For each time step,
    we classified the pixels as green, stressed, and yellow (if present). 2.4.3. Stress
    Detection Performance Estimation To evaluate the performance of the classifiers
    for early stress detection, we compared the classified (predicted: under stress
    or green) pixels from each HS VIs and ∆T index time step to the reference image
    (ground truth: yellow or green) and created a confusion matrix. The matrix was
    divided into four classes (Figure 6): True positive (TP): yellow pixels that were
    correctly predicted as under stress. False positive (FP): green pixels that were
    falsely predicted as under stress. True negative (TN): green pixels that were
    correctly predicted as green. False negative (FN): yellow pixels that were falsely
    predicted as green. Figure 6. Illustrations of the confusion matrix structure
    as used in this study. (a) Process of the calculated area. (b) Confusion matrix
    for yellow (under stress) and green (healthy) pixels as recognized by the ground
    truth (actual) and the VIs and thermal indices (predicted). The metrics that were
    used to describe the classifiers’ success for early stress detection based on
    the confusion matrix were: accuracy, precision, false positive rate (false alarm),
    and F1 score. Recall was also calculated for the F1 score calculation. The metrics
    were calculated as follows: Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + FP + TN + FN) (3) Precision
    = TP/(TP + FP) (4) False positive rate (false alarm) = FP/(FP + TN) (5) Recall
    = TP/(TP + FN) (6) The F1 score, a single-value metric, combines precision and
    recall using the harmonic mean. It considers both false negatives and false positives,
    making it a useful metric for imbalanced data [64]. In this study, the F1 score
    was utilized to assess the classifier’s performance and ensure that the classification
    results were not merely due to random chance. 3. Results 3.1. Ongoing Monitoring
    of VGS Using HS and TIR Images The average value of VIs allowed us to assess the
    general status of vegetation in VGS using remote and non-destructive methods.
    Figure 7 shows the time series of average VIs values and STD kernel from May to
    December 2020 for the two species in each GW. In both GWs, the VIs initially showed
    stable or minor changes in average values for several months. However, as the
    yellow visual symptoms appeared on the plants, there were noticeable changes in
    vegetation dynamics, with some VIs showing a rise while others demonstrated a
    drop, as well as a rise in standard deviation and STD kernel, all synchronized
    with the yellowing event. Figure 7. Average VIs and standard deviation (shading)
    time series of Viola hederacea (purple) and Hedera helix (green). The green (Hedera
    helix) and purple (Viola hederacea) dotted lines represent the STD kernel with
    values in the secondary y-axis. (a) North-facing and (b) south-facing GWs. The
    vertical yellow shading and red triangles indicate the yellowing events on 18
    November in (a) and October 14 in (b). The dates (November–December) in (b) where
    the images were in shadow conditions are marked in black lines. The data in (b)
    of the Hedera helix on 1 November was dropped due to mixed shadowed and sunny
    conditions. See details of VIs in Table 1. For the north-facing GW (Figure 7a),
    the average NDVI and standard deviation were 0.84 and 0.017 (Viola hederacea),
    and 0.79 and 0.019 (Hedera helix), respectively, from the beginning of the monitoring
    until the yellowing event. Just before the yellowing event (14 October to 1 November),
    the averages increased even further, and the standard deviation decreased (0.87,
    0.009 for Viola hederacea; 0.83, 0.012 for Hedera helix). At the onset of the
    yellowing event (18 to 24 November), the averages decreased to 0.84 (−3.4% for
    Viola hederacea) and 0.81 (−2.4% for Hedera helix), and the standard deviation
    increased to 0.049 (540% for Viola hederacea) and 0.044 (360% for Hedera helix)
    compared to the period just before the yellowing event. As the yellowing event
    progressed (1 to 21 December), the averages further decreased to 0.651 (−22% for
    Viola hederacea) and 0.759 (−6% for Hedera helix), and the standard deviation
    increased to 0.154 (314% for Viola hederacea) and 0.077 (175% for Hedera helix),
    compared to the beginning of the yellowing event. Similarly, the REIP and OSAVI
    averages decreased, and the standard deviation increased at the beginning of the
    yellowing event and beyond. The water content indices, WBI and NW-2, exhibited
    periodic changes throughout the study, with more drastic average decreases and
    standard deviation increases (WBI: −5.7%, 270%; NW-2: −15.7%, 300%) in Viola hederacea
    at the beginning of the yellowing. Other VIs were either not stable (e.g., r,
    G, PRI, NPQI, RVI, and mSR705) or very stable (e.g., SIPI) throughout the seasons,
    but also showed a decrease in average value and a drastic increase in standard
    deviation at the beginning of the yellowing event. Both species experienced decreases
    in average VIs and increases in standard deviation, indicating degradation of
    the entire GW during the yellowing event. Nevertheless, the changes in average
    and standard deviation values were more significant for Viola hederacea, and it
    eventually turned yellow and died. As for the STD kernel, the increase for both
    species began even before the beginning of the yellowing event (around 21 October)
    and continued to rise until the end of the time series. Some indices (e.g., NDVI,
    G, and PRI) exhibited a more synchronized response with the vegetation condition
    than others (e.g., NPQI, NWI-2, and mSR705). At the south-facing GW (Figure 7b),
    the NDVI averages and standard deviation were 0.77 and 0.013 (Viola hederacea),
    and 0.81 and 0.017 (Hedera helix) respectively from the beginning of the monitoring
    until the yellowing event, and 0.765 and 0.031 (Viola hederacea), and 0.788 and
    0.032 (Hedera helix) just before the yellowing event (14 to 30 September). At
    the onset of the yellowing event (14 October), the average of both species dropped,
    and the standard deviation drastically increased by −12%, 387% (Viola hederacea),
    and −3.8%, 125% (Hedera helix) compared to the period just before the yellowing
    event. In this GW, the Viola hederacea yellowing event was much more intensive
    and was visually apparent from the beginning. Thus, the difference between the
    species is even more significant than in the north-facing GW. As the yellowing
    event progressed (21 October to 1 December), the averages continued to decrease
    to 0.578 (−14% for Viola hederacea) and 0.738 (−2.6% for Hedera helix). Several
    VIs (i.e., PRI, RVI, and mSR705) gradually decreased in both species throughout
    the monitoring period, which may indicate a gradual degradation in the entire
    GW vitality over the year. However, during the yellowing event, all VIs values
    sharply changed in average and standard deviation only for the Viola hederacea,
    which turned yellow, while Hedera helix changes were much more moderate. As for
    the STD kernel, the increase was more intense for Viola hederacea and started
    only at the beginning of the yellowing event (14 October) and continued to rise
    until the end of the time series. Like the north-facing GW, the STD kernels of
    the indices showed variable synchronization with the vegetation condition. However,
    unlike the north-facing GW, the STD kernel did not increase before the yellowing
    event. During the study period, the north-facing GW remained entirely shaded,
    while the south-facing GW was fully exposed to sunlight during midday. Due to
    seasonal changes in the sun’s position, the south-facing GW (213) was entirely
    shaded in the last two images (24 November and 1 December), and partially shaded
    at the bottom of the GW (mainly at the Hedera helix areas) in the third image
    from the end (1 November). The shading conditions affected several pigment VIs
    in the last (2–3) images in the time series (Figure 7b). For example, PRI and
    NPQI sharply decreased during the yellowing event but started to increase on 1
    November, even though the yellowing event continued. Due to the mixed sun-shadow
    conditions in the 1 November image, noisy values were observed in PRI, NPQI, WBI,
    and NW-2 in the Hedera helix dataset. Therefore, we excluded this time step from
    the time series. The complete time series data, including the excluded time step,
    can be found in Figure A1 in Appendix A. Figure 8 presents the average ∆T of the
    two species for each GW. Data from the thermal camera is missing from 24 September
    until 21 October and on 23 June (north-facing GW) due to a technical problem (see
    Section 2.2). From the ∆T time series, it is evident that the north-facing GW
    (212) did not exhibit drastic changes in ∆T, except toward the end of the time
    series when ∆T began to rise as the GW yellowing progressed. This rise was observed
    in both species, although Hedera helix did not undergo yellowing. Conversely,
    at the south-facing GW, the ∆T index exhibited a consistent rise and was even
    slightly higher for the Hedera helix. Following the commencement of the yellowing
    event, ∆T in Viola hederacea continued to increase and surpassed that of Hedera
    helix. Data was unavailable before and after the commencement of the yellowing
    event, introducing uncertainty for this period. The consistent rise in ∆T was
    also observed in various HS VIs (see Figure 7b) and likely resulted from the gradual
    degradation of the entire GW. Eventually, this degradation led to the yellowing
    of Viola hederacea, whereas Hedera helix did not exhibit visual yellowing. The
    lowest ∆T in both GWs was recorded in the initial image (21 May), captured during
    a heatwave that transpired between 14–22 May 2020. During this period, the air
    temperature was elevated (Ta = 38 °C), and relative humidity was low (RH = 19.6%).
    In well-watered, unstressed vegetation, elevated air temperature, and reduced
    RH enhanced plant transpiration and resulted in decreased Tcanopy compared to
    air temperature (López et al., 2022 [65]). Figure 8. Time series of Viola hederacea
    (purple), and Hedera helix (green) average ∆T index in the (a) north-facing (212)
    and (b) south-facing (213) GWs. The vertical yellow shading and red triangle indicate
    the beginning of the yellowing events in each GW. The dotted lines are an interpolation
    of the missing data. 3.2. Early Detection of Stress Events Figure 9 illustrates
    the use of the r index as the “ground truth” for desiccated vegetation. The RGB
    and the r index images are depicted for both GWs. The yellowing index [%] is computed
    based on the r > 0.3 threshold. Figure 9. Yellowing index [%] for each GW based
    on the r index (r > 0.3). (a) North-facing GW and (b) south-facing GW. Images
    are presented for the date chosen as the reference image for early detection (14
    December at the north-facing GW and 24 November at the south-facing GW). The last
    column in the south-facing GW (b) yellowing index (1 December) is lower than the
    image before (24 November), due to vegetation regrowth in part of the yellowed
    area. Following the binary classification of stressed/green pixels for each VI
    based on the Otsu threshold, each image was compared to the reference image at
    four time steps before the first yellowing was visually apparent. In total, 48
    confusion matrices were computed (12 VIs × 4 time steps). Figure 10 shows a summary
    of the outcomes of the confusion matrices across the four VI categories outlined
    in Table 1 (RGB and HS pigment, leaf structure, and water content). At the north-facing
    GW (Figure 10a), 17 days before the onset of the yellowing event, metrics (accuracy,
    precision, and F1 score) displayed the highest values within the leaf structure
    and water content groups, both of which were derived from NIR wavelengths. In
    contrast, lower values were observed in the pigment groups (RGB and HS). Discrepancies
    in metrics among the classifiers became evident 35 days before the initial yellowing,
    occurring two months prior to the date of the ground-truth image, referenced for
    stressed vegetation (14 December). In the case of the south-facing GW (Figure
    10b), distinguishing between classifiers proved more challenging, with the range
    between 14–20 days before the initial yellowing event appearing to be the inflection
    point, also approximately two months prior to the ground-truth image on 24 November.
    In this context, the HS pigment and leaf structure groups yielded the highest
    performance. Figure 10. Maximum accuracy, precision, false alarm, and F1 score
    for each VIs group at the (a) north-facing and (b) south-facing GW. Each metric
    is colored based on the minimum value (white), median (gray), and maximum value
    (black). Table 2 outlines the highest metric scores within each VIs category during
    the final time step (17 days: north-facing; 14 days: south-facing) before the
    initial yellowing became visually apparent. At the north-facing GW, the water
    content index NWI-2 emerged as the most effective predictor (based on the F1 score),
    followed by the WBI index and then the OSAVI index. NWI-2 accurately predicted
    85% of the yellowing area on 14 December as early as 1 November, with an accuracy
    of 0.91, precision of 0.84, false alarm rate of 0.06, and F1 score of 0.85. Similarly,
    NWI-2 anticipated 64% of the yellow pixels 35 days prior to the initial yellowing
    (approximately two months ahead of the reference yellowing image), achieving an
    accuracy of 0.85, precision of 0.82, false alarm rate of 0.06, and F1 score of
    0.72. Meanwhile, at the south-facing GW, NPQI proved to be the strongest classifier,
    followed by the mSR705 and PRI indices. NPQI successfully predicted 72% of the
    24 November yellow pixels as early as 30 September, boasting an accuracy of 0.87,
    precision of 0.73, false alarm rate of 0.08, and F1 score of 0.73. Table 2. Metrics
    for each group at the north (212) and south (213) facing GWs at the last time
    step before the visual yellowing (17 days at 212 and 14 days at 213). Our investigation
    also encompassed the ∆T thermal index for the early detection of stressed vegetation.
    At the north-facing GW, the performance of ∆T on November 1 trailed behind the
    water content and leaf structure groups but surpassed the pigment group (accuracy
    of 0.87, precision of 0.77, false alarm rate of 0.09, and F1 score of 0.78). Previous
    time step metrics were slightly superior to the leaf structure group but still
    lagged behind the water content group. For the south-facing GW, missing data hindered
    our assessment of the time steps (24 and 30 September) that closely preceded the
    initial visible yellowing. Metrics for the final time step (14 September, around
    two and a half months before the reference image) were slightly lower than those
    of the other VIs groups (accuracy of 0.79, precision of 0.6, false alarm rate
    of 0.1, and F1 score of 0.53). Figure 11 presents the time series of stress maps
    for both the north and south-facing GWs. In the north-facing GW, a small region
    within the ROI began to yellow on 18 November (Figure 11a). The yellowing, occurring
    in small portions a few meters above the ground, was nearly impossible to detect
    through visual investigation on site. This event’s origins can be traced back
    two weeks or more. On 14 September, thermal index imagery displayed cooler vegetation
    temperatures (denoted by darker hues) in certain areas, suggesting potential over-irrigation
    or drainage issues. By 1 November, these areas exhibited decreased water content
    (NWI-2). The initial yellowing transpired where vegetation temperatures were lower,
    indicating that the first affected regions suffered from excessive irrigation.
    Although irrigation was scaled back on 22 October (Figure 1e), the areas affected
    by over-irrigation failed to recover and were the first to exhibit yellowing.
    Figure 11. Time series of RGB images (left), the r index (middle left), the high-performance
    classifier (middle right), and ∆T calculated from the thermal image (right) for
    the (a) north-facing (212) and (b) south-facing (213) walls. The red frame is
    the ROI from which the time series of the VIs were extracted. At the south-facing
    GW (Figure 11b), owing to the absence of TIR image data (see Section 2.2), we
    were unable to pinpoint the cause of stress events. Nevertheless, stressed regions
    were successfully detected and visualized before the visible yellowing using VIs.
    The time series of PRI, NPQI, RVI, REIP, and mSR705 indices (Figure 7b) indicated
    a decline in plant vitality as early as August 2020. Thermal index images prior
    to the yellowing event (8 and 14 September) highlighted the warmest areas (represented
    by brighter tones) at the GW’s upper portion–these regions were the first to undergo
    yellowing on 14 October. 4. Discussion Economic feasibility and maintenance are
    among the limiting factors of VGS [66]. While the significant construction costs
    are usually foreseen during the planning phase, clients often find themselves
    surprised by the unforeseen service costs linked to maintenance. The expense of
    irrigation is recognized as a significant factor [67], and the consequences of
    both inadequate and excessive irrigation, coupled with various abiotic or biotic
    stressors, can lead to VGS failure and necessitate extensive plant replacements
    [68]. While recommendations such as employing more tolerated plants [69,70] or
    irrigating using non-potable water [71] may alleviate certain operational costs,
    continuous monitoring of VGS is essential [20]. Real-time monitoring can identify
    stress indicators or system irregularities (e.g., drainage issues), allowing for
    timely intervention and averting the need for extensive plant replacements before
    irreversible damage occurs. This integrated approach not only addresses economic
    considerations but also underscores the importance of proactive monitoring in
    sustaining the long-term functionality and vitality of VGS. In this study, we
    employed time series of hyperspectral (HS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imaging
    to illustrate practical approaches for the ongoing monitoring of green walls (GWs)
    (Figure 7 and Figure 8) and the early detection of stress events via unsupervised
    Otsu classification (Figure 10, Table 2). General statistics derived from vegetation
    indices (VIs) provided insights into the entire GW (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Additionally,
    mapping the VI images into stress maps (Figure 11) offered spatial information
    on vegetation and watering status—a highly valuable asset in VGS, given the constrained
    accessibility to plants and the substrate [72]. These insights provided information
    about the timing of stress and possible reasons, which could be associated with
    watering patterns (either lack or over-irrigation). Our analysis employed a semiautomated
    method, realized through Python code, for noninvasive continuous monitoring of
    GWs. Apart from the manual image capture process (Figure 2a,b), image projection,
    and pre-preparation of plant species masks, the entire image processing workflow
    (Figure 3) can be fully automated, providing valuable insights into VGS health.
    Notably, the manual aspects of this study carry some limitations. The image projection
    process could impact accuracy, and the consistent mask for species separation
    from a specific date might not precisely depict species boundaries in subsequent
    images due to vegetation growth. Nevertheless, vegetation growth remains restricted
    due to the small size of the GW modules. In the continuous monitoring of both
    GWs, the yellowing event of Viola hederacea manifested as a decrease/increase
    in VIs values, a rise in standard deviation, and significant change in STD kernel
    across all VIs (Figure 7). In the north-facing GW, yellowing initially affected
    small sections, leading to a moderate decrease/increase in average VIs and a substantial
    upsurge in standard deviation and STD kernel values (Figure 7a). Hedera helix
    exhibited milder changes, potentially indicating a degree of stress without yellowing.
    Conversely, at the south-facing GW, the averages of several VIs consistently decreased/increased
    for both species since the summer, preceding the yellowing event, signifying the
    gradual deterioration of GW vitality over time (Figure 7b). Certain VIs were less
    sensitive and more stable over time (e.g., NDVI, SIPI), nevertheless, they were
    precise in detecting the yellowing event. Increased vegetation variation is generally
    viewed as a marker of stress [73,74]. The pronounced escalation in standard deviation
    values across all VIs during the yellowing event, along with a rise in several
    VIs’ STD kernels even before the event’s onset, highlights plants’ varied responses
    to stress conditions. This gradual change during the yellowing event suggests
    that plants did not experience immediate yellowing but responded in a non-uniform
    manner. This indicates that these parameters can serve as stress detectors in
    VGS as well. Some VIs were notably sensitive to shadow conditions, as observed
    in the final three images at the south-facing GW (Figure 7b and Figure A1 in Appendix
    A). Mixed shadow-sun conditions on 1 November also affected water content VIs,
    while several NIR-based VIs (such as RVI, NDVI, and SIPI) demonstrated lesser
    sensitivity to illumination changes, revealing the VIs’ trends. When devising
    a monitoring system utilizing image processing techniques in an outdoor environment,
    accounting for illumination variation along the VGS is crucial due to the vertical
    arrangement of the VGS and the intricate nature of the outdoor urban setting [75].
    Although we employed pixel-based spectrum normalization to address illumination
    variation in the vertical direction (Section 2.3.1), we did not account for shadowed
    areas. Our findings emphasize that normalized NIR-based VIs, such as NDVI, maintain
    consistent patterns even under varying lighting conditions while still providing
    information regarding plant conditions. Based on these observations, we propose
    that such VIs could serve as valuable tools to mitigate the effects of diverse
    illumination and uphold reliable vegetation monitoring in nonuniformed illumination
    areas. Further exploration into shadow treatment in VGS and in other urban settings
    is warranted. The time series of the ∆T index derived from TIR images provided
    supplementary insights into the plants’ water usage across the GWs (Figure 8).
    In the north-facing GW, a significant rise in the ∆T index was not observed until
    substantial sections of Viola hederacea along the GW displayed yellowing. Notably,
    the detection based on the ∆T time series lagged behind the HS VIs, where an increase
    was noted for both species only two weeks after the initiation of the yellowing
    event. This escalation in ∆T in the north-facing GW aligned with a sudden reduction
    in irrigation since 24 November (Figure 1e). Conversely, in the south-facing GW,
    ∆T increased progressively and remained elevated since the summer (August), extending
    through the yellowing event for both species. This pattern mirrored the HS VIs
    time series, indicating a gradual decline in the entire GW’s vitality over time
    (Figure 7b). The VIs and ∆T index time series from both GWs reveal that while
    plant species’ index values may differ, the trends throughout the study were similar,
    suggesting stress across the entire GWs. Nonetheless, the plants’ response to
    stress varied: one species (Viola hederacea) turned yellow and ultimately perished,
    while the other (Hedera helix) remained green and survived. This distinction in
    species’ stress response was mirrored in the ongoing VI monitoring, with more
    pronounced changes observed in the affected species, particularly reflected in
    heightened variation (i.e., standard deviation and STD kernel). Given that a GW
    often contains multiple vegetation species along the wall, species separation
    might be necessary when designing a remote sensing image-based monitoring system
    for more precise and comprehensive monitoring. Nevertheless, monitoring without
    separation can still offer insights into the GW’s overall vitality and generate
    stress maps for spatial issue detection. Early detection of stressed vegetation
    along the GWs was also explored in this study using RGB and HS VIs, as well as
    the ∆T thermal index, followed by Otsu unsupervised classification (Figure 10
    and Table 2). Plant yellowing is a symptom of a spectrum of problems, such as
    watering issues, temperature stress, lack of sunlight, insufficient nutrition,
    over-fertilization, disease, and pests. Although the precise cause of vegetation
    yellowing was not systematically diagnosed in this study, we presented initial
    findings highlighting the early detection of vegetation yellowing. The assembled
    data, including HS and TIR images, irrigation patterns, and environmental conditions,
    yields promising outcomes for the early detection of issues in VGS. These results
    offer an initial step toward gaining valuable insights into the causes of stress.
    While stress detection techniques in agriculture have progressed with the advent
    of machine learning and deep learning, our preference was to employ more straightforward
    approaches using image thresholding. Thresholding methods continue to be applied
    in stress detection and segmentation process in recent agricultural studies [76,77,78].
    Complex models demand extensive training datasets, particularly in our study’s
    context, where amassing substantial datasets of stress-affected pixels is undesirable
    in VGS. Additionally, the adoption of a simpler method establishes a baseline
    for future research in stress detection within VGS and presents an opportunity
    for further exploration as a practical tool. As anticipated, the HS VIs outperformed
    the RGB VIs, yielding superior outcomes for the early detection of stressed areas.
    Performance varied among the VIs groups and GW orientations (north/south). In
    the north-facing GW, the water content and leaf structure VIs exhibited the most
    reliable predictive capability, while in the south-facing GW, the HS pigment and
    leaf structure indices demonstrated superior performance in predicting stressed
    areas. Thus, we recommend using multiple sets of VIs for comprehensive plant parameter
    monitoring in image-based monitoring. Notably, the leaf structure VIs group demonstrated
    high performance in both orientations. Results from the north-facing GW revealed
    that 85% of stressed areas could be detected 17 days before visible yellowing
    (42 days before the ground-truth image) with an accuracy of 0.91. In the south-facing
    GW, 72% of the stressed area was detectable 14 days before visible yellowing (approximately
    two months before the ground-truth image), with an accuracy of 0.87. While early
    detection using ∆T in the north-facing GW exhibited lower performance compared
    to the water content and leaf structure VIs, it outperformed the pigment VIs group.
    In the south-facing GW, the performance of ∆T (alongside other VIs) was relatively
    diminished, likely due to data gaps and the limited time steps tested. Nonetheless,
    the visualization of the thermal index within stress maps (Figure 11) facilitated
    the identification of potential causes for vegetation stress. HS vegetation indices
    were most effective in the early detection of stress; nevertheless, RGB vegetation
    indices, such as the r and G indices, are effective for real-time stress detection
    indicated by color changes. Unlike the costly HS camera used in this study, RGB
    VIs can readily detect pigment alterations through simple manual or automated
    thresholding processes (Figure 9 and Figure 10). Developing an alert system for
    VGS based on RGB camera technology is feasible and could serve as an ongoing control
    system for large-scale VGS operations. Note that in this study we employed narrow
    RGB channels extracted from the HS camera. This likely resulted in higher accuracy
    compared to the use of broader channels commonly found in low-cost RGB cameras.
    Visualizing the HS VIs and thermal index through images (Figure 11) in conjunction
    with the irrigation patterns (Figure 1e) allowed us to pinpoint the cause of the
    plants’ stress in the north-facing GW. It is plausible that the yellowing event
    commenced in over-irrigated regions that were suddenly subjected to reduced irrigation.
    In the south-facing GW, although early yellowing occurrences were successfully
    detected, discerning the exact cause of plant stress proved challenging. An analysis
    of multiple indices’ time series from the south-facing GW (Figure 7b), including
    the thermal index (Figure 8b), revealed that the gradual decline in vegetation
    vitality commenced during the summer (August 2020), a full two months prior to
    the initial visual appearance of yellowing. Continuous irrigation over several
    months (from May to October) without adjustments to account for higher temperatures
    during the heatwave (14–22 May) and the summer months (July–August) (Figure 1e)
    likely initiated early plant stress. Moreover, the reduction in irrigation levels
    during October possibly exacerbated plant stress, ultimately culminating in the
    emergence of the yellowing event two weeks later. Monitoring large-scale outdoor
    VGS with cameras is mainly a challenging task due to their vertical orientation
    limiting the accessibility needed for optimal camera position. To tackle the maintenance
    issues associated with vertical structures, robotics solutions like cable-driven
    and rail track robots have been developed [14,34,79]. Researchers have also explored
    various image-based monitoring approaches for vertical crops like greenhouse tomatoes,
    using multiple cameras positioned at different heights [80], as well as the use
    of mobile robots [81,82]. In the context of the ongoing monitoring of large-scale
    VGS health, it is essential to collect spatial data that enables the early detection
    of problems. Achieving this is challenging with the methods mentioned above. Additionally,
    outdoor VGS typically do not yield the same commercial profits as agricultural
    structures, necessitating the search for simpler and more practical monitoring
    solutions than those previously discussed. Implementing ground-based monitoring,
    as conducted in this study, by stationing cameras in a fixed position on the ground,
    offers a straightforward approach to continuous surveillance. Although the normalization
    of spectral data facilitated data analysis, it is important to acknowledge that
    the vertical orientation in real-scale VGS could potentially influence the results.
    Nonetheless, the findings from ongoing monitoring, the early detection of stressed
    vegetation, and the visualization of stress maps, as demonstrated in this study,
    indicate the feasibility of this method for the broad-scale monitoring of large-scale
    VGS at the single image (without mosaicking). Alternative solutions, such as utilizing
    multiple camera positions or employing adjustable mounts or tracks positioned
    in front of the VGS, should be considered to mitigate the vertical impact while
    preserving spatial distribution. While our study presented the benefits of using
    precision agriculture methodologies in VGS, here we address certain limitations.
    The manual monitoring of specific ROI using expensive equipment (HS and TIR cameras)
    in our study raises concerns about the cost-effectiveness of continuously monitoring
    VGS. To optimize ongoing monitoring, it is crucial to explore alternative approaches,
    such as using more affordable sensors and implementing fully automated operations
    that can cover large-scale VGS. Additionally, shaded areas, common in VGS due
    to their vertical structure, need further study to find treatment solutions when
    employing image-based monitoring techniques. Technical issues with the TIR camera
    unveiled temporal gaps in the time series, hindering our ability to draw conclusive
    findings for the south-facing VGS. Furthermore, our study focused on the symptom
    of ‘yellowing’ without delving into the underlying causes of stress. Unexplored
    factors like nutrition, lighting conditions, and insect-related stresses may introduce
    complexities not addressed in our analysis. To address these limitations, future
    research should investigate the causes of stress in VGS, providing a more comprehensive
    understanding of the underlying phenomena. 5. Summary and Conclusions The goal
    of this study was to examine the applicability of ground-based remote sensing
    techniques to monitor outdoor VGS. Additionally, we showcased a semiautomated
    approach for the early detection of vegetation stress and the visualization of
    spatially related issues through time series representation. The main conclusions
    of our study are as follows: Consistent monitoring utilizing HS and TIR images
    can identify shifts in VGS health through index values, standard deviation, and
    STD kernel metrics. Both vegetation species experienced stress, yet only Viola
    hederacea exhibited yellowing and eventual demise. Our observations suggest that
    the Hedera helix is less vulnerable to changes in irrigation patterns and can
    recover more effectively following stress events. Species differentiation is pivotal
    for meticulous monitoring, accounting for each species’ unique characteristics
    and stress responses. Nevertheless, monitoring and visualizing the overall GW
    over time, without segregating individual species, can offer invaluable insights
    into the overall health of the GW and facilitate the identification of spatially
    linked issues. Given the complexity of urban settings and the vertical arrangement
    of vegetation, variations in illumination should be considered when implementing
    image-based VGS monitoring, and further investigation is needed. Early detection
    performance of stressed vegetation ranged from 14 to 35 days before visible yellowing,
    with an accuracy of 0.85 to 0.91. The insights gained from this study could be
    harnessed to formulate an automated spatial decision support system that fosters
    more efficient VGS operations. Additional investigations into stress detection
    methods and the adoption of low-cost cameras in outdoor VGS should be explored
    under different conditions and with various plant species. Author Contributions

  description: Irrigation is a significant process in smart precision agriculture
    to manage the water utilization of crop demand. The water required for irrigation
    is remarkably inconsistent, and the farmer’s decision is final regarding when
    and how much to irrigate. The accurate decision of irrigation process occurrence
    in the farm field is an important cause to scale and improve the water management
    procedure, accordingly, the sustainability of smart irrigation. In this proposed
    research work, a heuristic methodology that combines an Artificial Neural Network
    and the Genetic Algorithm had developed to predict the optimal water demand of
    the crop. The proposed methodology tested with real-time agricultural data showed
    that developed models have been well-suitable for optimal irrigation in precision
    agriculture contexts.

  description: The integral development of agriculture and tourism heavily depends
    on natural resources, especially agricultural resources, and it also may contribute
    to the sustainability of agriculture. The sustainability of agriculture is usually
    measured by the agricultural eco-efficiency. The main objective of this paper
    is to demonstrate the impact of the agriculture and tourism integration on agricultural
    eco-efficiency, so as to reflect the role of the agriculture and tourism integration
    on promoting agricultural sustainability. Applying panel data of 19 provinces
    in Yangtze River Basin and Yellow River Basin in China from 2008 to 2019, this
    paper uses a PSTR model to demonstrate the impact of agriculture and tourism integration
    on agricultural eco-efficiency and its mechanisms. It is found that in the study
    area, the integration of agriculture and tourism can contribute to improvements
    in agricultural eco-efficiency, and when levels of integration are high, the promotional
    effect is enhanced. However, impacts vary among different regions to some extent.
    In terms of influencing mechanisms, inputs of agricultural labor, sown crop area,
    effective irrigation area and other factors decrease with continuous improvements
    of integration. The input of pesticides, fertilizers and other factors does not
    decrease in the initial stage of integration but undergoes a rapid decrease after
    crossing a threshold value. And it demonstrates that the integration of agriculture
    and tourism is beneficial for improving the agricultural eco-efficiency, so that
    it will contribute to agricultural sustainability. Meanwhile, this paper offers
    a new research perspective for discovering effects of agriculture and tourism
    integration, providing implications for formulating regional policies for the
    integration.

    metrics Abstract The integral development of agriculture and tourism heavily depends
    on natural resources, especially agricultural resources, and it also may contribute
    to the sustainability of agriculture. The sustainability of agriculture is usually
    measured by the agricultural eco-efficiency. The main objective of this paper
    is to demonstrate the impact of the agriculture and tourism integration on agricultural
    eco-efficiency, so as to reflect the role of the agriculture and tourism integration
    on promoting agricultural sustainability. Applying panel data of 19 provinces
    in Yangtze River Basin and Yellow River Basin in China from 2008 to 2019, this
    paper uses a PSTR model to demonstrate the impact of agriculture and tourism integration
    on agricultural eco-efficiency and its mechanisms. It is found that in the study
    area, the integration of agriculture and tourism can contribute to improvements
    in agricultural eco-efficiency, and when levels of integration are high, the promotional
    effect is enhanced. However, impacts vary among different regions to some extent.
    In terms of influencing mechanisms, inputs of agricultural labor, sown crop area,
    effective irrigation area and other factors decrease with continuous improvements
    of integration. The input of pesticides, fertilizers and other factors does not
    decrease in the initial stage of integration but undergoes a rapid decrease after
    crossing a threshold value. And it demonstrates that the integration of agriculture
    and tourism is beneficial for improving the agricultural eco-efficiency, so that
    it will contribute to agricultural sustainability. Meanwhile, this paper offers
    a new research perspective for discovering effects of agriculture and tourism
    integration, providing implications for formulating regional policies for the
    integration. Similar content being viewed by others The socio-economic performance

    A review Article Open access 27 October 2020 The Impact of Population Growth on
    Natural Resources and Farmers’ Capacity to Adapt to Climate Change in Low-Income
    Countries Article 16 March 2021 1 Introduction China is a big agricultural country
    with the most largest population in the world, which has made remarkable achievements
    in agricultural industry (Deng & Gibson, 2019). From 1978 to 2019, the total output
    of grain, aquatic products and meat in China increased by several times, accounting
    for 1/5, 1/3 and 1/4 of the world’s supply of these products (Liu et al., 2019;
    Zeng et al., 2021). The rapid growth of China’s agriculture is mainly due to the
    continuous increase in input factors, which also leads to serious agricultural
    endogenous pollution. In terms of input factors, the use of pesticides, fertilizers
    and agricultural plastic films increased by 2.2 times, 6.7 times and 5.2 times,
    respectively (Liu et al., 2020a; Shi, 2022). The effective utilization rates of
    chemical fertilizer and pesticide are very low; the rate of the former is less
    than 1/3, and the rate of the latter is less than 2/3. Agricultural growth in
    China mainly depends on the intensive input of production factors. The pattern
    of agricultural production has led to serious agricultural pollution (Liu et al.,
    2019; Zou et al., 2020). And it has replaced industrial pollution as the biggest
    source of pollution in China (Zhao et al., 2022). In recent years, with aggravation
    of negative effects of agricultural production and the upsurge of sustainable
    development all over the world, to protect agricultural environment and achieve
    sustainability in agriculture has become an important issue concerned by the government
    and academia. Therefore, agricultural eco-efficiency has become a hot topic of
    research, by which agricultural sustainability can be reflected. Technological
    progress and urbanization have stimulated people’s demand for tourism, among which
    agriculture-related tourism is an adequate way to meet people’s needs, which can
    provide a relaxed and comfortable leisure environment (Ćirić et al., 2021). As
    a result, multi-functions of agriculture besides providing agricultural products
    have been explored, such as its function of tour, leisure and entertainment. Therefore,
    based on agricultural industry chain and featured by agriculture-related tourism,
    various forms of agriculture and tourism integration have gradually taken shape
    (Deng et al., 2019), such as agri-tourism, leisure agriculture and rural tourism
    (Karampela et al., 2021). The Guideline on Comprehensively Promoting Rural Revitalization
    and Accelerating Agriculture and Rural Modernization in China clearly states that
    the overall development of agriculture and tourism is an important way to promote
    rural revitalization and deepen supply-side structural reform. By the end of 2020,
    China had set up 388 demonstration counties as leisure agriculture and rural tourism
    destinations, and promoted 1,216 “China’s Beautiful Leisure Villages” and 1,199
    “National key villages for rural tourism” (Wang et al., 2022). According to data
    from the Ministry of Agriculture in China, the number of leisure agricultural
    tourists is 1.5 billion tourists, which generated revenue of 360 billion Yuan
    in 2014, while the number of leisure agricultural tourists increased to 3.2 billion,
    which generated revenue of 850 billion Yuan. In 2019, the total number of leisure
    agricultural tourists accounted for 53.28% of all the domestic tourists, while
    the operating income it generated accounted for 14.83% of the operating income
    of domestic tourism in China, which can be seen in Table 1. Table 1 Development
    of leisure agriculture and rural tourism in China Full size table With agriculture
    and tourism integration, its comprehensive effect can be further highlighted.
    On one hand, the integration of agriculture and tourism plays an significant role
    in solving bottlenecks of agricultural and tourism development (Schilling et al.,
    2012). On the other hand, it can effectively extend and expand the industry chain
    of agriculture, promote development of agro-related industries, and provide more
    jobs for farmers, thereby increasing their incomes (Veeck et al., 2016). A leisure
    farm with an annual reception of 100,000 people can achieve a business income
    of 10 million Yuan and increase the income of more than 1,000 agricultural families.Data
    from China National Leisure Agriculture and Rural Tourism Parks show that the
    sales revenue of agriculture and related products in the past five years is equivalent
    to the total operating revenue of the parks. According to the data of 1,000 key
    rural tourism villages in the first quarter of 2021 in China, the contribution
    of rural tourism employment is 47.1% on average (Tourism Big Data Center of Ministry
    of Culture and Tourism in China 2021). The agro-tourism activities is deeply affected
    by ecological, economic and tourism resources, of which ecological factors are
    the most critical (Koscak, 1998; Lupi et al., 2017; Torres, 2003; Wei, 2015).
    Agriculture-related tourism activities, such as harvesting local products and
    gathering forest fruits, also may affect the environment (Ammirato et al., 2020;
    Ćirić et al., 2021), especially on agriculture environment. However, few research
    and data have focused on the integral development of these two industries on agricultural
    environment or agricultural sustainability. Against above context, main purposes
    of this paper are as follows: 1) to measure the integral level of agriculture
    and tourism to better identify the linkage of agriculture and tourism, 2) to assess
    the agricultural ecological efficiency involving multi-outputs and multi-inputs,
    3) to demonstrate impacts of the agriculture and tourism integration on agricultural
    eco-efficiency, and 4) to identify influencing mechanisms of agriculture and tourism
    integration on agricultural eco-efficiency so as to put forward some policy recommendations.
    The contributions of this study are as follows: Firstly, it demonstrates the impact
    of the integral development of agriculture and tourism on agricultural eco-efficiency
    with empirical analysis, providing a new perspective for exploring factors which
    may affect agricultural eco-efficiency and agricultural sustainability; secondly,
    it focuses on the environmental effect of the agriculture and tourism integration
    from the perspective of impacts on agricultural eco-efficiency, while most studies
    concerning its economic and social impacts. 2 Literature review 2.1 The integral
    development of agriculture and tourism 2.1.1 Connotation of integral development
    of agriculture and tourism CAMPBELL et al. (2007) believed that an industry could
    cause changes in other industrial structures through inter-industrial linkage,
    providing possibilities for inter-industrial coupling development Tourism industry
    is a highly comprehensive and highly correlated industry, which has the possibility
    of integration with agriculture and its related industries. Tourism revenue determines
    the demand for tourism products and then determines the production of agricultural
    products and food in the process of tourism consumption. (Ristić et al., 2019;
    Rogerson, 2012). On the other hand, agricultural production process and seasonal
    characteristics affect the content of tourism supply (Sanches-Pereira et al. 2017;
    Torres, 2003). Given the strong linkage of tourism and agriculture, increasing
    attention has been given to the integration of agriculture and tourism (Gilbert
    & Hudson, 2000; Ristić et al., 2019; Streifeneder, 2016). Nie and Fang (2019)
    believes that the integration of agriculture and tourism is a process in which
    the internalization of inter-industrial division of labor, blurriness of boundary,
    sharing of products, markets and resources and the symbiosis development of the
    two industries are driven by market demand, economic growth and competition. Agriculture
    and tourism integration refers to the process of regional agro-tourism resource
    development, agricultural production and marketing, spatial layout and management
    implemented by the local government, agro-tourism enterprises, farmers and other
    relevant stakeholders to maximize economic, social and ecological benefits under
    specific local environment and consumption conditions (Wang, 2018). In terms of
    its nature, agricultural and tourism integration is a typical cross-type integration
    mode. In terms of its nature, the integration of agriculture and tourism is a
    typical cross-type integration mode. It is the application of leisure, experience,
    sightseeing and other agricultural functions in tourism industry chain, and also
    the play of tourism and leisure functions in the agricultural industry chain.
    In the integration of agriculture and tourism, the innovation result of agriculture
    changing the tourism industry chain is manifested as the production of tourism
    and leisure agricultural products and the new industrial forms of leisure, sightseeing
    and experience agriculture gradually formed based on this. The innovation results
    of tourism industry to change the agricultural industry chain are mainly reflected
    in the mining of tourism resources in agricultural production. This kind of agricultural
    products based on cross-integrated industrial resources expands the types of existing
    agricultural products and also changes the functions of the original products
    of these industries. At the same time, the supporting services related to agriculture
    are gradually derived to expand the versatility of agriculture, which can also
    be regarded as the integration mode of agricultural function expansion, which
    is shown in Fig. 1. Based on the cross-penetration between agriculture and tourism
    industry, the value creation function of tourism industry is gradually penetrated
    into the agricultural system, and the agricultural versatility is implanted in
    the tourism industry system, thus forming a new industrial form. Its essence is
    the deconstruction and extension of the value chain of agriculture and tourism
    industry, which can drive the integration, optimization and reorganization of
    resources, factors, technologies and market demands in rural areas, so as to enrich
    the connotation of agriculture, diversify the forms of industrial expression and
    diversify the forms of farmers’ income. Fig. 1 Conceptual frame of the integral
    development of agriculture and tourism R&D is short for research and development
    Full size image 2.1.2 Measurement of the integration level of agriculture and
    tourism Scholars have evaluated the level of industrial integration from the perspective
    of industrial association or industrial interaction. Studies from this perspective
    focus more on the evaluation of the state of interactive integration between industries.
    Similarly, scholars carrying out agriculture and tourism integration research
    usually measure the integration level of agriculture and tourism based on the
    correlation degree, coordination degree and industrial interaction between agriculture
    and tourism industry. Commonly used measurement methods from this perspective
    mainly include input–output method (Ye et al., 2018), coupling model (Wang, 2018;
    Zhang & Zhang, 2020; Zhou et al., 2016), gray correlation analysis method (Zhang
    & Zhang, 2020), co-integration analysis method (Nie & Fang, 2019), analytic hierarchy
    process method (Yang et al. 2021b; Chen et al., 2016) and vector autoregressive
    model (Xia and Xu 2016; Su, 2017; Liu et al., 2020a). 2.1.3 Effects of agriculture
    and tourism integration As for the effects of the integration of agriculture and
    tourism, lots of existing papers have focused on its economic, social and environmental
    effects. Some scholars believe that the interaction and integration of agriculture
    and tourism can create new and broad market space and expand consumer demand,
    while also promoting the high-quality development of agricultural products and
    tourism (Asiedu et al. 2011; Wang et al., 2022; Ilbery, 1991). And it improves
    the quality of agricultural products to better meet the needs of tourists and
    create more employment opportunities, which can increase farmers’ income, thereby
    reducing poverty and promoting economic development (Adiyia & Vanneste, 2018;
    Comerio & Strozzi, 2019; Pitrova et al., 2020; Veeck et al., 2016). At the same
    time, it makes the surplus rural labor force engaged in tourism reception work
    in their spare time, which is conducive to solving the shortage of local tourism
    labor force; the development of tourism expands the demand for agricultural products
    and can solve the problems of insufficient market demand for agricultural products
    (Podovac et al., 2019; Rogerson, 2012; Schilling et al., 2012). And it is also
    beneficial to rural environment (Podovac et al., 2019; Sanches-Pereira et al.
    2017). On the whole, the integration gives full play to the versatility of agriculture,
    explores the resource potential of agriculture and rural areas, and realizes the
    economic benefits of agricultural ecological resources in rural areas. On the
    other hand, the sustainable development of agricultural and tourism integration
    heavily depends on protection and sustainable utilization of these resources.
    Therefore, the integration of agriculture and tourism also forces the protection
    of agricultural ecological environment in turn. 2.2 Agricultural eco-efficiency
    2.2.1 Concept of agricultural eco-efficiency In 1990, Schaltegger and Sturn put
    forward the concept of ecological efficiency (eco-efficiency) in academia. They
    defined eco-efficiency as the ratio between economic growth and environmental
    impact. High eco-efficiency means maximum productivity with the least resource
    consumption, and minimizing environmental stress (Keating et al., 2010; Qu et
    al., 2022; Rosano-Peña et al., 2021). It was not until 1998 that the Organization
    for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) initiated the use of eco-efficiency
    in agricultural sector, in order to carry out effective assessments of agricultural
    production and its environmental impact (OECD, 1998). Since then, there have been
    more and more literatures on agricultural eco-efficiency, and great achievements
    have been made (Liu et al., 2019; Maia et al., 2016; Pishgar-Komleh et al., 2021).
    According to connotation of eco-efficiency, agricultural eco-efficiency (AEE)
    refers to the minimization of agricultural production factor input and undesired
    output under the given condition of expected output (Picazo et al. 2011). 2.2.2
    Measurement of agricultural eco-efficiency Some studies have assessed AEE based
    on the broad sense of agriculture, which contains the farming, husbandry, forestry,
    and fishing (Toma et al., 2015; Pan et al. 2013; Hong et al., 2016; Liu et al.,
    2020b). Other studies focused on the narrow sense of agriculture, which means
    crop plantation only (Wang et al. 2016;Wang et al. 2021;Xu et al., 2014; Shang
    et al., 2020;Picazo et al. 2011). In terms of non-expected output indicators,
    agricultural non-point source pollution (Zou et al., 2020), agricultural carbon
    emission (Pang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2020b; Tian 2014; Li 2014) and agricultural
    gray water pollution (Wang et al. 2021)are commonly used indicators. Based on
    AEE measurement, spatial–temporal evolution characteristics of AEE have been analyzed
    (Liu et al., 2020b). To evaluate agricultural ecological efficiency, many methods
    were constructed, such as Life Cycle Assessment, Ratio Method (Lyrstedt, 2005),
    Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) (Bravo-Ureta & Pinheiro, 1993; Deng & Gibson,
    2019; Jin et al., 2018; Suzigan et al., 2020) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)
    (Alene & Zeller, 2005;Pang et al., 2016; Picazo et al. 2011; Toma et al., 2015).
    Among them, DEA and SFA are the two main methods, which can achieve convincing
    results in most cases. 2.2.3 Influencing factors of agricultural eco-efficiency
    As for the influencing factors of AEE, some studies have focused on factors of
    agriculture itself, such as the agricultural scale level, agricultural industrial
    structure, per capita agricultural added value, agricultural disaster rate, and
    agricultural machinery density (Pang et al., 2016; Rybaczewska-Błazejowska & Gierulski,
    2018), while others analyzed relevant external influencing factors of agriculture,
    such as educational level of agricultural labor force, farmers’ household operating
    income ratio, public investment in agriculture, government regulation and technological
    progress (Liu et al., 2020b; Wang & Zhang, 2018). The literature review shows
    that previous studies have paid less attention to the influencing factors of AEE
    from the perspective of industrial integration. 2.3 Impacts and its mechanism
    of agriculture and tourism integration on AEE The agriculture and tourism integration
    is based on agriculture, which is the extension of agricultural multi-function
    and industrial chain. So agriculture-related tourism activities are largely depend
    on agricultural resources, which also influence the agriculture environment (Ćirić
    et al., 2021). First, the exchange of information and elements between agriculture
    and tourism will improve the quality of agricultural labor on one hand and transfer
    a number of surplus rural labor to cities on the other hand (Dax et al., 2019;
    Liu et al., 2014). The improvement of agricultural labor quality effectively improves
    AEE, and the increase in the number of labor transferred to other sectors reduces
    the input of agricultural labor, thus improving the level of agricultural effective
    output (Forsyth, 1995). Second, the integration of agriculture and tourism is
    helpful to spread advanced agricultural technologies. The agriculture-related
    leisure business is helpful to realize the ecological environment value of agriculture
    (Liu et al., 2014; Pitrova et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022), which helps to improve
    the capital accumulation level of agricultural producers and provides them with
    adequate capitals to purchase advanced and efficient agricultural machinery and
    equipment. As a result, it reduces the input of labor, land, mechanical power
    and other factors, which is beneficial to improve AEE. In addition, in order to
    promote industries integration, the government always takes advantage of its own
    resource advantages to protect rural arable land resources, revitalize idle rural
    arable land and create preconditions for the use of advanced agricultural technology
    (Yin & Xiao, 2019), so that agriculture input factors such as water and arable
    land can be saved a lot, and AEE is improved ultimately. Thus, agriculture and
    tourism integration is beneficial to reduce the agriculture inputs, especially
    those are harmful to environment (Sanches-Pereira et al. 2017). Meanwhile, the
    integration can strengthen the management of agricultural ecological environment.
    And it has gradually expanded the scale of non-agricultural industries, which
    enables government departments with enough financial support to improve the agricultural
    production environment (Colton & Bissix, 2005), such as promoting construction
    of saving water facilities and the education of ecological protection, so that
    ecological capital can be accumulated, which is the foundation for improving of
    AEE (Bayyurt & Yılmaz, 2012; Chakraborty, 2021). At the same time, in order to
    promote the sustainable development of agriculture and tourism integration, governments
    have continuously strengthened regulations on the usage of chemical fertilizers
    or pesticides, which results in reduction of these chemical products (Deng et
    al., 2019; Xie et al., 2018). On the other hand, the integration helps to strengthen
    the ecological behavior of agricultural producers (Lee & Jan, 2019). With the
    integral development, agricultural producers gradually begin to realize that agro-environmental
    ecological factors can provide them with create higher and sustainable premiums
    (Barbieri, 2013; Jiang, 2022). In order to achieve long-term sustainable economic
    benefits, they will set up green development concept, practice and strengthen
    environmental protection behavior, reducing harmful environmental elements inputs,
    thus promoting AEE (Setokoe et al., 2019). The influencing mechanism of agriculture
    and tourism integration on AEE is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 The impact mechanism
    of agriculture and tourism integration on AEE Full size image However, few empirical
    studies have concentrated on the influence of agriculture and tourism integration
    on AEE. Given the contemporary situation in China and the above analysis, it was
    hypothesized that: The integration of agriculture and tourism might contribute
    to improving the agricultural eco-efficiency, and this effect will be enhanced
    when the level of integration of agriculture and tourism increases. 3 Methods
    and materials 3.1 Evaluation of the integral level of agriculture and tourism
    based on the synergetic degree model Industrial integration can be regarded as
    a complex and changing open system formed through competition and cooperation
    among different industrial components in two or more industrial systems in time
    and space (Rui and Hu 2008). An industrial integration system is a self-organized
    system. Based on synergetic self-organization theory (Liening, 2014), this paper
    uses the synergetic degree model of the composite system proposed by Tao et al.
    (2017) to estimate the integrated level of agriculture and tourism. Suppose that
    the subsystem of the composite system of agriculture and tourism is Si, i ∈ [1,
    2], and the order parameter in its development process is ei = (ei1,ei2,…,ein)
    where n ≥ 1, βij ≤ eij ≤ αij, j = 1,2,…,n. In the formula (2), αij is the upper
    limit of order parameter component eij and βij is the lower limit (Huang et al.
    2020). For the lower limit, the minimum actual value for the past year can be
    used. The upper limit can be selected according to its predicted value, planned
    value, or maximum actual value in the past year. Then, the order degree of eij
    of the subsystem can be calculated as follows: $$\\mu_{i} \\left( {e_{ij} } \\right)
    = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\frac{{e_{ij} - \\beta_{ij} }}{{\\alpha_{ij}
    - \\beta_{ij} }},} & {j \\in \\left[ {1,\\;k} \\right]} \\\\ {\\frac{{\\alpha_{ij}
    - e_{ij} }}{{\\alpha_{ij} - \\beta_{ij} }},} & {j \\in \\left[ {k + 1,\\;n} \\right]}
    \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$ (1) According to the above equation, μi(eij) ∈ [0,
    1], the larger μi(eij) is, the greater the “contribution” of order parameter component
    eij to the system order(Wan et al., 2021). We must note here that in a real system,
    there are a number of eijs that are either too high or low, but it is better to
    concentrate around a particular point. For an eij value that does not meet the
    order degree definition, it can be satisfied by adjusting its value range [βij,
    αij]. The order degree not only depends on the number of order parameters, but
    it is also closely related to their combination (Qiao et al., 2017). In this paper,
    the linear weighted summation method (Jiao et al., 2018) is used to calculate
    the order degree of the subsystem, which can be written as Eq. (2): $$\\mu_{i}
    \\left( {e_{i} } \\right) = \\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{n} {\\lambda_{j} \\mu_{i} \\left(
    {e_{ij} } \\right),\\lambda_{j} \\ge 0} ,\\;\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{n} {\\lambda_{j}
    = 1}$$ (2) μi(ei) is the system order degree of subsystem Si. The larger μi(ei)
    is, the more ei contributes to subsystem Si and vice versa (Wan et al., 2021).
    In Eq. (4), λj represents the weight value corresponding to each order parameter
    component (Amedzro St-Hilaire & Boisselier, 2019). Here, the method proposed by
    Diakoulaki (1995) is used to calculate the weight of the subsystem evaluation
    index. For original data, it is assumed that each order parameter component includes
    m samples for each year, among which xjt is the value of the jth component of
    the order parameter t sample. The original data xjt are standardized as follows:
    $$x_{jt}^{\\prime } = {{\\left( {x_{jt} - \\overline{x}_{jt} } \\right)} \\mathord{\\left/
    {\\vphantom {{\\left( {x_{jt} - \\overline{x}_{jt} } \\right)} {S_{jt} \\left(
    {j = 1,\\;2,\\; \\cdots ,\\;n;\\;t = 1,\\;2, \\cdots ,\\;m} \\right)}}} \\right.
    \\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace} {S_{jt} \\left( {j = 1,\\;2,\\; \\cdots ,\\;n;\\;t
    = 1,\\;2, \\cdots ,\\;m} \\right)}}$$ (3) where \\(x_{jt}^{\\prime }\\) represents
    the standardized data, \\(\\overline{x}_{jt} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{m =
    1}^{m} {x_{jt} }\\) is the mean value of variable, and Sj is the standard deviation
    of variable. We then estimate the weight of subsystem evaluation index with the
    CRITIC method. The basic principles of CRITIC: $$\\xi_{j} = \\sigma_{j} \\cdot
    \\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{n} {\\left( {1 - r_{jk} } \\right)\\left( {j = 1,\\,2,
    \\cdots ,n} \\right)}$$ (4) In Eq. (4), ξj reflects the influence of the jth evaluation
    index on the system of a given province, σj is the overall standard deviation
    of the evaluation index after standardization, and rjk is the correlation coefficient
    between the jth and kth evaluation indexes. The higher ξj is, the stronger is
    the influence of the jth index on the system, the greater the index’s relative
    importance. λj is the weight of the jth evaluation index, which can be written
    as: $$\\lambda = \\frac{{\\xi_{j} }}{{\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{n} {\\xi_{j} } }}\\left(
    {j = 1,\\;2, \\cdots ,n} \\right)$$ (5) System synergy not only involves the orderly
    development of the subsystem itself but also coordination between subsystems.
    According to the theory of the systemic coordination, considering the synergetic
    status of two systems, it can be measured by the deviation between them. In this
    paper, the deviation coefficient C is introduced. The smaller the deviation coefficient
    is, the better the coordination between systems will be, and conversely, the worse
    the coordination between systems will be. Assuming that the order degrees of subsystems
    S1 and S2 are μ1(e1) and μ2(e2), respectively, the synergy of the two subsystems
    can be described as follows: $$C = \\sqrt[2]{{\\frac{{\\mu_{1} \\left( {e_{1}
    } \\right)\\;\\mu_{2} \\left( {e_{2} } \\right)}}{{\\left( {\\mu_{1} \\left( {e_{1}
    } \\right) + \\mu_{2} \\left( {e_{2} } \\right)} \\right)^{2} }}}}$$ (6) $$F =
    {{\\left( {\\mu_{1} \\left( {e_{1} } \\right) + \\mu_{2} \\left( {e_{2} } \\right)}
    \\right)} \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{\\left( {\\mu_{1} \\left( {e_{1} } \\right)
    + \\mu_{2} \\left( {e_{2} } \\right)} \\right)} 2}} \\right. \\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace}
    2}$$ (7) In Eq. (7), F is the comprehensive harmonic index of subsystems of agricultural
    and tourism, reflecting the overall contribution of the two subsystems (Wan et
    al., 2021). To reflect overall “coordination” or “synergy” effects of subsystems
    of agriculture and tourism, the synergy model of the composite system is constructed
    based on the synergy model of the two subsystems as follows: $$D = \\sqrt {C \\times
    F}$$ (8) In Eq. (8), D is the synergy degree of the composite system, which presents
    the integration level of two industries. So we use it to measure the integration
    level of agriculture and tourism(ATL). The agriculture and tourism integration
    industry subsystems involve several system state variables. According to synergetic
    self-organization theory (Liening, 2014), order parameters can determine the macroscopic
    behaviors of a system and represent its order degree (Li et al., 2021). These
    parameters can be referred to as ordering parameters. Therefore, accurately determining
    a system’s order parameter can not only effectively reduce the complexity of system
    research but can also capture the development of composite system evolution. According
    to the existing literature, 7 indexes (the primary industry output value, gross
    output value of agriculture, forestry, husbandry and fishery, consumption level
    of rural residents, output value of featured agricultural products, crop sown
    area, number of people employed in primary industry, total power of agricultural
    machinery) are selected for agriculture industry (Liu et al., 2020b; Wang, 2018)
    as order parameters to measure levels of agriculture development according to
    the performance and features of the agricultural industry. 7 tourism indexes are
    selected as order parameter components to measure tourism development (domestic
    tourism revenue, foreign exchange earnings from tourism, the number of domestic
    tourism, the number of inbound travelers, the number of star hotels, the number
    of scenic spots above grade A, the number of people employed in tourism) according
    to the performance and features of tourism industry. All the above indicators
    and their description are given in Table 2. Table 2 Variables and indicators description
    of agriculture and tourism integration Full size table 3.2 Assessment of agriculture
    eco-efficiency based on Super-SBM model Agricultural production will bring desired
    output, at the same time bring undesirable output, such as various of pollutants
    (Liu et al., 2020b; Rosano-Peña et al., 2018). In this paper, the Super-SBM model
    with undesirable output is used to measure AEE for the following two reasons:
    First, as agricultural production inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides destroy
    the ecological environment, the measurement of agricultural output should consider
    the negative impact of agricultural production on the ecological environment at
    the same time. Second, in the ordinary SBM model, the DMU whose efficiency level
    is greater than or equal to 1 is assigned a value of 1, so the DMU whose efficiency
    value is greater than 1 cannot be distinguished from the DMU whose efficiency
    value is 1(She et al., 2020; Srinivasa Raju & Nagesh Kumar, 2013). However, the
    super-efficiency SBM model including undesired output directly incorporates the
    slack variables into the objective function, thus avoiding the above problem (Xiang
    et al., 2019). The super-efficiency SBM model with unexpected output is given
    as follows: $$\\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {\\rho * = \\min \\frac{{1 + \\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\limits_{i
    = 0}^{m} {D_{i}^{ - } } }}{{1 - \\frac{1}{a + b}\\left( {\\sum\\limits_{r = 1}^{a}
    {\\frac{{D_{r}^{e} }}{{y_{rk}^{e} }}} \\sum\\limits_{h = 1}^{b} {y_{hk}^{f} }
    } \\right)}}} \\\\ {s.t.\\sum\\limits_{j = 1,\\;j \\ne k}^{n} {x_{ij} \\lambda_{j}
    \\le x_{ij} + D_{i}^{ - } } } \\\\ {\\sum\\limits_{j = 1,\\;j \\ne k}^{n} {y_{rj}^{e}
    \\lambda_{j} \\le y_{hk}^{f} } } \\\\ {\\sum\\limits_{j = 1,\\;j \\ne k}^{b} {y_{hk}^{f}
    \\lambda_{j} \\le y_{hk}^{f} + D_{h}^{f} } } \\\\ {1 - \\frac{1}{a + b}\\left(
    {\\sum\\limits_{r = 1}^{a} {\\frac{{D_{r}^{e} }}{{y_{{}}^{{}} }}} + \\sum\\limits_{h
    = 1}^{b} {\\frac{{D_{h}^{f} }}{{y_{hk}^{f} }}} } \\right)} \\\\ {D^{ - } \\ge
    0,\\;D^{e} \\ge 0,\\;D^{f} \\ge 0} \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$ (9) Assuming
    that λ ≥ 0 and ∑λ = 1, this is the super-SBM model of variable scale return (VRS)
    with unexpected outputs. Assuming that λ ≥ 0, this is the supper-SBM model of
    constant return to scale (CRS) with unexpected outputs. Here, D−, Dε, and Df are
    slack variables, respectively, representing too much input, insufficient expected
    output and too much unexpected output. ρ* is the eco-efficiency of a DMU, and
    since the model is super-efficient, eco-efficiency is no longer between 0 and
    1. Crop plantation is still the main part of agricultural industry in China, so
    this study takes agriculture in the narrow sense as the research object and selects
    input and output indicators to evaluate AEE. The output indicator includes expected
    and unexpected outputs. The total agricultural output is selected as the expected
    outputs. Carbon emission from agricultural production is selected as the unexpected
    output (Pang et al., 2016), which originate from the use of fertilizers, pesticides,
    agricultural irrigation and powered agricultural machinery. According to West
    and Marland (2002), the carbon emission coefficients of the four categories are
    as follows: pesticides 4.93 (kg/kg), chemical fertilizers 0.90 (kg/kg), agricultural
    irrigation 20.48 (kg/ha), and the total power of agricultural machinery 0.18 (kg/kw)
    (Chen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021). The unexpected outputs calculation is as
    follows: $$E = \\sum {T_{i} \\times \\delta_{i} }$$ (10) E represents the total
    carbon emissions, T means the source of carbon emissions, δ is the carbon emission
    coefficient (Liu et al., 2021), and i represents the ith carbon emission source
    (Han et al., 2018). Referring to existing papers on AEE (Keating et al., 2010;
    Liu et al., 2020b; Pang et al., 2016), 5 input variables are selected: (1) agricultural
    labor, which is measured by the “agricultural labor force” (Liu et al., 2020b);
    (2) land, which is measured by the total sown agricultural area (Liu et al., 2020b);
    (3) agricultural water consumption, which is measured by effective irrigation
    area; (4) mechanical power, which is measured by the total mechanical power; and
    (5) pesticides and fertilizers, pesticide input is measured by the level of pesticide
    use, and fertilizer input is measured by the level of pure fertilizer use(Xu et
    al., 2021). All the input and output indictors are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Variables
    and indicators description of agriculture eco-efficiency Full size table As small-scale
    farming by individual owners is still a distinct feature of China’s rural economy,
    agricultural production is characterized by constant scale returns, and agricultural
    production has had negative effects on the environment. In this paper, the constant
    scale return model (CRS) with unexpected output is used to calculate AEE and to
    assign equal weight to both expected and unexpected outputs. 3.3 The panel smooth
    transition regression model specification In the initial stage of agriculture
    and tourism integration, operators pay more attention to the direct economic benefits
    of agriculture than the sustainability of agriculture (Cui et al., 2020). They
    seldom consider the impact on the environment, and seldom take initiatives to
    reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and other harmful environmental
    factors. Therefore, the effect of low integration level on reducing the input
    of harmful environmental factors may be not so significant. When the integration
    of agriculture and tourism enters the advanced stage, the ecological premium of
    agriculture is fully exploited and the ecological protection consciousness of
    operators is stimulated. Therefore, operators will consider adopting a more green
    and low-carbon way of production and operation. Therefore, the impact of agriculture
    and tourism integration on AEE will increase with the improvement of integration
    degree. In order to demonstrate the nonlinear impact of agro-tourism integration
    on the improvement of AEE, this paper adopts the Panel Smooth Transition Regression
    model (PSTR) (González et al., 2005). Core variables considered here include the
    degree of agricultural and tourism integration (ATLit) and agricultural eco-efficiency
    (AEEit). Also, we take into consideration the financial support for agriculture,
    industrialization levels and agricultural economic development levels factors
    as explanations of AEE (Hong et al., 2016; Wang et al. 2018). According to the
    existing literature, financial support for agriculture (WFit) is measured by the
    ratio of local fiscal expenditures on agriculture, forestry and water conservation
    (Jiang, 2022). The industrialization level (IDit) is measured by ratio of industrial
    added value to gross domestic product. The level of agricultural development (PICit)
    is measured by the per capita added value of agriculture (Jiang, 2022).Testing
    model is specified as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} InAEE_{{it}} = & \\mu _{i} +
    \\beta _{{01}} Inatl_{{it}} + \\beta _{{02}} iNPIC_{{it}} + + \\beta _{{03}} inID_{{it}}
    + \\beta _{{04}} InWF_{{it}} \\\\ & + \\left( {\\beta _{{11}} InATL_{{it}} + \\beta
    _{{12}} InPIC_{{it}} + \\beta _{{13}} InID_{{it}} } \\right)g\\left( {q_{{it}}
    } \\right)\\left( {q_{{it}} ;\\;r,\\;c} \\right) + \\varepsilon _{{it}} \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$
    where i = 1…N, t = 1…T; N represents the number of sample provinces, and T represents
    the study period; μi represents individual fixed effects and εit is the error
    term (Tiba, 2019). g(qit; r, c) is the transition function (Granger & Teräsvirta,
    1993; Luukkonen et al., 1988), which is given as follows: $$g\\left( {q_{it} ;r,\\;c}
    \\right) = \\left\\{ {1 + \\exp \\left[ { - r\\prod\\limits_{j = 1}^{m} {\\left(
    {q_{it} - c_{j} } \\right)} } \\right]} \\right\\},r > 0,\\;c_{1} \\le c_{2} \\le
    \\cdots \\le c_{n}$$ (12) In Eq. (12), qit is a transition variable; r is the
    slope parameter, which determines the transition speed; c is the position parameter,
    which determines the threshold of parameter transition, the threshold value = EXP(c);
    and m is the number of position parameters (Chen & Chen, 2021). In the PSTR model,
    the coefficient of variable estimation is composed of linear β0 and nonlinear
    β1*g(•). When g(•) = 0, the model is in low regime. When g(•) = 1, the model is
    in a high regime. At the same time, when the value of the conversion function
    moves smoothly from [0, 1], the estimated coefficients are monotonically converted
    from β0 to β0 + β1 which centers on c. When the transition variable is the integration
    level ATLit, the effect of ATLit on AEE can be expressed as: $$b_{ATL\\;it} =
    \\frac{{\\partial InAEE_{it} }}{{\\partial InAEE_{it} }} = \\beta_{01} + \\beta_{01}
    \\times g\\left( {q_{it} ;r,\\;c} \\right) + \\beta_{11} InATL_{it} \\frac{{\\partial
    \\left( {q_{it} ;r,\\;c} \\right)}}{{\\partial \\left( {InALT_{it} } \\right)}}$$
    (13) When bATLit is greater than 0, with improvements in integration, AEE is constantly
    improved; therefore, integration level promotes the improvement of AEE. When it
    is negative, with improvements in integration, AEE declines continuously, therefore
    the level of integration inhibits the improvement of AEE. Following research practice
    in this field (Gonzalez et al. 2017), a three-stage test is required before analysis.
    First of all, we take the Taylor expansion of g(qit; r, c) where r = 0’ and then
    construct an auxiliary regression. Then we used the Wald, Fischer and likelihood
    ratio tests based on Colletaz and Hurlin’s insights (Anatolyev, 2004; Im et al.,
    2003). If the null hypothesis (H0: r = 0) is rejected, there is a nonlinear relationship.
    The second stage involves testing the number of parameters. A null hypothesis
    test of r = 1 is first carried out, and if H0 (r = 0) is rejected, a null hypothesis
    test of r = 2 is carried out until the null hypothesis r = r* cannot be rejected.
    Finally, the number of transition functions is obtained as r*. The third stage
    involves selecting the optimal model for estimation from models m = 1, r = r*
    and m = 2, r = r*. 3.4 Data source and study area The integral development of
    agriculture and tourism generally occurs in areas abundant in agricultural and
    culture-historical resources (Ristić et al., 2019; Yang et al. 2021a). This paper
    focuses on 19 provinces in the two largest river basins in China, which are rich
    in agricultural and natural and cultural resources. 11 provinces in The Yangtze
    River Basin are used in this study, including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui,
    Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, Chongqing, Sichuan, Yunnan, while 8 provinces
    in the Yellow River including Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia,
    Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai. The research data used in this paper are drawn mainly
    from China’s statistical yearbook, tourism statistical yearbook, rural statistical
    yearbook, industrial statistical yearbook, and provincial statistical yearbooks
    and from the Statistical Bulletin of National Economic and Social Development
    (2008–2019). In addition, the National Bureau of Statistics, National Tourism
    Administration, and Ministry Of Agriculture and official provincial websites are
    used as sources of data supplementary. All data measured in monetary units have
    been deflated according to constant price levels in 2008. 3.5 Statistics description
    The integration level of agriculture and tourism (ATL) is measured by the synergy
    degree model as shown above. Based on the synergetic degree model, ATL in each
    province is estimated from 2008 to 2019. Using the dataset and the Super-SBM model,
    AEE of each province is calculated from 2008 to 2019 at the same time. The basic
    average level of AEE and ATL in the study area over the study period is shown
    in Fig. 3. On the whole, AEE and ATL of 19 provinces have continuously improved
    over time, growing at an annual rate of 2.60% and 1.76%, respectively. Integration
    of agriculture and tourism is an important form of rural industries integration,
    which is beneficial for promoting rural economic growth and rural revitalization,
    so it is also strongly supported by the government. And in recent years, the central
    government in China has attached great importance to sustainable development of
    agricultural ecological environment; therefore, AEE has improved greatly, which
    can be seen in Table 4. The used variables in the PSTR model are displayed in
    Table 5. Fig. 3 Average levels of AEE and ATL of the study area from 2008 to 2019

    3.6 The unit roots testing To avoid “pseudo-regression” or “pseudo-correlation”
    in the empirical results, the stationarity test of each variable is first carried
    out in this paper to ensure the unbiased and consistent empirical results. Unit
    root test is a common method to test stationarity of variables. In order to avoid
    the possible errors caused by a single test, three methods (IPS, LLC and ADF-Fisher)
    (Im et al., 2003) were adopted in this paper to conduct unit root test on data.
    The results of panel unit roots are shown in Table 6. From Table 6, we can see
    that all variables reject the null hypothesis of the existence of unit root, and
    the panel data have good stationarity. Table 6 The Panel unit roots test Full
    size table 4 The empirical results and discussion 4.1 Nonlinearity analysis 4.1.1
    Nonlinearity tests Before PSTR model estimation, heterogeneity test, namely nonlinearity
    test, should be conducted to determine whether the model has nonlinear effect.
    If heterogeneity exists, it is more reasonable to use the PSTR model for estimation
    (Yao & Su, 2021); otherwise, it is considered that linear estimation should be
    carried out. In Table 7, model (1) is set for all 19 provinces, model (2) is set
    for 11 provinces in the Yangtze River Basin, and model (3) is set for 8 provinces
    in the Yellow River Basin. Using these 3 models, we can test whether ATL in different
    regions show differences in improvements in AEE. As can be seen from Table 7,
    for model (1), (2) and (3), when m = 1 and m = 2, the test values of LMW, LMF
    and LR all reject the null hypothesis so that the model is linear at the significance
    level of 1%.Therefore, it comes to a conclusion that agriculture and tourism integration
    has a nonlinear impact on agricultural eco-efficiency. Table 7 Nonlinearity test
    of the PSTR Full size table 4.1.2 Residual nonlinearity test Next, residual nonlinearity
    test is performed to determine the number of transformation functions r. The null
    hypothesis H0 assumes that the PSTR model has only one threshold; the alternative
    hypothesis H1 assumes that the PSTR model has two thresholds or more (Tiba, 2019).
    As can be seen from Table 8, none of the three models reject the null hypothesis,
    so they all have only one transformation function, that is r = 1. Table 8 Setting
    test of the number r of conversion functions Full size table After determining
    the number of transition functions r = 1, the number of position parameters should
    be determined as follows: in each model, the number of position parameters corresponding
    to minimum AIC and BIC values is the number of selected position parameters (González
    et al., 2005). According to this principle, it can be seen from Table 9, on the
    premise of r = 1, when m is set to the number 1, AIC and BIC values of the three
    models are all smaller than those when m is set to 2. Therefore, it can be concluded
    that the best mechanism combination of the three models is one transformation
    function and one threshold parameter (r = 1, m = 1). Table 9 Test of the number
    m of threshold parameter Full size table 4.2 Empirical results 4.2.1 Results of
    PSTR From the number of optimal transition functions and position parameters,
    the estimation results of the model using data for each province for the study
    period are as follows (Table 10): (1) For the whole study area, the linear part
    coefficient (β01 = 0.0668) and the nonlinear part coefficient (β11 = 0.4018) both
    are greater than zero, and significant at confidence levels of 1%, indicating
    that the agriculture and tourism integration can contribute to the improvement
    of AEE. When the conversion function g(ATLit; r, c) = 0, the influence effect
    of agriculture tourism integration development was 0.0668(β01), indicating that
    the model was in a low mechanism. When the function g(ATLit; r,c) = 1, the total
    influence effect of agriculture tourism integration was 0.4686(β01 + β11), indicating
    that the model was in a high mechanism. Between low and high mechanisms, the impact
    effect of agriculture tourism integration is centered on the threshold value of
    0.6821 (the threshold value = EXP(c), that is e−0. 3826) of agriculture eco-efficiency,
    and smoothly transforms in the interval of [0.0668, 0.4686] with the change of
    its own state variables. This indicates that the integration of agriculture and
    tourism is not only conducive to the improvement of AEE, but also with the increase
    in integration level, its promoting effect on agricultural ecological efficiency
    presents an enhanced trend. 1. Combined with the analysis of AEE in the study
    area from 2008 to 2019(Fig. 3), the growth rate of AEE was relatively slow from
    2008 to 2010, and the rate accelerated after 2011. From the perspective of agriculture
    and tourism integration history, although the No. 1 document of the Chinese Central
    Government proposed to develop rural tourism for the first time in 2007, at the
    beginning of the implementation of the policy, the integration of agriculture
    and tourism was mainly based on the simple model of “leisure agriculture” or “Nongjiale”,
    which was a simple and crude model of integration. Since then, leisure agriculture
    and rural tourism have played a great part in promoting the realization of multiple
    functions of agriculture and the integration of rural industries. Policies supporting
    industrial integration have been issued intensively since 2010, which have promoted
    the integral development of agriculture and tourism greatly, and the integration
    has played a more and more significant role in improving AEE. The influence coefficient
    transforms in the interval of [0.0668, 0.4686] during the study period. Meanwhile,
    we can see in Table 4, AEE of 2 provinces crossed the threshold value of 0.6821
    in 2008, while AEE of 18 provinces crossed the threshold value in 2019. So it
    also proves the influencing mechanism of agriculture and tourism integration on
    improving AEE from an empirical perspective. 2. In the Yangtze River Basin, both
    the linear part coefficient (β01 = 0.0712, P<0.01) and the nonlinear part coefficient
    (β11 = 0.4832, P<0.01)) are greater than zero, indicating that the agriculture
    and tourism integration in this area can contribute to improving AEE. The linear
    part coefficient (β01 = 0.0712) is higher than that of the whole research region
    0.0668. The nonlinear part coefficient (β11 = 0.4832) is also higher than that
    of the whole research region 0.4018. So we can say that the agriculture and tourism
    integration in the Yangtze River Basin has a greater improvement effect on AEE
    than the whole research region. The influence coefficient transforms in the interval
    of [β01 = 0.0712, β01 + β11 = 0.5544] during the study period. When the integration
    level of provinces crossed the threshold value of 0.6879 (the threshold value = e−0.
    3741), we can see a continuous enhancement trend of the impact of the integration
    on AEE. The Yangtze River Basin is rich in water and forest resources with a high
    level of urbanization and economy. The relatively superior natural resources,
    climate conditions and relatively developed economy conditions promote people’s
    demand for agro-related leisure in this area. With the improvement of integration
    level, agricultural ecological value is further highlighted, which also promotes
    the enhancement of ecological consciousness of agricultural producers. So they
    will take initiatives to protect agricultural ecological environment as to achieve
    sustainable benefits. 3. As for the Yangtze River Basin, the linear part coefficient
    is 0.0002(not significant at all given confidence levels). The nonlinear part
    coefficient is 0.3022(significant at confidence level of 10%), which is lower
    than the nonlinear part coefficient of the whole research region 0.4018. The threshold
    of agricultural and tourism integration of provinces in the Yellow River Basin
    is higher than Yangtze River Basin and the whole study area(the threshold value
    e−0. 3281 = 0.7203). Only when the threshold value of 0.7203 is crossed, agriculture
    and tourism integration can improve AEE greatly. This may be due to the relatively
    weak economic foundation of most provinces in the Yellow River Basin, which makes
    it difficult to promote advanced agricultural technology. According to (Deng &
    Gibson, 2019), economy factor is important for the application of advanced agricultural
    technology. In addition, natural environment in this area is relatively harsh,
    and most provinces suffer from frequent droughts. In the Loess Plateau in the
    Yellow River Basin, soil erosion and sand storm damage has result in the eco-environmental
    deterioration. Because of the poor natural resources and climate conditions of
    this region, it is relatively difficult for agricultural tourism to be widely
    carried out. Therefore, in the early stage of integral development, the integration
    level of agriculture and tourism has no significant effect on agricultural ecological
    efficiency. And when the integration level crossed the threshold value of 0.7203,
    ecological capital of agriculture can create more value, which stimulates agricultural
    producers to pay more attention to agricultural sustainable development. Then,
    they will consciously reduce harmful environmental elements input in the producing
    process so as to improve AEE, and the promotion effect of agriculture tourism
    integration on AEE is enhanced. 4. From the perspective of control variables in
    Model (1), the impact of per capita agricultural added value on AEE in the whole
    study area is positive. And the coefficient of the linear part is 0.1183(P<0.01),
    and the coefficient of the nonlinear part is 0.1670(P<0.05)(β02 = 0.1183, β12 = 0.1670).
    The influence coefficient transforms in the interval of [β02 = 0.1183, β02 + β12 = 0.2853]
    during the study period. This indicates that per capita agricultural added value
    contributes to improving AEE, and this influence is further enhanced with the
    increase in the level of agriculture tourism integration. As the impact of industrialization
    level on AEE, its coefficient changed from -0.0021 in the linear part to 0.2254
    in the nonlinear part, but the linear part was not significant at all given confidence
    levels. It can be concluded that in the low level integration stage, industrial
    development may inhibit the improvement of AEE slightly, but with the increase
    in ATL, the promotion effect of industrialization level on AEE became more and
    more significant. The effect of financial support to agriculture on AEE was negative
    and significant in both linear and nonlinear parts (β04 = -0.2017, β14 = -0.1133);
    the parameter estimations of the linear part and nonlinear part are significant
    at confidence level of 5%. The influence coefficient transforms in the interval
    of [β04 = -0.2017, β04 + β14 = -0.3150] during the study period, which indicated
    that financial support to agriculture inhibited the improvement of AEE, and this
    effect was further enhanced with the increase in ATL. To a large extent, China’s
    financial support for agriculture tends to subsidize petroleum agricultural elements
    such as pesticides, chemical fertilizers and agricultural machinery, which has
    a negative effect on AEE (Han & Zhang, 2020; Wang & Zhang, 2018). Table 10 PSTR
    model estimation results Full size table 4.2.2 Results of the influencing mechanism
    test In order to analyze the influence mechanism of agriculture and tourism integration
    on agricultural eco-efficiency, PSTR models (4) to (9) were constructed. The dependent
    variables of each model are crop sown area, effective irrigated area, agricultural
    employees, total power of machinery, fertilizer and pesticide usage. The independent
    variable is ATL, and results are shown in Table 11. Meanwhile, the control variables
    of above models are consistent with those of models (1) ~ (3). Data of the whole
    study area are used for testing the influencing mechanism test. Table 11 PSTR
    model results of mechanism test Full size table It can be seen from Table 11 that
    there is a nonlinear relationship between the integral level of agriculture and
    tourism and the input factors of AEE. Among them, crop sown area, the effective
    irrigated area and the agricultural employees all decrease with the deepening
    of the integration. The total mechanical power increased with the increase in
    the integration level at the beginning, but when the integration level crossed
    the threshold, the total mechanical power decreased with the increase in the integration
    level. This may be because when the integration level is low, the input of machinery
    replaces the input of agricultural labor force, which greatly reduces the input
    of agricultural labor force factors. However, the total power input of machinery
    shows an increase trend because the level of agricultural technology has not been
    greatly improved. With the improvement of integration level and agricultural technology
    level, the nonlinear part of total mechanical power input decreases after crossing
    the threshold value. After analyzing the influence mechanism of ATL on the input
    factors of agricultural production, it is found that: Given the expected output,
    the reduction of input factors and unexpected output is limited at the initial
    stage of the integration, so the space for the improvement of AEE by the integration
    is limited. With the high level of integration, both input factors and non-expected
    output have a large space to reduce under the premise of expected output. Therefore,
    the promotion effect of agriculture and tourism integration on AEE shows a gradually
    expanding trend. 4.3 Endogeneity test results The integration of agriculture and
    tourism can promote improvements in AEE, and conversely, improvements in AEE may
    also promote the agriculture and tourism integration. We used two methods to test
    the endogeneity of the model. First, we established a model with levels of agricultural
    and tourism integration lagging by two periods to demonstrate the effect of agricultural
    and tourism integration on improvements in AEE. It is assumed that only agricultural
    and tourism integration in the past can improve AEE in future. The results show
    that effects of agricultural and tourism integration on improvements in AEE are
    basically the same as those described above, indicating that the agriculture and
    tourism integration promotes improvements in AEE. Second, we use road network
    density as an instrumental variable for endogeneity analysis for two main reasons.
    On one hand, the government’s support for the integration of agriculture and tourism
    is reflected in the construction of transportation infrastructure. To integrate
    agriculture and tourism, quality transportation infrastructure must be built.
    Therefore, the integral level of agriculture and tourism can be represented by
    the density of highway networks to some extent. Second, the density of road networks
    does not directly affect AEE. The regression results from the first stage show
    that the statistical value of F is greater than 10 and passes a significance test
    of 5%, indicating that there is no weak instrumental variable problem. The integration
    level coefficient of the second stage is positive and significant, indicating
    that the integration promotes improvements in AEE. 5 Conclusion and implications
    5.1 Conclusion Based on provincial data of the Yangtze River basin and Yellow
    River basin in China from 2008–2019, this study applies PSTR model to test the
    impact of the agriculture and tourism integration on agricultural ecological efficiency,
    together with its impact mechanism. It can be seen that the impact of the integration
    of agriculture and tourism on AEE presents nonlinear characteristics with the
    integration level as the threshold. When its integration level was lower than
    the threshold value, it had a low promotion effect on agricultural eco-efficiency.
    However, when the integration level is high after crossing the threshold value,
    its promotion effect on AEE is very significant and shows an enhanced trend. And
    there are some differences of this impact in different regions. The agriculture
    tourism integration in provinces in the Yangtze River Basin has the most significant
    promotion effect on AEE. But the impact not is so an obvious in provinces in the
    Yellow River Basin when the level of agriculture and tourism integration is lower
    than the threshold value, only if the integration level cross the threshold value,
    it has a greater improvement effect on AEE. Based on the analysis of the influencing
    mechanism, it can be seen that the input of crop sown area, agricultural labor
    force, effective irrigation area and other factors decreases with the improvement
    of the integration level. Inputs such as pesticides and fertilizers did not decrease
    significantly in the initial stage of integration, but decreased rapidly after
    the level of agriculture and tourism integration crossing the threshold value.
    The total power of agricultural machinery rose in the initial stage of integration
    and fell rapidly after crossing the threshold value. 5.2 Theoretical implications
    The theoretical enlightenments brought by this study are given as follows: On
    the one hand, this study expands the research content of influencing factors of
    agricultural eco-efficiency, indicating that we may explore the influencing factors
    from the perspective of industrial integration besides the input factors of agriculture;
    on the other hand, it also enriches the impact research of agricultural tourism
    integration, while most existing literature mainly concentrated on the effects
    of agri-tourism on the rural development and residents’ living environment (Ćirić
    et al., 2021; Lupi et al., 2017; Nooripoor et al., 2021). Meanwhile, it provides
    a new research perspective to reveal the inter-relationship between agriculture
    and tourism, while lots of studies are concentrated on the influences of agriculture
    on tourism. For example, Fleischer and Tchetchik (2002, 2005) have analyzed the
    impact of agriculture on tourism and found that farmers engaged in agri-tourism
    benefit from the existence of farm activities. Therefore, researches should pay
    attention on sustainable development of agriculture from the perspective of rural
    industry integration and multiple functions of agriculture. The integration of
    agriculture and other industries is an important way to expand the agricultural
    industrial chain, whick is also helpful to promoting sustainable development of
    agriculture. 5.3 Policy implications The results of this study are of direct importance
    to policymakers in China, for the government plays a very significant role in
    promoting industries integration in rural areas (Ćirić et al., 2021; Su et al.,
    2019). As it is discussed above, the integral development of agriculture and tourism
    is helpful for improving agricultural ecological efficiency, which is also beneficial
    for achieving sustainable agricultural development and rural revitalization. Therefore,
    governments should further improve policies and institutional guarantee conditions
    for the development of agriculture and tourism integration. Considering the particularity
    of agricultural development, the government should increase support and play a
    leading and coordinating role in the integration process, but also coordinate
    the interests of enterprises, farmers and other stakeholders. Second, local governments
    at all levels should formulate relevant policies based on local conditions in
    view of regional differences in the improvement effect of the integration on agricultural
    eco-efficiency, so as to better play the positive role of agro-tourism integration
    in improving agricultural eco-efficiency. Agriculture and tourism resources are
    abundant in provinces in the Yangtze River basin, the agriculture and tourism
    integration has good development foundation, so the government should further
    perfect policy support of industries integration development, strengthen the regulatory
    functions of integration development, coordinate the relationship between different
    stakeholders. Due to the geographical, ecological environment, economic conditions
    of provinces in the Yellow River Basin, the foundation of agriculture tourism
    integration is relatively weak. Therefore, the government departments can promote
    the integration by increasing financial support to give farmers who engaged in
    agri-tourism business, establishing some influential agri-tourism brands, and
    strengthening the agricultural ecological education and ecological management
    in agriculture, as research found that governance and education are important
    on improving AEE (Bayyurt & Yılmaz, 2012). At the same time, it should stimulate
    agricultural leisure consumption through marketing propaganda, so as to raise
    agricultural output and promote rural economic and environmental development.

  description: According to data from Govt. of India, agriculture is a high-priority
    sector of the Indian economy, with 58% of all families dependent on it directly
    or indirectly, for their livelihoods. With increasing world population, climate
    change and limited arable land, the current practices in agriculture are becoming
    unsustainable for both people and planet as they incur huge environmental cost
    and wastage. These in turn leave the small producers at or below the poverty level.
    Therefore, there is an urgent need of paradigm shift in this domain, and adoption
    of digital and AI based technologies can aid in the shift. AI and Data-driven
    technologies have the potential to enhance productivity and efficiency, thus generating
    higher farm income, waste reduction and sustainability. By collecting and analyzing
    data from various sources such as reports, images, sensors, drones, and other
    sources, farmers can gain a deeper understanding of their fields and crops. This
    information can then be used to make more precise decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, pest control, and other farming practices. AI and data driven techniques
    are also gaining traction in the precision livestock management. From sensor based
    farm and animal behavior monitoring to veterinary medicine - AI based systems
    have found several applications. In this tutorial we will briefly describe about
    how we can apply state of the art ML/DL techniques on data from different modalities
    and different perspective to gain useful insights on enhanced agricultural output.

    in turn leave the small producers at or below the poverty level. Therefore, there
    is an urgent need of paradigm shift in this domain, and adoption of digital and
    AI based technologies can aid in the shift. AI and Data-driven technologies have
    the potential to enhance productivity and efficiency, thus generating higher farm
    income, waste reduction and sustainability. By collecting and analyzing data from
    various sources such as reports, images, sensors, drones, and other sources, farmers
    can gain a deeper understanding of their fields and crops. This information can
    then be used to make more precise decisions about irrigation, fertilization, pest
    control, and other farming practices. AI and data driven techniques are also gaining
    traction in the precision livestock management. From sensor based farm and animal
    behavior monitoring to veterinary medicine - AI based systems have found several
    applications. In this tutorial we will briefly describe about how we can apply
    state of the art ML/DL techniques on data from different modalities and different
    perspective to gain useful insights on enhanced agricultural output. Index Terms

    15.8%, 5.2% and 11.2%, respectively, than conventional furrow/flood irrigation

    Introduction The maize-wheat system is the third most important cropping system
    (~ 2.90 M ha) after the rice–wheat and cotton-wheat systems1 that has potential
    in view of an emerging water crisis in the Indo-Gangetic plains of South Asia.
    Under conventional flood irrigation in rice, a major amount of irrigation water
    is lost through evaporation and soil percolation2,3. In recent years, the area
    under maize cultivation has increased in north-west (NW) India largely due to
    favorable government policies for promoting its cultivation to save precious irrigation
    water and electricity costs4. Growing conventional maize and wheat on a flat field
    requires 6–7 tillage operations along with flood irrigation, which involves high
    energy input and inefficient use of irrigation water and fertilizer nitrogen (N),
    and in less economic profits5. An alternate technique to save water and increase
    irrigation water productivity (WPi) and fertilizer nitrogen use efficiency (NUE)
    comprises a shift to permanent raised beds based conservation agriculture (CA)
    practices (no-tillage and straw mulching), irrigation scheduling and fertigation1,6.
    There is a great challenge to enhance productivity and decrease cultivation costs
    in the maize-wheat system. The adoption of furrow-irrigated permanent raised beds
    increased yields, NUE, addressed labor and water issues and saved the environment7,8,9,10.
    In a permanent raised bed planting system, both maize and wheat are planted on
    the top of 37.5 cm wide beds with 30 cm wide furrows and retaining previous crop
    residues on the soil surface11. Previous studies showed that maize planted on
    permanent raised beds with retention of residues resulted in 11% savings in irrigation
    water and 16% higher WPi compared to conventional planting8,12. Conservation agriculture
    coupled with precise water and nutrient application shall provide opportunities
    for an intensification of cereal systems for a much needed change towards transforming
    agrifood systems in South Asia. The layering of drip irrigation combined with
    N fertigation in the CA system could be an economically feasible choice for field
    row crops, such as maize13,14,15 and wheat15,16,17,18 to increase WPi and NUE.
    Surface drip irrigation has a serious limitation due to the complex process of
    anchoring laterals at the start and removing them after the harvest of each crop
    because they interfere with field operations during the year. Unlike surface drip
    irrigation, the subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) system reduces soil evaporation,
    permits better delivery of water and fertilizers directly to the plant root zone
    to meet and synchronize the plant demand which results in higher WPi and NUE,
    and it also saves labor cost and allows normal tillage practices13,18,19. Conventional
    surface application of N as urea encourages volatilization losses of N particularly
    when crop residues are retained as mulch20,21. Precise N fertigation in several
    splits through SDI might reduce N losses via leaching and volatilization, thereby
    improving NUE in a CA-based permanent raised bed maize-wheat system19,22,23. Thus
    precise N placement along with irrigation water in the active crop root zone via
    SDI will enhance NUE and WPi in a CA-based permanent raised bed maize-wheat system.
    Limited information is available on the effect of SDI systems on yield, water
    productivity and NUE on the CA-based annual maize-wheat system. Pablo et al.24
    and Douh and Boujelben25 reported higher WPi under SDI compared to flood irrigation
    in maize. Jat et al.19 evaluated the potential of SDI under a CA-based maize-wheat-mung
    bean (Vigna radiata) system using flat-bed planting on partially reclaimed soil
    and reported significant increases in WPi and NUE under SDI compared to conventional
    flood irrigated systems. However, their study lacks information on the crop responses
    of maize and wheat to varying N rates applied through SDI under a permanent raised
    bed system. Therefore, detailed scientific information is urgently needed on the
    effect of the SDI method on N response, WPi, and NUE in the regions of severe
    water scarcity and injudicious use of N fertilizer in CA-based permanent raised
    bed maize-wheat system in NW India. We hypothesized that CA-based practices (permanently
    raised bed planting and straw mulching) layered with SDI system and N fertigation
    at different levels will increase crop yields, WPi, and NUE in the maize-wheat
    system. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effects of N levels on
    crop yields, irrigation water savings, WPi, NUE, and economics under SDI in a
    CA-based irrigated maize-wheat system in NW India. Results Weather Maize season
    The precipitation for the years 2015 (541 mm), 2016 (494 mm), and 2017 (444 mm)
    in maize seasons were lesser than the long-term average (LTA) (June-October) of
    603 mm (Fig. 1). Its distribution of pattern was also quite dissimilar during
    the three seasons, with low rains in June 2015, July 2017, August 2016 and 2017,
    and September 2017, whereas quite high rains were recorded during July 2017. Monthly
    pan evaporation (E) during three maize seasons was generally comparable to the
    LTA (Fig. 1). Total pan E in June-October 2015 (785 mm), 2016 (784 mm), and 2017
    (769 mm) was comparable to that of LTA (784 mm). The minimum monthly temperature
    was 1–2 °C higher than the LTA throughout the growing season in 2015 and 2016
    (Fig. 2). The maximum monthly temperature was normally the same as the LTA, except
    for a higher value in July 2016. Figure 1 Monthly mean total pan evaporation and
    rainfall during 2015–16, 2016–17, 2017–18 and the long-term averages (1970–2014).

    Wheat season Total rainfall during the 2015–16 and 2016–17 wheat seasons (November–April)
    was 74 and 46 mm, respectively, (Fig. 1), which was lower than the LTA of 122
    mm. However, in 2017–18 total rainfall (130 mm) was matching to the LTA. Total
    pan E during the wheat season was 600, 581 and 541 mm in 2015–16, 2016–17, and
    2017–18, respectively, compared to the LTA (575 mm) (Fig. 1). Mean monthly Max
    and Min T was higher than the LTA during the 3 years of study, apart from higher
    Min T was recorded in March–April 2016, and lower Max T in March 2017 (Fig. 2).
    Grain yield and yield attributes Significant interaction effects of year × treatments
    were observed for grain yields of maize and wheat crops, therefore year-wise yield
    data are discussed in the following section. Maize Maize grain yield declined
    over the years irrespective of the treatments. It was significantly higher in
    2015 (7.73 t ha–1) compared to 2016 (6.95 t ha–1) and 2017 (6.53 t ha–1). Maize
    yield increased significantly with increasing N rate up to 100% of recommended
    N rate (T4) in the SDI system in all three years of the study. Mean grain yield
    (averaged 3-years) with T4 was higher by 132% compared to no-N control (T1) (Table
    1). At the recommended N rate (100% N), the 3-yr mean data (average over 3-yr)
    indicated that maize yield was significantly higher (16.0%) in SDI (T4) compared
    to conventional FI system (T5) (Table 1). The grain yield of maize (3-yr mean)
    with 75% of recommended N dose in the SDI (T3) system was similar to that with
    100% N in the conventional FI system, thereby helping in saving 25% of N fertilizer.
    Interestingly, the interaction effects (year by treatment) indicated that maize
    yield was not statistically different among T3 to T5 in the year 2015, but in
    the year 2016 and 2017, the maize yield was outperformed in T4 than T3 and T5.
    In 2017, even the maize yield was higher by 22% under 75% N with SDI (T3) over
    to 100% N with furrow irrigation (T5) and this was similar to 50% of N with SDI
    (T2, Table 1). Table 1 Effect of N- fertigation through subsurface drip irrigation
    on maize, wheat and maize-wheat system grain yield, irrigation water use and irrigation
    water productivity in CA-based maize wheat system on permanent beds. Full size
    table Wheat Wheat grain yield, irrespective of treatments was significantly higher
    in 2016–17 (5.12 t ha–1) compared to 2017–18 (4.80 t ha–1) but decreased again
    in 2015–16 (4.26 t ha–1) (Table 1). In all the 3 years of study, wheat responded
    significantly to applied N up to 120 kg ha–1 (100% recommended N dose) under SDI
    in the maize-wheat system (Table 1). The increase in wheat yield (averaged over
    3 years) was 173% under T4 compared to no N control (T1). There was no saving
    of N using SDI in wheat but the 3-yr mean results indicate that the SDI system
    helped to achieve a significantly higher yield by 5.1% in T4 compared to T5 (Table
    1). In 2015–16 and 2016–17, wheat grain yield with T4 was significantly higher
    by 6.9 and 6.5% compared to T5 at similar fertilizer N rates, respectively, (Table
    1) while wheat yield was similar under T4 and T5 in 2017–18. Interaction results
    (year by treatment) showed that the highest wheat grain yield was recorded under
    SDI with 100% N (T4) followed by furrow irrigation with 100% N (T5) in the year
    2016–17. Unlike maize, SDI with 75% N (T3) performed inferior for wheat yield
    than T5, except in 2016–17, where both were found at par. System Overall, the
    system yield of maize-wheat (MW) did not differ among the years (Table 1) unlike
    individual crops, this was compensated by maize and wheat yield. The 3-yr average
    data show that the total system MW system yield was significantly differed among
    the treatments except for T3 and T5. The highest system grain yield was under
    T4 which was higher by 2.0% compared to T3 and T5 (Table 1). On a system basis,
    the yield was similar under T3 and T5 resulting in saving of 25% of fertilizer
    N. There were no interaction effects observed on system yield and system yield
    ranged from 5.69 to 14.98 Mg ha–1. Irrigation water used and irrigation water
    productivity (WPi) Total irrigation water applied in maize, irrespective of treatments
    was significantly higher in 2017 (195 mm) compared to 2016 (111 mm) and 2015 (108
    mm) (Table 1). The N rates (T2-T4) showed a non-significant difference in the
    total amount of irrigation given in maize under SDI (Table 1). This was because
    all these treatments received the same amount of water in every irrigation applied.
    The average saving in irrigation water under the SDI system was 141 mm compared
    with the CT system and this was 56% lower compared to later (Table 1). Similarly,
    total irrigation water applied in wheat, irrespective of treatments was significantly
    higher in 2017–18 (230 mm) compared to 2016–17 (205 mm) and 2015–16 (201 mm) (Table
    1). The N rates (T3-T4) showed a non-significant effect on the total amount of
    irrigation given in wheat under SDI and were significantly higher than T1 and
    T2 treatments (Table 1). The average saving in irrigation water in wheat under
    the SDI system was 196 mm compared to the CT system. The quantity of irrigation
    water given to wheat in T4 was on an average 53.0% lower compared to T5 (Table
    1). Like maize and wheat crops, the higher amount of irrigation water was applied
    (425 mm) during 2017–18 and the lowest was in 2015–16 (309 mm). The saving in
    irrigation water input in the maize-wheat system was 54% in T4 compared to T5
    during the study period (Table 1). The average saving in irrigation water in the
    maize-wheat system under the SDI system was 337 mm compared with the CT system
    (Table 1). Interaction effects of the year by treatments results showed that the
    highest irrigation water was applied in T5 during 2017–18 for both maize and wheat
    crops and system level and it was lowest under T1 during 2015–16. WPi of maize,
    irrespective of treatments was significantly higher in 2015 (8.72 kg m–3) compared
    to 2016 (7.08 kg m–3) and further decreased again in 2017 (3.53 kg m–3) (Table
    1). The 3-yr mean data show that the WPi of maize was higher by 2.9 times in T4
    compared to T5 (Table 1). In SDI treatment WPi of maize in T4 ranged from 5.09
    to 11.9 kg m–3 in comparison to 2.16 to 3.56 kg m–3 in T5 during 3 years of experimentation
    (Table 1). The WPi of maize in T4 was significantly higher by 3.3, 2.8, and 2.4
    times compared to T5 in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively (Table 1). Like maize,
    WPi of wheat, irrespective of treatments was significantly higher in 2016–17 (2.57
    kg m–3) compared to 2015–16 (2.21 kg m–3) and 2017–18 (2.30 kg m–3) (Table 1).
    The 3-yr mean data show that the WPi of wheat was significantly higher by 2.2
    times in T4 compared to T5 (Table 1). The WPi of wheat in the SDI system (T4)
    ranged from 3.21 to 3.56 kg m-3 in comparison with 1.32–1.90 kg m-3 in T5 in the
    three-year experimentation (Table 1). The WPi of wheat in T4 was significantly
    higher by 2.24, 1.87 and 2.48 times compared to T5 in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18,
    respectively (Table 1). WPi of the maize-wheat system, irrespective of treatments
    was significantly higher in 2015 (4.30 kg m–3) compared to 2016 (4.05 kg m–3)
    but decreased again in 2017 (2.89 kg m–3) (Table 1). The 3-yr mean data show that
    WPi of the maize-wheat system was significantly higher by 2.4 times in T4 compared
    to T5 (Table 1). The system based WPi in T4 was significantly higher by 2.56,
    2.18, and 2.52 times compared to T5 in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively (Table
    1). Grain N content, grain N uptake, and agronomic and N uptake efficiency The
    grain N uptake of maize was similar in both years (Table 2). However, it was significantly
    higher (11.4%) in 2016–17 compared to 2017–18 in wheat (Table 2). The grain N
    uptake of maize and wheat increased significantly with the increasing rate of
    N under the SDI system (Table 2). In 100% N treatment with SDI (T4), grain N uptake
    was significantly higher by 30.2 and 15.6% (2-year mean) in maize and wheat compared
    to the conventional FI system (T5), respectively (Table 2). The SDI system did
    not show a significant effect on grain N uptake efficiency (NupEG) in maize and
    wheat at different N rates on the mean of two years’ data (Table 2). At the same
    N rate, NupEG in maize was significantly (p < 0.05) higher by 44.0% in SDI (T4)
    than in T5 (Table 2). The corresponding increase in wheat grain NupEG in T4 compared
    to T5 was 22.0%. The total N uptake of maize and wheat (2017–18) increased significantly
    with the increasing rate of N under the SDI system (Table 1s). In 100% N treatment
    with SDI (T4), total N uptake was significantly higher by 44.0 and 17.2% in maize
    and wheat compared to the conventional FI system (T5), respectively (Table 1s).
    The SDI system did not show a significant effect on NUE in maize and wheat (2017–18)
    at different N rates (Table 1s). In 100% N treatment with SDI (T4), NUE was significantly
    higher by 67.7 and 24.6% in maize and wheat compared to the conventional FI system
    (T5), respectively (Table 1s). Table 2 Effect of subsurface fertigation and flood
    irrigation on grain N uptake, N uptake efficiency in grain (NupEG) and agronomic
    efficiency of nitrogen (AEN; kg grain kg–1 N applied) in maize and wheat in CA-based
    maize- wheat system. Full size table The agronomic efficiency of nitrogen (AEN)
    of maize and wheat generally decreased significantly (p < 0.05) with the increasing
    rate of N up to 75% of recommended N rate (T3). The 3-yr mean data showed that
    AEN in maize was significantly higher (31.5%) in T4 compared to T5 (Table 2).
    The AEN in wheat, irrespective of the treatments was significantly higher in 2015–16
    compared to 2016–17 and 2017–18 (Table 2). The 3-yr mean data showed that AEN
    in maize was significantly higher (8.4%) in T4 compared to T5 (Table 2). Regression
    equations, optimum dose and economic optimum dose of N The relationships between
    fertilizer N rates and grain yield of maize and wheat were best described by quadratic
    functions (Fig. 1s). The regression equations, regression coefficient, optimum
    dose (OD) of N and economic optimum dose (EOD) of N are presented in (Table 3).
    The OD of N to get maximum yield and EOD were 140 kg N ha–1 and 138 kg N ha–1
    for maize, respectively (Table 3). The corresponding values for wheat were 225
    kg N ha–1 and 221 kg N ha–1, respectively (Table 3). Table 3 Regression equations,
    regression coefficients, optimum dose of nitrogen (OD) and economic optimum dose
    (EOD) in maize and wheat. Full size table Mineral N There was a significant difference
    in ammoniacal N content amongst different treatments at all the soil depths (Fig.
    3a). The NH4-N content varied from 1.2 to 3.5 (0–7.5 cm), 1.2 to 3.7 (7.5–15 cm)
    and 1.2 to 2.3 mg kg–1 (15–30 and 30–45 cm) soil depths, respectively (Fig. 3a).
    The NH4-N content was significantly higher in T4 than that of T5 in 0–7.5 and
    7.5–15 cm soil depths whereas it was significantly higher in T5 compared to T4
    at 15–30 cm soil depth. Similarly, there was a significant difference in nitrate-nitrogen
    content amongst different treatments at all the soil depths (Fig. 3b). The NO3-N
    content varied from 7.5 to 14.0 (0.7.5 cm), 5.9 to 8.8 (7.5–15 cm), 1.2 to 5.9
    (15–30 cm), and 1.2 to 4.7 mg kg–1 in 30–45 cm soil depth (Fig. 3b). NO3–N was
    significantly higher in T4 than that of T5. Similarly, higher mineral N content
    (NH4–N + NO3–N) was found under T4 compared to T5 at all the soil depths (Fig.
    3c). Figure 3 Effect of nitrogen rate and drip fertigation on (a) ammoniacal nitrogen

    size image Economic profitability Economic profitability plays a pivotal role
    while considering crop management practices. Considering Scenario 1 with subsidy
    on electricity as well as 80% subsidy on a drip system, the variable costs of
    production in each of maize and wheat were lesser by US$ 47 in CA-based SDI plots
    (T4) than that under the conventional maize-wheat system (T5) (Fig. 4a). Under
    T5, the higher variable cost compared to SDI was due to higher labor and fuel
    costs for seedbed preparation in both maize and wheat. In Scenario 2, with no
    subsidy on electricity and drip system, the variable costs of production in maize
    and wheat were higher by US$ 18 and 12 in SDI treatment (T4) compared with T5,
    respectively (Fig. 4a). The high variable costs under T4 were primarily due to
    high drip costs. The gross returns in maize, irrespective of the treatments were
    significantly higher by 8.2 and 10.3% in 2015 compared with 2016 and 2017, respectively,
    (Fig. 4b). The 3-yr mean data show that gross returns in maize were significantly
    higher (16.1%) in T4 compared to conventional FI (T5) (Fig. 4b). The gross returns
    in wheat, irrespective of the treatments were significantly higher by 24.8% in
    2016–17 compared to 2015–16 (Fig. 4c). The 3-yr mean data show that gross returns
    in wheat were significantly higher (3.4%) in T4 compared to T5 (Fig. 4c). Figure

    (c) under different management practices on subsurface drip irrigation system.
    Vertical bars are standard error (SE) within each treatment. Refer to Table 5
    for treatment details. Full size image Considering Scenario 1 with a subsidy on
    electricity as well as 80% subsidy on a drip system, the net returns from the
    maize and maize-wheat system were non-significantly different in 3 years (Table
    4). The net returns in wheat, irrespective of the treatments were significantly
    higher by 35.1% in 2016–17 than in 2015–16 (Table 4). Similar was the trend for
    net returns in maize, wheat and maize-wheat systems for Scenario 2 (Table 4).
    In Scenario 1, the 3-yr mean data show that net returns were significantly higher
    by 27.9, 8.5 and 17.6% in maize, wheat and maize-wheat system, respectively under
    T4 compared to conventional FI (T5) (Table  4). In Scenario 2, the corresponding
    increase was 22.6, 3.6 and 12.7% in maize, wheat and maize-wheat system, respectively,
    (Table 4). Table 4 Economics analysis (net returns and B:C ratio) of maize-wheat
    system under different management practices with 80% subsidy and without subsidy
    on subsurface drip irrigation system. Full size table Considering Scenario 1 with
    subsidy on electricity as well as 80% subsidy on a drip system, the benefit to
    cost (B:C) ratio for the SDI system was 3.47 compared to 2.64 for T5 (Table 4).
    In Scenario 1, the 3-yr mean data show that B:C ratio was significantly higher
    by 42.3 and 23.8% in maize and wheat, respectively under T4 compared to conventional
    FI (T5) (Table 4). Considering Scenario 2 without subsidy on electricity and drip
    system, the B:C ratio for the SDI system was 2.38 compared to 2.20 for T5 (Table
    4). In Scenario 2, the 3-yr pooled data show that B:C ratio was significantly
    higher by 18.1% in maize under T4 compared to conventional FI (T5) (Table 4).
    The net returns and B:C ratio from SDI will still be more even when the subsidy
    is reduced to 25% from 80%. Discussion Effect of CA and fertigation on crop yields
    The maize grain yield was markedly affected by the seasonal rainfall distribution
    pattern. For example, the high reduction in maize yield observed in 2017 under
    T5 was possibly owing to heavier rainfall (191 mm) received in August compared
    to 166 and 89 mm in 2015 and 2016, respectively, that adversely affected maize
    growth due to temporary flooding. Many researchers8,26,27 reported higher maize
    yield under permanent raised bed planting with residue mulching compared with
    CT fresh bed layout without mulch on fine-textured and sandy loam soils because
    maize under fresh beds system suffered from waterlogging due to soil crusting
    and poor soil aeration. The greater negative effect of flooding on maize yield
    in T5 may also be ascribed to the lower infiltration rate commonly observed in
    fresh beds CT system compared to CA-based maize-wheat system19,28. In contrast,
    Jat et al.29 and Ram et al.30 observed non-significant differences in grain yield
    of maize on permanent raised beds and fresh beds due to the high infiltration
    rate of loamy sand soil. In a recent study, Jat et al.19 recorded similar maize
    yield under flood irrigation and SDI systems but the latter received 25% less
    fertilizer N in CA-based maize-wheat-mung bean (Vigna radiata Lamm) system under
    the climatic conditions nearly similar to that of the present study. The maize
    performance also depends on the seasonal weather and climatic variations, in well
    distributed and normal rainfall year both systems perform similarly but under
    erratic and heavy rainfall-fall events and longer drought spells seasons the permanent
    beds perform better than fresh beds8,26,27. Lamm and Trooien31 and Tarkalson et
    al.32 from semi-arid regions of Nebraska, USA, reported similar or higher maize
    yield with SDI compared to flood irrigation because of the precise supply of water
    and N to the crop requirement. The higher grain weight in 2015 compared to 2017
    contributed to a higher maize grain yield in the first year (Table 2s). However,
    there is no information available on grain yield with different N doses with SDI.
    The higher yield of maize under 100% N under SDI could be attributed due to N
    application in root zone through fertigation and deep placement also reduces the
    losses of N which also met the plant demand in more synchronized. The increase
    in wheat yield in 2016–17 could be due to favorable weather conditions compared
    with the first year. For example, maximum and minimum temperatures in March 2016–17
    were lower by 1.5 to 4.4 °C compared with 2015–16 and 2017–18. Aryal et al.33
    and Gupta et al.34 reported that weather is very significant in determining wheat
    grain yield under similar ecologies. Gupta et al.34 demonstrated an increase in
    wheat yield when the daily temperature in the particular year was 2.2–3.3 °C lower
    during the grain filling stage compared with other years in their study. The higher
    av. grain weight and grains per spike in 2016–17 compared to other years contributed
    to higher wheat grain yield in the second year (Table 2s). Our findings are consistent
    with the earlier researchers16,17,18,19 who reported similar or higher wheat yields
    under SDI compared to flood irrigation on medium to fine-textured soils. The higher
    total system WEY in the first and second years compared with the third year was
    due to either higher maize or wheat grain yield in the first and second years.
    The higher total system productivity (WEY) under SDI might be due to the beneficial
    effects of CA practices on crop growth and the better synchrony of split-N fertigation
    and crop N demand at various growth stages in both maize and wheat. Better supply
    of water and N through SDI resulted in higher yields of maize and wheat compare
    to conventional FI system due to reduction in N losses and improving availability
    of irrigation water. Similar observations were also concluded by Lu et al.15;
    Li et al.35 and Yolcu and Cetin36 under SDI in maize and wheat crops. Effect of
    CA and fertigation on irrigation water saving and water productivity The higher
    saving in irrigation water under the SDI system compared with the CT system might
    be due to the uniform distribution of irrigation water in the root zone in SDI
    which minimizes evaporation and percolation losses and further additional benefits
    contributed from the crop residue mulching in permanent beds systems. Researchers23,37,38
    reported large savings in irrigation water in SDI treatment in both crops of maize
    and wheat because of low drainage and evaporation losses. Our findings supported
    the results from earlier studies19,23,31,39 showing a 23 to 55% reduction in irrigation
    water use and increased WPi compared to conventional FI. The increase in WPi is
    ascribed to both increases in both crop yields and irrigation water saving. Earlier
    studies19,23 also showed a 32–53% reduction in irrigation-water use in wheat under
    SDI over conventional flood systems. Our results are consistent with the findings
    of Chen et al.16, Sidhu et al.18, and Jat et al.19 using SDI in wheat under rice–wheat
    and maize-wheat cropping systems. Crop residue retention on the surface in CA-based
    wheat and maize under SDI (T4) might also have helped in conserving soil moisture
    through a reduction in evaporation loss thereby reducing irrigation water requirement29,37,38,40.
    Effect of fertigation on N use efficiency Our data showed markedly higher values
    of NupEG in maize (67–75%) and wheat (76–88%) on permanent raised beds using SDI
    compared to CT flood irrigation system as 45–50% reported by Ladha et al.41. Similarly,
    higher NUE observed in maize (108%) and wheat (87%) on permanent raised beds using
    SDI compared to CT flood irrigation system (64–69%) in 2017–18. Bar-Yosef42 reported
    that NUE under SDI could be as high as 90% compared to 40–60% in conventional
    fertilizer application methods. Our data showed that there was a saving of 25%
    of N fertilizer in maize and system WEY due to the fact that N was applied in
    5 equal splits in the SDI system in the root zone compared with broadcasting in
    2 equal splits in the conventional FI system. The SDI system possibly reduced
    N losses via leaching, ammonia volatilization, and denitrification because small
    N doses were applied in several splits near the root zone along with small amounts
    of irrigation water19,36. According to Majeed et al.10 and Sandhu et al.23 the
    lower N losses in maize and wheat under permanent raised beds may lead to high
    recovery efficiency of applied N compared to conventional flat planting. The higher
    grain yields of maize and wheat under SDI resulted in significantly higher AEN
    under T4 compared to T5. The higher uptake of N under the SDI system was associated
    with greater biomass production and lower loss of applied fertilizer compared
    to conventional FI systems. Jat et al.19 and Sandhu et al.23 reported a significant
    increase in AEN and NUE under drip irrigation compared to the conventional FI
    systems in maize-wheat systems. Yadvinder-Singh et al.21 suggested that both timing
    and method of N application are important to increase NUE under straw mulched
    conditions. Li et al.43 reported that SDI increased the maize grain yield via
    increased plant nutrient uptake and reduced ammonia volatilization. Reduction
    in the use of N fertilizer via an increase in the NUE would lead to a substantial
    reduction in N2O emitted from the production and application of N fertilizers44.
    The OD of fertilizer N for maize in SDI was 140 kg ha–1 as compared to recommended
    N in conventional FI system (150 kg ha–1). Thus SDI system saved ~ 7% of fertilizer
    N with higher yield potential in maize. The EOD value for SDI system did not change
    significantly compared to OD due to low subsidized price of urea N. The OD and
    EOD values for wheat are higher compared to maize. The OD and EOD values for wheat
    are out of range of the experimental limits and thus will be erroneous to discuss
    here. The effect of fertigation in drip irrigation on NupEG may be underestimated
    when irrigation water contains a significant amount of NO3-N because of the significant
    reduction in the use of irrigation water under SDI compared to conventional FI.
    Earlier studies45,46,47 reported a wide range of concentrations of NO3-N (0 to
    40 mg N L–1) in the groundwater of NW India. However, irrigation water used in
    our study contributed a small amount of N (data not reported). The higher NO3-N
    in T4 than that of T5 may be attributed to the reason that water does not percolate
    in the lower depths under the SDI method because of light and frequent irrigations.
    Consistent with the results from our study, Yuvarajan and Mahendran48 reported
    higher available nutrients (NPK) in the 100% recommended fertilizer treatment
    in the post-harvest soil samples under SDI compared to the flood irrigation system
    in bananas. Effect of CA and fertigation on maize-wheat system profitability Higher
    crop yields coupled with the low cost of tillage and labor resulted in the highest
    net returns in the SDI system (T4) compared with the conventional (T5) maize-wheat
    system. Considering Scenario 1 with a subsidy on electricity as well as 80% subsidy
    on a drip system, the higher gross and net returns in 2015 maize compared to other
    years were due to higher maize grain yield in 2015. Similarly, higher gross and
    net returns in 2016–17 wheat compared to 2015–16 wheat were due to higher wheat
    grain yield in 2016–17. The lower net returns in no-N control (T1) in 2015–16
    wheat was due to low wheat grain yield (Table 1) coupled with less MSP of 2015–16
    wheat (Sect. “Economic analysis”). In the rice–wheat system, Sidhu et al.18 reported
    a 29.8% higher net profit for the SDI system with 80% subsidy over the income
    of the conventional system (flood irrigation). Similarly, Jat et al.19 reported
    that SDI in a CA-based maize-wheat system provided 5.4% higher profitability over
    the conventional system (flood irrigation). Conclusions This study showed that
    SDI can achieve crop yields similar to or higher than that of conventional flood
    irrigated and recommended N management practices in the sub-tropical regions.
    At the 100% recommended N rate, maize and wheat yields (mean for three yrs) were
    15.7 and 5.2% higher under the SDI system than that in conventional FI treatment,
    respectively. Grain yield response of both maize and wheat to fertilizer N application
    was best described by quadratic response functions in SDI system. Irrigation WP
    under SDI was 183 and 120% higher for maize and wheat than that of conventional
    FI treatment, respectively. Similarly, NUE in the maize-wheat system significantly
    improved under SDI compared to the conventional FI systems with 25% saving of
    fertilizer N in maize. The net returns from the CA-based maize-wheat system layered
    with SDI provided 17.6% (with 80% subsidy on SDI) higher net returns than that
    for the conventional FI system. Overall, layering CA with SDI in a maize-wheat
    system resulted in a higher yield, WPi, NUE and net returns than the conventional
    FI, and can be adopted in other parts of South Asia. Future research should be
    conducted to understand N transformations in soil and quantify N loss mechanisms
    under SDI for designing effective fertigation strategies to further increase the
    NUE. The potential of using SDI for other nutrients (e.g. P, K and micronutrients)
    to achieve high productivity and nutrient use efficiency in the maize-wheat systems
    under different agro-climatic zones needs to be explored. Methods Experimental
    site The experimental site at Borlaug Institute for South Asia (BISA), Ladhowal
    (30.99°N latitude, 75.44°E longitude, 229 m ASL), Punjab, India, which has a semi-arid
    sub-tropical climate. The hot, dry summer in March-June is followed by the monsoon
    season from late June-mid September and winter in October-February; 80% of the
    annual rainfall (average 734 mm) falls during the monsoon season. The soil texture
    (0–15 cm layer) is a Typic Haplustept with a loam (34% sand and 46% silt). The
    slope of the area is 0.2–0.4%. The values of pH (1:2 soil: water), electrical
    conductivity, Walkley–Black organic C, NaHCO3-extractable P, and NH4OAc-extractable
    K were 8.4, 0.53 dS m–1, 7.5 g kg-1, 21.8 mg kg–1, and 191 mg kg–1, respectively.
    The values of Zn, Fe, Mn and Cu were 1.35, 13.0, 2.25 and 1.52 mg kg–1, respectively.
    The contents of Ca, Mg and S were 80.0, 24.0 and 74.6 mg kg–1, respectively. The
    infiltration rate and water holding capacity were 6.75 mm h–1 and 23.3% (on a
    dry weight basis), respectively. At the start of the experiment, the bulk density
    of the 0–10 cm soil layer was 1.47 Mg m-3. The experiment was conducted for 3
    years (2015–16, 2016–17, and 2017–18), and before this experiment, the site was
    under the maize-wheat system for the last three years. Measurement of rainfall
    and air temperature (T) The daily rainfall, maximum temperature (Max T) and minimum
    temperature (Min T) were measured daily using a Davis weather station (Davis Vantage
    Pro 2 Weather Station) installed at the experimental site (Product Manual Davis
    Instrument Corp.). Experimental design and treatments Raised bed planting system
    with 0.675 m wide beds (mid furrow to mid furrow) was established and the crops
    were planted on a 0.375 m wide top. After the wheat harvest in April 2014, the
    SDI system was set up in May 2014. To nullify the previous residual effects of
    maize-wheat treatments in experimental plots, general crops of maize (2014) and
    wheat (2014–15) were raised to stabilize the permanent raised beds before the
    start of the experiment in June 2015. Five treatments were included in this study
    and details are given in Table 5. A randomized complete block design with 3 replicates
    was used in each season. The size of each plot was 81 m2 (2.70 m × 30 m). Table
    5 Treatment details. Full size table Formation of raised beds In June 2013, a
    seedbed for maize was prepared using a disc plough followed by two passes of the
    cultivator, and a laser-assisted land leveler to level the field. In the first
    week of June 2013, fresh raised beds were prepared using a 4-wheel tractor driven
    bed planter (National Agro Industries, Ludhiana, Punjab, India) and maize was
    sown on the top of beds using the recommended dose of fertilizers (120 kg N as
    urea + 26 kg P as di-ammonium phosphate + 50 kg K as muriate of potash ha–1) in
    the last week of June and harvested in the second week of October 2013. The fresh
    beds were maintained as such in designated plots for treatments T1 to T4 and termed
    as permanent raised beds for the next wheat crop. In T5, fresh beds were prepared
    in each season which was dismantled after harvest before sowing the next wheat
    crop. One row of maize was sown in the centre of the bed top at 20 cm plant to
    plant spacing, whereas 2 rows of wheat spaced at 20 cm were planted on each bed.
    In T5, beds, after the maize harvest was dismantled and conventional till wheat
    at 22.5 cm row spacing was planted on flatbeds. The permanent raised beds were
    never disturbed but the furrows were slightly reshaped once a year (before sowing
    of the maize crop) without disturbing the bed shape. A 4-wheel tractor with narrow
    tyres was used for all the operations to restrict movement only in furrows. Crop
    residue/stover management In T1 to T4 treatments, maize at maturity was manually
    harvested above the cob height and removed from the plots, while the remaining ~ 50%
    portion of lower stubbles was retained which averaged 2.5, 4.6, 5.0, and 5.5 t
    ha–1 in T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively Moreover, retaining 50% of maize stover
    on the field will help recycle more plant nutrients compared to that when the
    whole stover is removed. Total N addition through maize stubbles was 14, 32, 38,
    and 43 kg ha–1 in T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively. Wheat was manually harvested
    at 20–22 cm above the ground level and straw stubbles were 0.8, 1.5, 1.8, and
    2.0 t ha-1 in T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively, as per N dose in different treatments.
    In conventional till treatment (T5), both maize and wheat crops were manually
    harvested at the ground level and all the biomass was removed from the plots.
    Installation of drip irrigation system The SDI system comprising polyethylene
    laterals (internal diameter 16 mm) was placed in the centre of each permanent
    raised bed. Based on the standardization and findings of the optimum depth of
    the SDI system (data not reported), for the ease of long-term tillage operations,
    20 cm lateral depth was considered optimum for the maize-wheat system on permanent
    raised beds. The laterals used in this study had in-line emitters spaced at 30
    cm with 2.0 L h–1 capacity at a pressure of 135 kPa for the entire wetting of
    a plot area. The lateral spacing was thus 67.5 cm apart (compatible with bed width)
    and placed at a depth of 20 cm (each lateral in the centre of each bed) for both
    maize and wheat (Fig. 5). Thus, each dripline served 1 row of maize and 2 rows
    of wheat on permanent raised beds. The subsurface driplines were laid using a
    drip laying machine18. Hydro cyclone filter and Venturi injector were used as
    per Sidhu et al.18. Figure 5 (a) Single row of maize and (b) two rows of wheat
    crop on each permanent bed with subsurface drip irrigation system. Full size image
    Maize and wheat crops were irrigated using tube tensiometers monitored with a
    SoilSpec® vacuum gauge installed at 20 cm soil depth within each plot. Tensiometers
    installed as per Gupta et al.34 were regularly read each morning between 9:00
    and 10:00 a.m. All plots received irrigation (70 mm in flood and 10 mm in SDI
    treatments) at the V8-10 stage (21–25 DAS) to all treatments of maize, and 70
    mm in T5 before the second split of urea application at 40–45 DAS (if there was
    no rainfall event). Further irrigations were given whenever the average soil matric
    potential of the treatment plot decreased to – 50 ± 1 kPa. Common irrigation (70
    mm in conventional flood and 10 mm in SDI treatments) was applied at the crown
    root initiation (CRI) stage (21-25 DAS) in all treatments of wheat, and 70 mm
    in conventional flood irrigation (T5) only before the second application of fertilizer
    dose. Like maize, additional irrigations were given whenever the average soil
    matric potential of the treatment plot decreased to − 35 ± 1 kPa. In the T5 treatment,
    PVC pipe was used to give irrigation. The irrigation amount was the same in all
    three replications of each treatment. Other crop management details are described
    below. Crop management Maize Fresh bed plots (T5) were irrigated with about 75
    mm of water prior to tillage operations. Two passes of discing and one cultivator
    followed by two plankings were used for seedbed preparation for both maize and
    wheat at about 75% of field capacity moisture regime. The maize hybrid P3396 was
    sown on 17 July 2015, 18 June 2016, and 17 June 2017 using a seed rate of 20 kg
    ha–1 at a depth of 3–5 cm, using a double-disc planter fitted with an inclined
    plate seed metering mechanism (Dasmesh Mechanical Works, Punjab, India). A basal
    fertilizer dose of 26 kg P and 50 kg K ha–1 was drilled at planting using di-ammonium
    phosphate (single super phosphate in no N control) and muriate of potash, respectively.
    Total N applied was as per the N levels (T2-T5) of which 24 kg N ha-1 was applied
    as di-ammonium phosphate and the remaining N was applied as urea. In T5, the remaining
    (126 kg N ha–1) urea N was applied in 2 equal splits at 21–25 days after sowing
    (DAS) and 40–45 DAS. Under SDI, the remaining N as urea was applied in 5 equal
    split doses at 10-day intervals starting at 20 DAS, and the amount of urea was
    calculated as per the N levels in each treatment (T2 to T4). Maize crop was manually
    harvested on 25 October 2015, 06 October 2016, and 08 October 2017. Herbicide
    Atrataf 50WP (Atrazine @ 1.25 kg ha−1) was applied in all the treatments for controlling
    the broad leaf weeds. The pest management was done by using Decis (Deltamethrin)
    @ 200 ml ha−1 in all the treatments. Wheat In the conventional till plot (T5),
    after maize harvest, pre-irrigation (~ 75 mm) was given before the preparation
    of the seedbed for wheat. After dismantling fresh beds in maize, a conventional
    flat seedbed was prepared for wheat involving 2 passes each of discing, tilling,
    and planking. Wheat (HD 2967) was seeded at 100 kg ha–1 at 3–5 cm depth with a
    Turbo Happy Seeder49. The wheat was sown on 10 November 2015, 29 October 2016,
    and 31 October 2017, respectively. Like maize, wheat also received a similar basal
    dose of P and K. However, the total N applied was as per the N levels (T2-T5)
    of which 24 kg N ha–1 was applied as DAP and the remaining N was applied as urea
    except for no nitrogen plot where P was applied as a single super phosphate. In
    T5, the remaining (96 kg N ha–1) fertilizer N was applied before irrigation in
    2 equal splits at CRI (21–25 DAS) and the maximum tillering stage at 40–45 DAS.
    Under SDI, N was given in five equal splits starting from 21 days of sowing and
    applied each at a 10-day interval as per the nitrogen treatments. The manual harvesting
    of wheat crops (about 10–12 cm above ground level) was done on 16 April 2016,
    13 April 2017, and 16 April 2018. The post emergence herbicides Topik (clodinafop
    15% WP)@400 g ha−1 and Algrip (metsulfuron)@25 g ha−1) were applied in all the
    treatments at 25–30 DAS. The pest management was done by using precautionary sprays
    of propiconazole@500 ml ha−1 and Dimethoate 30% EC @ 500 ml ha−1 in all the treatments.
    Observations Irrigation water input and irrigation water productivity The amount
    of water applied to each treatment was measured using a water meter (Dasmesh Mechanical
    Works, Punjab, India) fitted to the delivery pipe close to the trial area. The
    total irrigation input (mm) to each crop was determined. Irrigation water productivity
    (WPi) for maize and wheat was calculated as the ratio of grain yield to total
    irrigation water applied. Grain yield Grain yield (at maturity) was determined
    by manually harvesting an area of 8.1 m2 (4-beds and 3 m row length in bed systems
    and 12-rows and 3 m row length for flat wheat) in the centre of each plot at ground
    level. Grain moisture content was determined after drying the subsamples in an
    oven at 60 °C to a constant weight. Grain yield was adjusted at 14.5% (maize)
    and 12% (wheat) grain moisture and expressed as Mg ha-1. Average grain weight
    was based on the weight of 100 and 1000 grains selected from the threshed grain
    subsamples of maize and wheat, respectively. Average grains per cob/spike were
    determined from randomly selected 10 cobs/spikes. Spike density (m-2) in wheat
    was done at 2 locations (1 m row length) for each treatment at maturity. The total
    annual maize-wheat system yield was determined by adding the yield of maize to
    the yield of wheat. Grain N uptake and N- use efficiency At maturity, total N
    concentration in the grain subsamples in 2016–17 and 2017–18 and stover/straw
    subsamples in 2017–18 was determined by H2SO4-HClO4 digestion and analysis of
    digestate by micro Kjeldahl method. The NUE was calculated as under. (i) The agronomic
    efficiency of applied N (AEN) was calculated as below: $${\\text{AEN (kg grain/kg
    N applied) }} = \\, \\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\underline{{\\text{(grain yield in
    N fertilized plot - grain yield in no N plot)}}} } \\\\ {\\text{(quantity of N
    fertilizer applied in N fertilized plot)}} \\\\ \\end{array} ,$$ (ii) Grain N
    uptake efficiency (NupEG) was calculated as: $${\\text{NupEG (\\% ) }} = \\, \\begin{array}{*{20}c}
    {\\underline{{\\text{(total grain N uptake in N fertilized plot - total N uptake
    in no N plot)}}} } \\\\ {\\text{(quantity of N fertilizer applied in N fertilized
    plot)}} \\\\ \\end{array} \\times 100,$$ for calculating grain N uptake efficiency
    in T5 treatment, N uptake for no N plot (T1) was used presuming small differences
    in N uptake between SDI and conventional till plots. (iii) N use efficiency (NUE)
    based on total N uptake was calculated as: Total N uptake in both grain and stover/straw
    was determined to calculate NUE similar to that explained for NupEG as above.
    Irrigation water containing low concentrations of NH4-N (0.30 mg L–1) and NO3-N
    (0.40 mg L–1) hence, the irrigation N input data were not considered for calculating
    NUE. Grain yield response to fertilizer N and calculation of optimum N doses While
    quadratic response equations (Y = a + bx + cx2) were developed for maize and wheat
    using SigmaPlot 15.0.where Y is grain yield (Mg ha-1) of maize or wheat; x is
    rate of N (kg ha–1); and a, b, and c are constants of quadratic response equation.
    Optimum N dose and economic optimum N dose were calculated from the quadratic
    response equations as described by Fausti et al.50. The market value of the cost
    of N as urea was taken as US$ 0.15 kg-1 and the prevailing market prices of maize
    and wheat in 2017–18 were US$ 195 Mg–1 and US$ 238 Mg–1, respectively. Ammoniacal
    and nitrate–N in soil Soil samples were collected at wheat harvest in 2017–18
    from all the experimental plots from 0–7.5, 7.5–15, 15–30, and 30–45 cm depths.
    Mineral N was extracted from the fresh soil samples using 2 M KCl solution. Micro-Kjeldahl
    steam distillation method was used for the determination of NH4-N and NO3-N in
    2 M KCl extracts51. The data were corrected for soil moisture content. Economic
    analysis To calculate the economics of the SDI system, partial budgeting was done
    as explained by Sidhu et al.18. The net profits were the extra income that resulted
    from using the SDI system in our partial budget. The cost of operations and inputs
    (variable costs) to grow the crop are given in Table 6. In the economic analysis,
    the fixed costs such as land value and interest were not included. The prices
    used were the government guaranteed minimum support prices (MSP) of maize (182,
    187 and 195 US$ Mg-1 in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively) and wheat (209, 223
    and 238 US$ Mg-1 in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18, respectively). This budget sheet
    was prepared as referred by the Department of Economics, Punjab Agricultural University
    (PAU), Ludhiana, India (Table 6). The number of laborers was calculated considering
    8 working hours to be equivalent to 1 person-day required for all agronomic practices
    as detailed in Sidhu et al.18. Similarly, the time (h) required by a tractor-drawn
    machine/implement to complete a field operation such as tillage, seeding, and
    harvesting was recorded and expressed as h ha−1. To calculate the irrigation cost,
    initial and final reading units on the electric meter were noted after running
    the tube well for 10 min in both SDI and flood irrigated plots. The price of 1
    kW of electricity is taken as US$ 0.11. The time taken to complete 1 cm and 5
    cm of irrigation in SDI and flood irrigated plots were 53 min and 60 min, respectively.
    For irrigation costs, the electricity charges were calculated as US$ 2.15 and
    US$ 8.22 ha-cm–1 for drip and flood, respectively. Irrigations number ranged from
    7 to 17 for maize and 17 to 18 for wheat under SDI during the 3-year study. Labor
    cost per person-day was US$ 4.79. The cost of drip irrigation, its life span,
    and depreciation cost were the same as explained in Sidhu et al.18. The gross
    returns included income from the sale of grain and straw of both maize and wheat
    crops. The gross returns were calculated by using the market minimum support price
    (MSP) for both maize and wheat grains (Table 6). The calculations of net return
    (NR) were done as per Sidhu et al.18. In Scenario 1 (with subsidy), the parameters
    considered were electricity and 80% subsidy on a drip system whereas in Scenario
    2 (without subsidy), there was no subsidy on electricity and drip system. One
    US$ was equivalent to Indian Rs. 73/- based on the exchange rate. Table 6 Cost

    Full size table All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines
    and regulations. Statistical analysis The normality of data was tested using the
    SAS 9.2 software package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and the normality assumption
    of ANOVA was fully met, there was no need for data transformation. In this study,
    we followed the procedure to build statistical models for data analysis for randomized
    complete block design (RCBD) in fixed plots, which is suggested for fixed plot
    experiments with the complexity of tillage and management: treatment and year,
    together with within-year replication52. The analysis advanced using a complete
    two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). The treatments were fixed effects and
    were randomly allocated to plots. ‘Year’ was a repeated factor; this was combined
    with the treatment model by introducing the term “Year + Treatment x Year”. ‘Replication’
    was a randomized unit, so we kept it under random effect by including replication
    interactions with all treatments. The final model was tested using the JMP software.
    $${\\text{Fixed effect}}:{\\text{ Year }} + {\\text{ Treatment }} + {\\text{ Treatment
    }} \\times {\\text{ Year,}}$$ $${\\text{Random effect}}:{\\text{ Replication }}
    + {\\text{ Replication }} \\times {\\text{ Year}}{.}$$ All variable means were
    compared using Tukey’s honest significant difference at p = 0.05, where significant
    treatment means were separated using alphabet letters. Data availability The datasets

    chapter''s full text. Full Text Preview Introduction Urban agriculture, encompassing
    practices such as rooftop farming, vertical farming, and hydroponics, has emerged
    as a promising approach to address the increasing demand for food in urban areas
    (Su et al., 2020). As the world''s population continues to urbanize, the limited
    availability of arable land and the challenges associated with traditional agricultural
    practices pose significant obstacles to ensuring food security in cities (Kasprzyk
    et al., 2022). However, the integration of smart technologies has the potential
    to overcome these challenges and optimize urban agricultural practices. Smart
    technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence
    (AI), and data analytics, are revolutionizing various industries, and urban agriculture
    is no exception. These technologies offer innovative solutions to enhance resource
    efficiency, improve productivity, and promote sustainability in urban farming
    (Pathmudi et al., 2023). One of the key benefits of smart technologies in urban
    agriculture is the increased feasibility of food production in urban areas. Research
    conducted by Badami and Ramankutty (2015) suggests that urban agriculture is more
    feasible for growing basic daily vegetables for the urban poor in developed countries
    than in developing countries. By leveraging smart technologies, urban farming
    can be made more efficient and productive, making it a viable option for food
    production in resource-constrained urban areas. Resource circularity is another
    area where smart technologies play a crucial role in urban agriculture. Weidner
    et al. (2019) highlight the potential of decentralized anaerobic digestion and
    vermicomposting, coupled with smart technologies, in utilizing organic waste for
    urban agriculture. By closing the loop and recycling organic waste, smart technologies
    contribute to a resource circular economy in urban farming, reducing the reliance
    on external resources and minimizing waste. Water management is a critical aspect
    of urban agriculture, and smart technologies offer improved solutions in this
    regard. Mason et al. (2019) demonstrate the potential of intelligent irrigation
    systems, enabled by IoT and data analytics, to reduce water consumption while
    maintaining crop yield in smallholder farming systems. By integrating sensors,
    wireless communications, and data platforms, these systems provide real-time data
    for informed decision-making, enabling precise and optimized water management
    in urban agriculture. In addition to resource efficiency, smart technologies also
    contribute to the environmental sustainability of urban agriculture. Jaramillo
    and Desyouni (2015) emphasize that the current food system contributes heavily
    to global environmental challenges such as biodiversity loss and climate change.
    However, smart urban farming practices, such as vertical farming and greenhouses,
    supported by smart technologies, offer controlled environments that reduce the
    need for land, water, and pesticides. This can help mitigate the negative environmental
    impacts associated with conventional agriculture. While the integration of smart
    technologies in urban agriculture holds great promise, it is essential to address
    the challenges and considerations associated with their implementation. Benis
    and Ferrão (2018) highlight barriers such as high investment costs, narrow profit
    margins, and uncertain marketing channels that hinder the commercialization of
    rooftop farming. Moreover, the potential drawbacks of smart urban agriculture,
    including the dependence on technology and the exclusion of traditional farming
    practices, need to be carefully examined (Glaeser et al., 2021). In conclusion,
    smart technologies have the potential to revolutionize urban agriculture by enhancing
    resource efficiency, improving productivity, and promoting environmental sustainability.
    Through the integration of IoT, AI, and data analytics, urban farming can overcome
    challenges associated with limited land availability, water scarcity, and environmental
    impact. However, it is crucial to consider the socioeconomic aspects, inclusivity,
    and long-term sustainability of smart urban agriculture initiatives. Continue

  description: 'Context: The rice-wheat cropping system in the Indo-Gangetic plains
    (IGP) of South Asia has been shown to have higher productivity. However, this
    benefit is offset by the unsustainable over-drafting of groundwater resources.
    Given the growing scarcity of water, it is imperative to investigate alternative
    crop establishment and irrigation methods that do not rely on the conventional

    of combining conservation agriculture-CA with sub-surface drip irrigation-SSD
    referred to as CA+, at different nitrogen (N) doses on physiological performance,
    crop yield, irrigation and nitrogen use-efficiency, as well as farm profitability
    of rice in the north-western IGP of India. Method: A two-year field experiment
    was conducted to assess the effects of medium-term CA and the combination of CA
    with SSD (CA+) at three levels of N (0%, 75%, and 100% of the recommended dose),
    in comparison to PTR using recommended dose of nitrogen-RDN (120 kg N ha-1). Indicators
    of crop growth (under CA, CA+), i.e., biomass, grain yield, water-use, water-use
    efficiency (WUE), nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE), and economic analysis of rice
    production were evaluated and compared with PTR. Result: The results revealed
    that the PTR plots produced 15% and 11% higher grain yield than CA and CA+ systems,
    respectively, even at 100%RDN, due to a significantly higher number of fertile
    tillers. However, the application of 100%RDN and irrigation through SSD resulted
    in a significant increase in nitrogen uptake (4.5%) and remobilization (7.5%)
    into the grain compared to PTR. The CA+ plots demonstrated a reduction in irrigation
    water usage by 1.5 and 2 times compared to the CA and PTR systems, leading to
    a respective increase in WUE by 1.6% and 1.8%. PTR exhibited highest net returns,
    while the CA+ treatment– SSD-N100 achieved the highest benefit-cost ratio. Conclusion:
    The combination of CA with SSD at 100%RDN offers significant benefits, including
    notable water saving, improved WUE, NUE and crop yield. This integrated approach
    presents a promising solution to address the pressing issues of food security
    and sustainability arising from water scarcity and groundwater depletion in South
    Asia. Future implication: There is a need to increase awareness among farmers
    about the benefits of CA coupled with SSD i.e., CA+, for water-intensive rice-based
    systems. Additionally, further research should focus on identifying ideal rice
    cultivars suitable for CA+ systems and determining the optimal specifications

    resource, playing a pivotal role in sustaining 40% of irrigation water and agricultural
    production on a worldwide scale (Siebert et al., 2010, Dalin et al., 2017). However,
    numerous agricultural regions are currently experiencing a rapid depletion of
    groundwater due to excessive extraction to meet the escalating water demand (Wada
    et al., 2010). This problem is further exacerbated by the adverse effects of climate
    change, urbanization, and population growth, which have significantly reduced
    water availability, particularly in South Asia (Jain et al., 2021). Notably, India
    stands out as the largest consumer of groundwater globally, where it accounts
    for 60% of the country''s total irrigation supply (Siebert et al., 2010, Dalin
    et al., 2017). High pumping rates have led to the depletion of groundwater aquifers,
    particularly in the northwest and south regions, facing critically low groundwater
    availability. Despite this critical situation, conventionally managed cropping
    systems with flood irrigation continue to dominate agricultural practices in India.
    Therefore, urgent attention must be given to the development of efficient and
    sustainable approaches that conserve water in water-intensive cropping systems
    like rice-wheat (RW), which are vital for ensuring food security (Yadvinder-Singh
    et al., 2014a). The rice-wheat (RW) system, which covers a vast area of 13.5 Mha
    in India’s Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), with Northwest India accounting for half
    of it (Ladha et al., 2009), faces significant challenges in its conventionally
    managed rice production system, known as puddled transplanted rice (PTR). This
    conventional approach is not only labor and energy intensive but also demands
    substantial amounts of irrigation water, ranging from 1800 to 2400 mm per season.
    This conventional system also contributes to soil degradation, further jeopardizing
    its long-term sustainability (Chauhan et al., 2012, Jat et al., 2019). Moreover,
    the depletion of groundwater resources adds an additional risk to this traditional
    RW system (Choudhary et al., 2018, Kumar et al., 2018). In the past five decades,
    groundwater levels have consistently declined across majority of RW cultivation
    areas in India (Humphreys et al., 2010), with a five-fold acceleration in decline
    between 2000 and 2006 compared to the period from 1973 to 2001 (Yadvinder-Singh
    et al., 2014a). Given this alarming situation, urgent measures are necessary to
    ensure sustainable use of groundwater in the RW system. Flood irrigation (FI),
    intensive dry- and wet tillage, and crop residue (CR) removal/burning are the
    primary causes of the inefficient water-use and deterioration of the soil and
    ecosystem health in PTR (Nayak et al., 2022, Parihar et al., 2022). To address
    these issues, CA-based practices such as zero-tillage (ZT), crop residue retention
    have emerged as a promising alternative to PTR, offering improved resource use-efficiency,
    crop productivity, farmer profitability, and soil quality (Choudhary et al., 2018,
    Ladha et al., 2009). CA-based ZT employing direct-seeded rice (DSR) and residue
    retention has demonstrated significant benefits, including regulation of soil
    temperature, reduction of evaporative water loss, improved soil infiltration and
    water storage, increased crop yield, and enhanced water use efficiency (WUE) (Jat
    et al., 2019; Yadvinder-Singh et al., 2014b). In the context of water conservation,
    several studies conducted in NW India suggested that crop diversification through
    CA-based maize-wheat rotation could be an alternative to conventional RW and/or
    CA-based RW rotation (Khedwal et al., 2023, Bhatt et al., 2021, Jat et al., 2020).
    Unfortunately, the preference for rice cultivation persists among farmers due
    to high market demand and assured procurement, limiting the adoption of maize
    crops (Jat et al., 2020, Jat et al., 2020). To address the pressing issues of
    water scarcity in the irrigation systems of IGP, various alternative approaches
    have been proposed, such as reduced tillage, aerobic rice, direct-seeded rice,
    saturation irrigation, laser land levelling, alternate wetting and drying, stubble
    mulching. In recent times, micro-irrigation has emerged as a viable option for
    cultivating cereal crops such as maize (Jat et al., 2019, Rao et al., 2021), rice
    (Sharda et al., 2017, Sidhu et al., 2019), and wheat (Sandhu et al., 2019, Dhayal
    et al., 2023), offering benefits in terms of enhanced yield, improved resource
    efficiency, and profitability. Given this context, combining the CA-based practices
    with drip irrigation have potential to reduce water consumption while also gaining
    farmers’ acceptance as well. Therefore, employing a combination of CA practices
    and drip irrigation can be an effective solution to tackle the water scarcity
    challenges in the IGP. However, implementing surface drip irrigation in cereal
    crops is challenging due to the difficulties faced during field operations caused
    by the presence of laterals on the soil surface. To overcome this challenge and
    enhance the acceptance of drip irrigation in cereal-based systems, sub-surface
    drip (SSD) irrigation has been proposed as an alternative (Sidhu et al., 2019,
    Jat et al., 2019; Patra et al., 2021). SSD irrigation enables precise application
    of water and nutrients directly to the root zone, effectively limiting weed emergence
    and proliferation, reducing energy and labor costs, and complementing direct sowing
    under ZT practices (Parihar et al., 2022, Jat et al., 2021). Moreover, the implementation
    of SSD improves the efficiency of irrigation water usage in rice cultivation by
    minimizing water loss through evaporation and deep percolation (Rana et al., 2022)
    . Additionally, the practice of fertigation, which combines the application of
    nutrients with irrigation, reduces fertilizer losses caused by volatilization,
    runoff, and leaching, thereby improving fertilizer use efficiency (Sharda et al.,
    2017). Hence, combining CA-practices with SSD irrigation holds the potential to
    achieve economically viable yield even with a reduced application dose of nitrogen
    (N). In the context of surface drip irrigation studies conducted in CA-based cereal
    systems, research on subsurface drip irrigation (SSD) is limited. Existing studies
    have primarily focused on yield attributes and water-saving potential, neglecting
    key physiological parameters such as water uptake efficiency, photosynthetic activity,
    nutrient uptake, and growth dynamics. A comprehensive understanding of the crop''s
    response in these conditions can be achieved by monitoring and evaluating these
    parameters. Photosynthesis and transpiration rates are influenced by climate,
    soil, and crop management factors. Combining conservation agriculture (CA) with
    SSD may alter the crop microclimate and create a favorable environment for growth
    and development. However, previous studies have shown variable effects of water-saving
    approaches in rice, as they can modify the soil''s physical and chemical properties
    compared to traditional practices (PTR), affecting nutrient availability, utilization,
    and crop establishment. By elucidating the physiological responses of rice plants
    to CA-based subsurface drip irrigation, we can gain valuable insights to optimize
    crop management strategies and improve overall productivity. Furthermore, this
    research can contribute to the development of more efficient irrigation systems
    and promote the adoption of sustainable farming practices. While studies have
    examined the individual benefits of CA and SSD in terms of water and nitrogen
    savings, there is a lack of comprehensive research exploring the complementarity
    of these two technologies in impacting crop physiological responses, productivity,
    irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in CA-based
    rice-wheat (RW) rotations. Moreover, there is a scarcity of data on the physiological
    response, productivity, IWUE, and NUE of rice under CA-based RW rotation with
    SSD irrigation at different N rates. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted
    a 2-year study in the NW-IGP of India. Our objectives were to assess the effects
    of combining CA practices with SSD irrigation (CA+) and CA with flood irrigation
    (FI) at different N doses, compared to the conventional practice of puddled transplanted
    rice (PTR), on rice''s physiological performance, yield, IWUE, NUE, and farm profitability.
    Our hypothesis is that combining CA with water and nutrient N application through
    SSD irrigation, even below the recommended N dose, can offer opportunities for
    water and N savings while maintaining productivity. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.
    Experimental site and climate The experimental field is located at the research
    farm of the Borlaug Institute for South Asia (BISA)-CIMMYT in Punjab, India (30.99°N,
    75.44°E, 229 m above sea level). The medium-term trial began during the monsoon
    season of 2015 and involved combinations of tillage methods (PTR/CA), irrigation
    practices (FI/SSD), and residue management (removed/25% retained). Since 2015,
    the experimental site has been used for zero-tilled cultivation of wheat and rice
    with both FI and SSD irrigation, while retaining 25% of the straw residue from
    both crops. The N treatments were implemented over a two-year period (2019–2020).
    The soil at the experimental site is sandy loam, with a composition of 34% sand,
    46% silt, and 20% clay. It has a moderately alkaline pH of 8.3 and is non-saline
    (EC of 0.51 dS m−1). The bulk density ranged from 1.47 to 1.56 Mg m−3, the soil
    infiltration rate was 6.75 mm hr−1, and the average water content at field capacity
    was 23.3%. The Walkley-Black organic carbon content is 7.5 g kg−1, NaHCO3-extractable
    phosphorus is 9.4 mg kg−1, and NH4OAc-extractable potassium is 205 mg kg−1.The
    study area experiences a semi-arid and sub-tropical climate characterized by three
    distinct seasons: the monsoon season (July-October), dry-winter (November-March),
    and hot-dry summer (April-June). The region receives an average annual rainfall
    of 734 mm, with over 75% of the rainfall occurring during the monsoon season.
    Fig. 1a and b depict the variation in rainfall distribution during the two years
    of the study (2019–2020). August 2019 recorded higher rainfall, as did July 2020,
    while both years had no rainfall in October. June consistently emerged as the
    driest month, receiving only 2–5% of total rainfall. On the other hand, August
    2019 and July 2020 received 55–58% of total rainfall. The cumulative rainfall
    for June-October in 2019 (503 mm) and 2020 (400.8 mm) was lower than the long-term
    monthly average (530 mm) for the same period over the previous 48 years (Supplementary

    experiment consisted of 7 treatments; three CA-based with SSD (CA+), three CA-based
    with flood irrigation–FI, and PTR as farmer’s practice (Table 1). The three treatments
    under CA+ were zero-tilled direct-seeded rice + SSD without N (SSD-N0), 75% of
    the recommended dose of N (SSD-N75), and 100% of the recommended dose of N (SSD-N100).
    Similarly, the three treatments under CA were zero-tilled direct-seeded rice + FI
    without N (FI-N0), 75% of the recommended dose of N (FI-N75), and 100% of the
    recommended dose of N (FI-N100). Additionally, PTR represented the farmers'' practices
    with 100% of the recommended dose of N. Each of the seven-treatments were replicated
    thrice and organized in a randomized complete block design (RCBD). Each experimental
    plot had an area of 135 m2 ((5.4 m × 25 m). Table 1. Description of imposed treatments

    PR 126 rice cultivar, developed by Punjab Agricultural University, was selected
    for cultivation. The cultivation practices differed based on the plot types. For
    the puddled transplanted rice (PTR) plots, the process involved the complete removal
    of wheat residues, followed by ploughing, harrowing, and puddling of the soil.
    On the contrary, the conservation agriculture (CA) and CA+ plots retained 25%
    of the preceding wheat crop residues on the soil surface. In the CA and CA+ plots,
    rice seeds were sown using a happy seeder machine (Sidhu et al., 2015). The sowing
    dates were the 10th of June and 7th of June in 2019 and 2020, respectively, with
    a row spacing of 22.5 cm and a seed rate of 20 kg ha-1. In the case of PTR plots,
    seeds in the nursey were sown on 11th June and 7th June in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
    After a period of 29 and 27 days, the seedlings were transplanted into the PTR
    plots, while maintaining the same row spacing. The basal application included
    60 kg P2O5 + 40 kg K2O + 25 kg ZnSO4 ha-1 for all plots. In PTR plots, the full
    recommended dose of N (120 kg N ha-1) as urea was broadcasted in three equal doses:
    at transplanting, 3 weeks after transplanting, and 6 weeks after transplanting.
    In the CA-plots (ZT-DSR+ flood irrigation), N was applied (treatment-wise) in
    four equal doses at 10, 21, 42, and 56 days after sowing (DAS). In the CA+ plots
    (ZT-DSR+SSD), N was applied at ten-day intervals up to the flowering stage. The
    SSD irrigation system was installed using a two-row tractor-operated drip-laying
    machine (BISA-CIMMYT, Ludhiana, Punjab, India). Polyethylene laterals (16 mm in
    diameter) were placed at 0.15 m depth parallel to crop rows, with a spacing of
    0.67 m (Fig. 2). This configuration allowed each dripline to serve three rows
    of the rice crop. The line-source emitters, with a fixed discharge capacity of
    2.0 L h-1, were uniformly spaced at 0.3 m intervals. In CA+ plots fertilizers
    were mixed with irrigation system using a venturi injector. The irrigation scheduling
    for SSD and FI plots, except for the PTR treatment, was based on soil matric potential
    (SMP) measured by tube tensiometers. These tensiometers, equipped with a SoilSpec®
    vacuum gauge, were installed 0.15 m below the soil surface between two drip lines
    at the centre of each experimental plot, following the methodology described in
    Gupta et al. (2016). Tensiometer readings were taken every morning between 9:00–10:00 a.m.
    Although tensiometers were installed in all plots (CA and CA+), we considered
    only the tensiometer readings from the SSD-N100 and FI-N100 plots for irrigation
    scheduling. Including N0 and N75 could introduce additional factors that deviate
    from the study''s objective. The irrigations in SSD and FI plots were given frequently
    until establishment (28–30 DAS) to ensure good crop stand and after that SMP based
    irrigation scheduling was followed, initiating irrigation whenever the reading
    dropped to − 15 kPa. In contrast, irrigation in PTR plots were scheduled according
    to Punjab Agricultural University’s recommendation. This involved maintaining
    standing water for the initial 15 days after transplantation, followed by adopting
    the alternate wetting and drying method of irrigation until reaching physiological
    maturity. Each irrigation event involved the application of 10–20 mm of water
    for CA+ treatments, while CA alone and PTR treatments received 50 mm of water.

    drip lateral. 2.4. Measured and calculated parameters 2.4.1. Fractional intercepted
    photosynthetic active radiation The photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
    was periodically measured using the line-quantum sensor LI-191SA (LICOR Inc.,
    Lincoln, NE, USA). Measurements were taken during the active growth period (35–117
    DAS). At seven-day intervals, the incident PAR (I0) and transmitted PAR (It) were
    recorded both at the top and bottom of the crop canopy. The fractional intercepted
    PAR (fIPAR) was calculated according to Monteith (1981): (1) where, I0 and It
    are the incident and transmitted solar radiation, respectively. 2.4.2. Leaf area
    index and specific leaf nitrogen Leaf area (LA; cm2 plant-1) was determined at
    ten-day intervals up to 105 DAS, using an LA meter (LICOR 3000, USA). The LA of
    five hills was measured, averaged, and expressed as cm2 plant-1. The LAI was calculated
    using the following equation. (2) The SLN (mmol N m-2) was calculated at the flowering
    stage (when maximum leaf expansion is expected) from N content (g) and leaf area
    (one side) per g of dry mass (Allison et al., 1997) . The SLN values then expressed
    in units of mmol N m-2. (3) 2.4.3. Measurement of photosynthetic and transpiration
    rate At the flowering stage , we measured photosynthesis rate (PN, μmol CO2 m−2
    s−1) and transpiration rate (TN, mmol H2O m−2 s−1) in vivo on the fully expanded
    leaves of three plants from each plot. This was done using a photosynthetic system
    (LI-6400, LICOR, USA) under saturated light conditions, with photosynthetically
    active radiation (PAR) was set as 1200 μmol m-2 s-1. The measurements were conducted
    between 11.00 and 11.30 am. The ambient CO2 level was 400 ± 25 ppm and the air
    temperature were 34˚C. The leaves were enclosed in the chamber, and the net exchange
    of CO2 between the leaf and the atmosphere was computed. The PN and TN were calculated
    by the Infrared Gas Analyzer''s (IRGA’s) inbuilt microcomputer using this rate
    of change and other factors such as the leaf area enclosed, the volume of the
    enclosure, and the temperature (Anand et al., 2007, Pandey et al., 2017). 2.4.4.
    Biomass accumulation Periodic dry matter accumulation was recorded at periodic
    intervals of 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 DAS by using destructive method. For
    sample collection, we designated the seventh and eighth row in each plot. From
    this row, three representative spots, each spanning 50 cm in length, were randomly
    selected. Plant samples were obtained by cutting them at ground level. The collected
    samples were air-dried for 5–6 days, then oven-dried at 65˚C for 2 days and the
    dry weight was expressed as kg ha-1. 2.4.5. Root length density Root sampling
    was undertaken at the key stages of maximum root growth, namely maximum tillering
    and the flowering stages (65 and 90 DAS). Triplicate root samples were obtained
    by cutting the plants at their base using a root auger. The collected roots were
    thoroughly washed under gently running water, passing through a series of mesh
    sieves. Subsequently, the extracted roots were scanned using a Root Scanner, generating
    tiff images. The obtained images were analyzed using WinRhizo Pro software (Regent
    Instruments Inc., Canada) (Kamoshita et al., 2019, Parihar et al., 2019). The
    root length density (RLD) was determined up to a soil depth of 15 cm using the
    following equation: (4) 2.4.6. Yield and yield attributes The yield attributes–the
    number of tillers and number of panicles were counted from the middle three rows
    (11th, 12th, and 13th row) at two randomly selected spots, each spot measuring
    1 m in length. The average values were calculated and reported as the number of
    tillers m-2 and the number of panicles m-2. Grains per panicle were determined
    by counting the number of grains in ten randomly chosen representative panicles
    and expressed as the average number of grains per panicle. To estimate the overall
    yield, two rows along the length and three rows along the breadth were excluded
    to eliminate the border row effect. The remaining rows were harvested and left
    in the field for five days to allow for proper air drying. Subsequently, they
    were threshed using a paddle thresher and then winnowed. The final grain yield
    was recorded as kilograms per plot and then converted into t ha-1 at 14% grain
    moisture content. The test weight was determined by calculating the weight of
    1000 grain seeds and expressed as gram at 14% moisture content. The straw yield
    of rice was determined by drying a few samples in an oven at 65 °C until a constant
    weight was achieved. The result was reported as t ha-1 on a dry weight basis.
    2.4.7. Plant nitrogen analysis The samples collected for biomass accumulation,
    grain and straw yield were subjected to nitrogen (N) analysis. After drying the
    collected samples (grains and straw), N content was determined using a CHNS analyzer
    (Euro EA-3000). The N uptake by plant during the vegetative stage and by grain
    and straw at harvest was calculated using the following approach: The remobilized
    N was estimated according to Ciampitti and Vyn (2013) as follows: 2.5. Computation
    of efficiencies 2.5.1. Water use-efficiency The photosynthetic-WUE (P-WUE) was
    estimated by applying the following equations (Guo et al., 2016): (5) Irrigation-WUE
    (IWUE; kg ha-1 mm-1) was computed according to Parihar et al. (2017) using the
    following formula: (6) 2.5.2. Nitrogen use efficiency The photosynthetic-NUE (P-NUE)
    (nmol CO2 mmol-1 N s-1) was computed applying the following formula (Anand et
    al., 2007): (7) The partial factor productivity of N (PFPN) was calculated as
    the GY obtained per kg of N applied and expressed as kg grain kg−1 N applied.
    Additional significant indicators of nitrogen (N) utilization efficiency are agronomic
    efficiency (AEN) and recovery efficiency (REN). These metrics was be calculated
    using the following equations (8) (9) In the above equations, \"Total N Uptake
    Fertilized\" represents the combined N uptake from both grain and stover in the
    fertilized plot (kg kg−1), \"Total N Uptake Control\" denotes the combined N uptake
    from both grain and stover in the unfertilized control plot (kg kg−1), \"Applied
    Fertilizer N\" signifies the amount of N fertilizer applied (kg kg−1), \"Grain
    Yield Fertilized\" represents the grain yield in the fertilized plot (kg kg−1),
    and \"Grain Yield Control\" signifies the grain yield in the unfertilized (control)
    plot (kg kg−1). 2.6. Economic analysis The cost of the SSD irrigation system was
    determined by considering an 80% subsidy provided by the Govt. of India on the
    actual cost, which amounted to USD 3477.90 ha-1. To calculate the annual depreciation
    amount, the straight-line depreciation method was employed, considering a salvage
    value of 10% and a 15-years useful life span of the SSD system (Sidhu et al.,
    2019). As a result, the total cost incurred for installing the SSD system for
    a single crop in the RW system was USD 20.87. Throughout the study period, the
    gross returns (GR), and net returns (NR) were calculated based on inputs and output
    rates, considering the incurred variable cost along with the annual depreciation
    amount (USD 20.87) of the drip irrigation system. The cost of human labour was
    determined according to the Indian labour laws, considering one person-day equal
    to 8 hours of work. Additionally, machinery time (hours per hectare) required
    to perform a specific on-farm operation was computed. The total cost for all on-farm
    operations was derived by accounting for the cost, time, and diesel consumption
    associated with each operation. The total variable cost (TVC) was obtained by
    summing the input costs. The GR was calculated by multiplying the output (grain
    and straw yields) by their respective market prices. To determine the NR, the
    TVC + annual depreciation cost (Rs. 20.87) were subtracted from GR. It is important
    to note that the economic analysis did not include fixed costs such as land value
    and interest. The economic analysis was conducted using Indian rupees (INR) and
    later converted into USD. 2.7. Statistical analysis The collected data was analysed
    using the general linear model procedures of the statistical analysis system (SAS
    Institute, Cary, NC) for a RCBD. To assess the variation between treatments, an
    analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. Post-hoc analysis was conducted using
    the LSD test at a significance level of P < 0.05 (Gomez and Gomez, 1984), allowing
    for comparisons of treatment means. 3. Results 3.1. Leaf area index and Fractional
    intercepted photosynthetically active radiations At the flowering stage (90 DAS),
    the peak values for both Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Intercepted Photosynthetically
    Active Radiation (fIPAR) were observed, followed by a subsequent decline (Fig.
    3 and Fig. 4). Among the different treatments, the PTR plots exhibited the highest
    LAI (4.41) and fIPAR (0.88), compared to CA+ and CA plots, even when subjected
    to 100% recommended dose of N (SSD-N100 and FI-N100). The application rate of
    nitrogen had a greater impact on LAI and fIPAR than the irrigation system, as
    the LAI and fIPAR values remained similar between CA+ and CA plots across all
    nitrogen rates (0%, 75%, and 100% of the recommended dose). Interestingly, both,
    the SSD-N100 and FI-N100 treatments had ∼12% higher LAI than their respective
    N-75% treatments (SSD-N75 and FI-N75). The control treatments, SSD-N0 and FI-N0,
    consistently exhibited the lowest LAI and fIPAR values across all treatments.

    and transpiration rate Throughout the study years, there were no significant differences
    in the photosynthesis rate of PTR, CA, and CA+ plots at 100% and 75% of the recommended
    dose of N (Table 2). However, it was evident that plots without nitrogen fertilizers
    (SSD-N0 and FI-N0) exhibited lower photosynthetic rate compared to N-fertilized
    plots. In case of the transpiration rate, the N-fertilized CA+ plots (SSD-N75
    and SSD-N100) had significantly lower rates, around 13–14% compared to PTR and
    CA-plots (FI-N0, FI-N75, and FI-N100), which showed similar transpiration rates
    (Table 2). Interestingly, the transpiration rate of SSD-N0 was comparable to that
    of PTR and CA-plots. Table 2. Effect of different crop establishment techniques,

    information. Different lowercase letters within each column indicate significant
    differences (P < 0.05) based on the least significant difference test. 3.3. Dry
    matter accumulation All treatments exhibited a sigmoid growth curve for dry matter
    accumulation (Fig. 5). Initially, dry matter accumulation was slow, followed by
    a rapid increase up to 50 DAS, then a subsequent decrease, reaching its peak at
    95 DAS. Notably, the PTR plots exhibited the highest (2-year mean) biomass accumulation
    over two-year period, reaching 17,670 kg ha-1. At harvest, the PTR treatment outperformed
    the SSD-N100 and FI-N100 treatments, sowing 10% and 13% higher biomass, respectively.
    The rate of N application had a higher impact on dry matter accumulation than
    the irrigation system, as evident from the significant reduction in biomass in
    no nitrogen treatments (SSD-N0 and FI-N0) (Fig. 5). At the flowering stage, the
    application of 100% recommended dose of N (FI-N100 and SSD-N100) resulted in 1.13
    times higher biomass compared to the application of 75% recommended dose of N
    (FI-N75 and SSD-N75) in both CA and CA+ plots. At 100% of the recommended dose
    of N, CA+ plots (SSD-N100) and CA plots (FI-N100) recorded 1.17–1.18 times higher
    biomass at harvest compared to their respective plots with 75% recommended dose
    of N. In case of control treatments (FI-N0 and SSD-N0), both at the flowering
    and harvest stages, they consistently accumulated the lowest biomass among all
    treatments. Moreover, the CA+ treatments exhibited 3% higher biomass compared
    to the CA-based treatments at similar nitrogen doses (Fig. 5). Download : Download

    Table 1 for treatment details. 3.4. Specific leaf nitrogen The PTR plots exhibited
    8–9% higher specific leaf N-content (SLN) compared to the CA and CA+ plots (Table
    2). Interestingly, the CA and CA+ treatments had similar specific leaf N content
    across all nitrogen application rates. However, an increase in N application rates
    led to higher specific leaf N content for both CA and CA+ treatments (Table 2).
    The specific leaf N content of SSD-N75 and SSD-N100 treatments were statistically
    similar. However, in the case of CA treatments, FI-N100 recorded 12% higher specific
    leaf N content than FI-N75 treatment. The control treatments (FI-N0 and SSD-N0)
    recorded the lowest specific leaf N content (60.4 and 59.9 mmol m-2) irrespective
    of the different practices (CA and CA+). 3.5. N-uptake and remobilization N-uptake
    and remobilization exhibited similar patterns across the two seasons. Increasing
    the N-application rate during the vegetative growth stage, N-uptake and N-remobilization
    increased. The levels of N-uptake and remobilized N were comparable among the
    SSD-N100, FI-N100, and PTR treatments (Fig. 6). Vegetative stage N uptake in the
    CA and CA+ treatments showed no significant differences at the same N dose. However,
    the use of 100% recommended dose of N in both CA and CA+ treatments led to a 12%
    and 14% increase in vegetative N uptake compared to FI-N75 and SSD-N75, respectively.
    The control treatments (FI-N0 and SSD-N0) under CA and CA+ exhibited the lowest
    vegetative N uptake and N remobilization. At 100% recommended dose of N, CA+ based
    SSD-N100 plots with SSD irrigation increased N uptake (4.5%) and remobilization
    (7.5%) compared to PTR plots. Furthermore, decreasing the N application from 100%
    to 75% of the recommended N dose led to a reduction of vegetative N uptake by
    12–14%. Download : Download high-res image (161KB) Download : Download full-size

    system (2-years mean basis). Refer to Table 1 for treatment details. 3.6. Root
    length density The irrigation system and N application rate had a significant
    impact on root length density (RLD) at soil depth up to 15 cm during the maximum
    tillering (MT) and flowering stages (Fig. 7). Increasing the N dose resulted in
    higher RLD regardless of the irrigation system employed. For instance, SSD-N100
    outperformed the SSD-N75 treatment by 16% and 7% during the MT and flowering stages,
    respectively. Similarly, the SSD-N75 exhibited 47% and 23% higher RLD than SSD-N0
    at the MT and flowering stages, respectively. In CA plots, the use of 100% recommended
    dose of N (FI-N100) led to a 10% higher RLD than FI-N75 at the MT stage. However,
    at the flowering stage, FI-N75 exhibited a comparable RLD value to the FI-N100
    treatment. Over the course of two years, root proliferation under SSD-N100 followed
    a similar pattern to PTR and yielded 7–9% higher RLD compared to the FI-N100 at
    the MT and flowering stages (Fig. 7). With the exception of PTR, the RLD of CA+ plots
    were consistently higher than that of CA plots at a similar N application rate.
    For example, during the flowering stage, the RLD of CA+ plots were 10.7%, 3.4%,
    and 10.2% higher than that of CA plots for 0%, 75%, and 100% recommended dose
    of N, respectively. Similar trends in RLD were observed during the MT stage. Download

    Refer to Table 1 for treatment details. 3.7. Grain and straw yields Straw yield
    and certain yield attributes, such as the number of tillers per square meter,
    weight of 1000 grains, and grain panicles, showed no significant differences among
    different irrigation methods at similar N doses (Table 3). However, the number
    of panicle m-2 and grain yield (GY) in PTR pots were significantly higher than
    in SSD and FI-based plots when applying 100% of the recommended N dose. In CA
    and CA+ treatments, reducing the N dose from 100% to 75% of recommended N dose
    showed no effect on yield attributes. However, both grain and straw yields were
    influenced by the N dose, with a significant decrease observed when the N dose
    was reduced from 100% to 75% of the recommended dose. Compared to the SSD-N75,
    the GY increased by 1.2 times under SSD-N100, and similarly, GY under FI-N100
    was 1.1 times higher than under FI-N75. Notably, PTR plots produced 35–40 more
    tillers and panicle m-2 than SSD-N100 and FI-N100 plots. Consequently, PTR had
    the highest two-year average GY, followed by SSD-N100, which was comparable to
    FI-N100. PTR yielded 11.1% and 15.7% more grain than SSD-N100 and FI-N100, respectively.
    Similar trends were observed in straw yield, with PTR producing 9.5% and 12.0%
    more biomass than SSD-N100 and FI-N100, respectively. Table 3. Yield attributes

    based on the least significant difference test. 3.8. Water use-efficiency Depending
    on the irrigation system and crop establishment methods, varying amounts of irrigation
    water were applied to different treatments (Table 4). Due to the lower rainfall
    in 2020 (Fig. 1), the total irrigation water applied in all three systems (CA,
    CA+, and PTR) increased in the second year compared to the first year. In 2020,
    PTR plots received 35% more irrigation water compared to 2019, while CA and CA+ plots
    received 22% and 12% more irrigation water, respectively. PTR required the highest
    amount of irrigation water in both years, while the adoption of CA+ and CA significantly
    decreased the amount of irrigation water (Table 4). Compared to CA and PTR, CA+ plots
    required 1.5 and 2 times less irrigation water over the two-year period, respectively.
    Water management through SSD significantly increased irrigation water use efficiency
    (IWUE) compared to FI and PTR treatments. The SSD-N100 treatment resulted in 1.6
    and 1.8 times higher IWUE (on a 2-year mean basis) than FI-N100 and PTR, respectively
    (Table 4). Table 4. Water use and water use-efficiency of rice as affected by

    1 for detailed treatment information. Different lowercase letters within each
    column indicate significant differences (P < 0.05) based on the least significant
    difference test. The photosynthetic water use efficiency (PWUE), derived from
    the ratio between photosynthesis and transpiration rate at the flowering stage,
    ranged between 2.05 and 3.04 (μmol CO2 mmol-1 H2O) (Table 2). On average, CA+ plots
    exhibited 10% higher PWUE than CA treatments, regardless of the N dose. Among
    the treatments, SSD-N100 plots had the highest PWUE (3.04 μmolCO2 mmol-1 H2O),
    which was comparable to FI-N100 (2.83 μmolCO2 mmol-1H2O) but significantly higher
    than PTR (2.71 μmolCO2 mmol-1H2O). SSD-N100 increased PWUE by 12% compared to
    PTR, while no significant difference was observed between FI-N100 and PTR. The
    N-application rate had a significant impact on the PWUE, with the lowest values
    recorded for treatments without N (FI-N0 and SSD-N0) (Table 2). 3.9. Nitrogen
    use efficiency The PTR plots exhibited the highest partial factor productivity
    of nitrogen (PFPN) value (60.51 kg grain kg-1 N), followed by SSD-N75 (49.17),
    which was almost similar to FI-N75 (48.84) (Table 5). Across different N doses,
    the SSD irrigated CA+ plots had similar PFPN to their respective flood-irrigated
    CA treatments. SSD-N75 showed a 13% higher PFPN than SSD-N100, and a similar trend
    was observed for CA treatments. Agronomic efficiency (AEN), which also considers
    yield in relation to NUE, followed similar trend as PFPN. PTR showed the highest
    AEN (32.83 kg increase kg-1 N) followed by SSD-N100 (26.42), showing almost similar
    values. However, for recovery efficiency (REN), the highest N recovery was observed
    under SSD treatments. SSD-N100 exhibited the highest REN value (66.30%), followed
    by SSD-N75 (62.28%). On average, the REN of CA+ plots were 16.72% higher than
    that of CA plots. The REN of PTR was 21.28% lower than CA+ treatment– SSD-N100.
    Even at 25% lower N rate, CA+ exhibited 17.26% higher REN than PTR. Photosynthetic
    NUE (PNUE) exhibited a decrease with increasing N dose, with the highest PNUE
    observed in plots without N application (SSD-N0 and FI-N0), regardless of irrigation
    system and establishment methods (Table 2). Table 5. Nitrogen use efficiency of

    The cost of implementing SSD was calculated in this study, taking into account
    the 80% subsidy provided by the Government of India on actual cost (see Section
    2.7). The SSD-N100 treatment resulted in 1.2- and 1.1-times lower cultivation
    costs compared to the PTR and FI-N100 treatments, respectively (Table 6). The
    net return of PTR treatment was significantly higher than FI-N100 but comparable
    to SSD-N100 over the two years of the study period. While SSD demonstrated numerically
    higher net returns compared to FI at the same N dose, the statistical analysis
    showed no significant difference. (Table 6). However, reducing the N application
    rate significantly reduced the net return in the N-free treatments (FI-N0 and
    SSD-N0). CA+ -based SSD-N100 plots generated 1.3-times higher net returns than
    SSD-N75. The net benefit-cost ratio in SSD-N100 plots was higher than in all other
    treatments except PTR, which had a statistically similar net benefit-cost ratio
    (Table 5). Table 6. Economics of rice as affected by different crop establishment
    techniques, N doses, and irrigation methods under rice-wheat cropping system.

    within each column indicate significant differences (P < 0.05) based on the least
    significant difference test. 4. Discussion 4.1. Effect of N and irrigation on
    plant growth parameters The higher leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of intercepted
    photosynthetically active radiation (fIPAR) observed in the PTR plots compared
    to the CA and CA+ treatments can be attributed to better crop establishment, growth,
    and source strength, such as the number of tillers and leaf size (Seeraj et al.,
    2018, Singh et al., 2018). The PTR treatment achieved peak fIPAR during the flowering
    stage due to its high LAI, resulting in a higher photosynthetic rate (Yoshida,
    1972) . Apart from PTR treatment, sufficient N-doses with high LAI and fIPAR had
    a positive effect on rice growth under both CA and CA+ treatments at 100% recommended
    dose of N (Samadiyan et al., 2013). Although there was no statistically significant
    difference in photosynthesis observed between CA and CA+ , the numerical difference
    can be explained by the higher leaf area attained under CA+ , which may have prevented
    excessive irradiance losses to the ground. The low LAI observed in the CA and
    CA+ treatments without N application (SSD-N0 and FI-N0), can be attributed to
    N-deficiency (Rana et al., 2022), resulting in lower fIPAR, photosynthesis, and
    biomass yield (Müller, 2011). N-deficiency causes photo-inhibition (Henley et
    al., 1991), leading to reduced photosynthesis and under-expression of yield-attributing
    characters in treatments with low or no N application (Hall et al., 1995, Green,
    1987). Even when CA is combined with N application using SSD at 75% of N recommended
    dose (SSD-N75), it fails to improve rice growth compared to PTR or even FI-N100,
    indicating that rice is responsive to N and optimal N application is necessary
    to avoid growth reduction and yield losses, regardless of irrigation system (SSD
    or FI). 4.2. Effect of N and irrigation on N-uptake and N use efficiency During
    the vegetative stage, rice primarily relies on soil mineral nitrogen (N) uptake,
    whereas, in the reproductive stage, N-uptake is predominantly depending on the
    organic N content present in plant tissues, which is subsequently remobilized
    to grains (.Jones et al., 2011, Hashim et al., 2015). Among the different treatments,
    FI-N100 and SSD-N100 exhibited higher N accumulation during the vegetative phase,
    indicating enhanced remobilization (Fig. 6). The percentage of remobilized vegetative
    N across treatments ranged from 42% to 61%, aligning with findings from other
    researchers'' (Masclaux et al., 2001, Zhang et al., 2017, Zhao et al., 2015).
    The impact of CA on crop growth and yield is influenced, in part, by the soil
    nutrient pool (Zentner and Lindwall, 1978). Sequestration of N through the decomposition
    of surface-retained residue further increases the mineral N pool in the soil,
    leading to enhanced soil N pools in CA-based practices (Alam et al., 2020). The
    combined effect of CA and SSD irrigation promotes surface residue decomposition
    under the CA system and the application of N directly at the active root zone
    via SSD fertigation improves N availability in the soil. Rice roots exposed to
    continuous N flow in CA+ system-based SSD-N100 plots thrive and proliferate more,
    resulting in increased N acquisition by the plant. The SSD-N75 recorded the maximum
    NUE, despite the GY being significantly lower than PTR, SSD-N100, and FI-N100
    plots. Based on the findings of this study, in the RW system of NW India, it may
    be recommended to fertilize the rice crop with 75% recommended dose of N when
    using SSD irrigation to attain the maximum nitrogen recovery efficiency. However,
    to avoid any yield losses, rice crop should be fertilized with 100% recommended
    dose of N, irrespective of the irrigation methods. 4.3. Grain yields The PTR plots
    exhibited higher GY than CA and CA+ treatments, primarily due to the production
    of greater number of tillers and panicles per unit area. A lower GY (10–14%) under
    DSR compared to PTR has been observed by Jat et al. (2019) and Kumar and Ladha
    (2011), which is consistent with our findings. It is worth noting that all treatments
    in our study, including the CA+ plots, were grown using the same cultivar and
    similar row spacing, ensuring comparable light availability. Additionally, since
    the CA plots were also flooded, the higher number of tillers and panicles observed
    in the PTR plots cannot be attributed to inadequate light availability or insufficient
    irrigation. One possible explanation for the increased tillering in the PTR plots
    is the higher plant density achieved through transplanting. Therefore, increasing
    the seed rate in DSR, in particular under CA, could potentially result in a higher
    number of tillers and ultimately a higher GY. The superior performance of SSD-N100
    in terms of GY compared to FI-N100 can be attributed to more effective water and
    nitrogen (N) management. This led to a greater number of tillers and panicles,
    as well as an increased number of grains per panicle in the SSD-N100 treatments
    compared to the FI-N100 treatments (Parthasarathi et al., 2017). However, it is
    important to note that our findings differ from some studies that have reported
    comparable or even higher rice yields with sub-surface drip (SSD) irrigation compared
    to PTR (Jat et al., 2019, Sidhu et al., 2019, Sharda et al., 2017). 4.4. Water
    use efficiency The higher IWUE observed in the SSD-N100 treatment can be attributed
    to the significant reduction in the applied water, specifically (50% of the water
    used for PTR). Similar findings were reported by Sharda et al. (2017), who found
    that SSD in DSR saved 40–50% more water and achieved a 90% higher WUE compared
    to PTR. Likewise, Jat et al. (2019) reported substantial water savings of 23%,
    46%, 46%, and 55% in maize, rice, wheat, and mungbean under CA+ system, respectively,
    compared to CA with FI. In CA+ plots, the irrigation water savings can be explained
    by the presence of crop residue on the soil surface, as well as the application
    of water directly to the root zone in smaller amounts (10–20 mm) but at higher
    frequencies (Kumar et al., 2018, Sidhu et al., 2019, Tarkalson et al., 2009).
    This practice minimizes losses such as deep percolation, evaporation, and seepage,
    leading to higher soil moisture content in the effective root zone (Camp, 1998,
    Douh and Boujelben, 2011, Sidhu et al., 2019, Sharda et al., 2017). In contrast,
    under PTR, a water depth of 50 mm was applied during each irrigation event, with
    a significant portion lost by percolation and evaporation losses. Studies by Ayars
    et al. (1999) and Sidhu et al. (2019) have also reported substantial water losses
    associated with PTR due to these factors. 4.5. Economics The higher profitability
    observed in the SSD-N100 plots, despite a slight decrease of 11% in crop productivity
    compared to PTR plots, could be attributed to the higher cultivation costs associated
    with conventional PTR practices. Intensive tillage, puddling, and transplanting
    in PTR plots incurred 8–14% more cultivation costs. Other studies conducted in
    similar agro-ecologies showed similar findings (Sidhu et al., 2019, Jat et al.,
    2019). CA+ had a lower cultivation cost due to reduced irrigation water usage,
    labour requirements, and energy inputs compared to both CA and PTR. Many researchers
    reported energy savings associated with CA and CA+ practices (Choudhary et al.,
    2018, Kumar et al., 2018, Parihar et al., 2017, Sidhu et al., 2019). Consistent
    with our findings, previous studies have shown higher profitability under CA and
    CA+ practices in rice (Sivanappan, 1994, Sharda et al., 2017), maize (Patra et
    al., 2023), and wheat (Sidhu et al., 2019), as well as maize-wheat cropping systems
    (Jat et al., 2019). Therefore, the combination of CA combined with SSD irrigation
    at optimum N-application represents a promising and efficient irrigation option
    that could mitigate future water scarcity as well as ongoing groundwater depletion
    in South Asia. Adoption of SSD irrigation can benefit farmers by increasing profitability
    and promoting sustainability through significant water and energy savings. However,
    the initial cost of implementing the SSD system is higher compared to the FI system,
    which hinders its widespread adoption in the absence of a subsidy. Furthermore,
    because water and electricity for groundwater pumping in the NW of India are free,
    farmers are expected to prefer FI due to its simplicity, existing farmer expertise
    in FI, and a similar or higher yield to SSD. Therefore, governmental support and
    strict policies together are crucial to facilitate the widespread adoption of
    the SSD system. Despite the potential benefits of SSD irrigation, certain challenges
    such as rodents (lamm et al., 1997), root intrusion with drip lines (Camp, 1998),
    and emitter clogging may negatively impact its performance and uniformity (Lamm
    and Trooien, 2003). While we did not encounter any issues during our research,
    it is important to monitor the operation, performance, and uniformity of SSD technology
    for potential problems such as rodent activity, root intrusion, drip line pinching,
    and emitter clogging. 5. Conclusions Regardless of the irrigation system employed,
    rice exhibits high responsiveness to nitrogen (N) fertilization. Inadequate N
    application resulted in significant reduction in photosynthesis rate, plant growth
    parameters, biomass and grain yields, and yield attributes. While puddled transplanted
    rice (PTR) plots demonstrated higher grain yield compared to conservation Agriculture
    (CA) and CA+ systems, this productivity came at a substantial water expense. However,
    the integration of CA practices with subsurface drip (SSD) irrigation, known as
    CA+ technology, and applying 120 kg N ha-1 (100% RDN) through fertigation in greater
    number of splits leads to substantial improvements in irrigation water use efficiency
    (IWUE). The IWUE achieved under CA+ was 1.8 and 1.6 times higher than that of
    PTR and CA systems, respectively, despite the observed yield losses. Additionally,
    the CA+ system achieves the highest profitability, as indicated by the benefit-cost
    ratio. The advantages of SSD irrigation primarily stemmed from water savings and
    reduced production costs, rather than increased crop productivity. The rationalization
    of water and N through a sub-surface drip irrigation system in rice cultivation
    in NW India could be a potential option not only for water-conservation but also
    for enhancing the benefit-cost ratio, thus increasing farmers’ acceptance. The
    adoption of CA+ enables significant water savings and economical yields, especially
    when applied at 100% RDN through fertigation. Therefore, in the rice-wheat (RW)
    system of northwest India, it is advisable to fertilize rice under the CA+ system
    with 100% RDN (120 kg ha-1) to avoid yield losses, regardless of the chosen irrigation
    method. Accordingly, breeding programmes should prioritize on identifying rice
    cultivars that are well suited to CA+ system, displaying high N efficiency to
    reduce N application. Efforts should also focus on raising farmers’ awareness
    of the benefits of SSD irrigation to encourage the adoption of this promising
    technology for the cultivation of water-intensive crops, such as rice. Further
    investigation is warranted to determine the ideal drip line depth, line spacing,
    emitter discharge for different agroecological condition. Exploring the optimal
    seeding rate for CA+ to achieve tillering comparable to PTR is also a research
    topic worth investigating. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare

  description: The present study aimed to understand the water-energy-food nexus among
    diverse crops at the command area level through five indicators. The research
    was carried out in South India, Periyamuthur Village located in the Krishnagiri
    dam command area. Paddy, jasmine, betel, mango, and coconut are the major crops
    for which nexus analysis was conducted. A geodatabase created from the cadastral
    map and Adangal register formed the base to generate thematic Maps on Crop classification,
    Irrigation wells and farm areas, that helped to identify the sample plots for
    primary data collection. The indicators include water consumption, energy consumption,
    Water productivity, Energy productivity and Water Energy Food Nexus Index (WEFNI).
    Among all crops, betel has the highest water consumption of 7627.634 m3/acre while
    coconut has the highest energy usage of 2900.40 MJ/acre. Despite its higher consumption,
    betel has higher water and energy productivity of 2.360 kg/m3 and 9.929 kg/MJ
    respectively because of their high yields. Maximum and minimum normalization were
    used to standardize the indicators. The water energy food nexus index was highest
    for jasmine at 0.828, which implies the crop has high suitability and sustainability.
    The management practice adopted for Jasmine is satisfied and it was lowest for
    coconut at 0.095, which implies the poor management of resources. Paddy has a
    WEFNI of 0.21, which is relatively low based on its spatial coverage (40%). The
    management options to reduce water and energy consumption for paddy were suggested.
    WEFNI helps in evaluating the present status and developing suitable strategies
    to improve the WEFNI thereby improving the water and energy productivity for sustainable
    agriculture.

  description: Traditional phosphorus fertilizers are necessary for plant growth but
    about 80–90% are lost into the surrounding environment via irrigation, therefore
    nano-fertilizers have been developed as slow-release fertilizers to achieve sustainable
    agriculture. This trial investigated the impact of the foliar application of hydroxyapatite
    nanoparticles (HA-NPs) as a source of nano-phosphorus (P-NPs) on two cultivars
    of sweet corn (yellow and white) throughout two seasons. The morphology and structure
    of the prepared HA-NPs were characterized via transmission electron microscopy
    (TEM) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). In addition, agro-morphological criteria,
    chemical contents (i.e., photosynthetic pigments, phenols, indoles, minerals,
    etc.), and genomic template stability percentage (GTS%) were evaluated in the
    produced sweet corn. The application of 50 mg/l HA-NPs improved the growth characteristics,
    yield per hectare, leaf pigments, and chemical content of yellow sweet corn, whereas
    the application of 100 mg/l of HA-NPs to white sweet corn enhanced the vegetative
    characteristics, production, photosynthetic pigments, phenols, and indoles. The
    difference in results may be due to the presence of a +ve unique band with SCoT-4
    and SCot-2 primers at 1250 and 470 bp in yellow and white corn treated with 50
    and 100 mg/l, respectively. The minimum GTS% was recorded at a concentration of
    75 mg/l for both white and yellow corn. The HA-NPs can be applied as a foliar
    source of P-NPs to achieve agricultural sustainability.

    Indeed, fertilization is important in agricultural production, where large quantities
    of fertilizers are applied to fulfill crop requirements and improve production
    (Hassan et al., 2022; Springmann et al., 2018; Un, 2019). However, the over-enforcement
    of agrochemicals has immediate passive ecological consequences for water and soil,
    as well as may be harmful to plants (Abd Elwahed et al., 2019; Guo et al., 2021;
    Saia et al., 2021). One of the most important macronutrient fertilizers is phosphorous,
    which is involved in many physiological processes. (Malhotra et al., 2018). The
    efficiency of traditional phosphorus fertilizer is 5–30%, with excess fertilizer
    entering the soil and water bodies causing eutrophication and algal fluorescence
    (Hawkesford et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2021). In addition, phosphorus is a limited
    resource, with diminishing rock sources of phosphorus becoming a concern, thus
    traditional methods of fertilizer production are unsustainable (Alewell et al.,
    2020; Liu et al., 2020). Consequently, new methods and technologies such as nanotechnology
    and slow-release fertilizer to sustainably boost cultivation output are necessary
    (Abd El-Aziz et al., 2022; Hofmann et al., 2020). Nanotechnology has been applied
    in numerous industrial sectors and more recently, in food production (El-Aziz
    et al., 2023; Shaban et al., 2021; Youssef et al., 2021, 2023). This technology
    is based on the preparation of materials in sizes less than 100 nm and is now
    applied in agricultural processes, including anti-pathogen, insecticides, remote
    sensing, and fertilizers, to realize sustainable agriculture or smart agriculture
    (Dasgupta et al., 2017; Mohamed et al., 2021; Salama et al., 2021). Hydroxyapatite
    nanoparticles (HA-NPs) are a prospective source of nano-phosphorus (P-NPs) (Li
    et al., 2021; Zhou and Lee, 2011) and are prepared by various methods such as
    one-stride moist chemistry deposition (Sadat-Shojai et al., 2013), precipitation
    (Cengiz et al., 2008), water-based sol-gel (Abd El-Aziz et al., 2019), etc. However,
    few studies have reported the use of HA-NPs as a nano-fertilizer (Elsayed et al.,
    2022) but they have been shown to enhance the growth and seed production structure
    of soybean plants by 32.6% and 20.4%, respectively (Liu and Lal, 2014). On the
    other hand, nano-fertilizers also affect gene expression. Currently, as a result
    of rapid growth in the field of genomics research (Liu et al., 2023; Salama et
    al., 2022a, 2022b). Several molecular markers have evolved such as amplified fragment-length
    polymorphisms (AFLPs), restriction fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs), single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs), and simple sequence
    repeats (SSRs), which are utilized on different plant species for various desired
    applications (Guerra, 2008). Nowadays, there is a trend for gene-targeted markers
    instead of using anonymous DNA markers (Andersen and Lübberstedt, 2003; Gupta
    and Rustgi, 2004). SCoT markers have been confirmed as dominant markers, which
    are considered simple, and rapid and do not need prior sequence information. The
    polymorphism of the SCoT marker is connected to functional genes and their corresponding
    traits (Xiong et al., 2011). This study investigated the effect of a foliar nano-phosphorus
    fertilizer on sweet corn (Zea mays var.). Sweet corn is the outcome of a recessive
    mutation in genes responsible for the processing of sugar to starch within the
    endosperm of the corn kernel. It is harvested when it has reached the milk stage
    (immature) and is consumed as a vegetable crop instead of grain. The practicability
    of ripping includes transforming sugar to starch so the sweet corn is edible fresh,
    packaged, or frozen before the kernels become solid and farinaceous (Smith, 2013).
    Additionally, sweet corn has different degrees of sugar, with local cultivars
    having the lowest sugar content compared to cross-bred cultivars that have the
    highest sugar content (Subaedah et al., 2021). Hence, this study aims to investigate
    the application of HA-NPs as slow-release fertilizers to achieve the principle
    of sustainable agriculture and their influence on two cultivars of sweet corn
    plant growth, productivity, biochemical content, genomic DNA stability, and toxicity.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Sodium orthophosphate dodehydrate (Na3PO4·12H2O)
    and calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2·2H2O) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical
    Company. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was supplied by El-Naser Company. Two cultivars
    of sweet corn seeds were brought from China (Beijing Agria Nky Seed Co., Ltd).
    2.2. Preparation of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HA-NPs) HA-NPs as a source of
    nano-phosphors (P-NPs) were prepared according to the process designated by Abd
    El-Aziz et al. (Abd El-Aziz et al., 2019). Solution A was created by dissolving
    5.8 g of CaCl2·2H2O in double-distilled water (100 ml). Solution B was created
    by dissolving 9.12 g of Na3PO4·12H2O in 0.09 N solution of NaOH. Solution A was
    added drop by drop to solution B with stirring continuously at room temperature
    to create a white suspension solution which was centrifuged at 10000 rpm to get
    a white precipitate. At least three cycles of resuspension in water and centrifugation
    were required to verify that every trace of a byproduct was eliminated. The white
    precipitate was dried for 72 h at 70 °C in an oven before being milled into a
    powder to get HA-NPs. 2.3. Characterization Japanese Transmission Electron Microscope
    (TEM) model JEM-1230 which operated at 120 kV and a resolution of 0.2 nm with
    a maximum magnification of 6X105 was applied to demonstrate the morphology of
    HA-NPs. Before characterizing, a drop of a suspended solution of HA-NPs was applied
    to a copper grid coated with carbon and left to dry in the air. The average particle
    size distribution of as-prepared nanoparticles was measured by employing a particle
    size analyzer (Nano-ZS, Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK). Philips X-ray diffractometer
    with CuK radiation source (λ = 0.15418 nm) was used to determine the crystal structure
    of HA-NPs. The analysis scan was performed in a 2θ range of 10 to 60°. With a
    Shimadzu 8400S FTIR Spectrophotometer, the FTIR spectrum of HA-NPs was captured
    in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. 2.4. Experiment layout At the end of February,
    the land was scraped, plowed, and leveled, after which, it was divided into plots.
    When the soil was prepared for planting, organic manure of 46 m3/ha was added,
    and calcium superphosphate was added at about 460 kg/ha (15.5% P2O5). After the
    seeds'' germination, potassium sulfate (48% K2O), and ammonium nitrite (33.5%
    N) were added by 115 kg/ha and 276 kg/ha, respectively. Sweet corn seeds were
    planted on the 1st of March in clay soil (50.4% clay, 37.8% silt, and 11.8% sand)
    throughout two seasons (2021 & 2022) in Shebin El-Kom, El-Monifia governorate,
    Egypt. Two seeds were planted per hole and the plot area was 25.2 m2 involving
    three ridges; each ridge was 12 x 0.7 m. The plant distance was 20 cm apart on
    one side of the ridge. The physicochemical characteristics of investigated soil
    (Table 1) were analyzed as maintained by Cottenie et al. (1982). Table 1. Physicochemical
    characteristics of investigational soil (Combined data of two seasons). Physical

    treatments Two cultivars of sweet corn plants, yellow sweet corn cv Jingke sweet
    183 and white cv Jingke Nuo 2000 were sprayed with different concentrations of
    HA-NPs (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/l) after 25 days of sowing (Vegetative Growth
    Stages; V4). The second spray was done after the first one within 15 days. Three
    replications of a split-plot design were used to set up the experiment. HA-NPs
    concentrations in the sub-plots were distributed randomly, whereas the main plots
    determined the cultivar type. 2.6. Agro-morphological criteria After 70 days (Silk
    stage; R1) of sowing, three plants were chosen at random from each treatment''s
    replicates to measure the vegetative growth factors such as the length of the
    plant (cm), leaf area, number of leaves, and internodes, as well as the weight
    fresh for leaves and stem (g While after 90 days of sowing (Harvest stage; R5),
    the yield and its components were measured as expressed by the cob length (cm),
    cob diameter (cm), number of rows per cob and grains per row, plus cob weight
    (g), and yield (T/ha). 2.7. Chemical contents 2.7.1. Photosynthetic pigments Fresh
    leaves were collected after 70 days after seeding to measure the photosynthetic
    pigments by extraction in 85% acetone, according to Vaccari et al. (2011). According
    to Metzner et al. (1965), the amounts of chlorophyll a (Chl A), chlorophyll b
    (Chl B), and carotenoid (Cart) were measured against a blank (85% acetone) using
    a UV/VIS spectrophotometer (TG 80, Germany) at 663, 644, and 452 nm, respectively.
    The equations proposed by Jiang et al. (2018) were used to compute the pigment
    content. Chl A = 10.3 E663–0.918E644 (μg/ml) Chl B = 19.7E644–3.870E663 (μg/ml)
    Cart = 4.2 E452 - (0.0264 Chl A + 0.426 Chl B) (μg/ml). The Chl and Cart concentrations
    were determined as (mg/g) fresh weight of plant material. 2.7.2. Biochemical contents
    Fresh sweet corn grain samples in both the yellow and white varieties were dried
    at 70 °C in an oven to obtain a constant weight, and then the dry grain samples
    were milled to analyze the following biochemical contents. 2.7.2.1. Total sugars
    Total sugars were assessed using a method depicted by Dubois et al. (DuBois et
    al., 1956). In a test tube, 1 ml of ethanol extract was added with 1 ml of phenol
    (5%) supplemented with 5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid, then the combination
    was softly blended and allowed to cool. The blank contained (1 ml) of ethanol
    (80%) with all reagents. Absorbance was estimated at 490 nm using a spectrophotometer.
    2.7.2.2. Oil content The Soxhlet method is explained by the Association of Official
    Analytical Chemists (Association of Official Analytical, 2000) as the criterion
    technique for oil analysis. A dry grain sample of 5 g (in an oven at 102 °C for
    5 h) was placed into the thimble. The thimble was put as a stand in a beaker in
    a Soxhlet extractor. Next, 90 ml of petroleum spirit (40-60 °C) was put into the
    flask followed by heating of the solvent in the flask until it boils. The heat
    was regulated so that solvent drips from the capacitor into the sample room at
    the rate of about 6 drops per second. The extraction persisted for 6 h. The thimble
    was dried in an oven at 102 °C for 2 h until a constant weight was accomplished.
    The percentage of oil is calculated by the following equation: Where; the weight
    of the empty thimble (g) is W1, the weight of the thimble plus sample (g) is W2
    and the weight of the sample is S. 2.7.2.3. Total protein The dry, ground grain
    samples were weighed into a digested flask (0.5 g) and then digested in H2SO4
    concentrated (10 ml) after digestion sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 33%) was appended
    followed by steam distillation, and the distillate was gathered in 20 ml of boric
    acid (4%). After that nitrogen content was evaluated by utilizing titration with
    HCl (0.01N). Total protein content was destined by a factor of 6.25 multiplied
    by the percentage of nitrogen obtained (Khanzada et al., 2008). 2.7.2.4. Total
    phenols Phenols were assessed by adding 1 ml of ethanol extract (0.1 g dry weight
    of grain samples were separated with methanol (80%) and then filtrated down to
    a size of 20 ml), 70 ml of filtered water, 5 ml of Folin-Ciocalteau reagent, and
    15 ml of saturated sodium carbonate solution, respectively. Then, the sample was
    incubated at chamber temperature for 30 min and gauged at 765 nm in a spectrophotometer.
    Gallic acid was used as a norm reference for the analysis of the total phenolic
    content, as a milligram of gallic acid commensurate per gram of dry weight (Waterhouse,
    2002). 2.7.2.5. Total flavonoids The colorimetric method of total flavonoid content
    was described by Chang et al. (2002). Flavonoids were estimated by supplementing
    0.5 ml of a sample of ethanol extract, 10% aluminum chloride (0.1 ml), 1 M potassium
    acetate (0.1 ml), and distilled water (4.3 ml) were mingled. After incubation
    at room temperature for 30 min, the absorbance was mensurated at 415 nm utilizing
    a spectrophotometer. The total flavonoid content was revealed as milligram quercetin
    equivalent per gram of dry weight. 2.7.2.6. Total indoles Total indoles were estimated
    calorimetrically by supplementing 1 ml of ethanol extract sample into a test tube
    followed by 2 ml of Salkowski reagent (150 ml of H2SO4 concentrated plus 7.5 ml
    FeCl3.6H2O 0.5M) was appended (Gordon and Weber, 1951). This solution was incubated
    for 30 min in the dim at chamber temperature. Next, total indoles were mensurated
    at 530 nm wavelength by employing a spectrophotometer (Lwin et al., 2012). The
    focus of total indoles was evaluated by utilizing a standard curve designed with
    standard Indole Acetic Acid. 2.7.3. Minerals determination To estimate N, P, and
    K in dry grain samples were digested by weight (0.5 g) of grain samples in a digested
    flask with 10 ml of H2SO4 concentrated, the combination was heated for 10 min
    after supplemented (1 ml) of perchloric acid, and warming uninterrupted till a
    clear solution appeared. The digested solution was completed to 100 ml using filtered
    water (Cottenie et al., 1982). After that, nitrogen content was estimated by using
    the Kjeldahl method according to Khanzada et al. (2008). Phosphorus content was
    determined by spectrophotometric technique as depicted by Cottenie et al. (1982)
    at 650 nm wavelength. Potassium content was estimated by a flame photometer method
    according to Okalebo et al. (2002). 2.8. Toxicity test The sweet corn seeds were
    desiccated at 105 °C until they reached a constant weight, and then they were
    ground into a fine powder. Two concentrations of 0.1% and 1.0% of extraction were
    made from sweet corn powder in water. After that, a Microtox analyzer 500 (USA)
    was used to determine how poisonous the materials were (Johnson, 2005). 2.9. Statistical
    analysis According to the method outlined by Snedecor and Cochran (1989), the
    collected data were subjected to statistical analysis of variance and checked
    for significant differences using LSD at a 5% level. 2.10. DNA extraction and
    SCoT-PCR amplification Genomic DNA was extracted from leaf samples of randomly
    chosen shoots for each treatment using Gene Jet Plant Genomic DNA Purification
    Mini Kits (Thermo scientific K0791). Thermo Scientific''s NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer
    was used to measure the isolated plant genomic DNA, which was then diluted to
    50 ng/l and utilized as a DNA template for PCR reactions. Six primers of SCoT
    (SCoT-2; CAACAATGGCTACCACCC, SCoT-4; CAACAATGGCTACCACCT, SCoT-8; CAACAATGGCTACCACGT,
    SCoT-12; ACGACATGGCGACCAACG, SCoT-13; ACGACATGGCGACCATCG, and SCoT-15; ACGACATGGCGACCGCGA)
    were applied for PCR amplification of the genomic DNA of white and yellow sweet
    corn, this PCR amplification of the genomic DNA was done in 0.2 ml PCR Eppendorf
    inside a total volume of 25 μl in 96-well plates via Thermocycler (Bio-Rad). PCR
    reaction mixtures consisted of 12.5 μl Dream Taq Green PCR Master Mix 2X (Thermo
    scientific K1081), 1 μl primer 10 pmol (Metabion, German), and 1 μl Template DNA
    (50 ng/μL) then completed to 25 μl via water (nuclease-free). A standard PCR program
    used with SCoT markers as follows: an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 3
    min (one cycle), followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and
    72 °C for 2 min; the final extension at 72 °C for 5 min (one cycle) then held
    at 4 °C. 100 bp DNA Ladder H3 RTU (GeneDirex, Cat No. DM003-R500) and 5 μl of
    DNA amplified PCR product were loaded in each well of agarose was placed in 1X
    TAE buffer (1.2%) and run at 100 V for about 2 h. The gel was photographed by
    gel documentation (Bio-Rad) and was analyzed by the Total Lab program to find
    out the molecular size of each band. The Genomic template stability (GTS, %) was
    calculated as the following: Where (a) denotes the average number of DNA profile
    variations and (n) denotes the number of bands chosen using DNA control profiles
    (Ozakca and Silah, 2013). 3. Results 3.1. Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HA-NPs)
    characterization Fig. 1a illustrates the HA-NPs morphological structure using
    TEM, where the as-prepared nanoparticles showed a symmetric spherical shape with
    particles the size of less than 100 nm. In addition, Fig. 1c represents that the
    average particle size of HA-NPs was 100 nm using a particle size analyzer. Download

    TEM image (a), particle size distribution (b), XRD partum (c), and FTIR (d) of
    as-prepared HA-NPs. The XRD diffraction pattern of HA-NPs was shown in Fig. 1d.
    It showed peaks at 2θ equal 25.9°, at 32.07°, 33.1°, and 34° corresponding to
    the crystal plane (0 0 2), (1 1 2), (3 0 0) and (2 0 2), respectively, which indicates
    a good formation of HA-NPs. FTIR analysis of HA-NPs was obtained in Fig. 1d. It
    shows the bands at 875, 600 and 560 cm−1 correspond to the (PO4)3+ group. Due
    to ambient water adsorption on the nanoparticles'' surface, the absorption bands
    at 3400, 1600, and 1450 cm−1 were caused by the stretching and bending vibrations
    of the O-H groups, respectively (Shekhar et al., 2016). 3.2. Vegetative growth
    characters Table 2 presents the effects of two cultivars of the sweet corn plant
    and various concentrations of HA-NPs on plant length, leaf area, number of leaves
    and internodes, and fresh weight of leaves and stems during two sequent seasons
    in 2021 and 2022, showing that these characteristics were improved in the white
    sweet corn cultivar compared to the yellow cultivar. Where it is found that the
    plant length (209.1 and 200.9 cm), leaf area (669.7 and 646.5 cm2), number of
    leaves (11.7 and 11.1), and internodes (13.1 and 12.5), as well as fresh weight
    for leaves (134.8 and 129.9 g/plant), stem (741.0 and 704.8 g/plant) and Plant
    (875.8 and 838.3 g/plant) are higher in the white cultivar of sweet corn during
    two seasons. Table 2. Effect of cultivars, different concentrations of HA-NPs,

    = Not Significant (p < 0.05). Furthermore, data in Table 2 represent the effect
    of various concentrations of HA-NPs on vegetative characteristics during two seasons
    2021 and 2022. The plant length (194.5 and 189.7 cm), leaf area (614 and 597 cm2),
    number of internodes (11.5 and 10.9), fresh stem (623.5 and 596.7 g) and plant
    (730.2 and 698.5 g) weights were enhanced in the white cultivar by raising the
    concentration of HA-NPs to 100 mg/l during two consecutive seasons 2021 and 2022,
    while the number of leaves (10.5 and 10) and fresh weight for leaves (108.1 and
    103.1 g) were highest at the 50 mg/l concentration. The interaction among sweet
    corn varieties and various concentrations of HA-NPs had no significant impact
    on the vegetative development characters except for the number of internodes per

    of sweet corn as corn length (21.9 and 21.2 cm), corn diameter (4.99 and 4.90
    cm), and number of grains per row (43.4 and 42.0), cob weight (281.6 and 267.5
    g) and cob green yield (40.6 and 39.2 t/ha) showed a significant effect with a
    white cultivar of sweet corn plant at two seasons 2021 and 2022, respectively,
    as compared to yellow cultivar. On the other hand, the yellow cultivar of sweet
    corn plants gave the maximum number of rows per cob (14.3 - 13.8) compared with
    the white cultivar (12.9 - 12.5). The concentrations of HA-NPs have a significant
    achievement on sweet corn harvest characteristics such as cob diameter, number
    of grains per row, cob weight, and green cob yield per hectare during two alternating
    seasons 2021 and 2022 (Table 3). The longest cob (20.5 and 19.9 cm) was recorded
    with sweet corn plants sprayed with 50 mg/l of HA-NPs. Conversely, the concentration
    of 75 mg/l of HA-NPs gave the preferable number of rows per cob (14.0 and 13.5).
    On the other hand, the cob diameter (4.90 and 4.82 cm) and the number of grains
    per row (41.7 and 39.8), cob weight (230.9 and 219.4 g), and green cob production
    per hectare (33.3 and 32.3 t/h) were ameliorated with 100 mg/l of HA-NPs, through
    two agriculture seasons 2021 and 2022. The interaction between the white cultivar
    of sweet corn and 100 mg/l concentrations of HA-NPs recorded a significant enhancement
    in cob length (23.3 and 22.5 cm), number of grains per cob (49.3 and 46.9), cob
    weight (325.0 and 308.8 g/plant) and green cob yield per hectare (46.8 and 45.8
    t/h), during sowing seasons 2021 and 2022 (Table 3). On the contrary, the number
    of rows per cob and the cob diameter did not show a significant effect. 3.4. Photosynthetic
    pigments Chlorophyll content reverberates the photosynthetic assimilation capability
    and photosynthesis rate of plants. In this research, it is perspicuous from Fig.
    2a that the content of photosynthetic pigments as expressed as Chl A, Chl B, total
    Chl, and Cart of sweet corn leaves was affected by the varieties of sweet corn
    and the concentrations of HA-NPs, through cultivation seasons 2021 and 2022. The
    superior content of Chl A (1.282 and 1.237 mg/g fresh weight), Chl B (0.650 and
    0.625 mg/g fresh weight), and total Chl (1.937 and 1.840 mg/g fresh weight) was
    achieved in the white variety, while the content of carotenoids (1.264 and 1.205
    mg/g fresh weight) was the highest in the yellow variety of the sweet corn plant.

    Fig. 2. Effect of cultivars (a), different concentrations of P-NPs (b), and their
    interaction (c) on photosynthetic pigments of sweet corn leaves (a combination
    of the data of the two seasons). Chl A (1.422 and 1.371 mg/g fresh weight), Chl
    B (0.708 and 0.670 mg/g fresh weight), and total Chl (2.130 and 2.023 mg/g fresh
    weight) became greater in leaves of sweet corn plants that were treated with 100
    mg/l of HA-NPs as compared to other concentrations, in seasons 2021 and 2022 (Fig.
    2b). Conversely, the optimal content of carotenoids was obtained (1.251 and 1.206
    mg/g fresh weight) with a concentration of 50 mg/l HA-NPs. It can be seen in Fig.
    2c that the white variety of sweet corn plant was spattered with 100 mg/l HA-NPs
    had higher Chl A (1.576 and 1.531 mg/g fresh weight), Chl B (0.795 and 0.748 mg/g
    fresh weight) and total Chl (2.372 and 2.253 mg/g fresh weight) in leaves as compared
    to other concentrations in two consecutive seasons in 2021 and 2022. In contrast,
    the yellow variety of sweet corn presented the maximum content of carotenoids
    (1.320 and 1.260 mg/g fresh weight) with plants cured with HA-NPs at a concentration
    of 50 mg/l. 3.5. Biochemical contents In Table 4, it was demonstrated that the
    cultivars of sweet corn plants had a substantial impact on the content of total
    sugar, oil, total phenols, total flavonoids, and indoles, throughout the two consecutive
    planting seasons of 2021 and 2022. The white cultivar of the sweet corn plant
    produced the greatest concentration of total sugar (71.4 and 68.3%), oil (26.5
    and 25.4%), and indoles (13.0 and 12.6 mg/g dry weight) in grains. However, the
    yellow sweet corn variety had higher levels of protein (16.0 and 15.1%), total
    phenols (13.1 and 12.3 mg/g dry weight), and flavonoids (2.7 and 2.5 mg/g). Table

    Not Significant (p < 0.05). On a dried weight basis, grains of sweet corn for
    the plants that were treated with 50 mg/l of HA-NPs, showed a noticeable excess
    of total sugar (67.2 and 64.2%), protein (13.6 and 13.2%), phenols (12.9 and 12.3
    mg/g dry weight), and indoles (13.5 and 13.3 mg/g dry weight) in both seasons
    2021 and 2022 as shown in Table 4. On the contrary, the oil content was recorded
    as the highest with plants treated with HA-NPs at a concentration of 100 mg/l.
    The total flavonoids showed the maximum value (2.7 and 2.5 mg/g dry weight) with
    25 mg/l of HA-NPs, during cultivation seasons 2021 and 2022. The interactions
    between sweet corn cultivars and concentrations of HA-NPs on the biochemical content
    of grains as total sugar, total phenols, total flavonoids, and indoles appeared
    the significant influence except for the percentage of oil did not give a significant
    increase, during two successive seasons in 2021 and 2022 (Table 4). Total sugar
    recorded the highest value (86.6 and 82.9%) with white cultivars sprayed with
    25 mg/l of HA-NPs. On the contrary, the oil percentage (27.4 and 26.3%) enhanced
    with a white cultivar that was sprayed with 75 mg/l of HA-NPs. Foliar application
    with 100 mg/l of HA-NPs increased indoles (13.0 and 12.6 mg/g dry weight) in grains
    of a white cultivar. As for the content of flavonoids (3.5 and 3.2 mg/g dry weight),
    phenols (13.1 and 12.3 mg/g dry weight), and protein (16.9 and 16.6%), the best
    values appeared in the yellow grains cultivar where it was added with 25, 50,
    and 100 mg/l, respectively with HA-NPs. 3.6. Minerals The optimal proportion of
    nitrogen (2.55 and 2.46%), phosphorus (0.28 and 0.26%), and potassium (0.96 and
    0.92%) showed a significant influence in grains of the yellow sweet corn cultivar
    as compared to the white cultivar, during two sequential seasons 2021 and 2022

    and their interaction (c) on minerals of sweet corn grains (a combination of the
    data of the two seasons). In the same context, the distinct concentrations of
    HA-NPs had a considerable consequence on the mineral content in sweet corn grains.
    The topmost content of nitrogen (2.17 and 2.11%) and phosphorus (0.26 and 0.24%)
    were gained with a concentration of 50 mg/l of HA-NPs (Fig. 3b), during the two
    following seasons 2021 and 2022. Reciprocally, the highest percentage of potassium
    (0.87 and 0.83%) was registered with a concentration of 75 mg/l. Yellow sweet
    corn cultivar presented the highest percentage of nitrogen (2.70 and 2.66%), and
    phosphorus (0.32 and 0.31%) by splashing plants with 50 mg/l of HA-NPs. Contrariwise,
    the top percentage of potassium (1.07 and 1.02%) appeared with 75 mg/l of HA-NPs,
    during two consecutive seasons 2021 and 2022, (Fig. 3c). 3.7. Toxicity test Using
    a Microtox analyzer, the sweet corn grains collected from plants treated with
    different doses of HA-NPs (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/l) for the two cultivars
    of sweet corn (yellow & white) demonstrated their non-toxicity. They are safe
    and eco-friendly because the effective concentration (EC50) for all samples was
    less than 100. 3.8. Genomic DNA studies Six primers were used for the SCoT amplification
    to find the difference in DNA fingerprints of white and yellow corn exposed to
    different concentrations (25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/l) of HA-NPs and the control
    (Fig. 4 and Table 5, Table 6, Table 7). Download : Download high-res image (1012KB)

    to 190 bp with six monomorphic bands and three polymorphic bands without any unique
    bands. The primer SCoT-4 showed eight bands with four monomorphic and four polymorphic
    at 1250, 1100, 900, and 340 bp. These polymorphic bands have one + ve unique band
    at 1250 and a –ve unique band at 900 bp with samples treated with 100 and 25 mg/l
    HA-NPs, respectively. In the primer SCoT-8, the total number of bands was seven
    bands with one monomorphic band and six polymorphic bands without unique bands
    at molecular sizes 990, 930, 680, 540, 350, and 200 bp. The total number of bands
    using SCoT-15 primer was eight ranging from four monomorphic and four polymorphic
    at 1200, 800, 255, and 200 bp. These polymorphic bands have two –ve unique bands
    at 255 and 200 bp which are absent in the sample treated with 75 mg/l of HA-NPs.
    Whatever the yellow corn showed 39 representative bands. The SCoT-8 primer had
    six bands ranging from 1260 to 350 bp and hadn''t any polymorphic band. Whilst
    SCoT-2 primer displayed six bands ranging from 880 to 300 bp with four monomorphic
    bands and two polymorphic bands with molecular sizes 750 and 470 bp. The polymorphic
    bands have one + ve unique band at molecular size 470 bp for samples treated with
    50 mg/l HA-NPs. In primer SCoT-4, there were six bands with five monomorphic bands
    and one polymorphic band with a molecular size of 750 bp. The polymorphic band
    was characterized by –ve unique band which is absent only in samples treated with
    75 mg/l of HA-NPs. The primer SCoT-13 displayed three bands with two monomorphic
    bands and one polymorphic band without unique bands at a molecular size of 600
    bp. The primer SCoT-12 exhibited eight ranging from 810 to 135 bp, with four monomorphic
    and four polymorphic at 720, 610, 290, and 135 bp. The polymorphic bands have
    two + ve unique bands at 720 and 640 bp which are present only in control. In
    the primer SCoT-15, ten bands ranging from 1200 to 255 bp were obtained, with
    seven monomorphic and three polymorphic at 1200, 1100, 255, and 950 bp. The polymorphic
    bands have three unique bands at 1200, 1100, and 950 bp, which are present only
    in control. 4. Discussion Phosphorus is one of the basic nutrients required for
    plant development and reproduction. It is an essential ingredient in transforming
    the sun''s energy into nourishment, oil, and fiber, playing major roles in photosynthesis,
    sugar metabolism, energy storage and transmission, cell division and expansion,
    and the transmission of genetic acquaintance. Moreover, phosphorus boosts sanitary
    root outgrowth and yield (Poudel et al., 2023). In addition, Hanif et al. (2015)
    indicated that nano-form fertilizers can promote plant metabolism which leads
    to an increase in the average exudation. Several studies showed that HA-NPs positively
    impact the outgrowth and development of different plants such as Zea mays (Yoon
    et al., 2020), Arachis hypogaea (Bakry et al., 2022), and lycopersicon esculentum
    (Priyam et al., 2022). Also, Veneklaas et al. (2012) reported that the photosynthetic
    rate is dependent on phosphorus-containing components. Indeed, phosphorus is a
    building block of pivotal biomolecules, inclusive of amino acids, phytic acid,
    nucleic acids, phospholipids, and energy source molecules, and contributes to
    the photosynthetic action (González and Trejo-Téllez, 2010). The Chl A, Chl B,
    and the total Chl content were evident in yellow and white sweet corn when HA-NPs
    were applied at the concentration of 50 and 100 mg/l, respectively (Fig. 2), thereby
    improving plant growth (Table 2, Table 3). This is in line with Abdel Wahab et
    al. (Mahmoud et al., 2019) who reported that nano-fertilizers enhanced the photosynthesis
    of tomato plants and decreased respiration, thereby increasing the total Chl content.
    The nano-fertilizers easily enter the epidermis and are transported throughout
    the plant vascular system via the stomata (Lv et al., 2019). From the consequences,
    the yield traits (Table 3) were improved with the application of HA-NPs which
    may be due to the enhancement in the values of plant growth criteria and Chl content.
    Meena et al. (2021) also found that the application of nano-fertilizers augmented
    wheat production due to increased growth hormones, improved metabolism, and increased
    photosynthesis. In addition, HA-NPs application ameliorates nutrient uptake, which
    leads to the foremost outgrowth of plant sections and enhanced metabolism, thereby
    increasing photosynthesis to improve crop outgrowth and production (Nasrallah
    et al., 2022). Hagab et al. (2018) indicated that the addition of 75% nano-zeolite
    phosphorus afforded peanut yield qualities markedly superior to those gained via
    the implementation of traditional fertilizer at an average of 100%. The biochemical
    and mineral contents of the sweet corn grains were also increased with HA-NPs
    application because the fertilizers enhanced the plant mineral concentration (Roosta
    et al., 2015). The plant species and nano-fertilizer properties (e.g. type, dose,
    the method applied, exposure period, and structure) influence the uptake, transmission,
    and accumulation of nanoparticles via roots or leaves as well as their nutritional
    character (Cox et al., 2016; Joshi et al., 2018). The tripping, accumulation,
    uptake, bioavailability, and transfer mechanisms of nano-fertilizers differ from
    those that transport into plants (Sun et al., 2022). Furthermore, the nano-fertilizers
    greatly enhance the total phenolic compound content (Uresti-Porras et al., 2021).
    Also, plant indoles are enhanced by enhanced plant outgrowth. The excess indoles
    conjugated to other compounds to be available to the plant during growth when
    needed for free (El-Mergawi and Abdel-Wahed, 2004). The function of HA-NPs is
    crucial in the movement of metabolites from the leaves to the grains in addition
    to increasing the chemical content of sweet corn grains. HA-NPs as a foliar fertilizer
    are non-toxic to sweet corn plants at different concentrations. Marchiol et al.
    (2019) also reported that HA-NPs were not toxic to tomato plants, thus HA-NPs
    were used as a phosphorus fountain to transport other elements. Shaban et al.
    found that the seeds of common dry bean plants splashed by ZnO-NPs (Shaban et
    al., 2019) and molybdenum oxide nanoparticles (Shaban et al., 2022) did not affect
    rats that consumed them. So, the toxic impacts of the nanoparticles are specified
    by the structure of the research layout, the period of subjection on the plant,
    the stage of expansion at which the nanoparticles will communicate with the plant,
    as well as the means of nanoparticle introduction and interaction. The application
    of HA-NPs improved the sweet corn cultivar growth characteristics, yields, and
    biochemical content and was most effective on the white variety (Table 2, Table
    3, Table 4), possibly due to the difference in the DNA markers (Table 5, Table
    6, Table 7). The digit of rows of grains in each cob (Farsiani et al., 2011) and
    the phytochemicals content are conditional on several factors including the genotype
    and ripeness (Revilla et al., 2021). Zhang et al. (2017) showed that the total
    phenolic content in sweet corn varies between varieties, whilst, Zhang et al.
    (2018) indicated that the flavonoid content differed in pollen, silks, tassels,
    and grains between five corn cultivars. Also, Mondale et al. (Mandale et al.,
    2019) suggested that the phosphorous condensation reduced with the growth of plants
    and there were variations between cultivars (sweet corn and popcorn). The application
    of HA-NPs was more effective on the values of photosynthetic pigments (Fig. 2),
    agro-morphological criteria (Table 2), total indoles, and total phenols (Table
    4) in white sweet corn, especially that treated with 100 mg/l. This may be due
    to the presence of a +ve unique band with SCoT-4 primer at molecular size 1250
    bp. Also, the polymorphic bands of SCoT-4 have one + ve and –ve unique bands at
    1250 and 900 bp in the plants treated with 100 and 25 mg/l of HA-NPs, respectively
    (Fig. 4 and Table 5-7). These –ve and +ve unique bands may be formed due to the
    genotoxic effect of 25 and 100 mg/l HA-NPs, respectively, on primer binding sites
    in genomic DNA. So, –ve unique may lead to turning off certain genes thereby reducing
    the cob length, cob diameter, number of rows per cob, number of grains per row,
    and percentage of oil, as well as increasing the sugar content, while + ve unique
    bands may turn on a certain gene related to increasing the studied agro-morphological
    criteria, photosynthetic pigments, total indoles, and total phenols. Furthermore,
    the polymorphic bands of SCoT-15 have two –ve unique bands at 255 and 200 bp absent
    in the plants treated with 75 mg/l of HA-NPs. This –ve unique may turn off certain
    genes which increase the oil, protein, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents.
    Regarding the yellow corn, the 50 mg/l concentration was more effective and was
    characterized by the appearance of a +ve unique band with SCoT-2 primer at 470
    bp. The appearance and disappearance of bands in samples treated with HA-NPs compared
    to the control explain the effect of these nanoparticles as genotoxic agents causing
    DNA damage in the priming sites. The alterations in the priming sites caused changes
    in the annealing conditions and homologous recombination that lead to the evanescence
    of certain bands and the occurrence of new bands (Atienzar and Jha, 2006). In
    addition, in yellow sweet corn, the polymorphic band of SCoT-4 was characterized
    by –ve unique band at 750 bp absent only in samples treated with 75 mg/l HA-NPs.
    This –ve unique band may be formed due to the genotoxic effect of HA-NPs which
    turned off certain genes related to the increased cob diameter and the potassium
    content in plant cells. Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) and nanotechnology are
    gaining increasing attention due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, as well
    as unique physical, chemical, mechanical, optical, and biological capabilities
    (Ghosh et al., 2016). Since plants can adsorb and accumulate NPs from the soil,
    water, and air, they are particularly vulnerable to nanotoxicity. Consequently,
    it is advised to use plants as model organisms in a first-level bioassay system
    to determine the potential toxicity of different nanomaterials (Ghosh et al.,
    2019; Kaveh et al., 2013). The mutagenic effect of the studied nanoparticle on
    plants was measured qualitatively by calculating the percentage of genomic template
    stability (GTS%). The mutation in base pairs of DNA leads to genomic instability
    (Savva, 2000). The minimum GTS% was recorded in samples treated with 75 mg/l P–NPs
    in both white and yellow corn and this may reflect the increased oil, protein,
    and potassium contents of white corn and the increased potassium content of yellow
    corn. Also, the GTS% values decreased with increasing HA-NPs concentration (Table
    7); this agrees with several studies performed on Phaseolus vulgaris (Osman et
    al., 2020), Vicia faba (Mahmoud, 2019), and Rocket Eruca sativa (Plaksenkova et
    al., 2019) plants treated with MoO3-NPs, ZnO-NPs, and Fe3O4-NPs, respectively.
    5. Conclusions The foliar spray of HA-NPs on two sweet corn cultivars improved
    plant growth, productivity, and photosynthetic pigment content and was non-toxic,
    thus these HA-NPs can be applied as a foliar nano-fertilizer to achieve agriculture
    sustainability. Contribution Dina M. Salama: carried out the agriculture experimental,

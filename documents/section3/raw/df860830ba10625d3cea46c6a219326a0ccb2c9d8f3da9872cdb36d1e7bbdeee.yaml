    As the world population is expected to touch 9.73 billion by 2050, according

    to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the demand for agricultural

    needs is increasing proportionately. Smart Agriculture is replacing conventional

    farming systems, employing advanced technologies such as the Internet

    of Things (IoT), Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) to

    ensure higher productivity and precise agriculture management to overcome

    food demand. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in

    researchers within Smart Agriculture. Previous literature reviews have also

    conducted similar bibliometric analyses; however, there is a lack of research
    in

    Operations Research (OR) insights into Smart Agriculture. This paper conducts

    a Bibliometric Analysis of past research work in OR knowledge which has

    been done over the last two decades in Agriculture 4.0, to understand the

    trends and the gaps. Biblioshiny, an advanced data mining tool, was used in

    conducting bibliometric analysis on a total number of 1,305 articles collected

    from the Scopus database between the years 2000–2022. Researchers and

    decision makers will be able to visualize how newer advanced OR theories

    are being applied and how they can contribute toward some research gaps

    highlighted in this review paper. While governments and policymakers will

    beneﬁt through understanding how Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and

    robotic units are being used in farms to optimize resource allocation. Nations

    that have arid climate conditions would be informed how satellite imagery

    and mapping can assist them in detecting newer irrigation lands to assist their

    scarce agriculture resources.

    1. Introduction

    The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United

    Nations (FOA) has estimated that the world population will

    touch 9.73 billion by 2050 and will continue to rise until it

    reaches 11.2 billion by 2,100 (FAO, 2018). There is a direct

    correlation between population expansion and an increase in

    the need for food production. Both increases in population

    and increase in urbanization increase the risk of food shortage

    due to increased consumption, and the demand for nutritious

    agriculture, as farmlands are replaced with infrastructure and

    buildings (Yuan et al., 2018). There are many obstacles to

    agricultural output, resulting in lower crop yield, such as soil

    salinity in arid climates (Mohamed et al., 2019). Further, climate

    and soil sensitivity have an impact on crop quantity and

    quality (Abdel-Fattah et al., 2021). Consequently, it is critical to

    concentrate on surveying land resources for use in agricultural

    growth in dry regions (Saleh et al., 2015). The agriculture

    industry is one of the key sources of national income in

    developing countries. Hence, using new technology to improve

    the agriculture sector is critical to these countries’ national

    economies. In addition to providing the raw materials required

    for the industrial process, agricultural production includes the

    production of food for humans and cattle. Smart Agriculture

    aims to address these concerns through increasing productivity,

    better allocation of resources, adapting to climate change and

    overcoming food wastage.

    Fundamentally, both Smart Agriculture and Precision

    Agriculture utilize the Internet of Things (IoT) or information

    technology to improve spatial management procedures to

    maximize crop yield while avoiding the overuse of fertilizers

    and pesticides (Auernhammer, 2001; Bacco et al., 2019; Chiu

    et al., 2022). Unlike Precision Agriculture, Smart Agriculture,

    also known as Agriculture 4.0, further employs advanced

    technologies such as Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine

    Learning (ML) to tackle a variety of crop-related diﬃculties by

    enabling the examination of changes in atmospheric conditions,

    soil properties, moisture, etc. The AI and IoT technology enable

    the connection of a variety of distant sensors, including ground

    sensors, robots, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), since it

    allows items to be linked and operated automatically through

    the internet (Almetwally et al., 2020; Chiu et al., 2022; Javaid

    et al., 2022). Despite Smart Agriculture technology evolving fast,

    academics feel that the technology is still at a nascent stage.

    Agricultural IoT application is currently fragmentary, and its

    usefulness for integration in agricultural development has not

    been fully investigated. This necessitates further research in

    combining Smart Agriculture with Operation Research (OR)

    theories (Hu et al., 2020).

    Bibliometric analyses on Smart Agriculture have also been

    conducted in the past. Abdollahi et al. (2021) conducted

    a bibliometric analysis between the years 2002 to 2021 to

    investigate the application of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)

    in agriculture. Rejeb et al. (2022a) conducted a bibliometric

    analysis between the years 2000–2021 to understand the

    comprehensive application of drones in agriculture. Rejeb et al.

    (2022b) looked at the applications of Artiﬁcial Intelligence

    (AI) in agriculture between the years 1992–2021 by conducting

    a bibliometric analysis. Rejeb et al. (2022c) analyzed the

    applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) in Agriculture

    between the year 2012–2020 by conducting bibliometric

    analysis. However, past bibliometric analyses tried to understand

    how the technologies such as WSN, AI, and IoT were being

    integrated into agriculture practices over the years, but there

    are few, if not any, bibliometric analyses on the application

    of Operations Research (OR) theories in Smart Agriculture or

    Agriculture 4.0 at a comprehensive level to understand how such

    theories have been applied in farms that have already integrated

    technologies such as AI and IoT systems. A complete evaluation

    of the studies on Operation Research (OR) in IoT-based

    intelligent agriculture is expected, considering this context. The

    research questions are (1) How have OR theories are being

    evolved over the last two decades to a more advanced and

    complex level? (2) Which OR theories are being applied to Smart

    Agriculture, and in what context? (3) How are Decision Support

    Systems (DSS) being applied to optimize Smart Agriculture, and

    for which objectives? (4) How are OR theories being applied to

    aid in achieving Smart Agriculture objectives? (5) What are the

    trends, gaps, and future research prospects in the application of

    OR in Smart Agriculture?

    The

    rest

    of

    the

    manuscript

    is

    outlined

    as

    follows:

    The methodology used to conduct bibliometric analysis is

    discussed in methodology section. The results and discussions,

    compromising of descriptive, keyword, and historical analysis,

    applications of DSS, as well as thematic analysis, are conducted

    in results and discussion section. The gaps, extracted insights,

    and future directions are discussed in gaps, future work, and

    insights section. Finally, an extensive conclusion comprising

    theoretical and practical implications, as well as limitations, are

    presented in conclusion section.

    2. Methodology

    In order to convey a holistic overview of the past literature

    on Smart Agriculture at a broad level over many the years,

    it would be ideal to conduct a bibliometric analysis over

    a traditional and systematic literature review. Traditional

    literature review lacks a transparent and systematic approach,

    and as a result, it is more likely to be biased (Kraus et al., 2020).

    While systematic literature review is more methodological

    to allow researchers to collect relevant research papers to

    conduct analysis in a systematic way to identify research gaps

    (Chakraborty et al., 2021). Whereas, bibliometric analysis can

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.1053921

    be applied to large data collection to allow us to visualize

    and reveal the advancement of a discipline in a statistical and

    mathematical method Rejeb et al. (2022b). It supports all the

    main areas of the classical bibliometric approach and provides

    various analyses using a graphical or visualization method

    (della Corte et al., 2019). A structured content analysis using

    bibliometric analysis allows researchers to identify themes and

    is a powerful and reliable approach for conducting a literature

    review (Chakraborty et al., 2021). This research is focused on

    gaining a rounded overview of the OR applications in Smart

    Agriculture, and in order to do so, it would be more feasible

    to conduct a bibliometric analysis for better visualization of

    how research has been gaining popularity and what are the

    research gaps. Moreover, the articles collected would require to

    be analyzed from diﬀerent angles in an unbiased manner, which

    both traditional and systematic literature reviews do not provide.

    Hence, the bibliometric analysis would be an optimum choice.

    FIGURE 1

    Radial venn diagram.

    Bibliometric analysis has been conducted to present a

    state of intellectual structure and to highlight the key trends

    of OR in smart agriculture. The analysis is performed using

    R-package bibliometrix (Harzing and Alakangas, 2016), an

    application designed for quantitative research in Bibliometrics

    or Scientometrics. It supports all the main areas of the classical

    bibliometric approach and provides various analyses using a

    graphical or visualization method (della Corte et al., 2019).

    As mentioned, to conduct a comprehensive overview of

    past literature on Smart Agriculture at a broad level, a wide

    variety of keywords is used to capture the maximum number

    of papers within a deﬁned framework. Bibliometric analysis of

    the collected material in this article is conducted in six phases:

    (1) Descriptive analysis, (2) Keyword analysis, (3) Historical

    analysis, (4) Application of DSS in Smart Agriculture, (5)

    Thematic analysis, and (6) Research gaps and future directions,

    and (7) Conclusions.

    During the ﬁrst phase, a set of keywords was outlined in a

    selected database to capture the past research work in the area

    of smart agriculture. Figure 1 depicts a Radial Venn diagram

    merging four diﬀerent areas with speciﬁc keywords, highlighted

    in Table 1, to collect material of interest to us (Resulting Area

    of Interest). Boolean operators “OR” and “AND” were used to

    achieve the desired merged area of research.

    As shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, Scopus was used as an

    online database to search for material. Two rounds of the search

    were made, wherein the search term was conﬁned to Keywords

    in the ﬁrst and the Article Title in the other. Since publications

    within the ﬁeld of OR in Smart Agriculture were near negligible

    before the year 2000, as shown in Table 4, and to highlight the

    interconnection between the literature paper, the search was

    limited to ﬁnal article papers published in English, and the time

    range was set between 2000 and 2022. To further reﬁne the

    A total of 1,305 articles were collected and exported in BibTex

    format to be readily used for Biblioshiny software to conduct a

    range of bibliometric analyses. Figure 2 shows the ﬂowchart of

    the literature selection process.

    3. Results and discussion

    This paper uses an approach similar to that of some scholars

    (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017) to draw a structure for a literature

    review in OR in Smart Agriculture. The approach is based

    on (1) data collection, (2) data analysis and visualization (3)

    Interpretation. The following section outlines the outcomes of

    the methodology phase described earlier.

    3.1. Descriptive analysis

    Table 4 shows statistics of publications through the past two

    decades. It includes the number of published articles (yearly

    and cumulative) from 2000 to 2022 and the total number of

    articles that have cited the chosen articles. The data illustrate

    that the number of articles in the scope of OR in Smart

    Agriculture gradually increased from 2000 to 2017, whereafter

    it dramatically increased, along with the number of citations per

    year. We should point out that the reason that we started with

    the year 2000 is because of the limited number of articles (max.

    2000) that could be downloaded from the saved library in Scopus

    in one ﬁle to be imported into the Biblioshiny application;

    however, most of the studies have been done in the recent two

    decades, as well.

    Some of the highly cited articles relating to operations

    research in smart agriculture focused on crop identiﬁcation

    using machine learning (ML) techniques (van Niel and

    McVicar, 2004; Peña-Barragán et al., 2011; Ghosal et al., 2018),

    precise irrigation using remote sensing and machine learning

    (Thenkabail et al., 2009; Goap et al., 2018), smart farming using

    the IoT (Mendas and Delali, 2012; Muangprathub et al., 2019),

    crop prediction using simulation modeling (Ines et al., 2013; V.

    Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2014), and using Unmanned Aerial

    Vehicles (UAV) for crop identiﬁcation (Torres-Sánchez et al.,

    2015; de Castro et al., 2018). The wide variety of topics of high

    citation demonstrates the diversity of the research streams in

    Smart Agriculture.

    Likewise, some of the major categories of operations

    research in smart agriculture were identiﬁed through the

    Scopus database, which included agricultural and biological

    sciences (about 40% of the articles published), Environmental

    Science (38%), Computer Science (28%), Engineering (16%)

    and decision sciences (2%). The most cited countries in the

    Scopus database included the USA (4,825 citations), Italy

    (3,826 citations), China (3,767 citations), and Spain (1,841

    citations), indicating the regions around the world contributing

    signiﬁcantly to the ﬁeld of operations research in smart

    agriculture. Further, Figure 3 is a combination of annual

    scientiﬁc production and annual trending topics generated

    using bibliometrix. The graph indicates the increasing interest

    of researchers in the ﬁeld of operations research in smart

    agriculture and, further, the increased complexity of the

    knowledge applied in smart agriculture.

    Topics were less sophisticated in terms of smart agriculture

    and operations research between the years 2000 and 2017

    since AI and ML methods were not well researched to be

    better applied in agriculture. The topics commonly discussed

    were decision support systems and management of information

    technology for the optimization of agriculture (such as crops,

    waste management, soil erosion, and water use). From 2017,

    the trending topics indicate more complexity and precise

    management of agriculture as research within AI and ML grows

    further, in turn improving agricultural production and practices.

    The topics trending since 2017 are focused on algorithms,

    climate change, precision agriculture, decision trees, remote

    sensing, and predictive analytics error in smart agriculture.

    The crease in complexity and development of sophisticated

    applications of Operations Research is an indication of the

    increased need of the agriculturists to overcome challenges faced

    to optimize their farming practices. Furthermore, the sudden

    increase in the number of articles and total citations from the

    year 2017 is also an indication toward the increasing interest of

    researchers in the application OR in Smart Agriculture.

    keywords frequently used by scholars in Operations research in

    smart agriculture.

    The highest keyword occurrences are for agriculture (7%),

    remote sensing (4%), crops (4%), and artiﬁcial intelligence

    (4%), as listed in Figure 4, which indicates that major research

    areas in operations research in smart agriculture are focused

    on agricultural crops through the use of IoT and AI. In terms

    to obtain an even percentage of articles that focused on

    agricultural systems (such as soil, land use, irrigation, etc.)

    using diﬀerent smart approaches, which included AI, remote

    sensing and machine learning. Within the agriculture group,

    some of the highest cited articles discussed object-based crop

    classiﬁcation (Peña-Barragán et al., 2011), remote sensing

    for agricultural applications (Weiss et al., 2020), predictive

    modeling of agricultural pollution (V. F. Rodriguez-Galiano

    et al., 2018), and managing farms through the use of information

    systems (Espejo-Garcia et al., 2020).

    Top-cited articles on remote sensing discussed various

    aspects, such as Thenkabail et al. (2009) using remote sensing

    to simulate a Global Irrigated Area Map (GIAM) to assist

    precision agriculture (Weiss et al., 2020) and discussing the

    applications of remote sensing in agriculture, (Ines et al.,

    2013) combining remote sensing and simulation to increase

    maize crop production, and (Torres-Sánchez et al., 2015) using

    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) in remote sensing methods

    for better crop identiﬁcation. It can be deduced that remote

    sensing techniques are commonly employed in agriculture to

    achieve better mapping, improve crop yields and classiﬁcation to

    enhance productivity, and achieve automated smart agriculture.

    Articles on AI looked at the integration of multicriteria

    decision analysis with GIS for agricultural land suitability

    detection (Mendas and Delali, 2012), GIS-based photovoltaic

    farm site detection (Sánchez-Lozano et al., 2014), selecting

    patterns and features for crop weed row mapping using UAV

    (Pérez-Ortiz et al., 2016), and predicting crop yield using fuzzy

    cognitive mapping (Papageorgiou et al., 2009). Articles in ML

    keyword criteria focused on designing a deep machine vision

    model for plant detection (Ghosal et al., 2018), managing

    irrigation systems in agriculture using decision support systems

    (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016), value creation through big data

    analytics (Saggi and Jain, 2018), etc., Other articles considered

    deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect

    water pollution in agricultural irrigation (Chen et al., 2020),

    precise automated leaf detection using image feature analysis

    (Pantazi et al., 2019), and predicting soil moisture content using

    hybrid machine learning (Prasad et al., 2018).

    The wide variety of highly cited articles in AI and ML,

    the heart of smart agriculture, indicates a great potential

    for

    future

    research

    in

    diﬀerent

    agricultural

    segments

    and using big data analytics, farms are adopting more

    precise management.

    3.3. Historical analysis

    Historical network analysis allows us to cluster a number

    of research streams that have evolved over the years. It uses

    the collection of bibliography from the articles collected and

    generates a map of the most relevant citations (Borgman

    and Furner, 2002; Garﬁeld, 2016). The direct historical

    network is discussed in this section, which was generated

    through Biblioshiny.

    The number of nodes was set to 40 to show a complete

    overview of the diﬀerent research paths. The following section

    will discuss the six areas of research relating to Operations

    research in smart agriculture; (1) Remote sensing and statistics,

    (2) ML approach for precise agricultural mapping, (3) Precise

    agricultural management using the IoT, (4) Cloud-based satellite

    for precise irrigation mapping (5) Decision Support Systems

    (DSS) to mitigate fertilizer-based loss and (6) Sustainable

    agriculture using ML techniques.

    3.3.1. Remote sensing and statistics

    Locating and extending irrigation land is important for

    better water management. Using remote sensing techniques

    to gather large amounts of data enables decision-makers to

    make better and more sustainable agricultural decisions. Two

    authors- (Zhu et al., 2014) and (Meier et al., 2018), as

    named in Table 6, both discussed using statistical approaches

    involving diﬀerent vegetation indexes (NDVI) for precise

    irrigation to assist croplands. Both authors considered using

    remote sensing and IoT to generate large statistical data to

    achieve accurate measurements of irrigated areas for improving

    agricultural practices.

    Zhu et al. (2014) employed remote sensing and time-series

    NDVI for mapping irrigated lands in China. Large statistical

    data were collected on diﬀerent precipitation patterns, which

    were downscaled using a spatial allocation model to locate new

    irrigation areas. Meier et al. (2018) looked at using remote

    sensing and multi-temporary NDVI to test existing maps and

    used decision trees to extend irrigated areas. Such methods

    of detecting newer irrigation land or extending the current

    irrigation land support Smart Agriculture requirements by

    increasing productivity since water is an essential source needed

    by agriculture and farms to produce crops.

    3.3.2. Machine learning for precise agricultural

    mapping

    Sustainable agricultural management of water resources

    demands a better understanding of spatial irrigation patterns.

    Both articles focused on the handling of large data to achieve

    better and more precise irrigation in the context of a single

    country using the ML approach. Deines et al. (2017) looked

    at Northern U.S. and analyzed the high-resolution irrigation

    maps produced by Landsat satellite imagery over the past 2

    decades using Google Earth Engine to understand the irrigation

    patterns to better manage the agricultural water resources.

    Statistical modeling involving a random forest classiﬁer was used

    to understand how precipitation inﬂuenced irrigation over time.

    Ketchum et al. (2020) used an ML approach to achieve

    better mapping of irrigated agricultural lands in the Western

    U.S. Similar to the ﬁrst group, Google Earth Engine was used

    to collect past data of four diﬀerent classes: irrigated agriculture,

    wetlands, uncultivated land, and dryland agriculture over 3

    decades to cover a variety of spectra to better map the irrigated

    agricultural lands to improve precise agricultural practices.

    The higher resolution of irrigated lands and better

    classiﬁcation assists in enhancing precise irrigation management

    for farms, and such methods support Smart Agriculture goals by

    improving resource allocation. Table 7 shows research stream:

    ML for precise agriculture mapping.

    3.3.3. Precise agricultural management using

    the Internet of Things (IoT)

    The research stream illustrated that IoT practices could be

    more sustainable and proﬁtable in terms of precise agriculture

    through better water management and fertilizer allocation than

    conventional models. Krishnan et al. (2020) employed smart

    irrigation systems based on fuzzy logic using IoT to reduce

    the amount of power for the watering of ﬁelds. A fuzzy logic

    controller was used to determine the input parameters, such as

    soil humidity, temperature, and moisture, to compute the output

    of the motor status. Farmers were assisted with smart irrigation

    systems through Global Systems for Mobile Communication

    (GSMC) to better manage the watering of agricultural ﬁelds by

    knowing the job status, including the soil moisture, humidity,

    and temperature, along with the status of motor power.

    Kocian et al. (2020) used IoT-based agricultural decision

    support methods for crop growth prediction. A dynamic

    Bayesian network (DBN) was used to correlate the parameters of

    crop growth with the environmental control parameters through

    the unknown Markov Chain. The crop growth parameters

    included lead-area index, dry weight, and evapotranspiration

    on a daily basis, while the environmental control parameters

    included solar exposure, vapor pressure, and temperature of the

    controlled environment. Large expectation-maximization (EM)

    algorithms were used to track states and better understand the

    parameters of DBN.

    Lin et al. (2020) focused on fertigation management

    based on IoT for sustainable precision agriculture. The paper

    addressed the irrigation and fertilizer allocation problems

    through a framework using IoT to manage not only at the

    short-term level but also in the long term. The integer linear

    programming model was developed to allocate limited resources

    among diﬀerent crops to maximize the total proﬁt (both

    economic and environmental).

    The use of IoT in smart agriculture supports the agriculture

    4.0 requirements by adapting to climate change as water

    resources are further decreasing due to increased demand, and

    this requires the use of smart irrigation. IoT is also being applied

    in Smart Agriculture, using probability to predict crop growth

    to increase productivity; such methods support Agriculture 4.0.

    Table 8 shows research stream: precise agriculture management

    using IoT.

    3.3.4. Cloud-based satellite for precise

    irrigation mapping

    All the articles in this stream utilized satellite imaging at

    a cloud-based level for better mapping of diﬀerent sectors

    of agriculture, such as irrigation and soil moisture, to

    improve precise agricultural practices. Such precise and accurate

    agricultural practices assist farmers in adapting to climate

    change and increase the productivity of their crops.

    Bazzi et al. (2021) focused on precise irrigation through

    mapping at plot scale using S1 and S2 data over 4 years

    (2017–2020). Two irrigation metrics were adopted for selection

    criteria, the ﬁrst one based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)

    using S1 and the other optical-based using S2; both were time

    series. Random forest (RF) was used to build an irrigation

    classiﬁcation model to validate the results. The proposed method

    demonstrated a higher accuracy of irrigation maps compared

    to empirical methods. Higher accuracy of irrigation mapping

    assists Smart Agriculture goals by better resource allocation.

    Likewise, Wellington and Renzullo (2021) considered

    enhancing irrigated crop mapping using S2 images. Accurate

    mapping for irrigated areas can be challenging to generate

    at a small level, requiring complex models attached to image

    stacks. Supervised random forest was applied to the collected

    data for smallholder irrigation schemes, enhancing the mapping

    of irrigation land. Pageot et al. (2020) also looked at better

    detection of irrigated lands jointly using S1 and S2 along

    with meteorological time series to improve crop irrigation

    management. The study was conducted over 2 years in a

    temperate area to detect rainfed plots. Monthly data was

    cumulated, provided by satellite imaging to be readily used

    in Random Forest Classiﬁer. Through the combined use of

    S1 (radar), S2 (optical), and meteorological (weather) time-

    series data, the study showed signiﬁcant improvement in both

    classiﬁcations of irrigated crops and mapping of irrigated areas.

    Detecting newer irrigated lands, in turn, leads to agricultural

    production increasing, since there is a protentional for more

    availability of water.

    Gao et al. (2018) formulated a synergetic technique using S1

    and S2 for mapping soil moisture and irrigated areas. The paper

    developed an algorithm using the Water Cloud Model (WCM)

    to spatialize the soil water content between 2015 and 2017. Along

    with WCM, a decision tree approach using statistical indices

    of soil humidity and Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation Index

    (NDVI) was used to classify irrigation maps at individual ﬁelds.

    By analyzing the moisture content of the soil to classify irrigation

    lands, the resources are better allocated for farms.

    The research of Bousbih et al. (2018) was based on high-

    dimensional automated algorithm satellite imaging for better

    mapping to achieve precise management of diﬀerent agricultural

    sectors. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to identify

    irrigated areas based on parameters of soil moisture such as

    mean and variance. The model was tested in Tunisia, and the

    research concluded that classiﬁcation based on soil moisture

    3.3.5. Decision support systems (DSS) to

    mitigate fertilizer-based loss

    The nodes Meza-Palacios et al. (2020) and Zhang et al.

    (2021), as named in Table 10, have LCS and GCS of (0,

    3) and (1, 2), respectively, both having a low score due to

    the publications being recent. Zhang et al. (2021) utilized a

    new structure consisting of analytical hierarchy (AHP) and

    modiﬁed analytical hierarchy methods (MAHP) along with

    metaheuristic optimization techniques to ascertain the optimum

    rate of nitrogen while considering the capacity and requirement

    constraints. Such DSS was designated to satisfy both farmers

    by generating high proﬁts and the environmental experts by

    keeping pollution low.

    Meza-Palacios et al. (2020) focused on increasing the yield

    of sugarcane by increasing the eﬃciency of fertilizer rates. The

    research proposed a (DSS) based on two fuzzy models, the

    edaphic condition model and NPK fertilization model, for a

    better NPK (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium) fertilization

    rate. Such DSS models enable farmers to ensure that they meet

    the safety standards of minimizing the impact on climate and

    human health.

    3.3.6. Sustainable agriculture using machine

    learning (ML) techniques

    The nodes Hamrani et al. (2020) and Abbasi et al. (2021),

    as named in Table 11, have LCS and GCS of (0,0) and (1,10),

    respectively. All three papers looked at the application of

    the ML approach to overcome environmental problems, to

    achieve sustainable agriculture. Abbasi et al. (2021) used ML

    algorithms to model carbon dioxide emissions from inorganic

    fertilizers. The paper looked at six diﬀerent models, viz., random

    forest (RF), Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN), Radial

    Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), Extreme Learning

    Machine (ELM), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection

    Operator (LASSO), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The

    paper retained the same input parameters, compared the output

    of the diﬀerent models, and found that RF was the best model for

    predicting carbon dioxide emission from IF. Likewise, Hamrani

    et al. (2020) also compared three additional ML models,

    the LSTM method.

    The research papers in this research stream looked at

    diﬀerent ML models to analyze which are useful in predicting

    greenhouse gas emissions from the soil. The outcome of the

    research stream supports the agriculture 4.0 goals of adapting

    to climate change.

    3.4. Application of DSS in smart

    agriculture

    The four areas that agriculture 4.0 looks to address are

    directly related to accurate decision-making, and researchers

    are designing and implementing Decision Support Systems

    (DSS) to optimize crop productivity while addressing them.

    Articles with the following keywords were ﬁltered: Decision

    Support System (DSS), optimization, and simulation. From the

    resultant 238 articles, those which addressed the four areas of

    Agriculture 4.0 were ﬁltered to highlight the models they applied

    in smart agriculture. Table 12 discusses the application of DSS in

    smart agriculture.

    Researchers have used a wide variety of methods to

    design DSS to support farmers for better decision-making.

    Recio et al. (2003) utilized the application of the advanced

    decision-making tool AgriSupport II system to enhance the

    agriculture production processes. The AgriSupport II system

    provided farmers with decision-making solutions to improve

    operations like operating cost, proﬁtability analysis, scheduling,

    and resource allocation. CPLEX optimizer was used to design

    a model algorithm that would ensure optimum decision-

    making suggestions by computing all feasible modes and then

    performing a comparative analysis of all modes to suggest the

    mode that is the least costly for agricultural task allocations.

    By adopting the AgriSupport II system, farmers are assisted

    in achieving higher eﬃciency at the least investment cost,

    consequently enhancing agricultural production, which is one

    of the requirements of Agriculture 4.0.

    Conesa-Muñoz et al. (2016) and Nabaei et al. (2018)

    both looked at using multi-robot sensing systems to allocate

    agricultural work to appropriate robotic units. The multi-

    sensing system was tested multiple times on a Spanish farm,

    using both aerial and ground units, to assist farmers in the

    optimal distribution of tasks. Both used the metaheuristic

    optimization method for ground planning through Harmony

    Search Algorithm. The multi-robot system collected agricultural

    data using aerial vehicles controlled by a Mission Manager,

    which was connected to a Base Station Computer. The system

    assigned agricultural tasks to the most appropriate robotic unit,

    allowing farmers to supervise and manage the entire process

    through a multi-robot sensing system, a decision-making tool

    for task allocation. Accurate imaging data collected can also

    inform farmers about how much herbicides or pesticides are

    needed for the crops. Such systems can act as essential supports

    for Agriculture 4.0.

    With the increase in the deployment of Aerial Unmanned

    Vehicle (UAV) in various applications, including agriculture,

    Alsalam et al. (2017) designed an onboard DSS system to detect

    the precise location of crops with disease and then delegate

    appropriate action to UAV, such as precise herbicide spray.

    Through the assistance of the Object-Based Image Analysis

    (OBIA) algorithm, the use of UAV can increase eﬃciency in

    work with precise crop detection and management of toxic

    damage on farms.

    Within the scope of route planning, Keller et al. (2007) and

    Bochtis et al. (2012) constructed Agriculture Decision Support

    System (DSS) to optimize the deployment and utilization of

    agricultural vehicles in ﬁelds with sensitive soil. The B-pattern

    optimization algorithm was used as a tool to provide an optimal

    route. Route planning and optimization enable vehicles to

    consume less energy and cause less damage to sensitive soil. This

    will enhance crop productivity, which supports the agriculture

    4.0 requirement. Most current research for the application

    of Agriculture Decision Support Systems (ADDS) for water

    resource management is related more to irrigation management.

    For example, Navarro-Hellín et al. (2016) designed a smart

    irrigation decision support system (SIDSS) for better irrigation

    planning through better, eﬃcient, and accurate use of water

    resources. The research looked at predicting the water needs

    of the crops for better irrigation planning. Partial Least

    Squares (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Interference Systems

    (ANFIS) were used to provide reasoning results to generate the

    decision support system requirement.

    Other authors, such as Giusti and Marsili-Libelli (2015),

    used fuzzy DSS (FDSS) using the IRRINET model to improve

    irrigation practices on farms. Similar to the ﬁnding of Navarro-

    Hellin, such fuzzy DSS assist farmers by using a predictive model

    and inference system of soil properties for better allocation

    through daily water scheduling. Fuzzy C-Mean algorithms were

    used to generate a decision support system for farmers by

    suggesting the amount of water the crops require to remain

    irrigated. Through better and smart management of irrigation

    of crops, the research supported Agriculture 4.0.

    Current researchers are also addressing climate change

    through better farming adaptability using ADSS (El-Sharkawy,

    2014; Weller et al., 2016). Schütze and Schmitz (2010) proposed

    a methodology, Stochastic Crop-Water Production Function

    (SCWPF), to quantify the eﬀect of climate change on irrigation

    in agriculture. The proposed DSS was tested on farms in

    France, and it was concluded that the OCCASION model

    formulated enabled farmers with adequate data on weather and

    soil properties to evaluate the potential eﬀect of climate change

    on farms, and OCCASION can be used to adjust decisions

    for irrigation scheduling and planning. Wenkel et al. (2013)

    presented an interactive DSS named LandCaRe, which was

    tested in Germany, and experimental ﬁndings showed that this

    system could be used to predict weather conditions and the

    extent of periods of vegetation. LandCaRe DSS can provide

    farmers with optimal decisions for improved farming practices

    under climate change.

    3.5. Thematic map

    The structure of the thematic map is generated by

    bibliometrix based on the clustering of the frequency of the

    repeated occurrences of keywords, and these clusters are known

    to be themes. Bibliometrix utilizes a thematic map to outline the

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    12

    frontiersin.org

    Yousaf et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.1053921

    conceptual framework of the research topics. A thematic map

    enables four diﬀerent typologies of topics to be identiﬁed based

    on which quadrant they are in. The motor themes are the motifs

    in the upper-right quadrant. They are distinguished by a high

    degree of centralization and density, indicating that they have

    been developed and are important in the ﬁeld of research.

    The highly developed and isolated motifs, also known

    as niche themes, are found in the upper-left quadrant.

    They have matured internal links with high density but

    insigniﬁcant outward links and hence are of little signiﬁcance

    in the ﬁeld (low centrality). Emerging or declining motifs

    appear in the lower-left quadrant. They have a low density

    and centrality, indicating that they are underdeveloped and

    peripheral. Basic and transversal themes are found in the lower-

    right quadrant and have a high degree of centralization and

    low density.

    These themes are signiﬁcant for a study ﬁeld and cover

    general topics relevant to all research areas of the ﬁeld (della

    Corte et al., 2019). As shown in Figure 5, thematic mapping

    allows the mapping of four diﬀerent themes of research.

    Keyword Plus was used as it allows the capture of an article’s

    features with greater depth. The thematic map is based on two

    axes, one indicating the centrality or relevance of the keyword,

    and the other, the density or the degree of development.

    Cluster #1 (C1) and Cluster #2 (C2) are both within

    the motor themes, where C2 is more central and less dense

    compared to C2. The higher central aspect of C1 indicates that

    the articles published within the scope of agriculture, article, and

    classiﬁcation are concerned more with crop classiﬁcation.

    Some of the recent publications within C1 focus on digital

    soil mapping (Lagacherie et al., 2022), an intelligence-based

    approach for agricultural soil prediction (Nguyen et al., 2022),

    AI-based apple leaf disease classiﬁcation (Al-Wesabi et al.,

    2022), and simulating various water-deﬁcit regimes for irrigation

    scheduling optimization (Martínez-Valderrama et al., 2020).

    Recent publications indicate that C1 is more inclined toward

    procedures and classiﬁcation of multiple aspects of agriculture

    segments. C2, which is also within the motor theme quadrant, is

    of higher density, indicating more research development in the

    ﬁeld of crops, AI, and decision support systems compared to C1.

    About 37% of the total articles collected are within the scope of

    C2, and the recent publications merge closely with C1.

    Cluster #3 (C3) and Cluster #4 (C4) are within the emerging

    or declining themes. Some of the recent articles in C3 discuss

    mapping land suitability (Carlier et al., 2021), soil prediction

    using AI (Nguyen et al., 2022), and modeling spatial dynamics

    (Sodango et al., 2021). While some articles in C4 are of emerging

    nature, including the combined use of machine learning

    algorithms and UAV (Ndlovu et al., 2021; Onishi and Ise, 2021;

    Qiu et al., 2021), machine vision yield monitoring (Dolata et al.,

    2021), artiﬁcial neural networks for crop evapotranspiration

    estimation (Gao et al., 2021), and usage of machine learning for

    crop prediction (Almeida et al., 2021).

    While there was no cluster within the niche or isolated

    theme, all four clusters are shown to be interlinked through

    the cross-collaboration of work between diﬀerent subject

    areas. The overall thematic map demonstrates that newer areas

    of study within agriculture are turning toward precision

    agriculture

    through

    precise

    modeling

    and

    estimating

    of maps, soil, evapotranspiration, etc., using newer and

    advanced technologies.

    4. Gaps, future work, and insights

    The comprehensive bibliometric analysis of OR in smart

    agriculture revealed some gaps and future directions, which are

    listed below:

    1. Precision Agriculture focuses on the application of IoT to

    achieve precise farming practices. IoT has mainly been used

    to achieve optimization of conventional farming systems,

    and such optimization models are included within the DSS

    to assist farmers in making better decisions. The Decision

    Sciences database covers 2% of the total material collected

    from the Scopus database. Research within this scope was

    inclined toward better task allocation or vehicle route

    planning to assist farmers in better utilizing robotic units

    in agriculture. Most such research used complex algorithms

    such as metaheuristic algorithm, B-pattern algorithm, and

    OBIA algorithm. The DSS was initially focused toward

    applying OR theories to achieve better resource allocations

    through route planning (Keller et al., 2007; Bochtis et al.,

    2012), and recent papers have also focused on resource

    allocation but through the application of robotic units for

    better task allocations (Conesa-Muñoz et al., 2016; Nabaei

    et al., 2018) and water management for irrigation planning

    (Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015; Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016).

    The application of DSS allows farmers to make better

    decisions for better farming; however, these methods are

    mostly limited to resource allocation, and there is a lack of

    research to address climate change, increase the productivity

    of the farms, or reduce agriculture waste. Moreover, there

    was a lack of research that utilized mathematical optimization

    programming, such as linear programming (LP), mixed

    integer programming (MIP), dynamic programming (DP),

    and Stochastic Programming (SP). Future research needs to

    incorporate such techniques to allow farmers to not only

    practice smart agriculture but also make decisions from the

    business perspective of enhancing proﬁtability by reducing

    food waste.

    2. Machine Learning (ML) and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI)

    application in agriculture were heavily inclined toward

    probability and statistics. As the world is facing water issues,

    an essential component of farming, much of satellite imaging

    methods were applied toward mapping and detecting

    irrigation lands (Deines et al., 2017; Ketchum et al., 2020;

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    13

    frontiersin.org

    Yousaf et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.1053921

    FIGURE 5

    Thematic map.

    Pageot et al., 2020; Bazzi et al., 2021), mostly using the

    Random Forest (RF) classiﬁers and at times Water Cloud

    Model (WCM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). While

    one of the recent papers (Abbasi et al., 2021) compared

    multiple AI and ML methods, such as FNN, RBFNN, and

    SVM, to draw the conclusion that the RF modeling method

    was optimum to be the application of prediction of carbon

    dioxide emission. Such development within the ﬁeld of ML

    and AI in agriculture demonstrates that future research is

    more focused on statistics and probability aspects of OR

    theories. One primary reason could be that climate change

    is causing unforeseen disruptions in agriculture productivity,

    and in order to bring resilience to farming practices, such

    theories are needed to predict the unforeseen circumstances

    to better overcome the risks. However, such methods can

    be capital intensive as the application of ML and AI on

    large data sets require a powerful machine to conduct

    computation, and also the computation times are lengthy.

    Researchers are employing advanced knowledge of AI and

    ML to enable farmers to mostly for better resource allocation

    and sometimes for adapting to climate change or increasing

    productivity. There is less focus on overcoming agriculture

    wastage, which is one of the main pillars of Smart Agriculture.

    This hints at the need for further research in terms of

    optimization of agriculture wastages in order to overcome

    this large research gap. Moreover, according to thematic

    analysis, the articles within C4 highlighted that future streams

    are expected to involve more complex OR theories, AI and

    ML streams, with the combination of ML algorithms and

    UAV (Ndlovu et al., 2021; Onishi and Ise, 2021; Qiu et al.,

    2021) to optimize the productivity, and continue to apply ML

    for prediction and estimation in crop management (Almeida

    et al., 2021; Q. Gao et al., 2018). Such complex application

    of OR is hinting toward future involving the analysis of large

    data sets to meet Agriculture 4.0 goals.

    3. The major research gap lies in most of the OR theories

    being applied to conventional farming systems to make them

    smarter and more automated. For example, some research

    papers looked at providing optimal decision parameters for

    farmers for better resource allocation using robots (Conesa-

    Muñoz et al., 2016; Nabaei et al., 2018), while others

    looked at the use of sensors with fuzzy models (Krishnan

    et al., 2020; Meza-Palacios et al., 2020), RF (Abbasi et al.,

    2021), and LSTM (Hamrani et al., 2020) to optimize crop

    yields and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, some

    papers designed DSS for improved irrigation management

    (papers), while others used satellite imagery to detect or

    extend irrigation lands (papers). While such papers utilize

    Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems

    14

    frontiersin.org

    Yousaf et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.1053921

    the application of IoT and ML, however, they are mainly

    being addressed toward optimizing traditional farming

    systems. About 1.5 and 1% of the total material collected

    addressed the application of OR in vertical farming and

    plant factories, respectively. With the introduction of newer

    farming methods such as vertical farms and plant factories to

    accommodate countries that do not have conditions suitable

    for agriculture, there is the prospect for future research in

    the application of newer OR theories in these newer farming

    methods to achieve agriculture 4.0 goals.

    5. Conclusion

    5.1. Discussions of ﬁndings

    Research on Operations Research (OR) application in

    smart agriculture is increasing. The literature review aids in

    understanding the links and advancement of a research ﬁeld

    and provides insights into the activities of scholars. However,

    the inherent subjectivity of narrative and systematic reviews is

    reduced by bibliometric analyses.

    Our study explored the operations research knowledge

    applied to smart agriculture. In this context, we conducted a

    descriptive analysis to describe how research is increasing. It has

    been clear that since 2017, research has dramatically increased,

    as newer knowledge in the Internet of Things (IoT), artiﬁcial

    intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) approaches is

    being enhanced for better application in smart agriculture. This

    has been further validated by conducting a keyword analysis.

    Then, historical analysis was also conducted by generating

    historiography to check how some of the research streams

    had evolved and what the current research publications are

    focused on. It was noted that the major focus was on statistics

    and prediction to achieve precise agriculture. This was further

    supported through thematic mapping, where it was noticed

    that emerging research was focusing on agricultural land use

    mapping through satellite imaging, along with agricultural

    robotics and remote sensing.

    Further, articles within the scope of decision support system

    (DSS) in smart agriculture were perused within the scope of

    Agriculture 4.0 requirements. It was apparent that DSS models

    were more inclined toward better allocation of resources using

    smart technology; however, recent articles seem to be adopting

    the climate change agenda (Hamrani et al., 2020; Abbasi et al.,

    2021; Zhang et al., 2021).

    Future research, according to thematic mapping, has

    shown that ML and AI applications are moving toward more

    complexity as complex OR theories are being combined. While

    most current research and the future streams within ML

    and AI scope are inclined toward probability and statistics

    to predict and estimate for reasons such as prediction of

    crops or evapotranspiration, and other reasons include adapting

    to climate change. However, there was lesser focus toward

    optimizing agriculture farms through reducing or reusing

    wastage. Moreover, RF applications of OR were more readily

    adopted for agriculture or irrigation mapping using satellite

    imaging. With the increase in the sophisticated nature of ML and

    AI, the future of OR is moving toward data sciences.

    It was noted that most applications of ML and AI, with OR

    theories, were being applied to conventional farming systems.

    As food security and climate change are starting to become

    more important, and countries that have arid climate conditions,

    there is a prospect and need to apply OR theories within newer

    farming methods. And since such newer farming methods, such

    as vertical farms or plant factories, usually involve sensors to

    control the environment, there is a scope to apply the current

    and past OR theories within conventional farming systems that

    involve sensors, robotic units and UAV.

    Finally,

    as

    the

    population

    is

    expected

    to

    increase

    drastically over the coming years, the agri-food demand

    is

    correspondingly

    expected

    to

    increase,

    and

    in

    order

    to

    achieve

    greater

    food

    security

    and

    a

    resilient

    agri-

    food

    supply

    chain,

    future

    research

    needs

    to

    utilize

    optimization

    and

    simulation

    techniques

    to

    reduce

    food

    waste, ensure better food security, and optimize agricultural

    resources to increase productivity within both precision

    and smart agriculture, and to meet agriculture 4.0 goals

    more holistically.

    5.2. Theoretical implications

    Our comprehensive bibliometric analysis within the scope

    of OR applications in Smart Agriculture oﬀers valuable

    information to multiple stakeholders, including researchers,

    decision makers, and consultants, who can understand and

    visualize how OR theories are being applied in diﬀerent areas

    of Smart Agriculture to optimize and design DSS. Moreover,

    as sustainability and climate change are taking center stage in

    research, researchers will be able to understand how AI, IoT

    and ML methods within Smart Agriculture are being applied to

    overcome and mitigate climate change concerns. Moreover, our

    research has demonstrated improving productivity and reducing

    agricultural waste to meet Smart Agriculture goals are areas

    of less focus, and this will motivate researchers to increase

    their area of study to overcome this gap. While researchers

    have been highly concentric toward irrigation planning between

    the years 2014 and 2015, newer research is focusing toward

    agriculture mapping and classiﬁcation, and such future direction

    will also allow the researcher to apply their current knowledge

    in this ﬁeld. Last but not least, the holistic overview of literature

    between the years 2000–2022 will certainly give researchers and

    multiple stakeholders the visual map of how research within the

    scope of OR in Smart Agriculture is evolving and what are the

    trending topics and the research gaps.

    15

    frontiersin.org

    Yousaf et al.

    10.3389/fsufs.2022.1053921

    5.3. Practical implications

    Nations that do not have suitable conditions for agricultural

    farming would have their governments trying to understand

    how they can make their current farming practices eﬃcient

    and responsive in order to meet the increasing agri-food

    demand. Our bibliometric analysis, speciﬁcally the application

    of DSS in Smart Agriculture, would give some examples of how

    governments can optimize and regulate their limited resources,

    such as water, through irrigation mapping. Furthermore, as our

    bibliometric analysis is demonstrating a drastic increase in the

    publication within the ﬁeld of OR in Smart Agriculture and

    the application of UAV and robotic units, governments will see

    the need to introduce policies to regulate the farms to ensure

    the safety of people and the environment is being maintained.

    Stakeholders who are not aware of the application of UAV

    and robotic units through the use of IoT and AI for better

    resource allocation will feel inclined toward adopting these

    methods to their farms. One of the major practical implications

    lies in understanding that most literature papers focus on OR

    theories in traditional farming methods. To the best of our

    knowledge, there are few or negligible literature papers that

    apply OR theories toward newer agricultural methods such

    as hydroponics, a part of vertical farming, plant factories or

    urban agriculture. Such lack of literature focus would indicate

    that governments and researchers would feel the need to adopt

    AI and IoT to make newer agricultural methods to Smart

    Agriculture and then apply OR theories to optimize them in

    order to meet Smart Agriculture or Agriculture 4.0 goals.

    5.4. Limitations of bibliometric analysis

    Even though our attempt to understand a holistic overview

    of OR theories in Smart Agriculture through bibliometric

    analysis has given signiﬁcant contributions, this review has

    some limitations that needs to be addressed when reading

    the results. One of the major shortcomings is that we only

    considered the Scopus database, and our articles of selection

    were limited to keywords and titles only. Future research should

    consider other databases, such as the Web of Science and

    integrate the ﬁndings with our results to provide a further

    overview of the OR theories being applied in Smart Agriculture.

    Moreover, if possible, future research should try to include

    Abstracts within the Scopus database search to capture more

    literature for a deeper bibliometric analysis. Our research mainly

    attempted to understand what are the current OR applications

    in Smart Agriculture during historical analysis, and future

    research should increase the span of historical analysis through

    increasing the node above 40 on Bibliometrix to generate

    more research streams and trends. While Smart Agriculture

    is a wide ﬁeld, future research may also incorporate how OR

    theories are being applied speciﬁcally in livestock, soil and

    water management through changing the keyword algorithms

    to incline the literature search to be more subject matter. Finally,

    as newer farming methods will be coming to light, future

    researchers should conduct a bibliometric analysis on how OR

    theories are being used within hydroponic, urban agriculture, or

    plant factories.

    \ in which human needs grow exponentially ac-\ncording to the increasing world\
    \ population, the advent of new technologies plays a fundamental\nrole in all\
    \ ﬁelds of industry, especially in agriculture. Optimizing times, automating machines,\
    \ and\nguaranteeing product quality are key objectives in the ﬁeld of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0, which integrates\nvarious innovative technologies to meet the needs of\
    \ producers and consumers while guaranteeing\nrespect for the environment and\

    \ system using data coming from an innovative experimental atmospheric and forecast-\n\
    ing simulator (capable of predicting some characteristic climate variables subsequently\
    \ validated\nwith local sensors), combined with indices deriving from Remote Sensing\
    \ and UAV images (treated\nwith the data fusion method), that can give fundamental\
    \ information related to Agriculture 4.0 with\nparticular reference to the subsequent\
    \ phases of system automation. These data, in fact, can be\ncollected in an open-source\
    \ GIS capable of displaying areas that need irrigation and fertilization and,\n\
    moreover, establishing the path of an automated drone for the monitoring of the\

    \ of interest.\nKeywords: atmospheric simulator; unmanned aerial vehicles; satellite\
    \ imagery; remote sensing;\ngeomatic techniques\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0 consists of an upgrade of the usual farming techniques and has the\nscope\
    \ to create a more sustainable and efﬁcient agriculture system that can produce\
    \ higher\nyields while minimizing the impact on the environment. By using advanced\
    \ technolo-\ngies, farmers can make more informed decisions, reduce waste, and\
    \ optimize resource\nutilization, leading to a more sustainable and proﬁtable\
    \ agriculture industry. Agriculture\n4.0 encompasses the advancement of precision\
    \ farming and refers to all agricultural actions\nthat are based on a precise\
    \ and accurate analysis of data and information acquired and\ntransferred using\
    \ advanced tools and technology. This refers to the tools and techniques\nthat\
    \ allow for the synergistic use of a variety of digital 4.0 technologies, allowing\
    \ for the\nautomatic collection, integration, and analysis of data collected from\
    \ the ﬁeld, sensors, or\nother third-party sources. Agriculture 4.0 refers to\
    \ the application of the Internet of Things\n(IoT), Big Data, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ and robotics to extend, accelerate, and improve the\nefﬁciency of operations\
    \ affecting the entire production chain [1].\nSome innovations are:\n•\nProcess\
    \ automation: thanks to the use of drones and sensors, it is possible to monitor\n\
    crops throughout their growth phase, as well as check the state of well-being\
    \ or the\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5, 1280–1301. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriengineering5030081\n\

    need to irrigate and fertilize the soil. There are countless beneﬁts associated\
    \ with\ndrones in the context of the agricultural industry. In fact, they can\
    \ be of help to farmers\nin acquiring data on the state of stress of plants and\
    \ observing the movements of\nlivestock, but they can also allow the identiﬁcation\
    \ of diseases in plants and animals,\nallowing timely interventions.\n•\nThe use\
    \ of GIS: thanks to this software that can integrate data of different natures,\n\
    it is possible to efﬁciently determine (according to different parameters such\
    \ as soil\npH, temperature, and humidity) the position of the crops, the land\
    \ use, and the need\nfor fertilization and irrigation. It is also possible to\
    \ carry out an analysis of historical\ndata to provide farmers with tools that\
    \ allow them to choose the best conditions for\ntheir crops.\nOf fundamental importance\
    \ is the sustainable management of the environment and\nthe planet’s resources,\
    \ including water. As is known, intelligent consumption of this\nresource is essential\
    \ in the ﬁeld of agriculture, [2]. Moreover, there are many studies\ncarried out\
    \ on the automation of agricultural vehicles and the monitoring of crops and\n\
    livestock. The advent of robotics in agriculture has allowed numerous beneﬁts,\
    \ including\nan increase in productivity, the acceleration of operations in the\
    \ procedures related to the\nmaintenance of cultivation, as well as safety during\
    \ production processes and precision in\nthe analysis of the possible interventions\
    \ to be carried out to optimize the harvest [3,4]. The\nGIS (Geographic Information\
    \ System) is a crucial tool frequently utilized in the realm of\nAgriculture 4.0.\
    \ It has numerous applications, particularly in precision agriculture, such as\n\
    assessing the potential of agricultural waste to generate bioenergy [5]. Particularly\
    \ useful\nare open-source GISs that allow for the implementation of internal functions\
    \ (including\nforecasting ones) useful in various application ﬁelds, also allowing\
    \ interaction with external\ntechnologies in real time. As it is known, diverse\
    \ data types can be incorporated into the\nGIS, including free satellite data,\
    \ although many of these data are limited due to their\nlow resolution. As a result,\
    \ higher spatial and temporal resolution multispectral UAV\nimages must be combined\
    \ with this data to resolve this limitation. To address the issue of\nintegrating\
    \ non-uniform data, data fusion techniques are frequently employed [6,7]. So,\n\
    in the literature, extensive studies could be found regarding the technologies,\
    \ materials,\nalgorithms, and protocols involved in this research, but less could\
    \ be found regarding their\nintegration. The present research ﬁts into this context\
    \ by proposing as the main novelty\nthe use of an atmospheric experimental simulator\
    \ capable of providing punctual variables,\nwhich, together with local sensor\
    \ data and the data fusion of satellite and drone images, are\nall managed by\
    \ an open-source GIS capable of estimating fundamental parameters related\nto\
    \ the cultivation and automation of agricultural vehicles. This estimation is\
    \ in the frame\nof a strategic management of crops through the identiﬁcation of\
    \ local optimal cultivation\ntypologies and the automation of optimal ﬁeld route\
    \ planning for both self-driving tractors\nand UAVs, which is further useful for\
    \ tactical in-season crop monitoring to guide crop\nirrigation and fertilization\
    \ management.\n2. Materials and Methods\nDuring experimentations, in order to\
    \ identify areas that best ﬁt the different possible\ntypologies of cultivation\
    \ and to plan the routes of both self-driving tractors and UAVs, we\nhave used\
    \ different systems, algorithms, and methodologies structured and integrated\n\
    with each other as schematically shown in the ﬂow diagram in Figure 1. Referred\
    \ to in\nmore detail:\n•\nAn open-source GIS, in particular the open-source QGIS;\n\
    •\nan innovative and experimental atmospheric simulator;\n•\nsatellite and UAV\
    \ images,\n•\nlocal sensors;\n•\nalgorithms and protocols for data transmission.\n\
    AgriEngineering 2023, 5\n1282\nFigure 1. Flow diagram developed in the frame of\
    \ Agriculture 4.0 concept illustrating the method-\nological scheme and the different\
    \ integrated systems, algorithms, and methodologies aiming to\nidentify areas\
    \ that best ﬁt the different possible typologies of cultivation and to plan the\
    \ optimal\nroutes of both self-driving tractors and UAVs as ﬁnal products of the\
    \ built strategic management\nsystem for crop irrigation and fertilization.\n\
    Firstly, the atmospheric simulator (using as inputs the Digital Elevation Model\
    \ (DEM)\nof the territory, weather sensor data, radar data, and very large-scale\
    \ weather models) was\nused to obtain, as outputs, the punctual values of some\
    \ characteristic weather variables:\nprecipitation, wind, pressure, and temperature,\
    \ which were subsequently reprocessed to\nobtain DEM layers of these variables.\
    \ (Weather variables such as precipitation, wind, pres-\nsure, and temperature\
    \ are important for Agriculture 4.0 because they directly inﬂuence the\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions that can have an impact on crops. Precipitation is crucial for the\n\
    water supply of plants; wind can affect growth and disease spread; atmospheric\
    \ pressure\nprovides information about imminent climatic changes; and temperature\
    \ inﬂuences plant\ngrowth and maturation). The validation of the results obtained\
    \ was performed through\nthe combination of different ground truth devices: local\
    \ sensors (soil moisture sensor, leaf\nwetness sensor, pH sensor, temperature\
    \ and humidity sensor, and barometric pressure\nsensor), using wireless sensor\
    \ network nodes (WSNn). This WSN was supported with the\nZigBee protocol (Texas\
    \ Instruments, Dallas, TX, USA), an ATmega128L microcontroller\n(Microchip Technology\
    \ Inc., Chandler, AZ, USA), and a solar cell module (Canadian Solar,\nGuelph,\
    \ ON, Canada) with the aim of collecting information from various sensors and\n\
    passing the information to a cloud server. Through the data fusion technique [8],\
    \ we have\ncombined satellite data and UAV images to establish important indices\
    \ used as an indica-\ntion of vegetation richness and to capture soil differences:\
    \ NDVI (normalized difference\nvegetation index), LST (land surface temperature),\
    \ NDMI (normalized difference moisture\nindex), and BSI (bare soil index). In\
    \ particular, the satellite images used are:\n•\nSentinel-2, Level 2A: Level 2A\
    \ of Sentinel-2 processing includes a scene classiﬁcation\nand an atmospheric\
    \ correction applied to Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) Level-1C or-\nthoimage products.\
    \ Level-2A’s main output is an orthoimage bottom-of-atmosphere\n(BOA) corrected\
    \ reﬂectance product.\n•\nWorldView-3: capable of acquiring images at 31 cm panchromatic,\
    \ 1.24 m multispec-\ntral, 3.7 m shortwave infrared, and 30 m CAVIS (clouds, aerosols,\
    \ vapors, ice, and\nsnow) resolution.\nAs regards UAV images, a Micasense Altum\
    \ Camera was used to capture multispectral\nphotos with a DJI Matrice 600 Pro.\
    \ This camera is ideal for agricultural use since it can\ncollect photos of crops\
    \ in both visible and infrared wavelengths at the same time. The drone\nﬂew around\
    \ 30 m above the ground, producing aerial GSD photos with a resolution of 5 cm.\n\
    All this information was processed by the GIS, which estimates the optimal automation\n\
    AgriEngineering 2023, 5\n1283\nparameters and those relating to the cultivable\
    \ areas. In particular, the algorithms used to\nidentify the cultivable areas\
    \ are as follows:\n1.\nSpatial data analysis algorithms, in particular buffering,\
    \ intersection, overlay, and\nclustering analysis, are useful for identifying\
    \ areas of interest, evaluating the proximity\nof climatic data, sensor data,\
    \ and DEM data, and carrying out comparative analyses\nbetween different areas.\n\
    2.\nRaster analysis algorithms to extract information from raster data such as\
    \ DEM and\nNDVI by calculating terrain statistics and identifying speciﬁc slope\
    \ or elevation areas\nthat are best suited for certain crops.\n3.\nSupervised\
    \ classiﬁcation algorithms such as random forest, support vector machine\n(SVM),\
    \ and neural networks to classify image data to determine crop typology and\n\
    to build a predictive model. These algorithms are available as plugins or additional\n\
    extensions that can be installed and used within the QGIS environment.\nIn relation\
    \ to the algorithms used for tractor automation, QGIS includes a number of\ntools\
    \ and algorithms that can be used to perform routing analysis and route planning\
    \ and\nalso supports the use of additional plugins and integration with other\
    \ tools and libraries\nthat offer advanced routing and route optimization features.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the “Network\nAnalysis Library (NAl)” and “pgRouting” plugins were\
    \ used to perform advanced routing\nanalysis within QGIS. These plugins offer\
    \ optimized routing algorithms that take into\naccount factors such as obstacles,\
    \ speed constraints, and speciﬁc preferences to calculate\noptimal routes, always\
    \ keeping in mind the necessary use of GPS for positioning and\nreferenced cartography\
    \ for displaying the position.\nAs regards the parameters, the output parameters\
    \ for identifying the cultivable areas\nare as follows:\n1.\nCrop classiﬁcation\
    \ map: Using the supervised or unsupervised classiﬁcation algo-\nrithms, it was\
    \ possible to generate a crop classiﬁcation map that assigns the estimated\ncrop\
    \ type to each area of the study area.\n2.\nCrop suitability assessment: Based\
    \ on the analysis of climate data, local sensor data,\nDEM, and NDVI, it was possible\
    \ to generate a crop suitability assessment for the\nstudy area.\n3.\nAnalysis\
    \ of environmental characteristics: The analysis of climate data, local sensor\n\
    data, DEM, and NDVI provided information on the environmental characteristics\
    \ of\nthe study area, including maps of temperature, precipitation, soil moisture,\
    \ and soil\npH, which have been used to evaluate the adaptability of crops to\
    \ local environmen-\ntal conditions.\n4.\nAnalysis report: They included statistics\
    \ on the prevailing crops, indicators of crop\nsuitability, analyses of environmental\
    \ characteristics, and other relevant information\nfor determining the type of\
    \ cultivation in the study area.\n5.\nTabular output data: In addition to the\
    \ maps and reports, tabular output data have\nbeen produced, which reports detailed\
    \ information on the study area.\nIn relation to the automation of the tractor,\
    \ the output parameters are GPS coordinates\n(in real time), driving routes (to\
    \ maximize operation efﬁciency), speed control (to ensure\nsafe and efﬁcient driving),\
    \ sensor monitoring (to detect any obstacles, avoid collisions\nand efﬁciently\
    \ manage the resources of the tractor), actuator control (to ensure precise\n\
    and smooth driving according to the routes and instructions provided), ground\
    \ condition\nmonitoring (to adapt the driving of the tractor, make decisions in\
    \ real time and to optimize\nthe use of resources), alarms and warnings (to alert\
    \ the operator or user in case of emergency\nsituations, unforeseen obstacles\
    \ or technical problems during automated driving), and\nperformance monitoring\
    \ (for operations management).\nThen, through Cannelloni software (written in\
    \ C++11 and capable of transferring CAN\nframes between two machines using UDP)\
    \ and a series of protocols (datagram protocol\n(UDP) or stream control transmission\
    \ protocol (SCTP), which are supported by Cannelloni\nsoftware. In some cases,\
    \ it is necessary to convert SCTP to the transmission control protocol\nAgriEngineering\
    \ 2023, 5\n1284\n(TCP)). The data are transmitted to the agricultural vehicle,\
    \ which will have the task of\nirrigating and fertilizing the area according to\
    \ the vegetation’s needs, and to the drone,\nwhich will have the task of monitoring\
    \ the existing cultivation. As a result, it is possible to\nvisualize the different\
    \ typologies on the GIS of areas suitable for cultivation related to land,\nwater,\
    \ and climate parameters.\n2.1. Geograﬁc Information System\nGeographic Information\
    \ System (GIS) technology is increasingly being used in agri-\nculture to help\
    \ farmers make better decisions and optimize their farming practices. GIS is a\n\
    system that allows for the capture, storage, analysis, and visualization of geographic\
    \ data,\nsuch as crop yields, soil characteristics, weather patterns, and other\
    \ relevant information.\nBy integrating this information with other data sources,\
    \ farmers can gain insights into their\noperations and make more informed decisions.\n\
    GIS can help farmers in various ways, such as:\n•\nLand use planning: GIS can\
    \ help farmers make informed decisions about the best\nuse of their land. It can\
    \ be used to analyze factors such as soil type, topography, and\nclimate to determine\
    \ the best species to crop in a particular area.\n•\nMarket analysis: it can be\
    \ used to analyze market trends and demand for certain crops.\n•\nDisaster management:\
    \ GIS can be used to monitor and respond to natural disasters\nsuch as ﬂoods,\
    \ droughts, and wildﬁres. By quickly identifying affected areas, farmers\ncan\
    \ take appropriate action to protect their crops and minimize losses.\nIn our\
    \ research, GIS plays a central role in the management of the information collected\n\
    from different sources and in the return of important information related to Agriculture\n\
    4.0. In fact, the choice of the optimal areas for cultivation depends on several\
    \ factors that\ncan affect the yield and quality of the crop, which include climate,\
    \ type of soil, irrigation,\ntopography, and market needs. In the following study,\
    \ QGIS (an open-source GIS) was\nused, which consists of software that allows\
    \ one to process, display, and analyze geographic\ndata such as maps, satellite\
    \ images, sensor data, etc., using the Python language. This\ntype of software,\
    \ which is entirely updatable, has therefore allowed the automation of the\nmanagement\
    \ of geographical data, the creation of customized scripts for data analysis,\
    \ and\nthe creation of customized tools for data visualization.\n2.2. Atmospheric\
    \ Simulator\nThe main novelty of this research is the use of an atmospheric simulator\
    \ [9] that,\nthrough a DEM and radar/sensor data, can provide important climate\
    \ information in rela-\ntion to the orographic characteristics of the land. This\
    \ article outlines the functioning of an\natmospheric simulator that has the ability\
    \ to generate highly detailed weather ﬁeld outputs\nwithin a restricted domain.\
    \ With minimal input, this software can produce outputs related\nto wind, temperature,\
    \ humidity, cloud cover, rain, and other atmospheric parameters for\ncubic cells\
    \ as small as 50 m. Unlike NWP (numerical weather prediction), the simulator’s\n\
    atmosphere microphysics is based on laws that regulate the interaction of a number\
    \ of\nparticles with which the atmosphere has been discretized. The latter, in\
    \ fact, consists of\na set of particles contained in the center of a cube (cells).\
    \ Each of these particles contains\nwithin it a speciﬁc quantity of gas, water,\
    \ and humidity from which its mass exchanges and\ninteractions with other particles\
    \ and the external environment are deﬁned. The particles\nwill be subjected to\
    \ a force derived from their energy state, from interaction with other\nparticles,\
    \ or from the surface.\nEssentially, the simulator emulates the behavior of the\
    \ Earth’s atmosphere as it relates\nto weather patterns and represents the state\
    \ of variation of the particles with which the\natmosphere has been discretized\
    \ and how they interact with each other. The simulation\nmodel incorporates two\
    \ solvers, L1 and L2, which work in tandem and process tasks at\na higher level.\
    \ These solvers translate the phenomena of the troposphere and vertical\nexchange\
    \ into a particle representation of the atmosphere.\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n\
    1285\n2.2.1. Solver 1\nSolver L1 is responsible for several tasks, including assigning\
    \ physical and chemical\nproperties to particles, applying forces to particles\
    \ based on their energy state from interac-\ntions with radiation and heat sinks,\
    \ assigning initial states to particles and environmental\nelements, dividing\
    \ the 3D domain into macro-clusters, and providing atomically referable\nforecast\
    \ ﬁelds for each. Real-time data or hypothetical values can be used as input.\n\
    2.2.2. Solver 2\nOn the other hand, Solver L2 is a Newtonian Simulator that utilizes\
    \ the values of force,\nmass, viscosity, and local density assigned by Solver\
    \ L1 to individual particles. It employs\na software library for ﬂuid modeling\
    \ called SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) [10]\nthat specializes in realistic\
    \ simulations of ﬂuids or gases within a few hundred meters.\nThe library is developed\
    \ by Nvidia, and the technology is called Nvidia PhysX. Solver\nL2 introduces\
    \ the forces attributed to the particles by L1 and initiates dynamic evolution\n\
    through PhysX using SPH Fluids rules. For instance, if there is local interpenetration\
    \ of cells\nat time t, repulsion forces come into play according to the represented\

    \ of the Simulator\nThe initialization of Solver L2 involves reading an ASCII\
    \ DEM that will serve as the\norographic domain of the simulation. The particles\
    \ are positioned uniformly on the scene\nand evolve until a point of stability\
    \ is reached. Solver L1 processes the initial conditions\nobtained from measurements,\
    \ such as sensors or radar, and provides directives for assigning\nforces, velocities,\
    \ and positions to particles in speciﬁc spatial volumes (clusters) to Solver\n\
    L2. L2 evolves by applying these directives for a speciﬁed time interval, and\
    \ Solver L1 is\ninformed of the new state of particles at the end of the evolution,\
    \ including their position,\nvelocity, density, and changes compared to the previous\
    \ state. Solver L1 then associates\nthe attributes provided by L2 with particle\
    \ and atmospheric state-related characteristics\nsuch as humidity and temperature.\
    \ The pattern detector (part of L1) creates clusters with\nhomogeneous atmospheric\
    \ characteristics such as cloud cover, rain, humidity, average\ntemperature, and\
    \ pressure from the states provided by Solver L2. The values referred to as\n\
    clusters are the output provided by the simulator.\nThe L1 now has the following\
    \ inputs, which are no longer initial conditions: Pattern\ndetector clusters,\

    coarse-scale boundary conditions, which are only required at the boundaries of\

    \ Satellite base map).\nSensors Used in the Study\nIn the study, ﬁve types of\
    \ sensors that measure important soil characteristics were\nmainly used: Soil\
    \ moisture sensor, leaf wetness sensor, pH sensor, temperature and hu-\nmidity\
    \ sensor, and barometric sensor. As is known, one of the limitations of using\
    \ point\nmeasurement sensors is their representativeness of soil or vegetation\
    \ parameter variability\nwithin a ﬁeld. In fact, point measurements provide information\
    \ at a speciﬁc location, but\nthey may not fully capture the spatial variability\
    \ of the parameters of interest. While\naware of the limitations, we have used\
    \ these local sensors because they have been useful to\nvalidate the reliability\
    \ of the model given by the atmospheric simulator.\nSoil moisture sensors are\
    \ commonly used in agriculture to help farmers determine\nwhen to irrigate their\
    \ crops, as overwatering can be costly and damaging to the crops, and\nunderwatering\
    \ can also be detrimental. They can also be used in landscaping to ensure that\n\
    plants are receiving the appropriate amount of water. Information given by the\
    \ soil Moisture\nSensor (we have used the TEROS 12 soil moisture sensor (Meter\
    \ Environment, Washington,\nDC, USA) is of fundamental importance in agriculture;\
    \ in fact, thanks to this instrument,\nfarmers can measure the volumetric water\
    \ content in the soil—which is the amount of water\npresent in the soil as a percentage\
    \ of the total volume of the soil—and manage the irrigation\nsystem in a productive\
    \ way. This type of sensor uses different technologies with which the\nAgriEngineering\
    \ 2023, 5\n1289\ncontent of water is measured indirectly through speciﬁc parameters\
    \ such as the dielectric\nconstant. As is known, there are two categories of soil\
    \ moisture sensors depending on the\ntechnology they use: sensors that measure\
    \ volumetric water content (VWC) and sensors\nthat measure soil tension when placed\
    \ in the soil proﬁle. Volumetric content is the volume\nof liquid water in the\
    \ soil, usually expressed as a percentage. Soil water tension indicates,\ninstead,\
    \ the energy required by plant roots to extract water from soil particles. As\
    \ soil\nwater is removed from the soil, soil tension increases. The three most\
    \ common types of soil\nmoisture sensors are:\n1.\nElectromagnetic sensors: The\
    \ most common electromagnetic sensors are capacitance\nsensors or frequency domain\
    \ reﬂectometry (FDR) sensors and time domain reﬂectom-\netry (TDR) sensors. These\
    \ sensors indirectly measure VWC based on the dielectric and\nelectric properties\
    \ of the soil medium (soil bulk permittivity or soil dielectric constant).\nThe\
    \ dielectric constant is a measure of the substance’s ability to store electrical\
    \ energy.\nSince soil particles, water, and air all have different dielectric\
    \ constants, their ability to\nstore or dissipate electrical energy is different.\n\
    2.\nCapacitance or frequency domain sensors: Typically, these sensors are in the\
    \ form of\ntwo parallel rods (two electrodes) or a pair of metal rings (two electrodes)\
    \ mounted\nalong the length of a PVC pipe. The capacitor along the length of the\
    \ PVC pipe allows\nsimultaneous measurements of soil moisture at different depths.\
    \ Portable capacitance\nprobes also allow measurements at several locations through\
    \ access tubes. When\nelectric current passes through these electrodes, they form\
    \ an electromagnetic ﬁeld\nin the soil. The probe measures the permittivity of\
    \ a soil medium by measuring the\ncharge time of a capacitor made with that medium\
    \ and thus the soil water content.\n3.\nTime domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors:\
    \ Time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors\nconsist of two or three parallel rods\
    \ inserted into the soil, acting as waveguides.\nWhen a deﬁned voltage pulse is\
    \ sent to the sensor, it travels along the waveguide.\nWhen this pulse reaches\
    \ the end of the waveguide, it reﬂects back. The oscilloscope\nconnected to the\
    \ sensor measures this reﬂection. As the soil’s water content increases,\nthe\
    \ dielectric constant of the soil also increases. Consequently, the travel time\
    \ of\nthe pulse decreases, and thus, the soil moisture content can be estimated\
    \ using the\ncalibration equation [36].\nA leaf wetness sensor is a device used\
    \ to measure the amount of moisture present on\nthe surface of leaves. It is often\
    \ used in agriculture to help farmers determine the optimal\ntime for irrigation\
    \ or to prevent fungal diseases that may occur due to prolonged leaf\nwetness.\
    \ The sensor works by measuring the electrical resistance between two conductive\n\
    plates, or probes, that are placed on the surface of the leaf. By monitoring the\
    \ changes in\nresistance over time, the sensor can detect when the leaf becomes\
    \ wet and when it dries\nout. Leaf wetness sensors may also include temperature\
    \ and humidity sensors to provide\nadditional environmental data that can help\
    \ farmers make more informed decisions about\nirrigation and disease management.\
    \ In particular, in this study, we have used the AccuPAR\nLP-80 Leaf Wetness Sensor:\
    \ The LP-80 Leaf Wetness Sensor consists of a ﬂat surface that\nis placed in contact\
    \ with the leaves. It utilizes electrical resistance or capacitive sensing\ntechnology\
    \ to detect the presence or absence of moisture on the leaf surface. By measuring\n\
    the wetness level, the sensor can provide valuable information for various applications,\n\
    such as determining optimal irrigation schedules, assessing plant health, and\
    \ monitoring\ndisease conditions [37].\nA pH sensor is a device used to measure\
    \ the acidity or alkalinity of a liquid or\nsoil. A pH sensor works by using a\
    \ probe or electrode that is sensitive to changes in\nhydrogen ion concentration.\
    \ Modern pH sensors may also include temperature sensors\nand microprocessors\
    \ to automatically compensate for changes in temperature and provide\nmore accurate\
    \ readings. pH sensors are widely used in agriculture for monitoring and\nmaintaining\
    \ the pH levels of soil, water, and nutrient solutions used for crop growth. pH\n\
    sensors are essential in agriculture because pH levels directly affect the plant’s\
    \ ability to\ntake up nutrients from the soil or water. They are also used in\
    \ hydroponic farming to\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n1290\nmonitor the nutrient solutions\
    \ used to grow plants that grow in water. In particular, for\nthe experimentation,\
    \ we have used the HALO wireless Soil pH meter (Hanna Instruments,\nInc., Padova,\
    \ Italy) [38].\nA temperature and humidity sensor is a device used to measure\
    \ the temperature and\nrelative humidity of the surrounding air. It is commonly\
    \ used in environmental monitoring\nsystems, greenhouses, and HVAC (heating, ventilation,\
    \ and air conditioning) systems.\nTemperature and humidity sensors are widely\
    \ used in agriculture to monitor environmental\nconditions in crop production\
    \ areas. These sensors are essential in agriculture because\ntemperature and humidity\
    \ levels directly affect plant growth and health. The applications\nof these sensors\
    \ also include the monitoring of environmental conditions in greenhouses\nand\
    \ the control of pest infestations. Pests thrive in speciﬁc conditions, and thanks\
    \ to this\ntype of sensor, farmers can identify conditions that favor pest populations.\
    \ For the study,\nwe have used BI-SENSOR (Maher Smart Agrocontrollers, Almeria,\
    \ Spain) [39].\nA barometric pressure sensor is an instrument used to measure\
    \ atmospheric pressure.\nIt is commonly used in weather monitoring systems, aviation,\
    \ and altimeters.\nThe sensor works by using a thin, ﬂexible membrane, typically\
    \ made of silicon, that\nis exposed to the atmosphere. As atmospheric pressure\
    \ changes, the membrane expands\nor contracts, causing a corresponding change\
    \ in the electrical resistance of the sensor.\nModern barometric pressure sensors\
    \ may also include temperature sensors to compensate\nfor temperature-related\
    \ changes in atmospheric pressure. This compensation is necessary\nbecause temperature\
    \ affects the density of air, which in turn affects atmospheric pressure.\nAtmospheric\
    \ pressure is an essential factor in determining weather patterns and can affect\n\
    crop growth and yield. Barometric sensors are used in several ways in agriculture,\
    \ including\nweather forecasting and livestock management. In the study, we used\
    \ the Digital Barometer\nPS-0060-AD (Netsens Sensing the Environment, Firenze,\
    \ Italy) [40].\n2.4. Self-Driving Remote Controlled Tractor in Smart Agriculture\n\
    Self-driving tractors are autonomous vehicles that use advanced technologies such\n\
    as sensors, cameras, GPS, and machine learning algorithms. Autonomous tractors\
    \ are\nbecoming increasingly popular in the agriculture industry as they offer\
    \ numerous beneﬁts\nto farmers. One of the main advantages of self-driving tractors\
    \ is their ability to operate\naround the clock, which increases the efﬁciency\
    \ of farming operations. They can work\ncontinuously without the need for rest\
    \ breaks or sleep, which can be particularly useful\nduring critical periods such\
    \ as planting and harvesting seasons. Self-driving tractors also\noffer greater\
    \ precision and accuracy in farming operations. They can operate with high\nlevels\
    \ of accuracy and repeatability, which can help reduce the use of fertilizers,\
    \ pesticides,\nand other inputs, leading to improved crop yields and reduced costs.\
    \ Moreover, self-\ndriving tractors can be programmed to work in various weather\
    \ conditions and terrains,\nwhich helps reduce soil erosion and improve overall\
    \ soil health. They can also operate in\nhazardous conditions or environments\
    \ that may be dangerous for human operators.\nThanks to improvements in several\
    \ ﬁelds of engineering, autonomous and remote-\ncontrol studies today allow increased\
    \ productivity in agriculture [41–44]. With a remote\ncontrol, the tractor is\
    \ operated by a person from a remote area, considering data from\ntractor cameras\
    \ and sensors. TX/RX of data is possible if requirements such as latency\nand\
    \ bandwidth for video and control data transfer are veriﬁed. A remote-control\
    \ system\nincludes cameras, sensors, collision avoidance sensors, and control\
    \ devices. ISO 11783,\ncommonly known as ISOBUS, is a communication standard that\
    \ allows a link between\ntractors. ISOBUS is based on the SAE J1939 protocol,\
    \ which includes the controller area\nnetwork (CAN) and allows electronic control\
    \ units (ECUs) to communicate through the\nCAN bus. Autonomous control algorithms\
    \ for agricultural tractors use communication\nbased on the ISOBUS standard. The\
    \ Cannelloni software allows the connection of area\nnetwork controllers on a\
    \ local area network. However, data transmission over the Internet\nor a mobile\
    \ network using this software is not secure. Control of the tractor is based on\n\
    the CAN bus, whose protocol allows a bit rate of up to 1 Mbps. The components\
    \ inside\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n1291\nthe tractor to remotely drive the tractor\
    \ are a remote-controlled cabin, a remote-controlled\ntractor, and a computer\
    \ for CAN tunneling on a mobile network [45].\nAll network trafﬁc is over a virtual\
    \ private network (VPN) connection, and commu-\nnication data among devices occurs\
    \ on the same local area network. A router connects\nthe tractor to the tactical\
    \ network using various mobile networks. By default, the router\nuses all these\
    \ connections simultaneously and switches between them to provide the best\npossible\
    \ service. The target of the remote control is to verify the possibility of remote\n\
    control of the tractor through various trial networks. This is possible by sending\
    \ CAN\nmessages over the network. SocketCAN [46,47] allows the CAN interface to\
    \ be controlled\nand programmed as a standard network interface. The Cannelloni\
    \ tool allows CAN data\nto be transferred over an Ethernet tunnel. Cannelloni\
    \ supports tunneling over UDP (user\ndatagram protocol) or SCTP (stream control\
    \ transmission protocol). The two protocols\nshow substantial differences. In\
    \ fact, SCTP is fast but unreliable in receiving data, while\nSCTP provides reliable\
    \ transport but is slower. The secure shell protocol (SSH) is used to\ntransfer\
    \ the CAN trafﬁc over the network and encrypt it. However, the SSH port is not\n\
    compatible with SCTP. It is needed to convert SCTP to the transmission control\
    \ protocol\n(TCP). This step is possible using the Socat utility. On board the\
    \ tractor and remote-control\ncabin is a Raspberry Pi 4 computer connected to\
    \ the local CAN using a Kvaser USB adapter.\nThe Raspberry Pi onboard the tractor\
    \ represents a client, allowing a connection to the server\nRaspberry Pi computer\
    \ on the remote-control cabin. The remote-control cab server has a\nknown address\
    \ on the Internet, while the tractor may be behind the network address trans-\n\
    lation (NAT) and/or ﬁrewall of the mobile operator. The tractor software will\
    \ constantly\ntry to establish a connection to the server. If the connection to\
    \ the server is lost, the client\nwill keep trying to establish a new connection.\
    \ The devices on the tractor generate a lot of\nCAN trafﬁc, but much of it is\
    \ not relevant to remote control. The same also applies to the\nremote-control\
    \ cabin. So, a ﬁlter has been inserted so that only the requested messages pass\n\
    through. Filtering is achieved by modifying the Cannelloni software to regulate\
    \ outgoing\nand incoming trafﬁc [48].\n2.5. Data Fusion Method for Remote Sensing\
    \ and UAV Images\nData fusion involves merging data from different sensors, platforms,\
    \ or domains to\ncreate a single, integrated data set. The purpose of data fusion\
    \ is to enhance the accuracy,\nreliability, and completeness of data and to improve\
    \ the performance of decision-making\nsystems. By integrating information from\
    \ different sources, data fusion can help identify\npatterns, trends, and relationships\
    \ that may not be apparent from individual sources alone.\nData fusion has numerous\
    \ applications in various ﬁelds, including defense, aerospace,\nmedicine, transportation,\
    \ and environmental monitoring. For example, in military op-\nerations, data fusion\
    \ can be used to combine data from multiple sensors, such as radar,\ninfrared,\
    \ and acoustic sensors, to provide a more complete picture of the battleﬁeld.\
    \ In\nhealthcare, data fusion can be used to combine data from various medical\
    \ devices and\nsensors to monitor patient health and provide better care. In this\
    \ case study, we have\ncombined remote sensing and UAV data.\nToday, real-time\
    \ information in several application ﬁelds can be obtained thanks to\na variety\
    \ of sensors on board UAVs. These ﬂight objects receive large amounts of data\n\
    (e.g., large amounts of images), and for this reason, it is needed to introduce\
    \ intelligent\nalgorithms capable of receiving different types of data and converting\
    \ them into valuable\nand concise information. To overcome this problem, the trend\
    \ today is to use multiple\nsensor data fusions capable of handling not only data\
    \ from UAVs but also data from regular\nrevisit times in high-resolution satellite\
    \ imagery. So, the use of UAVs allows for obtaining\nperiodic data, while the\
    \ combination of satellites maintains a ﬁne spatial resolution in the\nlarge area\
    \ of observation [49–52]. However, the data obtained from UAVs and satellites\n\
    are used separately; the goal is to merge them through data fusion techniques\
    \ to obtain\nimages useful for determining the indices useful for agriculture,\
    \ bearing in mind all the\nadvantages and disadvantages deriving from UAVs and\
    \ satellite data sources, which differ\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n1292\nin ﬂexibility,\
    \ cloud dependence, direct meteorological constraint, operator requirements,\n\
    data management, and payload [53–57].\nThe “data fusion” strategy (spatial-spectral)\
    \ aims to create datasets with advanced\nfeatures by combining one or more resolutions\
    \ from each source. This strategy, designed to\nextract the biophysical properties\
    \ of land cover and vegetation cover at high resolution,\nis currently little\
    \ used in ﬁelds such as agriculture. The fusion of satellite and UAV data\noffers\
    \ a range of advantages, including improved spatial and temporal resolution, greater\n\
    customization, and more detailed and comprehensive information. However, there\
    \ are\nalso some disadvantages, such as the limited coverage of drones compared\
    \ to satellites,\nhigher costs and more complex logistics, restrictions related\
    \ to weather conditions, and the\nmanagement of collected data. In particular,\
    \ the fusion spatial-spectral method is useful to\nimprove the spectral resolution\
    \ of low-cost UAV sensor imagery and the accuracy of land\ncover classiﬁcation\
    \ [58,59]. Spatiotemporal is used in data analysis when data are collected\nover\
    \ both space and time. It describes a phenomenon at a particular place and time.\
    \ The\nfusion spatial-temporal method is useful to obtain biophysical parameters\
    \ (leaf area index\nand chlorophyll content) of crops and make consistent predictions\
    \ with ﬁne spatial patterns.\nThe spectral resolution of an image describes the\
    \ frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum\ncollected by the satellite. This\
    \ spectral characteristic allows different features to be seen\nas separate entities.\
    \ The temporal resolution of an image is deﬁned as the amount of time\nneeded\
    \ to revisit and acquire data for the exact same location. The fusion spatial-temporal\n\
    method is used to obtain information in multispectral satellite data with hyperspectral\
    \ data\nfrom a UAV [60,61]. The obtained results allow for obtaining biophysical\
    \ variables (e.g.,\nleaf area index and chlorophyll content). Finally, the satellite/UAV\
    \ data fusion improved\nthe performance of the model compared to data obtained\
    \ individually from satellite or\nUAV due to satellite-based spectral characteristics\
    \ and structural characteristics obtained\nfrom UAVs [62,63].\nAs is known, remote\
    \ sensing techniques could be an important tool to ground infor-\nmation on the\
    \ characteristics of vegetation through the production of significant vegetation\n\
    indices. This information can be collected by multispectral and hyperspectral\
    \ systems using\noptical sensors, and thanks to these, it is possible to analyze\
    \ some fundamental indices in\nagriculture, such as the NDVI (normalized difference\
    \ vegetation index), NDMI (normalized\ndifference moisture index), and BSI (bare\
    \ soil index). In this research, Sentinel-2 satellite\nimages were used that have\
    \ a spatial resolution of a decameter and a revisit time of six days,\ntogether\
    \ with images captured by UAVs, which have a higher resolution and the possibility\n\
    to catch details within the canopies with no difficulty thanks to their flexibility.\
    \ The data\nutilized for this analysis included a Sentile-2 Level 2A image obtained\
    \ on four different dates\n(17 May, 14 July, 30 August, and 25 September 2022)\
    \ at 10:00 UTC, as well as a WorldView-3\nsatellite image taken on 17 November\
    \ 2022. The WorldView-3 images are considered to be\none of the most detailed\
    \ and precise commercial satellite images accessible to the public,\nwith a spatial\
    \ resolution of approximately 30 cm per pixel, allowing for the detection of\n\
    small objects on the Earth’s surface, including cars, buildings, vegetation, and\
    \ other features.\nIn addition, the multispectral images acquired by the DJI Matrice\
    \ 600 Pro drone (SZ\nDJI Technology Co. Ltd., Shenzhen, China), which was equipped\
    \ with a Micasense Altum\nCamera (AgEagle Aerial System Inc., Kansas, USA), were\
    \ also utilized. This camera is well\nsuited for agricultural purposes and has\
    \ the capability to capture images of crops in both\nvisible and infrared spectra\
    \ simultaneously. The drone ﬂew at a height of approximately\n30 m above the ground,\
    \ resulting in aerial GSD images with a resolution of 5 cm.\n3. Case Study\nThe\
    \ study area chosen for the research is in Calabria (South Italy), in particular,\
    \ in the\nmunicipality of Reggio Calabria, as shown in Figure 4.\nThe red line\
    \ shows the application area of the simulator, while the application of the\n\
    entire methodology was focused in a zone near the Castle of San Niceto, always\
    \ in the\nMunicipality of Reggio Calabria, with an extent of 35 hectares.\nAgriEngineering\
    \ 2023, 5\n1293\nThis area was chosen for different reasons:\n1.\nIt is a virgin\
    \ area that has not been cultivated yet, so the GIS was able to show us the\n\
    most suitable area for cultivation.\n2.\nIt has a morphology suitable for using\
    \ the simulator. In a few kilometers, there is\na sudden change in the orography\
    \ of the land: one passes from a coastal area to an\nApennine area, and this allows\
    \ the simulator to function properly as it takes the DEM\nof the area of interest\
    \ as its initial input. The dimensioning described in Section 2 was\ndesigned\
    \ to cover an area of 60 km × 60 km.\n3.\nIt is a small area, and therefore it\
    \ is possible to apply the entire proposed system and\nhave detailed results.\n\
    4. Results\nAll the data collected during the research were imported into a GIS\
    \ that, using the\nmethodology in paragraph 2, displayed the main results of the\
    \ activities we conducted.\nAs regards the atmospheric simulator software, Figure\

    \ data fusion technique (which also leverages different sensors, such as soil\
    \ mois-\nture sensors, to further enhance the overall understanding) [7] was performed\
    \ in the area of\ninterest, determining the different interest indices such as\
    \ the NDVI (normalized difference\nvegetation index), LST (land surface temperature),\
    \ NDMI (normalized difference moisture\nindex), and BSI (bare soil index) useful\
    \ for the planning and management of agricultural\nactivities. The choice fell\
    \ into these indices because they are very relevant in the context of\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0 in order to have an indication of vegetation richness and to capture soil\
    \ dif-\nferences [64]. As is known, to quantify the link between land surface\
    \ temperature (LST) and\nvegetation, the normalized difference vegetation index\
    \ (NDVI) is usually employed as an\nindication of vegetation richness. But the\
    \ normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) is\nan alternative indicator. By\
    \ studying the correlations between the land surface temperature\n(LST), the NDMI,\
    \ and the NDVI, some studies show that the linear association between\nLST and\
    \ NDMI is stronger, whereas the relationship between LST and NDVI is signiﬁcantly\n\
    less and varies by month. The linear association between LST and NDMI steadily\
    \ decreases\nas the seasons change from summer to fall. This ﬁnding implies that\
    \ NDMI, in addition to\nthe previously used NDVI, can be used to analyze LST.\
    \ NDVI values range from −1.0 to\n1.0 in general, with negative values suggesting\
    \ clouds and water, positive values near zero\nindicating bare soil, and higher\
    \ positive values indicating sparse vegetation (0.1–0.5) to\nthick green vegetation\
    \ (0.6 and above). The bare soil index (BSI) is a numerical indicator that\ncaptures\
    \ soil differences by combining blue, red, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared\n\
    spectral bands. These spectral bands are employed in a normalized fashion. The\
    \ blue and\nnear-infrared spectral bands are utilized to highlight the presence\

    \ to measure soil mineral content.\nBSI can be utilized in a variety of remote\

    \ in this work aimed to experiment with and test an automatic\nintegration system\
    \ for crop optimization and control. The methodology involves the\nintegration\
    \ of an experimental atmospheric simulator, satellite and UAV images, local\n\
    sensor data, and data transmission protocols, all managed in an open-source GIS.\
    \ The study\nfocused on identifying different types of cultivation and establishing\
    \ optimal routes for\nan automated tractor and a drone to monitor crop growth\
    \ and health. The research was\nconducted in a speciﬁc area in the province of\
    \ Reggio Calabria, chosen for its suitability\nfor applying the various technologies\
    \ described. Compared to similar approaches, this\nresearch demonstrates several\
    \ strengths and weaknesses. One notable strength is the\ncomprehensive integration\
    \ of multiple technologies, allowing for a holistic approach to\nAgriculture 4.0.\
    \ Our experimentation enables a detailed understanding of crop conditions\nand\
    \ facilitates precise fertilization/irrigation optimization. The tested method\
    \ is part of\nAgriculture 4.0, which still has a number of weaknesses. In fact,\
    \ the success of Agriculture\n4.0, and therefore also of the methodology proposed\
    \ by us, relies on the availability of\naccurate and up-to-date data as well as\
    \ the expertise required to interpret and utilize the\ncollected information effectively.\
    \ Additionally, the initial setup costs and the need for\nskilled personnel to\
    \ operate and maintain the system may pose challenges for widespread\nadoption.\
    \ Despite these weaknesses (however intrinsic to Agriculture 4.0), this research\n\
    contributes valuable insights into the potential of Agriculture 4.0. The integration\
    \ of\nvarious technologies and data sources offers a signiﬁcant advantage in optimizing\
    \ irrigation\npractices and monitoring crop health. Clearly, the authors have\
    \ given importance to the\nmethodology and not so much to the results, reserving\
    \ the right to analyze them in more\ndetail through different skills for the subdivision\
    \ of the areas suitable for cultivation. The\ntechnologies to be integrated within\
    \ drones may be particularly promising, including\nincreasingly sophisticated\
    \ sensors for the performance of different functions such as the\nvaporization\
    \ of fertilizers or natural pesticides. In fact, evaporation and crystallization\n\
    processes are currently prevalent in commercial fertilizer production facilities.\
    \ As fertilizer\ndemand continues to rise and the availability of low-cost raw\
    \ materials decreases, new\nfertilizer production technologies are being developed.\
    \ Evaporation and crystallization\ntechniques have many applications in the fertilizer\
    \ industry.\nThis research contributes to the advancement of Agriculture 4.0 by\
    \ showing the\nintegration of different tools and techniques. While there are\
    \ weaknesses to address, the\nbeneﬁts of adopting such integrated systems for\
    \ precision agriculture are signiﬁcant. The\nresults of this work demonstrate\
    \ the value of employing advanced technologies to optimize\nagricultural processes\
    \ and pave the way for more efﬁcient and sustainable agricultural\npractices in\
    \ the future.\n6. Conclusions\nThe advantages of the proposed innovative system\
    \ are evident in terms of time con-\nsumption, human resources, and productivity.\
    \ In fact, the automation of some fundamental\nagricultural activities normally\
    \ carried out by people saves time and costs. Furthermore,\nthe possibility of\
    \ analyzing different types of data on soil conditions and the well-being\nof\
    \ crops can increase productivity and quality and save a highly precious resource,\
    \ water,\nwhich is instead managed according to what emerges from the weather\
    \ variables provided\nby the simulator. The main novelty reported in this article\
    \ lies precisely in the use of this\nsoftware, which, through a few input data,\
    \ allows you to have an assessment of the weather\nconditions. Furthermore, although\
    \ self-driving tractors are still relatively new, they are\nalready having a signiﬁcant\
    \ impact on the agriculture industry. With the rapid advances in\ntechnology,\
    \ it is likely that self-driving tractors will become more common in the future\n\
    and will continue to transform the way farming is conducted.\nThis research focused\
    \ on a speciﬁc area in the province of Reggio Calabria, leverag-\ning the morphological\
    \ and orographic characteristics of the region for the application of\nvarious\
    \ technologies. This demonstrates that, with proper planning and implementation,\n\
    AgriEngineering 2023, 5\n1299\nsuch approaches can be adapted to speciﬁc agricultural\
    \ contexts, thus maximizing the\nbeneﬁts obtained. The future developments of\
    \ this research should focus ﬁrst of all on\nspeeding up and optimizing data processing\
    \ and data transmission protocols, possibly\nexperimenting with more efﬁcient\
    \ algorithms in terms of productivity and processing, and\nmoreover, on the validation\
    \ and large-scale implementation of these integrated systems.\nCollaboration between\
    \ research institutions, agricultural organizations, and farmers will\nbe crucial\
    \ to promoting the adoption of these innovative solutions. The ultimate goal is\n\
    to create a sustainable agricultural approach that efﬁciently utilizes available\
    \ resources,\nreduces environmental impact, and is beneﬁcial for farmers. This\
    \ requires the continuous\ndevelopment and adaptation of technologies and methods,\
    \ taking into account the speciﬁc\nneeds of different crops, environmental conditions,\
    \ and the farmers’ requirements.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, V.B.;\

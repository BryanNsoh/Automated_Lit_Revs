    Pasture Science 64(5) 424-434 https://doi.org/10.1071/CP12424 Submitted: 18 December
    2012  Accepted: 7 February 2013   Published: 22 August 2013 Abstract During the
    past 50 years, 3800 field experiments yielding over 5200 treatment series were
    conducted in Australia examining yield responses to applied N, P, K, or S fertiliser
    applications to cereal, oilseed and pulse crops. The experiments all had accompanying
    soil test data. These data were entered into multiple Microsoft Access® database
    templates and then consolidated into a single national online MYSQL® database.
    A web application (named the BFDC Interrogator) was also developed to rapidly
    access the national database (BFDC National Database) and construct soil test
    calibrations between percentage of the maximum grain yield achieved (hereafter
    called percentage relative yield) and soil test values recorded for specified
    ranges of regional or national experiments. Search parameters were applied to
    define soil test calibrations. These included farming system (dryland or irrigated),
    year of experiment, soil type, crop type, soil test, depth of soil sampling and
    soil test units. Other data filters based on site metadata, such as method of
    nutrient placement, can be applied to enable more definitive calibrations. The
    calibrations are used to derive critical soil test values at 80, 90 and 95% relative
    crop yield with 95% confidence limits. However, the soil test criteria at 90%
    relative crop yield with 70% confidence limits have been chosen as the single
    calibration and reliability standard for all crops and soil tests. Corresponding
    yield increase (t/ha)–soil test relationships for an applied nutrient can also
    be accessed. The BFDC National Database and BFDC Interrogator can now be accessed
    online by trained, registered users. This paper describes the methodologies that
    underpinned the progressive development of this tool. Through the commitment of
    the grains and fertiliser industries, it is anticipated that the calibrations
    will be used to improve decision support systems used to generate fertiliser recommendations
    for Australian cropping industries. Additional keywords: cereal, crop type, cropping

    The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) is a major
    international effort linking the climate, crop, and economic modeling communities
    with cutting-edge information technology to produce improved crop and economic
    models and the next generation of climate impact projections for the agricultural
    sector. The goals of AgMIP are to improve substantially the characterization of
    world food security due to climate change and to enhance adaptation capacity in
    both developing and developed countries. Analyses of the agricultural impacts
    of climate variability and change require a transdisciplinary effort to consistently
    link state-of-the-art climate scenarios to crop and economic models. Crop model
    outputs are aggregated as inputs to regional and global economic models to determine
    regional vulnerabilities, changes in comparative advantage, price effects, and
    potential adaptation strategies in the agricultural sector. Climate, Crop Modeling,
    Economics, and Information Technology Team Protocols are presented to guide coordinated
    climate, crop modeling, economics, and information technology research activities
    around the world, along with AgMIP Cross-Cutting Themes that address uncertainty,
    aggregation and scaling, and the development of Representative Agricultural Pathways
    (RAPs) to enable testing of climate change adaptations in the context of other
    regional and global trends. The organization of research activities by geographic
    region and specific crops is described, along with project milestones. Pilot results
    demonstrate AgMIP''s role in assessing climate impacts with explicit representation
    of uncertainties in climate scenarios and simulations using crop and economic
    models. An intercomparison of wheat model simulations near Obregón, Mexico reveals
    inter-model differences in yield sensitivity to [CO2] with model uncertainty holding
    approximately steady as concentrations rise, while uncertainty related to choice
    of crop model increases with rising temperatures. Wheat model simulations with
    mid-century climate scenarios project a slight decline in absolute yields that
    is more sensitive to selection of crop model than to global climate model, emissions
    scenario, or climate scenario downscaling method. A comparison of regional and
    national-scale economic simulations finds a large sensitivity of projected yield
    changes to the simulations’ resolved scales. Finally, a global economic model
    intercomparison example demonstrates that improvements in the understanding of
    agriculture futures arise from integration of the range of uncertainty in crop,
    climate, and economic modeling results in multi-model assessments. Highlights

    The worldwide agricultural sector faces the significant challenge of increasing
    production to provide food security for a population projected to rise to 9 billion
    by mid-century while protecting the environment and the functioning of ecosystems.
    This challenge is compounded by the need to adapt to climate change by taking
    advantage of potential benefits and by minimizing the potentially negative impacts
    on agricultural production. The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement
    Project (AgMIP; www.agmip.org) aims to improve substantially the characterization
    of world food security under climate change and to enhance adaptation capacity
    in both developing and developed countries. To examine the full range of climate
    change impacts on agriculture, both biophysical and economic aspects need to be
    considered and combined (Hillel and Rosenzweig, 2010). Methodologies for assessing
    the biophysical effects of climate on crop yield include statistical models (e.g.,
    Schlenker et al., 2006, Lobell and Burke, 2010) and process-based dynamic crop
    growth models (e.g., Keating et al., 2003, Brisson et al., 2003, Jones et al.,
    2003, van Ittersum and Donatelli, 2003, Challinor et al., 2004). For simulating
    the combined biophysical and economic effects of climate change on agriculture,
    reduced form statistical models have been used (e.g., Mendelsohn et al., 1994)
    as well as internally or externally coupled biophysical and economic simulation
    models designed for integrated assessment of economic, technological, policy,
    and environmental changes at regional or global scales (e.g., Rosenzweig and Parry,
    1994, Fischer et al., 2002, Hermans et al., 2010, Nelson et al., 2010). AgMIP
    utilizes intercomparisons of these various types of methods to improve crop and
    economic models and ensemble projections to produce enhanced assessments by the
    crop and economic modeling communities researching climate change agricultural
    impacts and adaptation (Table 1). This paper describes the scientific approach
    and structure of AgMIP; Climate, Crop Modeling, Economics, and Information Technology
    Team Protocols; Cross-Cutting Themes; and pilot study examples. Table 1. AgMIP
    objectives. Scientific • Intercompare crop and agricultural trade models as well
    as methodological options relating to scenario generation and the aggregation
    and scaling of model projections. • Incorporate crop and agricultural trade model
    improvements in coordinated regional and global assessments of future climate
    conditions. • Produce state-of-the-art, multi-model climate impacts assessments
    of agricultural regions. • Include multiple models, scenarios, locations, crops,
    and participants to explore uncertainty and the impact of methodological choices.  Organizational
    • Build the transdisciplinary community of climate, crop, economics, and information
    technology experts required to address crucial regional and global questions related
    to climate impacts on the agricultural sector.  Outreach • Develop a framework
    to identify and prioritize regional adaptation strategies. • Increase scientific
    and adaptive capacity of agricultural regions in developing and developed countries.
    • Link to key on-going efforts (e.g., the Consultative Group on International
    Agricultural Research''s Climate Change and Food Security program, CGIAR CCAFS;
    Global Future; the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization''s Modeling
    System for Agricultural Impacts of Climate Change, UN FAO MOSAICC; GEOSHARE; National
    Adaptation Plans; and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment,
    CORDEX) 1.1. Model Improvement Recent reviews have described how models may be
    improved to enhance their ability to project climate change impacts on crops (Boote
    et al., 2010, White et al., 2011, Rötter et al., 2011). AgMIP is targeting several
    key issues with the goal of making significant progress in model improvement.
    The first issue is resolving the debate in the literature concerning the simulation
    in dynamic crop growth models of elevated CO2 effects (Kimball, 1984, Tubiello
    and Ewert, 2002, Long et al., 2006, Ainsworth et al., 2008). More broadly, this
    issue relates to improving the simulation of CO2, temperature, and water interactions.
    AgMIP is addressing this need by bringing together free-air carbon dioxide enrichment
    (FACE) researchers and crop model developers to create a coordinated set of data
    and model tests for use in model improvement. Another key issue for improving
    the use of crop models is accounting for yield gaps. Yield gap refers to the difference
    between actual yield and potential yield with no biological constraints due to
    water, nitrogen, pests and diseases, and other factors. Because most crop models
    do not consider pests and diseases, variations in management among farmers in
    the region, high-resolution rainfall distributions, or nutrients other than nitrogen,
    simulated yields are often closer to potential than actual yield. These limitations
    are very difficult to predict, due largely to a lack of observed data that quantify
    those variations. Researchers have shown that these yield gaps can be accounted
    for empirically by using crop model simulations, historical regional yields, and
    statistical methods (Jagtap and Jones, 2001, Jagtap and Jones, 2002, Irmak et
    al., 2005). Since economic models need actual production for regions to predict
    economic consequences accurately, AgMIP is examining different methods for developing
    regionally aggregated yields adjusted for yield gaps using multi-year samples
    of observed historical regional yields and evaluated using independent years for
    the same region. Statistical approaches (e.g., Schlenker and Roberts, 2009, Lobell
    et al., 2011) are gaining in prominence for assessing climate change impacts on
    crop production due to their ability to rapidly assess large and diverse datasets.
    However, statistical models have difficulty offering process-level understanding
    and testing of adaptation strategies, so extrapolation beyond observed samples
    is risky even with extreme caution. AgMIP has ongoing activities that assess the
    strengths and weaknesses of using crop model simulations and statistical regression
    results to predict yields at aggregated scales using field and regional crop data
    at multiple locations under current and future climates. The recent global food
    price volatility has revealed a stronger sensitivity to climatic variability than
    previously anticipated (Easterling et al., 2007). A key aspect of AgMIP is to
    create capacity-building partnerships between and among agricultural crop and
    economic modelers around the world, enhancing the evaluation of current and future
    climate impacts and adaptations. Through economic model testing, intercomparison,
    and improvement, AgMIP aims to significantly enhance information (including uncertainty
    estimates) to guide policymakers regarding both current and future food prices.
    1.2. Climate variability and change assessments AgMIP builds on early efforts
    in crop model intercomparison by the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems
    (GCTE) project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP; Walker
    and Steffen, 1996) and on the activities of the International Consortium for Agricultural
    Systems Applications (ICASA; Hunt et al., 2006). Multi-model comparisons have
    also been carried out previously to assess crop model water and nutrient dynamics
    (Diekkrüger et al., 1995, Kersebaum et al., 2007). AgMIP also utilizes an ensemble
    approach similar to other groups of modelers, such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison
    Project (CMIP; now on CMIP5; Meehl et al., 2000, Taylor et al., 2009), multi-model
    assessments of the carbon cycle (Hanson et al., 2004) and the land surface (Henderson-Sellers
    et al., 1995), and the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF; Clarke and Weyant, 2009; now
    in its twenty-fifth year). Coordination among the agricultural modeling community
    has been hampered by a lack of standardization of data and scenarios as a basis
    for intercomparison (Rötter et al., 2011). As a result, for more than two decades,
    the majority of studies on climate change and agriculture have utilized only one
    crop model and only one economic model. Furthermore, studies use different sets
    of climate scenarios and assumptions, thus limiting the scope for large-scale
    comparisons and rigorous estimations of uncertainty. Multi-model climate, agronomic,
    and economic projections are essential inputs of the Vulnerability, Impacts, and
    Adaptation (VIA) research community to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5; now underway) and the UN Framework Convention
    on Climate Change (UNFCCC). AgMIP''s projections of future agricultural production
    and its economic consequences will set the context for local-scale vulnerability
    and adaptation studies, supply test scenarios for national-scale development of
    a range of policy instruments (including trade, agriculture, and natural resource
    management), and contribute to projections of land use change. 2. AgMIP structure
    and scientific approach The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement
    Project (AgMIP) is a set of distributed activities for agricultural model intercomparison
    and future climate change assessments with participation from multiple crop and
    economic modeling groups around the world (Fig. 1). AgMIP research activities
    are organized under four project teams (Climate, Crop Modeling, Economics, and
    Information Technology), with guidance provided by a Leadership Team as well as
    a Steering Group and Donor Forum. In addition, there are three AgMIP Cross-Cutting
    Themes – Uncertainty, Aggregation and Scaling, and Representative Agricultural
    Pathways (RAPs) – which span the activities of all teams). Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. AgMIP Teams, Cross-Cutting Themes, key interactions and
    expected outcomes. AgMIP activities are designed to facilitate extended applications
    and research on crucial agricultural issues including soil management, water resources,
    pests and diseases, and livestock. For example, initial efforts to assess future
    water resources will target key irrigated agricultural areas, such as California''s
    Central Valley and regions of India, using a range of methods from large-scale
    hydrologic analysis to integrated water resources management models. While pest
    and disease effects on production will be included via yield-gap factors in the
    initial phase of AgMIP, AgMIP encourages broader efforts in this area since direct
    simulation and prediction of these effects are extremely difficult. There are
    two primary scientific tracks by which AgMIP achieves its goals (Fig. 2). Track
    1, Model Intercomparison and Improvement, conducts crop and economic model intercomparisons
    during a historical period when results can be validated with observed conditions
    and field trials in order to identify strengths, weaknesses, and uncertainties.
    Track 2, Climate Change Multi-Model Assessment, examines climate change effects
    on food production and food security at field to global scales, including analyses
    of adaptation1 measures over a range of futures designated by climate scenarios
    and RAPs. Scenarios and AgMIP Protocols are distributed on the web, and multi-model
    results are collated and analyzed to ensure the widest possible coverage of agricultural
    crops and regions. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Two-track approach
    to AgMIP research activities. Track 1: Model Intercomparison and Improvement;
    Track 2: Climate Change Multi-Model Assessment. Initial AgMIP efforts focus on
    mechanistic (i.e., process-based) crop models, regional economic impact assessment
    models, partial equilibrium agricultural market models, computable general equilibrium
    (CGE; including dynamic CGE) models, and integrated assessment models. In future
    activities, AgMIP will engage the broader community of scientists exploring the
    impacts of climate change on agriculture to conduct comparisons across mechanistic,
    statistical, and empirical approaches 3. AgMIP protocols The AgMIP Protocols describe
    the processes and tasks necessary to conduct internally consistent model intercomparisons
    and multi-model assessments efficiently and comprehensively. The purpose of developing
    the Protocols is to provide guidance on the operating procedures, progress evaluations,
    and anticipated deliverables from each AgMIP team and for the integration of the
    project as a whole. Further detail and updated versions of the AgMIP Protocols
    are made available at www.agmip.org in order to facilitate participants’ efforts
    to contribute to, reproduce, and analyze AgMIP results. 3.1. Climate Team protocols
    The objectives of the Climate Team are to: 1. Improve documentation, standardization,
    and transparency of climate data collection and scenario generation sources and
    methods. 2. Provide historical climate information to enable coordinated agricultural
    model intercomparison and baseline period analysis in major agricultural regions.
    3. Create scenarios to test crop model sensitivity to key climate phenomena. 4.
    Develop an ensemble of future climate scenarios for major agricultural regions
    that may be used by field-based or gridded modeling systems with horizontal resolution
    on the order of 0.5°. 5. Perform agro-climatic analyses to understand agricultural
    regions’ vulnerabilities to historical climate and projected future conditions.
    Two types of climate scenarios are produced (Fig. 3). First-phase experiments
    are scenarios that are generated for simulations at all locations for consistent
    aggregation and intercomparison. Second-phase experiments are scenarios that allow
    exploration of additional important research questions, but are not required of
    all researchers/locations. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Overview
    of Climate Team agro-climatic analyses and prioritized scenarios. Local station
    observations serve as the foundation for AgMIP model intercomparisons and baseline
    period analyses. At least 30 years of data are needed to enable climatological
    analysis (WMO, 1989, Guttman, 1989), thus baseline analyses will focus on the
    1980–2009 period. Crop model simulations and intercomparisons require daily rainfall,
    solar radiation, and minimum and maximum temperatures representing farm-level
    conditions. Surface moisture (dewpoint temperature, vapor pressure, or relative
    humidity) and winds can allow calculation of more complex evapotranspiration methods.
    Station data are subject to quality assessment and quality control, with radiation
    gaps filled using NASA Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (POWER; Zhang et
    al., 2007), and solar radiation, winds, and surface moisture variables provided
    by the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA;
    Bosilovich, 2008). Data are also compared to and filled with gridded observational
    products from satellites (e.g., ISCCP, Zhang et al., 2004; CMORPH, Joyce et al.,
    2004; POWER, Zhang et al., 2007), station networks (e.g., WORLDCLIM, Hijmans et
    al., 2005, Willmott and Matsuura, 2009; New et al., 2002), and recent retrospective
    (Re-) analyses (e.g., GLDAS, Rodell et al., 2004; MERRA, Rienecker et al., 2011;
    ERA-INTERIM, Berrisford et al., 2009; CFSR, Saha et al., 2010). Weather generators
    (e.g., GiST, Baigorria and Jones, 2010; MarkSIM, Jones et al., 2002; WM2, Hansen
    and Mavromatis, 2001; NHMM, Robertson et al., 2007; LARS-WG, Semenov et al., 1998)
    allow for an increased number of iterations to better understand baseline climate
    variability. AgMIP prioritizes weather generators that can maintain geospatial
    correlations (e.g., GiST and NHMM; see Fig. 4) and those that can explicitly represent
    interannual variability (e.g., WM2 and MarkSIM) in order to enable realistic representation
    of climate extremes spanning across several AgMIP Sentinel Sites in regions where
    crop model simulations are conducted. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    4. Growing season temperature (°C) time series produced by Geo Spatial-Temporal
    weather generator (GiST, Baigorria and Jones, 2010) for five weather stations
    in Georgia and Florida showing patterns of fluctuations that reflect seasonally-varying
    correlations of temperatures and weather events among nearby stations. The Climate
    Team also creates climate sensitivity scenarios that test the simulated response
    of regional crops to changes in [CO2], temperature, and precipitation. Scenarios
    with plausible mean changes in these variables are simulated to facilitate the
    creation of impact response surfaces that highlight key crop model sensitivities,
    thresholds, and inflection points (Räisänen and Ruokolainen, 2006, Ruane et al.,
    in press-a). Weather generators also enable the creation of scenarios to investigate
    the impacts of shifts in climate variability, including changes to the standard
    deviation of daily temperature, the number of rainy days, and the distribution
    of extreme events. Climate scenarios that draw from observational products with
    varying resolution enable an investigation of the sensitivity of agricultural
    simulations to the scale of climate inputs. The set of AgMIP future climate scenarios
    enables projections of crop production under plausible future climates, with analysis
    of uncertainties owing to data quality, climate models, societal emissions pathways,
    and methodological techniques. Future climate scenarios are based on climate change
    simulations from an ensemble of general circulation models (GCMs) from the Third
    Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3; Meehl et al., 2007) and CMIP5 (Taylor
    et al., 2009). Projections are made for three periods under high and low emissions
    scenarios (A2 and B1, respectively; SRES, 2000) for CMIP3 and representative concentrations
    pathways (RCPs; Moss et al., 2010) for CMIP5. As preliminary investigations of
    the decadal experiments in CMIP5 (2005–2034) have raised concerns about their
    utility for impacts assessment (Goddard et al., 2012), we use the 2010–2039 near-term
    period to understand climate variability in relation to climate change and to
    develop effective adaptation strategies to near-current conditions early in the
    century. Mid-century (2040–2069) and end-of-century (2070–2099) periods address
    the agricultural impacts of the emerging climate change signal and its interaction
    with ongoing climate variability. First-priority future scenarios are generated
    using the delta method in which simulated mean monthly changes are imposed on
    baseline observations (Wilby et al., 2004). This method, while simple, allows
    comparison with many published results. The AgMIP Climate Team also employs weather
    generators and quantile-based distributional shifts to create scenarios that alter
    interannual and intraseasonal climate variability based on regional climate model
    (RCM) projections (e.g., Baigorria and Jones, 2010, Jones et al., 2002, Hansen
    and Mavromatis, 2001, Robertson et al., 2007). Although RCM simulations only cover
    a subset of GCMs, emissions scenarios, and future years, outputs from ongoing
    RCM intercomparisons (e.g., CORDEX, Giorgi et al., 2009; NARCCAP, Mearns et al.,
    2009; and ENSEMBLES, van der Linden and Mitchell, 2009) are included in the AgMIP
    Protocols to capture changes in mesoscale dynamics (e.g., changes in temperature
    extremes, frequency and intensity of precipitation, interactions with complex
    topography) and the uncertainty introduced by dynamical downscaling. Statistically
    downscaled data may also provide a more realistic spatial representation of climate
    changes (e.g., Wood et al., 2004, Maurer et al., 2007, Maurer et al., 2009, Maurer
    and Hidalgo, 2008). The AgMIP Climate Team participates in the agro-climatic analysis
    of climate, crop, and economic model results in order to improve understanding
    of the crucial climate phenomena that affect agricultural vulnerability and changes
    in production and trade. 3.2. Crop Modeling Team Protocols The objectives of the
    Crop Modeling Team are to: 1. Evaluate models for a range of crops and regions
    by comparing outputs with observed growth and yield data, including responses
    to [CO2], temperature, water shortage, water excess, and interactions with management
    factors. 2. Refine model algorithms and/or parameters to improve predictability.
    3. Solve for genetic coefficients to account for cultivar variation. 4. Represent
    crop management systems, e.g., sowing dates, rotations, irrigation, and nitrogen
    (N) fertilization practices, for crops over single and multiple seasons and in
    different regions. 5. Calibrate models for soil carbon, nitrogen fertility, and
    water-holding capacity in agricultural regions around the world. 6. Define and
    account for yield gap factors not related to water and N supply. 7. Simulate the
    set of AgMIP climate change scenarios with a suite of improved and calibrated
    crop models to create a coordinated set of yield inputs for the AgMIP economic
    assessments. 8. Characterize uncertainties in modeled outcomes relative to uncertainties
    in soil and weather inputs, model parameters, and model formulation. 9. Develop
    and evaluate adaptation strategies such as changes in management and genotypic
    improvement for future climate. The Crop Modeling Team is conducting several activities
    (Fig. 5). In the first activity, crop model sensitivity and uncertainty are evaluated:
    multiple models for the same crop are initially calibrated using Sentinel Site-specific
    datasets, followed by analyses of the models’ responses to [CO2], temperature,
    water availability (rainfall), nitrogen supply, sowing date, and other factors,
    both in isolation and selected combinations. AgMIP Sentinel Sites provide the
    data needed to test and improve crop models (Fig. 6). The primary goal of this
    activity is to obtain an estimate of crop model uncertainty calculated from the
    responses of an ensemble of crop models for a given crop and region. A second
    goal is to evaluate the accuracy of predicted responses to climate change factors
    by comparing to published responses to [CO2] and temperature. Download : Download

    image Fig. 6. The AgMIP Sentinel Site classification system for field experimental
    data that meet progressively more requirements to calibrate mechanistic crop models
    for a given site. The second activity calibrates crop models to intensive and
    extensive site-specific data, initially starting with available site-specific
    data on crop responses to various treatments (water, nitrogen, sowing date, other
    factors) for as many AgMIP Sentinel Sites as possible. Data consist of intensive
    in-season time-series information (such as soil water content, leaf area index,
    crop biomass, grain mass) as well as end-of-season yield components. Some site-specific
    data only have long records of end-of-season information (as in crop variety trials),
    but these sites are included as they have the advantage of capturing effects of
    multi-site and multi-year weather variation. Calibration of model parameters and
    code improvement by the crop modelers are documented. The objective of this step
    is to improve simulated responses to climatic, soil, and management factors. The
    third crop modeling activity is regional crop yield estimation over many soils,
    fields, sowing dates, and farmers for the past few decades. Regional yield data
    are often available from various agencies, but tend to suffer from three problems:
    (1) aggregation over many sites; (2) missing site-specific information on soils,
    cultivars, sowing dates, crop management, pest control, etc.; and (3) undefined
    yield gaps compared to well-managed crops on known farm or research fields. In
    this case, the crop modelers determine distributions of representative crop management
    and soils, run the models with that information, and compare simulated results
    to district-wide yields, possibly making bias-adjustments that account for yield
    gaps. This is essential to provide economic models with inputs that simulate actual
    production. Crop modelers interact with climate scientists and economists to project
    future agricultural production, with uncertainty estimates, in agricultural regions
    and use crop models to develop strategies for adaptation to future climate risks,
    such as varied sowing dates, alternative crops, and improved cultivars. The basis
    of uncertainty estimates is the variability among members of the ensemble used
    for prediction. The realism of such uncertainty estimates can be quantified to
    some extent with comparison of simulated hindcasts to data; however, simulated
    projections involve new unknowns, which can only be roughly evaluated (Spiegelhalter
    and Riesch, 2011). 3.3. Economics Team protocols The Economics Team is establishing
    a methodological and procedural foundation for the systematic comparison and improvement
    of regional and global agricultural economics models used for analysis of climate
    change impacts and adaptations in the agricultural sector (Fig. 7). The objectives
    of the Economics Team are to: 1. Improve documentation, standardization, and transparency
    of economic data and models. 2. Develop Representative Agricultural Pathways (RAPs)
    coordinated with the Representative Concentration Pathways and Shared Socio-economic
    Pathways being developed by the global integrated assessment community. 3. Advance
    the methods and procedures used to link crop and economic models for analysis
    of climate change impacts and adaptations in the agricultural sector. 4. Design
    and implement regional analysis of climate change impacts and adaptations using
    new methods for crop and economic model linkages, and carry out intercomparisons
    for a set of designated test regions where high-resolution biophysical and economic
    data are available. 5. Facilitate intercomparison of global agricultural system
    models using AgMIP crop model simulations. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 7. Economic Team activities. Regional and global modeling activities are
    done interactively. Achieving these objectives involves participating in AgMIP
    Cross-Cutting Themes (described in Section 4) to build collaborations among climate
    scientists, crop modelers, and economists to improve methods and procedures that
    allow crop model simulations to be used as inputs into economic models. First,
    an important part of AgMIP''s work is to facilitate the transdisciplinary development
    of agricultural scenarios referred to as Representative Agricultural Pathways
    (see Section 4.3). Second, methods are needed to allow site/point analyses to
    be scaled up to agro-ecological zones (AEZs) or larger regions (see Section 4.2),
    and to statistically characterize uncertain yield distributions and the effects
    of temperature thresholds and crop failure in economic models (see Section 4.1).
    A third important issue that arises in using crop model simulations is how to
    interpret crop model yields (e.g., as absolute or relative productivities). Initially,
    AgMIP crop modelers are aggregating from site to regional yields and bias-correcting
    the simulated regional yields to account for ‘yield gap’ relationships; these
    methods will be further addressed as AgMIP proceeds. A fourth important set of
    issues concerns the characterization of management data, including spatial and
    temporal aggregation of inputs, representation of human labor, pest management,
    measurement of capital stocks or capital service flows, and dynamic feedbacks
    from economic decision models to crop models, within and across seasons. Another
    major AgMIP initiative involves coordinating and facilitating intercomparisons
    of regional and global agricultural economic models being used for climate change
    impact and adaptation research. Regional economic impact assessment models provide
    greater capability to evaluate impacts of climate change on poverty, risk of hunger,
    and other social and environmental outcomes (Antle, 2011) taking prices as given,
    whereas market equilibrium models provide the capability to quantify changes in
    market prices and real incomes of consumers and producers. The AgMIP Leadership
    Team works with regional agricultural economic modeling teams to implement a suite
    of model runs utilizing the AgMIP crop model simulations and RAPs so that impacts
    can be assessed under consistent socio-economic scenarios. Regional models are
    intercompared for a selected set of regions where high-resolution biophysical
    and economic data are available. For these regions, it will be possible to compare
    alternative methods for coupling biophysical and economic models (e.g., Antle
    et al., 2001), as well as cross-validate global models with regional models for
    socioeconomic indicators that include poverty and risk of hunger. For global economic
    model intercomparison, an initial activity is underway using a set of models with
    global coverage and a range of other key features, including: 1. Significant disaggregation,
    to the country level at a minimum. 2. Explicit integration of biophysical modeling
    at a relatively high spatial resolution of crop response to management, choice
    of variety, and weather. 3. Water supply and demand responses to weather and irrigation
    infrastructure investment. 4. Some mechanisms to model biotic stresses and yield
    gaps. 5. Multiple policy levers for agricultural trade and investments of many
    kinds. 3.4. Information Technology Team protocols The AgMIP Information Technology
    (IT) Team facilitates model integration, intercomparisons, and assessments done
    by the other AgMIP teams by supplying useful and innovative solutions from the
    IT domain. The overall aim of the Information Technology Team is to develop an
    IT infrastructure that allows easy and secure access to shared data, scenarios,
    models, and results of AgMIP researchers, with both a short-term perspective for
    the completion of AgMIP goals and a long-term perspective for open public access
    to facilitate continuing research and applications of AgMIP data (Fig. 8). Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 8. AgMIP database management and exchange system.
    Project data and models are accessed via a model and data interface to a common
    database. A separate community interface allows project results to be shared openly.
    The objectives of the IT Team are to: 1. Develop the AgMIP Harmonized Database,
    a data-sharing mechanism with metadata, semantic inter-operability through the
    shared definition of variables, parameters, inputs, and outputs across models.
    2. Link data conversion tools to the AgMIP Harmonized Database. 3. Design and
    implement an online geo-enabled results viewer, for presentation of results in
    graphs, charts, maps, and tables. 4. Develop or apply a modeling framework that
    simplifies running multiple models jointly, either from different domains or from
    a single domain. Providing these IT solutions is challenging because AgMIP teams
    and participants are widely distributed across the globe with differing access
    to the internet and advanced hardware. There is a large diversity of data and
    models covering a span of domains and each have their proprietary developments,
    specific implementations, and purposes. The two AgMIP scientific tracks and the
    complex subject matter lead to a wide set of user demands on IT infrastructure.
    Other domains, most notably bio-informatics (Stein, 2002) and plant biology (http://iplantcollaborative.org/),
    have faced and overcome similar challenges by setting up an advanced IT infrastructure.
    An important determinant in integrating across domains, scales, and geographical
    locations is the adoption of shared formats through standards and shared language
    through semantic interoperability (Janssen et al., 2011). Semantic interoperability
    has been achieved through the use of ontologies (Gruber, 1993). Relevant examples
    for agriculture and climate are FAO''s Agrovoc ontologies (www.fao.org/agrovoc)
    and the SEAMLESS ontologies (Athanasiadis et al., 2009), and the climate and forecast
    metadata conventions (Eaton et al., 2010), respectively. Available standards are
    being critically reviewed, so that they can be adopted and extended to suit AgMIP
    goals. 4. AgMIP Cross-Cutting Themes In addition to AgMIP''s four disciplinary
    teams, AgMIP has identified three Cross-Cutting Themes that require transdisciplinary
    collaboration to achieve AgMIP goals. 4.1. Uncertainty End-users, stakeholders,
    and the broader scientific community have made it clear that projected climate
    impacts are not useful unless related uncertainties are characterized and assessed.
    For its evaluation of future food security, AgMIP''s transdisciplinary framework
    produces cascading uncertainty passed from an ensemble of climate simulations
    under several scenarios to an ensemble of crop model simulations, which are then
    aggregated to force an ensemble of economic models. AgMIP is developing methods
    to identify and track uncertainties throughout its framework, beginning with pilot
    investigations that quantify the contribution of uncertainty in yield changes
    owing to climate scenario and crop model distributions. Uncertainty owing to observational
    dataset errors are also tracked through the framework. In this way AgMIP can provide
    estimates of uncertainty at various phases of the impacts assessment process and
    pinpoint crucial bottlenecks, which will help prioritize future data collection
    and model improvement efforts. Uncertainty estimates of the full ensemble of AgMIP
    results are presented as cumulative distributions describing the probability of
    each outcome. In some cases this will be an empirical distribution, based on the
    finite number of models in an ensemble. In others this will be a continuous distribution,
    if, for example, parameter uncertainty is described by a normal distribution.
    These distributions are summarized by standard deviation or confidence intervals.
    It is important to emphasize that the level of uncertainty depends on the formulation
    of the prediction problem. For example, Wallach et al. (2012) found that uncertainty
    in predicting yield averaged over many climate scenarios was much smaller than
    the uncertainty in prediction for a given scenario. The realism of the AgMIP uncertainty
    estimates will be verified to the extent possible by comparing the probability
    distributions of hindcasts with historic data using confidence intervals and the
    Brier score. Climate uncertainties have been widely explored by the IPCC (Solomon
    et al., 2007); however, fewer studies have explored uncertainties introduced by
    crop and economics models (e.g., Aggarwal, 1995, Monod et al., 2006, Challinor
    et al., 2009). AgMIP allows the quantification of uncertainties relating to weather,
    soil, and management inputs; model parameters; and model formulation. AgMIP will
    evaluate the likelihood of extreme agroclimatic events (e.g., droughts, heavy
    downpours, extreme heat, cold, and frost) and their impacts. In economic models,
    uncertainties include population and income growth rates, elasticity estimates,
    rate of technological development, and price shocks. 4.2. Aggregation and scaling
    AgMIP research initiatives must overcome significant obstacles in scale dependence
    to link field-level crop models to regional and global economic models. AgMIP
    is developing and evaluating procedures to scale field-level outputs up to regional
    and country scales. Aggregation is facilitated by the availability of quality
    geographic data regarding the spatial distribution of climate (daily weather),
    topography, soils, land-use, farm-level management, socioeconomic conditions,
    and reported yields. While excellent data exist in some regions, data-sparse regions
    are often those with large spatial heterogeneity in farming conditions and practices.
    For these regions, AgMIP will investigate the potential of satellite, remote sensing,
    and other observational products to fill gaps in data. Techniques used in agricultural
    models that operate on scales closer to global climate model resolutions and have
    regional and global foci (such as GLAM, Challinor et al., 2004; LPJmL, Bondeau
    et al., 2007; PEGASUS, Deryng et al., 2011; IMPACT, Nelson et al., 2009; GLOBIOM,
    Havlík et al., 2011) will also be compared. Aggregation of field-scale crop model
    outputs to a regional or larger-scale economic model generally follows one of
    several approaches (e.g., Hansen and Jones, 2000, Ewert et al., 2011). One approach
    involves disaggregating the region into approximately homogeneous sub-regions
    in a type of biophysical typology (Hazeu et al., 2010) with associated AgMIP Sentinel
    Sites for calibrated crop model simulations, and then converting yields to regional
    production using planted areas in each sub-region (Burke et al., 1991, de Jager
    et al., 1998, Yu et al., 2010, Ruane et al., in press-b). Another approach uses
    multivariate sensitivity tests to cast probabilistic distributions of farm-level
    conditions into an estimate of regional production (Haskett et al., 1995). In
    a third approach, farm behavior is explicitly taken into account, and crop models
    are linked to farm economic models to provide farm production estimates, which
    can subsequently be upscaled through response functions (Pérez Domínguez et al.,
    2009, Ewert et al., 2009). A fourth approach is to make crop model simulations
    at high spatial resolution but with relatively coarse management differences,
    potentially utilizing reported regional yields to assist in bias-correction. Relative
    responses to different climate futures are then aggregated up to economic units
    of analysis and used to adjust exogenously-determined changes in productivity
    (Nelson et al., 2010). 4.3. Representative Agricultural Pathways To enable a simulation
    framework with consistent climate, economics, and field-level assumptions across
    a range of scales, a Cross-Cutting Theme is building on previous and current agricultural
    scenario development to create a set of Representative Agricultural Pathways (RAPs).
    These provide a linked set of necessary variables for field-level crop models
    and regional and global economic models in AgMIP assessments (Fig. 9). These scenarios
    help constrain uncertainty in each region, allowing stakeholders and policymakers
    to assess risk, and also contribute to monitoring, evaluation, and decision-making.

    AgMIP framework, demonstrating that AgMIP results are determined by specified
    Representative Concentration and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (RCPs and SSPs),
    and Representative Agricultural Pathways (RAPs). To ensure that climate and agricultural
    scenarios are not contradictory, the basis for the RAPs is the set of SRES emissions
    scenarios and RCPs used in the IPCC AR4 and AR5, respectively (SRES, 2000, Taylor
    et al., 2009). The RAPs description of national, regional, and global policy also
    links to the socio-economic scenarios developed for IPCC AR4 and AR5 (Moss et
    al., 2010). Potential RAPs variables for economic models include population growth,
    income growth, and technology changes, as well as trade, investment, energy, and
    agricultural policy. AgMIP RAPs also act to capture plausible farm-level improvements,
    as climate change impacts assessments that assume static farm management are generally
    pessimistic in their lack of development and adaptation (Burton et al., 2001).
    To better model crops at the farm scale, the economic, technological, and scientific
    development of each agricultural region will be used to specify plausible regional
    land use, irrigation, fertilizer and chemical applications, regional shifts in
    crop species, and improved genetic characteristics of cultivars that may be developed
    or more widely distributed in the coming decades. These more detailed analyses
    of adaptation will also improve the capacity to understand the potential spatial
    relocation of crops in response to climate change, using both regional and global
    economic models. Several RAPs will be created to specify evolving conditions for
    farm-level management options and country/regional-level economic policies over
    the 21st century. AgMIP RAPs will facilitate an important assessment of the scale-dependent
    and intertwining roles of climate change, economic development, and adaptation
    on the agricultural sector. AgMIP RAPs will also contribute to standardizing agricultural
    model simulations of future conditions, allowing independent researchers to directly
    compare their results. 5. AgMIP protocol examples As illustrations of the need
    for and use of AgMIP Protocols, crop model sensitivity and future climate impacts
    were tested for a wheat site in Mexico and projections of climate change economic
    effects on agriculture were compared at regional, national, and global scales.
    5.1. Wheat Yield near Obregón, Mexico Crop model simulations were conducted for
    wheat in Mexico with emphasis on the differential responses of multiple crop models
    and the resulting uncertainties. A subset of AgMIP climate scenarios was generated
    for Obregón, Mexico (27.33°N, 109. 9°W). Fig. 10 demonstrates the range of mean
    temperature changes for AgMIP future periods projected by an ensemble of 16 CMIP3
    GCMs, the first priority scenarios in the AgMIP Protocols (Note that the pilot''s
    baseline period went from 1974–2003 as opposed to the standard 1980–2009 AgMIP
    baseline period). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. 16-GCM ensemble

    A2 and (b) B1 scenarios. Boxes represent the inter-quartile range (IQR) and whiskers
    represent the furthest value within 1.5× IQR (values beyond this are considered
    outliers). The solid line connects median scenarios for each period, while dotted
    lines track the maximum and minimum. Vertical dashed lines denote each 30-year
    time period. Note that the baseline period in this experiment differs from the
    standard AgMIP baseline period of 1980-2009. Five crop models, APSIM-Nwheat (Asseng,
    2004), CERES-Wheat (Ritchie et al., 1985), two SALUS wheat models (Basso et al.,
    2010), and APES-Wheat (Donatelli et al., 2010, Ewert et al., 2009) were used for
    baseline analysis, sensitivity tests, and future climate simulations. Crop modeling
    groups were first supplied with observed field experimental data from Obregón,
    Mexico (Sayre et al., 1997) for model calibration (Table 2). Since this process
    can be hampered by the lack of suitable experimental data in some regions of the
    world, the implications of partially calibrated crop models on climate impact
    simulations are explored in the AgMIP Crop Model Pilots and Uncertainty Cross-Cutting
    Theme. Table 2. AgMIP Sentinel Site data for Obregón, Mexico. Environment • Daily

    • Anthesis and maturity dates The variability in grain yields between the years
    was influenced by season-to-season temperature and radiation variability, as crops
    were well-watered and well-fertilized each year (Fig. 11a). Thirty-year coefficients
    of variation of simulated yields averaged 12.1% across all crop models, which
    is smaller than the typical variability in observations from experiments in typical
    rain-fed environments (Taylor et al., 1999). All crop models were remarkably consistent
    in their yield variability. Simulated grain yields were within the range of observed
    grain yields for the period 1990–1995 (Sayre et al., 1997). Simulated wheat yield
    responses to increasing air temperature are shown in Fig. 11b. The standard deviation
    among the wheat models was not constant with changes in air temperature and was
    largest at the highest temperature increase. In general, the simulated yield response
    to increased temperature was similar to the reported observed yield response to
    increased temperature under well-watered and well-fertilized growing conditions
    (Lobell and Ortiz-Monasterio, 2007, Wheeler et al., 1996). All crop models indicated
    an increase in yield with an increasing atmospheric [CO2] (Fig. 11c). However,
    the individual quantitative response of each model differed, with the difference
    between the models varying at each [CO2]. The simulated mean relative response
    of 19.6% (±2.8%STD) of grain yield to an elevated [CO2] of 550 ppm (Fig. 11d)
    was consistent with non-water limited and non-N-limited Free-Air CO2 Enrichment
    (FACE) reported by Amthor (2001). However, this response is higher than that found
    by Ainsworth et al. (2008), and could be less under N-limited conditions or more
    under water-limited conditions (Kimball, 2010). Download : Download full-size

    five different GCMs. The atmospheric CO2 concentrations were 351 ppm for the baseline,

    distribution of yields among scenarios; and (f) cumulative probability distribution
    of yield changes among scenarios. The five crop models at Obregón were driven
    by ten mid-century scenarios (2040–2069) created using the delta approach based
    on changes from five different CMIP3 GCMs (CSIRO MK3.0, Gordon et al., 2002; GFDL
    CM2.1, Delworth et al., 2006; MPI Echam5, Jungclaus et al., 2006; NCAR CCSM3.0,
    Collins et al., 2006; and HadCM3, Johns et al., 2006) and two emissions scenarios
    (A2 and B1; SRES, 2000) and then compared to the historical baseline period. Two
    additional scenarios were created using the delta approach based on changes projected
    using ¼ and ½ degree statistical downscaling (Bias-Corrected Spatial Disaggregation,
    BCSD, downscaling method; Wood et al., 2004, Maurer et al., 2007, Maurer et al.,
    2009) of the MPI Echam5 A2 climate simulations to explore the sensitivity of climate
    scenarios to the presence and extent of downscaling. Each of these scenarios assumed
    no change in climate variability. Atmospheric [CO2] was set at 351 ppm for the
    baseline, 498 ppm for the B1, and 556 ppm for the A2 climate change scenarios,
    each representing the central year''s concentration for the 31-year period. Simulated
    yields were analyzed following methods used by Gouache et al. (in press) to quantify
    causes and effects of variation, and the probability and uncertainty of projected
    outcomes. On average, wheat yields were reduced in all five crop models under
    the future scenarios, mainly at the lower yield range (Fig. 11e). Yields in the
    A2 scenario were more reduced than in the B1 scenario. While higher projected
    temperatures in the future climate scenarios reduced grain yields (Fig. 11b),
    the increased atmospheric [CO2] compensated for some of these losses (Fig. 11c
    and d). The simulated yields using the two different downscaling approaches were
    only slightly different from the simulated yields using the A2 GCM scenarios.
    There was at least a 60% probability of 30-year mean yields declining by 2040–2069
    across scenarios and downscaling approaches (assuming an equal likelihood of all
    model/scenario combinations), and a corresponding <40% chance of increases in
    yield (Fig. 11f). There was 30% probability of >10% yield loss with A2, a 10%
    probability of >10% yield reduction with B1, and an ∼15% chance of >10% yield
    reduction with the downscaling scenarios (Fig. 11f). On average, grain yields
    were reduced by only a few percent with little difference between the scenarios
    and downscaling approaches (Fig. 12). For a given emissions scenario, differences
    in the projections of temperature changes from the five GCMs are shown by the
    horizontal scatter and error bars in Fig. 12, but note that each scenario does
    not have the same atmospheric [CO2]. Most of the variability in absolute yield
    response to a given emission scenario was caused by the five crop models rather
    than by differences in the five GCMs. For example, 88% of the simulated variance
    in A2 yields was a first-order effect due to variability between crop models (which
    may be influenced by biases in the baseline calibration), 10% was the first-order
    effect due to variability between GCMs, and we attribute the residual 2% to crop
    model/GCM interactions. This is apparent in the mean yields’ wide vertical scatter
    for any given temperature value in Fig. 12. This scatter remained much larger
    than the sensitivity of any given model''s simulated yield to the climate changes.

    and downscaling approaches. Larger filled symbols represent the average across
    experiments, with bars showing the standard deviation (horizontal bars for GCMs’

    CO2 concentrations are 351 ppm for baseline, 498 ppm for B1, and 556 ppm for A2.
    5.2. Sensitivity of projections to economic model resolution To illustrate the
    value of AgMIP to economic model intercomparison and improvement, we consider
    the role of scenario definition and model resolution by examining predictions
    of the national economic model used in the 2001 U.S. National Climate Assessment
    (Reilly et al., 2003), and the predictions of a sub-national integrated assessment
    model (Antle et al., 2004) for wheat production in the Northern Plains of the
    United States. The national model is based on data aggregated to U.S. regions,
    whereas the regional model is based on farm-level simulations aggregated to the
    regional level. The U.S. Assessment''s estimates for changes in wheat production
    due to climate change ranged from approximately −13 to +17%, depending on climate
    model and adaptation assumptions, whereas the Montana study showed yields ranging
    from −47 to +57% (Table 3). Economic returns in the Montana study also varied
    widely, depending on the CO2 fertilization effect and the degree of adaptation,
    from −60 to +69%. In contrast, the impacts on producer surplus obtained in the
    U.S. Assessment with aggregate data were small and negative for the Great Plains
    region. Thus, the disaggregated results imply a much higher degree of uncertainty
    about possible outcomes, with much more adverse outcomes possible if the effects
    of adaptation and CO2 fertilization are not fully realized. Table 3. Montana agro-ecological
    zone wheat yield and net returns changes for 2050, and US wheat yield changes
    for 2030 and 2090 using the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling GCM (%), revealing
    uncertainties owing to scenario definition and economic model resolution. Empty

    al. (2004). US data are from McCarl (2008); first number is for 2030, second number
    is for 2090, both with adaptation. These two economic studies used the same global
    climate model but different crop models, as well as different types of economic
    models and data aggregation. Thus, it is not possible to disentangle differences
    in predictions due to climate and crop models from differences due to economic
    models and aggregation. AgMIP facilitates economic model intercomparison using
    common climate scenarios and crop models, so economists will be able to identify
    differences in predictions caused by differences in economic model structure and
    data aggregation. Similar intercomparisons will be possible between global and
    regional economic models. 5.3. Sensitivity of global economic projections to model
    linkages and inter-model uncertainty Global economic model intercomparisons contribute
    to future projections of food security and adaptation in three ways: (1) improvements
    in individual models such as those describing crop and economic performance, (2)
    improvements in linkages across these models, and (3) an assessment of inter-model
    differences and uncertainty. The economic models may also serve to more realistically
    capture the transdisciplinary effects of climate on agriculture by closely linking
    biophysical models and socioeconomic behavior. A recent example of the benefits
    of linking models for plausible scenarios, reported in Nelson et al. (2010), demonstrates
    the challenges addressed in the AgMIP Protocols for model intercomparison. In
    this example, the linked modeling environments include climate, hydrology, water
    resources, crop, and socioeconomic conditions. Five quantitative perspectives
    on 2050 climate were used to drive agronomic performance of the important food
    and feed crops using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT;
    Jones et al., 2003) suite of crop models. A hydrology model also used the climate
    data to determine water supply as an input into a water supply-demand model. The
    water model then determined water availability for irrigation, generating yield
    stress factors for irrigated crop production. The water model and DSSAT productivity
    effects were combined to drive aggregated crop productivity effects in the International
    Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) IMPACT model. Three overall scenarios (optimistic,
    baseline, pessimistic) of GDP and population futures (similar to the proposed
    AgMIP RAPs) are each paired with the five climate scenarios for a total of 15
    plausible futures. Nelson et al. (2010) used prices as a useful single indicator
    of the range of possible outcomes. The first three columns of Table 4 report mean
    price changes from 2010 to 2050 for maize, rice, and wheat across the three overall
    scenarios as well as standard deviations and coefficients of variation. The price
    increases reflect a dramatic change in the long-term outlook for crop prices relative
    to the 20th century when prices declined throughout the period. The second three
    columns report the mean effect of climate change isolated from simultaneous future
    economic development, comparing price increases in a future with a perfect mitigation
    climate scenario to the mean of those under the other four climate scenarios.
    Table 4. Price outcomes of the IMPACT scenarios. For each crop and economic scenario,
    results are shown for economic development and climate change under an ensemble
    of GCM scenarios (left three columns) and for economic development assuming perfect

    Table 7 in Nelson et al. (2010). This analysis suggests both the value of the
    AgMIP activities and the challenges in doing model intercomparisons with so many
    linked processes. It is not sufficient to only compare results from the various
    wheat models, for example. Improvements in understanding of agricultural futures
    require integration of the range of projected yields of multiple crops across
    various emissions scenarios, climate models, crop models, and economic models,
    all with associated uncertainties. An important contribution of AgMIP is to facilitate
    examination of additional dimensions of uncertainty in global economic analyses,
    allowing economic model differences and inter-model uncertainty to be quantified
    through multi-model assessment. 6. Crop-specific, regional, and global AgMIP activities
    AgMIP activities that are underway include pilot studies on specific crops, integrated
    regional assessments, and global crop and economic model intercomparisons. 6.1.
    AgMIP crop-specific studies The Crop Modeling Team has defined a series of studies
    that include crop model intercomparisons on a crop-by-crop basis. These characterize
    uncertainties in predicted responses to climate change variables using high-quality
    AgMIP Sentinel Sites around the world. Fig. 13 shows the locations of crop model
    intercomparisons for the AgMIP Wheat, Maize, and Rice Pilots (pilots for sugarcane,
    sorghum, millet, soybean, peanut, potato, and others are also in development).
    Groups that have developed models for the specific crops lead these analyses,
    and the AgMIP Protocol-based activities are open to all crop models and modeling
    groups for each target crop. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 13. Sentinal

    6.2. Regional AgMIP activities AgMIP Regions are geographical areas in which collaborations
    are developed to implement the Protocols and provide outputs for use in regional
    and global assessments. AgMIP regional activities are underway in Sub-Saharan
    Africa, South Asia, North America, South America, Europe, and in development in
    Australia and East Asia (see Fig. 13). In Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, ten
    multi-disciplinary and international teams are undertaking integrated analyses
    of food production systems with a special focus on adaptation to climate change
    to improve food security in their regions (Rosenzweig et al., 2012). In other
    regions, AgMIP is holding workshops to bring together climate scientists, agronomists,
    and economists from leading national, regional, and international institutions
    to build capacity and conduct simulations and analyses at field-to-regional scales
    according to the AgMIP Protocols. Participation from scientists in all agricultural
    regions is crucial to AgMIP goals, as local expertise is vital to establishing
    grounded simulations for regional agriculture and improving prediction of global
    agricultural futures. 6.3. Global AgMIP activities The AgMIP Coordinated Climate-Crop
    Modeling Pilot (C3MP) is organizing crop modelers from around the world to run
    consistent experiments (at sites where they are currently modeling) using AgMIP
    climate scenarios and to submit results to the AgMIP Harmonized Database (see
    http://www.agmip.org/). The robustness and detail of regional projections of the
    agricultural impacts of climate change will improve incrementally with each result
    for an additional crop, site, and/or model. These pilot results will also form
    a starting point against which the improvement of crop models and regional and
    global assessments through AgMIP activities may be gauged. AgMIP is also coordinating
    global biophysical and economic model intercomparisons, bringing together key
    international modeling groups to test reference and future climate scenarios as
    part of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP, 2012).
    7. Conclusions, project milestones, and future plans AgMIP aims to enable a major
    advance by rigorously characterizing climate change impacts on agriculture in
    both biophysical and socioeconomic systems (see Table 5 for milestones). The Protocols
    and preliminary results presented here show that there is now enhanced capacity
    for the agricultural climate change research community to conduct such model intercomparisons
    and improvements, as well as to coordinate multi-model assessments of future climate
    impacts and adaptation on the agricultural sector and food security. AgMIP has
    begun the process of identifying Sentinel Sites with high-quality climate, soils,
    crop cultivar, crop management, and socioeconomic data for rigorous model intercomparisons
    and assessments. AgMIP research activities are underway in many regions. Table

    AgMIP is developing through a process of strong international collaborations.
    A major goal of AgMIP is to create capacity-building partnerships around the world,
    enhancing the ability of researchers in each agricultural region, as well as globally,
    to evaluate current and future climate impacts and adaptations, and thus contribute
    to future food security. Acknowledgements We acknowledge the significant contribution

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size

    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic growth
    of any country. With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic
    conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the
    food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as
    smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges
    in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology
    is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being
    explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm
    machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article,
    authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture.
    The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon
    and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops
    and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification
    of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield
    assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production
    by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour
    based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation
    which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also
    reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent. This article demonstrates
    how knowledge-based agriculture can improve the sustainable productivity and quality
    of the product. A graphical abstract for Machine Learning Applications for Precision

    Bluetooth Low Energy SECTION I. Introduction The population of the world will
    increase to 9.1 billion approximately thirty-four percent as of today by the end
    of 2050. Food requirement will increase by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization,
    land availability for agriculture will decrease drastically in the coming years.
    India will be the most populated country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging
    the domestic food production. The main reason for reduced food production is the
    lack of planning, unpredictable weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation
    techniques and livestock mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced
    a drastic change in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature
    of the earth has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic
    conditions. Frequent droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor
    farmers. According to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse
    climatic conditions, reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture
    [1], [2] is one of the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world
    [3]. Precision agriculture also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled
    data-driven sustainable farm management system. It is basically the adoption of
    modern information technologies, software tools, and smart embedded devices for
    decision support in agriculture [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture
    and the green revolution are the two key components of the first and second agriculture
    revolution. Precision farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution
    [5]. FIGURE 1. Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology
    in 1990 for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning
    system (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce
    the production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.
    Foundation of ML and DL algorithms which find their application in precision agriculture
    has been discussed. Performance comparison for various ML, DL algorithms in precision

    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.
    Li et al. [65] build a statistical model for predicting the rain-fed crop yield
    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters

    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    amounts of data have been produced, since the past decade as the miniaturization
    of Internet of things (IoT) devices increases. However, such data are not useful
    without analytic power. Numerous big data, IoT, and analytics solutions have enabled
    people to obtain valuable insight into large data generated by IoT devices. However,
    these solutions are still in their infancy, and the domain lacks a comprehensive
    survey. This paper investigates the state-of-the-art research efforts directed

    DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2689040 Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction
    The development of big data and the Internet of things (IoT) is rapidly accelerating
    and affecting all areas of technologies and businesses by increasing the benefits
    for organizations and individuals. The growth of data produced via IoT has played
    a major role on the big data landscape. Big data can be categorized according
    to three aspects: (a) volume, (b) variety, and (c) velocity [1]. These categories
    were first introduced byGartner to describe the elements of big data challenges
    [2]. Immense opportunities are presented by the capability to analyze and utilize
    huge amounts of IoT data, including applications in smart cities, smart transport
    and grid systems, energy smart meters, and remote patient healthcare monitoring
    devices. The widespread popularity of IoT has made big data analytics challenging
    because of the processing and collection of data through different sensors in
    the IoT environment. The International Data Corporation (IDC) report indicates
    that the big data market will reach over US$125 billion by 2019 [3]. IoT big data
    analytics can be defined as the steps in which a variety of IoT data are examined
    [4] to reveal trends, unseen patterns, hidden correlations, and new information
    [5]. Companies and individuals can benefit from analyzing large amounts of data
    and managing huge amounts of information that can affect businesses [6]. Therefore,
    IoT big data analytics aims to assist business associations and other organizations
    to achieve improved understanding of data, and thus, make efficient and well-informed
    decisions. Big data analytics enables data miners and scientists to analyze huge
    amounts of unstructured data that can be harnessed using traditional tools [5].
    Moreover,big data analytics aims to immediately extract knowledgeable information
    using data mining techniques that help in making predictions, identifying recent
    trends, finding hidden information, and making decisions [7]. Techniques in data
    mining are widely deployed for both problem-specific methods and generalized data
    analytics. Accordingly, statistical and machine learning methods are utilized.
    IoT data are different from normal big data collected via systems in terms of
    characteristics because of the various sensors and objects involved during data
    collection, which include heterogeneity, noise, variety, and rapid growth. Statistics
    [8] show that the number of sensors will be increased by 1 trillion in 2030. This
    increase will affect the growth of big data. Introducing data analytics and IoT
    into big data requires huge resources, and IoT has the capability to offer an
    excellent solution. Appropriate resources and intensive applications of the platforms
    are provided by IoT services for effective communication among various deployed
    applications. Such process is suitable for fulfilling the requirements of IoT
    applications, and can reduce some challenges in the future of big data analytics.
    This technological amalgamation increases the possibility of implementing IoT
    toward a better direction. Moreover, implementing IoT and big data integration
    solutions can help address issues on storage, processing, data analytics, and
    visualization tools. It can also assist in improving collaboration and communication
    among various objects in a smart city [9]. Application areas, such as smart ecological
    environments, smart traffic, smart grids, intelligent buildings, and logistic
    intelligent management, can benefit from the aforementioned arrangement. Many
    studies on big data has focused on big data management; in particular, big data
    analytics has been surveyed [10], [11]. However, this survey focused on IoT big
    data in the context of the analytics of a huge amount of data. The contributions
    of this survey are as follows. State-of-the-art research efforts conducted in
    terms of big data analytics are investigated. An architecture for big IoT data
    analytics is proposed. Several unprecedented opportunities brought by data analytics
    in the IoT domain are introduced. Credible use cases are presented. Research challenges
    that remain to be addressed are identified and discussed. These contributions
    are presented from Sections 3 to 6. The conclusion is provided in Section 7. SECTION
    II. Overview of IoT and Big Data An overview of IoT technologies and big data
    is provided before the discussion. A. IoT IoT offers a platform for sensors and
    devices to communicate seamlessly within a smart environment and enables information
    sharing across platforms in a convenient manner. The recent adaptation of different
    wireless technologies places IoT as the next revolutionary technology by benefiting
    from the full opportunities offered by the Internet technology. IoT has witnessed
    its recent adoption in smart cities with interest in developing intelligent systems,
    such as smart office, smart retail, smart agriculture, smart water, smart transportation,
    smart healthcare, and smart energy [12], [13]. IoT has emerged as a new trend
    in the last few years, where mobile devices, transportation facilities, public
    facilities, and home appliances can all be used as data acquisition equipment
    in IoT. All surrounding electronic equipment to facilitate daily life operations,
    such as wristwatches, vending machines, emergency alarms, and garage doors, as
    well as home appliances, such as refrigerators, microwave ovens, air conditioners,
    and water heaters are connected to an IoT network and can be controlled remotely.
    Ciufo [14] stated that these devices “talk” to one another and to central controlling
    devices. Such devices deployed in different areas may collect various kinds of
    data, such as geographical, astronomical, environmental, and logistical data.
    A large number of communication devices in the IoT paradigm are embedded into
    sensor devices in the real world. Data collecting devices sense data and transmit
    these data using embedded communication devices. The continuum of devices and
    objects are interconnected through a variety of communication solutions, such
    as Bluetooth, WiFi, ZigBee, and GSM. These communication devices transmit data
    and receive commands from remotely controlled devices, which allow direct integration
    with the physical world through computer-based systems to improve living standards.
    Over 50 billion devices ranging from smartphones, laptops, sensors, and game consoles
    are anticipated to be connected to the Internet through several heterogeneous
    access networks enabled by technologies, such as radio frequency identification
    (RFID) and wireless sensor networks. Reference [15] mentioned that IoT could be
    recognized in three paradigms: Internet-oriented, sensors, and knowledge [16].
    The recent adaptation of different wireless technologies places IoT as the next
    revolutionary technology by benefiting from the full opportunities offered by
    Internet technology. B. Big Data The volume of data generated by sensors, devices,
    social media, health care applications, temperature sensors, and various other
    software applications and digital devices that continuously generate large amounts
    of structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data is strongly increasing. This
    massive data generation results in “big data” [17]. Traditional database systems
    are inefficient when storing, processing, and analyzing rapidly growing amount
    of data or big data [18]. The term “big data” has been used in the previous literature
    but is relatively new in business and IT [19]. An example of big data-related
    studies is the next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity; McKinsey
    Global Institute [20] defined big data as the size of data sets that are a better
    database system tool than the usual tools for capturing, storing, processing,
    and analyzing such data [18]. “The Digital Universe” study [21] labels big data
    technologies as a new generation of technologies and architectures that aim to
    take out the value from a massive volume of data with various formats by enabling
    high-velocity capture, discovery, and analysis. This previous study also characterizes
    big data into three aspects: (a) data sources, (b) data analytics, and (c) the
    presentation of the results of the analytics. This definition uses the 3V’s (volume,
    variety, velocity) model proposed by Beyer [2]. The model highlights an e-commerce
    trend in data management that faces challenges to manage volume or size of data,
    variety or different sources of data, and velocity or speed of data creation.
    Some studies declare volume as a main characteristic of big data without providing
    a pure definition [22]. However, other researchers introduced additional characteristics
    for big data, such as veracity, value, variability, and complexity [23], [24].
    The 3V’s model, or its derivations, is the most common descriptions of the term
    “big data.” SECTION III. Big Data Analytics Big data analytics involves the processes
    of searching a database, mining, and analyzing data dedicated to improve company
    performance [25]. Big data analytics is the process of examining large data sets
    that contain a variety of data types [4] to reveal unseen patterns, hidden correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful business information [5].
    The capability to analyze large amounts of data can help an organization deal
    with considerable information that can affect the business [6]. Therefore, the
    main objective of big data analytics is to assist business associations to have
    improved understanding of data, and thus, make efficient and well-informed decisions.
    Big data analytics enables data miners and scientists to analyze a large volume
    of data that may not be harnessed using traditional tools [5]. Big data analytics
    require technologies and tools that can transform a large amount of structured,
    unstructured, and semi-structured data into a more understandable data and metadata
    format for analytical processes. The algorithms used in these analytical tools
    must discover patterns, trends, and correlations over a variety of time horizons
    in the data [26]. After analyzing the data, these tools visualize the findings
    in tables, graphs, and spatial charts for efficient decision making. Thus, big
    data analysis is a serious challenge for many applications because of data complexity
    and the scalability of underlying algorithms that support such processes [27].
    Talia (2013) highlighted that obtaining helpful information from big data analysis
    is a critical matter that requires scalable analytical algorithms and techniques
    to return well-timed results, whereas current techniques and algorithms are inefficient
    to handle big data analytics. Therefore, large infrastructure and additional applications
    are necessary to support data parallelism. Moreover, data sources, such as high-speed
    data stream received from different data sources, have different formats, which
    makes integrating multiple sources for analytics solutions critical [28]. Hence,
    the challenge is focused on the performance of current algorithms used in big
    data analysis, which is not rising linearly with the rapid increase in computational
    resources [19]. Big data analytics processes consume considerable time to provide
    feedback and guidelines to users, whereas only a few tools [29] can process huge
    data sets within reasonable amount of processing time. By contrast, most of the
    remaining tools use the complicated trial-and-error method to deal with massive
    amounts of data sets and data heterogeneity [30]. Big data analytics systems exist.
    For example, the Exploratory Data Analysis Environment [31] is a big data visual
    analytics system that is used to analyze complex earth system simulations with
    large numbers of data sets. A. Existing Analytics Systems Different analytic types
    are used according to the requirements of IoT applications [32]. These analytic
    types are discussed in this subsection under real-time, off-line, memory-level,
    business intelligence (BI) level, and massive level analytics categories. Moreover,
    a comparison based on analytics types and their levels is presented in Table 1.
    TABLE 1 Comparison of Different Analytics Types and Their Levels Real-time analytics
    is typically performed on data collected from sensors. In this situation, data
    change constantly, and rapid data analytics techniques are required to obtain
    an analytical result within a short period. Consequently, two existing architectures
    have been proposed for real-time analysis: parallel processing clusters using
    traditional relational databases and memory-based computing platforms [33]. Greenplum
    [34] and Hana [35] are examples of real-time analytics architecture. Off-line
    analytics is used when a quick response is not required [32]. For example, many
    Internet enterprises use Hadoop-based off-line analytics architecture to reduce
    the cost of data format conversion [36]. Such analytics improves data acquisition
    efficiency. SCRIBE [37], Kafka [38], Time-Tunnel [39], and Chukwa [40] are examples
    of architectures that conduct off-line analytics and can satisfy the demands of
    data acquisition. Memory-level analytics is applied when the size of data is smaller
    than the memory of a cluster [32]. To date, the memory of clusters has reached
    terabyte (TB) level [41]. Therefore, several internal database technologies are
    required to improve analytical efficiency. Memory-level analytics is suitable
    for conducting real-time analysis. MongoDB [42] is an example of this architecture.
    BI analytics is adopted when the size of data is larger than the memory level,
    but in this case, data may be imported to the BI analysis environment [43]. BI
    analytic currently supports TB-level data [32]. Moreover, BI can help discover
    strategic business opportunities from the flood of data. In addition, BI analytics
    allows easy interpretation of data volumes. Identifying new opportunities and
    implementing an effective strategy provide competitive market advantage and long-term
    stability. Massive analytics is applied when the size of data is greater than
    the entire capacity of the BI analysis product and traditional databases [44].
    Massive analytics uses the Hadoop distributed file system for data storage and
    map/reduce for data analysis. Massive analytics helps create the business foundation
    and increases market competitiveness by extracting meaningful values from data.
    Moreover, massive analytics obtains accurate data that leverage the risks involved
    in making any business decision. In addition, massive analytics provides services
    effectively. B. Relationship Between IoT and Big Data Analytics Big data analytics
    is rapidly emerging as a key IoT initiative to improve decision making. One of
    the most prominent features of IoT is its analysis of information about “connected
    things.” Big data analytics in IoT requires processing a large amount of data
    on the fly and storing the data in various storage technologies. Given that much
    of the unstructured data are gathered directly from web-enabled “things,” big
    data implementations will necessitate performing lightning-fast analytics with
    large queries to allow organizations to gain rapid insights, make quick decisions,
    and interact with people and other devices. The interconnection of sensing and
    actuating devices provide the capability to share information across platforms
    through a unified architecture and develop a common operating picture for enabling
    innovative applications. The need to adopt big data in IoT applications is compelling.
    These two technologies have already been recognized in the fields of IT and business.
    Although, the development of big data is already lagging, these technologies are
    inter-dependent and should be jointly developed. In general, the deployment of
    IoT increases the amount of data in quantity and category; hence, offering the
    opportunity for the application and development of big data analytics. Moreover,
    the application of big data technologies in IoT accelerates the research advances
    and business models of IoT. The relationship between IoT and big data, which is
    shown in Figure 1, can be divided into three steps to enable the management of
    IoT data. The first step comprises managing IoT data sources, where connected
    sensors devices use applications to interact with one another. For example, the
    interaction of devices such as CCTV cameras, smart traffic lights, and smart home
    devices, generates large amounts of data sources with different formats. This
    data can be stored in low cost commodity storage on the cloud. In the second step,
    the generated data are called “big data,” which are based on their volume, velocity,
    and variety. These huge amounts of data are stored in big data files in shared
    distributed fault-tolerant databases. The last step applies analytics tools such
    as MapReduce, Spark, Splunk, and Skytree that can analyze the stored big IoT data
    sets. The four levels of analytics start from training data, then move on to analytics
    tools, queries, and reports. FIGURE 1. Relationship between IoT and big data analytics.
    Show All C. Big Data Analytics Methods Big data analytics aim to immediately extract
    knowledgeable information that helps in making predictions, identifying recent
    trends, finding hidden information, and ultimately, making decisions [7]. Data
    mining techniques are widely deployed for both problem-specific methods and generalized
    data analytics. Accordingly, statistical and machine learning methods are utilized.
    The evolution of big data also changes analytics requirements. Although the requirements
    for efficient mechanisms lie in all aspects of big data management [30], such
    as capturing, storage, preprocessing, and analysis; for our discussion, big data
    analytics requires the same or faster processing speed than traditional data analytics
    with minimum cost for high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety data [45].
    Various solutions are available for big data analytics, and advancements in developing
    and improving these solutions are being continuously achieved to make them suitable
    for new big data trends. Data mining plays an important role in analytics, and
    most of the techniques are developed using data mining algorithms according to
    a particular scenario. Knowledge on available big data analytics options is crucial
    when evaluating and choosing an appropriate approach for decision making. In this
    section, we present several methods that can be implemented for several big data
    case studies. Some of these analytics methods are efficient for big IoT data analytics.
    Diverse and tremendous size data sets contribute more in big data insights. However,
    this belief is not always valid because more data may have more ambiguities and
    abnormalities [7]. We present big data analytics methods under classification,
    clustering, association rule mining, and prediction categories. Figure 2 depicts
    and summarizes each of these categories. Each category is a data mining function
    and involves many methods and algorithms to fulfill information extraction and
    analysis requirements. For example, Bayesian network, support vector machine (SVM),
    and k -nearest neighbor (KNN) offer classification methods. Similarly, partitioning,
    hierarchical clustering, and co-occurrence are widespread in clustering. Association
    rule mining and prediction comprise significant methods. FIGURE 2. Overview of
    big data analytics methods. Show All Classification is a supervised learning approach
    that uses prior knowledge as training data to classify data objects into groups
    [46]. A predefined category is assigned to an object, and thus, the objective
    of predicting a group or class for an object is achieved (see Figure 2). Finding
    unknown or hidden patterns is more challenging for big IoT data. Furthermore,
    extracting valuable information from large data sets to improve decision making
    is a critical task. A Bayesian network is a classification method that offers
    model interpretability. Bayesian networks are efficient for analyzing complex
    data structures revealed through big data rather than traditional structured data
    formats. These networks are directed acyclic graphs, where nodes are random variables
    and edges denote conditional dependency [47]. Naïve, selective naïve, semi-naïve
    Bayes, and Bayes multi-nets are the proposed categories for classification [48].
    Analyzing data patterns and creating groups are efficiently performed using SVM,
    which is also classification approach for big data analytics. SVM utilizes statistical
    learning theory to analyze data patterns and create groups. Several applications
    of SVM classification in big data analytics include text classification [49],
    pattern matching [50], health diagnostics [51], and commerce. Similarly, KNN is
    typically designed to provide efficient mechanisms for finding hidden patterns
    from big data sets, such that retrieved objects are similar to the predefined
    category [52]. Using cases further improve the KNN algorithm for application in
    anomaly detection [53], high-dimensional data [54], and scientific experiments
    [55]. Classification has other extensions while adopting a large number of artificial
    intelligence and data mining techniques. Consequently, classification is one of
    the widespread data mining techniques for big data analytics. Clustering is another
    data mining technique used as a big data analytics method. Contrary to classification,
    clustering uses an unsupervised learning approach and creates groups for given
    objects based on their distinctive meaningful features [56]. As we have presented
    in Figure 2 that grouping a large number of objects in the form of clusters makes
    data manipulation simple. The well-known methods used for clustering are hierarchical
    clustering and partitioning. The hierarchical clustering approach keeps combining
    small clusters of data objects to form a hierarchical tree and create agglomerative
    clusters. Divisive clusters are created in the opposite manner by dividing a single
    cluster that contains all data objects into smaller appropriate clusters [57].
    Market analysis and business decision making are the most significant applications
    of big data analytics. The process of association rule mining involves identifying
    interesting relationships among different objects, events, or other entities to
    analyze market trends, consumer buying behavior, and product demand predictions
    (see Figure 2). Association rule mining [58] focuses on identifying and creating
    rules based on the frequency of occurrences for numeric and non-numeric data.
    Data processing is performed in two manners under association rules. First, sequential
    data processing uses priori-based algorithms, such as MSPS [59] and LAPIN-SPAM
    [60], to identify interaction associations. Another significant data processing
    approach under association rule is temporal sequence analysis, which uses algorithms
    to analyze event patterns in continuous data. Predictive analytics use historical
    data, which are known as training data, to determine the results as trends or
    behavior in data. SVM and fuzzy logic algorithms are used to identify relationships
    between independent and dependent variables and to obtain regression curves for
    predictions, such as for natural disasters. Furthermore, customer buying predictions
    and social media trends are analyzed through predictive analytics [61] (see Table
    2). In the case of big data analytics, processing requirements are modified according
    to the nature and volume of data. Fast data access and mining methods for structured
    and unstructured data are major concerns related to big data analytics. Furthermore,
    data representation is a significant requirement in big data analytics. Time series
    analysis reduces high dimensionality associated with big data and offers representation
    for improved decision making. Research related to time series representation includes
    ARMA [62], bitmaps [63], and wavelet functions [64]. TABLE 2 Applications of Big
    Data Mining for IoT The big data analytics methods discussed in this section are
    widely adopted in many application areas of big data, such as disaster management,
    healthcare, business, industry, and e-governance. In Table 2, we present the application
    areas of big data mining functionalities that are elaborated in this section,
    ‘ ✓ ’ is used to show the support for an application whereas ‘-’ denotes that
    it is not obvious whether the method supports to an application or not. In particular,
    Table 2 shows that classification methods are suitable for medical imaging, industry,
    speech recognition, natural language processing, and e-governance. Clustering
    and association rule-based data analytics methods are applicable to industry and
    e-governance and are well adopted in healthcare, e-commerce, and bioinformatics.
    Predictive analytics are useful for disaster and market predictions, whereas time
    series analysis is used in disaster forecasting, medical imaging, speech recognition,
    social network analysis, and e-governance. D. IoT Architecture for Big Data Analytics
    The architectural concept of IoT has several definitions based on IoT domain abstraction
    and identification. It offers a reference model that defines relationships among
    various IoT verticals, such as, smart traffic, smart home, smart transportation,
    and smart health. The architecture for big data analytics offers a design for
    data abstraction. Furthermore, this standard provides a reference architecture
    that builds upon the reference model. Many IoT architectures are found in the
    literature [13], [66], [67]. For example, [13] offered an IoT architecture with
    cloud computing at the center and a model of end-to-end interaction among various
    stakeholders in a cloud-centric IoT framework for better comparison with the proposed
    IoT architecture. This architecture is achieved by seamless ubiquitous sensing,
    data analytics, and information representation with IoT as the unifying architecture.
    However, the current architecture focuses on IoT with regard to communications.
    To our knowledge, our proposed architecture, which integrates IoT and big data
    analytics, has not been studied in the current literature. Figure 3 illustrates
    the IoT architecture and big data analytics. In this figure, the sensor layer
    contains all the sensor devices and the objects, which are connected through a
    wireless network. This wireless network communication can be RFID, WiFi, ultra-wideband,
    ZigBee, and Bluetooth. The IoT gateway allows communication of the Internet and
    various webs. The upper layer concerns big data analytics, where a large amount
    of data received from sensors are stored in the cloud and accessed through big
    data analytics applications. These applications contain API management and a dashboard
    to help in the interaction with the processing engine. FIGURE 3. IoT architecture
    and big data analytics. Show All A novel meta-model-based approach for integrating
    IoT architecture objects is proposed. The concept is semi-automatically federated
    into a holistic digital enterprise architecture environment. The main objective
    is to provide an adequate decision support for complex business, architecture
    management with the development of assessment systems, and IT environment. Thus,
    architectural decisions for IoT are closely connected with code implementation
    to allow users to understand the integration of enterprise architecture management
    with IoT. SECTION IV. Use Cases This section presents a number of use cases for
    big IoT data analytics. Although the use cases are relevant to IoT applications,
    the choices have been guided for the ones that are most commonly used in IoT applications
    and for the amount of data that can be generated for analytics. A. Smart Metering
    Smart metering is one of the IoT application use cases that generates a large
    amount of data from different sources, such as smart grids, tank levels, and water
    flows, and silos stock calculation, in which processing takes a long time even
    on a dedicated and powerful machine [68]. A smart meter is a device that electronically
    records consumption of electric energy data between the meter and the control
    system. Collecting and analyzing smart meter data in IoT environment assist the
    decision maker in predicting electricity consumption. Furthermore, the analytics
    of a smart meter can also be used to forecast demands to prevent crises and satisfy
    strategic objectives through specific pricing plans. Thus, utility companies must
    be capable of high-volume data management and advanced analytics designed to transform
    data into actionable insights. B. Smart Transportation A smart transportation
    system is an IoT-based use case that aims to support the smart city concept. A
    smart transportation system intends to deploy powerful and advanced communication
    technologies for the management of smart cities. Traditional transportation systems,
    which are based on image processing, are affected by weather conditions, such
    as heavy rains and thick fog. Consequently, the captured image may not be clearly
    visible. The design of an e-plate system [69] using RFID technology provides a
    good solution for intelligent monitoring, tracking, and identification of vehicles.
    Moreover, introducing IoT into vehicular technologies will enable traffic congestion
    management to exhibit significantly better performance than the existing infrastructure.
    This technology can improve existing traffic systems in which vehicles can effectively
    communicate with one another in a systematic manner without human intervention.
    Satellite navigation systems and sensors can also be applied in trucks, ships,
    and airplanes in real time. The routing of these vehicles can be optimized by
    using the bulk of available public data, such as traffic jams, road conditions,
    delivery addresses, weather conditions, and locations of refilling stations. For
    example, in case of runtime address change, the updated information (route, cost)
    can be optimized, recalculated, and passed on to drivers in real time. Sensors
    incorporated into these vehicles can also provide real-time information to measure
    engine health, determine whether equipment requires maintenance, and predict errors
    [70]. C. Smart Supply Chains Embedded sensor technologies can communicate bidirectionally
    and provide remote accessibility to over 1 million elevators worldwide [71]. The
    captured data are used by on-and off-site technicians to run diagnostics and repair
    options to make appropriate decisions, which result in increased machine uptime
    and enhanced customer service. Ultimately, big IoT data analytics allows a supply
    chain to execute decisions and control the external environment. IoT-enabled factory
    equipment will be able to communicate within data parameters (i.e., machine utilization,
    temperature) and optimize performance by changing equipment settings or process
    workflow [72]. In-transit visibility is another use case that will play a vital
    role in future supply chains in the presence of IoT infrastructure. Key technologies
    used by in-transit visibility are RFIDs and cloud-based Global Positioning System
    (GPS), which provide location, identity, and other tracking information. These
    data will be the backbone of supply chains supported by IoT technologies. The
    information gathered by equipment will provide detailed visibility of an item
    shipped from a manufacturer to a retailer. Data collected via RFID and GPS technologies
    will allow supply chain managers to enhance automated shipment and accurate delivery
    information by predicting time of arrival. Similarly, managers will be able to
    monitor other information, such as temperature control, which can affect the quality
    of in-transit products. D. Smart Agriculture Smart agriculture is a beneficial
    use case in big IoT data analytics. Sensors are the actors in the smart agriculture
    use case. They are installed in fields to obtain data on moisture level of soil,
    trunk diameter of plants, microclimate condition, and humidity level, as well
    as to forecast weather. Sensors transmit obtained data using network and communication
    devices. These data pass through an IoT gateway and the Internet to reach the
    analytics layer shown in Table 1. The analytics layer processes the data obtained
    from the sensor network to issue commands. Automatic climate control according
    to harvesting requirements, timely and controlled irrigation, and humidity control
    for fungus prevention are examples of actions performed based on big data analytics
    recommendations. E. Smart Grid The smart grid is a new generation of power grid
    in which managing and distributing electricity between suppliers and consumers
    is upgraded using two-way communication technologies and computing capabilities
    to improve reliability, safety, efficiency with real-time control, and monitoring
    [73], [74]. One of the major challenges in a power system is integrating renewable
    and decentralized energy. Electricity systems require a smart grid to manage the
    volatile behavior of distributed energy resources (DERs) [75]. However, most energy
    systems have to follow governmental laws and regulations, as well as consider
    business analysis and potential legal constraints [76]. Grid sensors and devices
    continuously and rapidly generate data related to control loops and protection
    and require real-time processing and analytics along with machine-to-machine (M2M)
    or human-to-machine (HMI) interactions to issue control commands to the system.
    However, the system must fulfill visualization and reporting requirements. F.
    Smart Traffic Light System The smart traffic light system consists of nodes that
    locally interact with IoT sensors and devices to detect the presence of vehicles,
    bikers, and pedestrians. These nodes communicate with neighboring traffic lights
    to measure the speed and distance of approaching transportation means and manage
    green traffic signals [77]. IoT data gathered using the system require real-time
    analytics processing to perform necessary tasks, such as changing the timing cycles
    according to traffic conditions, sending informative signals to neighboring nodes,
    and detecting approaching vehicles that use IoT sensors and devices to prevent
    long queues or accidents. Moreover, smart traffic light systems can send their
    collected IoT data to cloud storage for further analytics. Table 3 presents the
    use cases of IoT big data analytics. TABLE 3 Comparison of IoT Big Data Analytics
    use Cases As shown in Table 3, most use cases are related to M2M communication
    technologies and decrease the role of human interaction. However, the technologies
    use prediction methods and decision-making techniques to improve real-time control,
    monitoring, and performance. Textual data are among the common data types generated
    by IoT devices, which are mostly sensors and cameras. Text-based data are suitable
    for analysis by distributed file systems, such as Hadoop. SECTION V. Opportunities
    IoT is currently considered one of the most profound transitions in technology.
    Current IoT provides several data analytics opportunities for big data analytics.
    Figure 4 shows the examples of use cases and opportunities discussed in Sections
    4 and 5. FIGURE 4. Example of use cases and opportunities for big IoT data analytics
    architecture. Show All A. E-Commerce Big IoT data analytics offers well-designed
    tools to process real-time big data, which produce timely results for decision
    making. Big IoT data exhibit heterogeneity, increasing volume, and real-time data
    processing features. The convergence of big data with IoT brings new challenges
    and opportunities to build a smart environment. Big IoT data analytics has widespread
    applications in nearly every industry. However, the main success areas of analytics
    are in e-commerce, revenue growth, increased customer size, accuracy of sale forecast
    results, product optimization, risk management, and improved customer segmentation.
    B. Smart Cities Big data collected from smart cities offer new opportunities in
    which efficiency gains can be achieved through an appropriate analytics platform/infrastructure
    to analyze big IoT data. Various devices connect to the Internet in a smart environment
    and share information. Moreover, the cost of storing data has been reduced dramatically
    after the invention of cloud computing technology. Analysis capabilities have
    made huge leaps. Thus, the role of big data in a smart city can potentially transform
    every sector of the economy of a nation. Hadoop with YARN resource manager has
    offered recent advancement in big data technology to support and handle numerous
    workloads, real-time processing, and streaming data ingestion. C. Retail and Logistics
    IoT is expected to play a key role as an emerging technology in the area of retail
    and logistics. In logistics, RFID keeps track of containers, pallets, and crates.
    In addition, considerable advancements in IoT technologies can facilitate retailers
    by providing several benefits. However, IoT devices generate large amounts of
    data on a daily basis. Thus, powerful data analytics enables enterprises to gain
    insights from the voluminous amounts of data produced through IoT technologies.
    Applying data analytics to logistic data sets can improve the shipment experience
    of customers. Moreover, retail companies can earn additional profit by analyzing
    customer data, which can predict the trends and demands of goods. By looking into
    customer data, optimizing pricing plans and seasonal promotions can be planned
    efficiently to maximize profit. D. Healthcare Recent years have witnessed tremendous
    growth in smart health monitoring devices. These devices generate enormous amounts
    of data. Thus, applying data analytics to data collected from fetal monitors,
    electrocardiograms, temperature monitors, or blood glucose level monitors can
    help healthcare specialists efficiently assess the physical conditions of patients.
    Moreover, data analytics enables healthcare professionals to diagnose serious
    diseases in their early stages to help save lives. Furthermore, data analytics
    improves the clinical quality of care and ensures the safety of patients. In addition,
    physician profile can be reviewed by looking into the history of treatment of
    patients, which can improve customer satisfaction, acquisition, and retention.
    SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Future Directions IoT and big data analytics have
    been extensively accepted by many organizations. However, these technologies are
    still in their early stages. Several existing research challenges have not yet
    been addressed. This section presents several challenges in the field of big IoT
    data analytics. A. Privacy Privacy issues arise when a system is compromised to
    infer or restore personal information using big data analytics tools, although
    data are generated from anonymous users. With the proliferation of big data analytics
    technologies used in big IoT data, the privacy issue has become a core problem
    in the data mining domain. Consequently, most people are reluctant to rely on
    these systems, which do not provide solid service-level agreement (SLA) conditions
    regarding user personal information theft or misuse. In fact, the sensitive information
    of users has to be secured and protected from external interference. Although
    temporary identification, anonymity, and encryptions provide several ways to enforce
    data privacy, decisions have to be made with regard to ethical factors, such as
    what to use, how to use, and why use generated big IoT data [7]. Another security
    risk associated with IoT data is the heterogeneity of the types of devices used
    and the nature of generated data, such as raw devices, data types, and communication
    protocols. These devices can have different sizes and shapes outside the network
    and are designed to communicate with cooperative applications. Thus, to authenticate
    these devices, an IoT system should assign a non-repudiable identification system
    to each device. Moreover, enterprises should maintain a meta-repository of these
    connected devices for auditing purposes. This heterogeneous IoT architecture is
    new to security professionals, and thus, results in increased security risks.
    Consequently, any attack in this scenario compromises system security and disconnects
    interconnected devices. In the context of big IoT data, security and privacy are
    the key challenges in processing and storing huge amounts of data. Moreover, to
    perform critical operations and host private data, these systems highly rely on
    third party services and infrastructure. Therefore, an exponential growth in data
    rate causes difficulty in securing each and every portion of critical data. As
    previously discussed, existing security solutions (Karim, 2016 #86) are no long
    applicable to providing complete security in big IoT data scenarios. Existing
    algorithms are not designed for the dynamic observation of data, and thus, are
    not effectively applied. Legacy data security solutions are specifically designed
    for static data sets, whereas current data requirements are changing dynamically
    (Lafuente, 2015). Thus, deploying these security solutions is difficult for dynamically
    increasing data. In addition, legislative and regulatory issues should be considered
    while signing SLAs. With regard to data generated through IoT, the following security
    problems can emerge [78]: (a) timely updates - difficulty in keeping systems up
    to date, (b) incident management - identifying suspicious traffic patterns among
    legitimate ones and possible failure to capture unidentifiable incidents, (c)
    interoperability - proprietary and vendor-specific procedures will pose difficulties
    in finding hidden or zero day attacks, (d) and protocol convergence - although
    IPv6 is currently compatible with the latest specifications, this protocol has
    yet to be fully deployed. Therefore, the application of security rules over IPv4
    may not be applicable to protecting IPv6. At present, no answer can address these
    challenges and manage the security and privacy of interconnected devices. However,
    the following guidelines can overcome these adversities. (a) First, a true open
    ecosystem with standard APIs is necessary to avoid interoperability and reliability
    problems. (b) Second, devices must be well protected while communicating with
    peers. (c) Third, devices should be hardcoded with the best security practices
    to protect against common security and privacy threats. B. Data Mining Data mining
    methods provide efficient and best-fitting predictive or descriptive solutions
    for big data that can also be generalized for new data [45]. The evolution of
    big IoT data and cloud computing platforms has brought the challenges of data
    exploration and information extraction [79]. However, for the overall big IoT
    data architecture, Figure 5 presents the primary challenges related to processing
    and data mining. FIGURE 5. Big data mining issues in IoT. Show All Exhaustive
    data reads/writes: The high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety qualities
    of big IoT data challenge exploration, integration, heterogeneous communication,
    and extraction processes. The size and heterogeneity of data impose new data mining
    requirements, and diversity in data sources also poses a challenge [80]–[82].
    Furthermore, compared with small data sets, large data sets comprise more abnormalities
    and ambiguities that require additional preprocessing steps, such as cleansing,
    reduction, and transmission [23], [83]. Another issue lies in the extraction of
    exact and knowledgeable information from the large volumes of diverse data. Consequently,
    obtaining accurate information from complex data requires analyzing data properties
    and finding association among different data points. Researchers have introduced
    parallel and sequential programming models and proposed different algorithms to
    minimize query response time while dealing with big data. Moreover, researchers
    have selected existing data mining algorithms in different manners to (a) improve
    single source knowledge discovery, (b) implement data mining methods for multi-source
    platforms, and (c) study and analyze dynamic data mining methods and stream data
    [84]. Hence, parallel k -means algorithm [85] and parallel association rule mining
    methods [65] are introduced. However, the need to devise algorithms remains to
    provide compatibility with the latest parallel architectures. Moreover, synchronization
    issues may occur in parallel computing, while information is exchanged within
    different data mining methods. This bottleneck of data mining methods has become
    an open issue in big IoT data analytics that should be addressed. C. Visualization
    Visualization is an important entity in big data analytics, particularly when
    dealing with IoT systems where data are generated enormously. Furthermore, conducting
    data visualization is difficult because of the large size and high dimension of
    big data. This situation shows underlying trends and a complete picture of parsed
    data. Therefore, big data analytics and visualization should work seamlessly to
    obtain the best results from IoT applications in big data. However, visualization
    in the case of heterogeneous and diverse data (unstructured, structured, and semi-structured)
    is a challenging task. Designing visualization solution that is compatible with
    advanced big data indexing frameworks is a difficult task. Similarly, response
    time is a desirable factor in big IoT data analytics. Consequently, cloud computing
    architectures supported with rich GUI facilities can be deployed to obtain better
    insights into big IoT data trends [86]. Different dimensionality reduction methods
    have been introduced as a result of complex and high-dimensional big IoT data
    [87], [88]. However, these methods are unsuitable for all types of presented data.
    Similarly, when fine-grained dimensions are visualized effectively, the probability
    to identify observable correlations, patterns, and outliners is high [89]. Moreover,
    data should be kept locally to obtain usable information efficiently because of
    power and bandwidth constraints. In addition, visualization software should run
    with the concept of reference locality to achieve efficient outcome in an IoT
    environment. Given that the amount of big IoT data is increasing rapidly, the
    requirement of enormous parallelization is a challenging task in visualization.
    Thus, to decompose a problem into manageable independent tasks to enforce concurrent
    execution of queries is a challenge for parallel visualization algorithms [90].
    At present, most big data visualization tools used for IoT exhibit poor performance
    results in terms of functionality, scalability, and response time. To provide
    effective uncertainty-aware visualization during the visual analytics process,
    avoiding uncertainty imposes a considerable challenge [32]. Furthermore, several
    important issues are addressed [91], such as (a) visual noise - most data set
    objects are closely related to one another, and thus, users may perceive different
    results of the same type; (b) information loss - applying reduction methods to
    visible data sets can cause information loss; (c) large image observation - data
    visualization tools have inherent problems with respect to aspect ratio, devise
    resolution, and physical perception limits; (d) frequently changing image - users
    will not notice rapid data changes in an output; and (e) high performance requirements
    - high performance requirements are imposed because data are generated dynamically
    in an IoT environment. Moreover, methods supported by advanced analytics enable
    interactive graphics on laptops, desktops, or mobile devices, such as smartphones
    and tablets [92]. Real-time analytics is another consideration highlighted in
    IoT architectures. Several guidelines on visualization in big data are presented
    [93], such as (a) data awareness, i.e., appropriate domain expertise, (b) data
    quality - cleaning data using information management or data governance policies,
    (c) meaningful results - data clustering is used to provide high-level abstraction
    such that the visibility of smaller groups of data is possible, and (d) outliers
    should be removed from the data or treated as a separate entity. Reference [94]
    suggested that visualization should adhere to the following guidelines: (a) the
    system should provide special attention to metadata, (b) visualization software
    should be interactive and should require maximum user involvement, and (c) tools
    should be built based on the dynamic nature of the generated data. D. Integration
    Integration refers to having a uniform view of different formats. Data integration
    provides a single view of the data arriving from different sources and combines
    the view of data [95]. Data integration includes all processes involved in collecting
    data from different sources, as well as in storing and providing data with a unified
    view. For each moment, different forms of data are continuously generated by social
    media, IoT, and other communication and telecommunication approaches. The produced
    data can be categorized into three groups: (a) structured data, such as data stored
    in traditional database systems, including tables with rows and columns; (b) semi-structured,
    such as HTML, XML, and Json files; and (c) unstructured data, such as videos,
    audios, and images. Good data offer good information; however, this relationship
    is only achieved through data integration [96]. Integrating diverse data types
    is a complex task in merging different systems or applications [97]. Overlapping
    the same data, increasing performance and scalability, and enabling real-time
    data access are among the challenges associated with data integration that should
    be addressed in the future. Another challenge is to adjust structures in semi-structured
    and unstructured data before integrating and analyzing these types of data [98].
    Information, such as entities and relationships, can be extracted from textual
    data by using available technologies in the eras of text mining, machine learning,
    natural processing, and information extraction. However, new technologies should
    be developed to extract images, videos, and other information from other non-text
    formats of unstructured data [98]. Text mining is expected to be conducted by
    applying several specialized extractors on the same text. Hence, managing and
    integrating different extraction results from a certain data source require other
    techniques [99]. SECTION VII. Conclusion The growth rate of data production has
    increased drastically over the past years with the proliferation of smart and
    sensor devices. The interaction between IoT and big data is currently at a stage
    where processing, transforming, and analyzing large amounts of data at a high
    frequency are necessary. We conducted this survey in the context of big IoT data
    analytics. First, we explored recent analytics solutions. The relationship between
    big data analytics and IoT was also discussed. Moreover, we proposed an architecture
    for big IoT data analytics. Furthermore, big data analytics types, methods, and
    technologies for big data mining were presented. Some credible use cases were
    also provided. In addition, we explored the domain by discussing various opportunities
    brought about by data analytics in the IoT paradigm. Several open research challenges
    were discussed as future research directions. Finally, we concluded that existing
    big IoT data analytics solutions remained in their early stages of development.
    In the future, real-time analytics solution that can provide quick insights will
    be required. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    With the recent advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is now possible
    to process a large number of sensor data streams using different large-scale IoT
    platforms. These IoT frameworks are used to collect, process and analyse data
    streams in real-time and facilitate provision of smart solutions designed to provide
    decision support. Existing IoT-based solutions are mainly domain-dependent, providing
    stream processing and analytics focusing on specific areas (smart cities, healthcare
    etc.). In the context of agri-food industry, a variety of external parameters
    belonging to different domains (e.g. weather conditions, regulations etc.) have
    a major influence over the food supply chain, while flexible and adaptive IoT
    frameworks, essential to truly realize the concept of smart farming, are currently
    inexistent. In this paper, we propose Agri-IoT, a semantic framework for IoT-based
    smart farming applications, which supports reasoning over various heterogeneous
    sensor data streams in real-time. Agri-IoT can integrate multiple cross-domain
    data streams, providing a complete semantic processing pipeline, offering a common
    framework for smart farming applications. Agri-IoT supports large-scale data analytics
    and event detection, ensuring seamless interoperability among sensors, services,
    processes, operations, farmers and other relevant actors, including online information
    sources and linked open datasets and streams available on the Web. Published in:

    I. Introduction The development of highly accurate embedded sensors measuring
    the environmental context inside farms has led to the enablement of precision
    agriculture [1], for improving productivity and increasing yields and profitability,
    reducing the environmental footprint, by techniques such as more efficient irrigation,
    targeted, more precise use of fertilizers and pesticides for crops, as well as
    food and antibiotics for animals. Precision agriculture enables the vision of
    smart farming, which is about real-time data gathering, processing and analysis,
    as well as automation technologies on the farming procedures, allowing improvement
    of the overall farming operations and management, and more informed decision-making
    by the farmers. Farming is highly unpredictable, due to its large dependency on
    weather and environmental conditions (e.g. rain, temperature, humidity, hail),
    unpredictable events (e.g. animal diseases, pests), as well as price volatility
    in agricultural markets. This implies the need for large-scale agriculture-related
    frameworks that harness sensor/automation technologies and data analytics, in
    order to help the farmers become informed about their farms'' conditions and risks
    early enough, in order to take proper counter-measures and protect their crops/livestock
    and overall production. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    The participation of the general public in the research design, data collection
    and

    interpretation process together with scientists is often referred to as citizen
    science.

    While citizen science itself has existed since the start of scientiﬁc practice,
    developments

    in sensing technology, data processing and visualization, and communication of
    ideas

    and results, are creating a wide range of new opportunities for public participation
    in

    scientiﬁc research. This paper reviews the state of citizen science in a hydrological
    context

    and explores the potential of citizen science to complement more traditional ways
    of

    scientiﬁc data collection and knowledge generation for hydrological sciences and
    water

    resources management. Although hydrological data collection often involves advanced

    technology, the advent of robust, cheap, and low-maintenance sensing equipment

    provides unprecedented opportunities for data collection in a citizen science
    context.

    These data have a signiﬁcant potential to create new hydrological knowledge, especially

    in relation to the characterization of process heterogeneity, remote regions,
    and human

    impacts on the water cycle. However, the nature and quality of data collected
    in citizen

    science experiments is potentially very different from those of traditional monitoring

    networks. This poses challenges in terms of their processing, interpretation,
    and use,

    especially with regard to assimilation of traditional knowledge, the quantiﬁcation
    of

    uncertainties, and their role in decision support. It also requires care in designing
    citizen

    science projects such that the generated data complement optimally other available

    knowledge. Lastly, using 4 case studies from remote mountain regions we reﬂect
    on the

    challenges and opportunities in the integration of hydrologically-oriented citizen
    science

    in water resources management, the role of scientiﬁc knowledge in the decision-making

    process, and the potential contestation to established community institutions
    posed by

    co-generation of new knowledge.

    1. INTRODUCTION

    Citizen science refers to the participation of the general pub-

    lic (i.e., non-scientists) in the generation of new scientiﬁc

    knowledge. A large variety of approaches exist, ranging from

    community-based data collection, to soliciting contributions,

    to carrying out various scientiﬁc tasks with the help of large

    groups of people through use of the internet (i.e., crowd-sourcing,

    Dickinson et al., 2012).

    New developments in sensing technology (e.g., Hart and

    Martinez, 2006), data processing and analysis, and knowledge

    EARTH SCIENCE

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    communication are opening new pathways for citizen science.

    Inexpensive yet robust sensors now can allow amateurs to collect

    large volumes of data and document them with appropriate meta-

    data such as location and time. Information and communication

    technologies (ICT) facilitate the ﬂow of data and knowledge, both

    for uploading collected data to centralized databases, and for

    querying datasets using rich and tailor-made interfaces. Lastly,

    communication technologies such as cellular networks and the

    internet also can allow for a much more dynamic and interactive

    approach to the formulation of hypotheses, research design, data

    analysis, and knowledge generation.

    The provision of water resources is one of the most fundamen-

    tal ecosystem services for humanity. Hydrological science under-

    pins most decision-making on water resources and is the basis

    for assessing risks related to water such as ﬂoods and droughts.

    But despite its critical societal relevance, this area of science is

    characterized by an acute scarcity of data in both the spatial and

    temporal domains (e.g., Hannah et al., 2011), which contrasts sig-

    niﬁcantly with the heterogeneity and complexity of actual water

    management and governing processes. As such, it is pertinent to

    reﬂect upon the potential role that citizen science could play in

    the generation of new knowledge in relation to the water cycle

    and related ecosystem services, and the use of citizen science in

    decision-making.

    This paper therefore aims to provide a critical review of the

    available literature on citizen science in a context of hydrology,

    water resources, and wider ecosystem services management, and

    to seek and develop a new perspective on the major challenges

    and opportunities that may lie ahead. Section 2 explores the phi-

    losophy and motivations behind the citizen science approach.

    Section 3 reviews existing citizen science applications in hydrol-

    ogy and water resources sciences. This is followed by an overview

    of some of the major challenges and opportunities for citizen

    science for ecosystem services management and sustainable devel-

    opment (Section 4). Lastly, in Section 5, we illustrate the discussed

    concepts by means of four case studies from remote mountain

    regions in Peru, Ethiopia, Nepal, and Kyrgyzstan, with different

    levels of citizen science activities and interests. In these regions,

    environmental pressures on ecosystem services are particularly

    acute and a lack of information on physical processes hinders

    the generation of relevant knowledge for adaptation. As a result,

    there may be a strong potential for citizen science to complement

    classic scientiﬁc knowledge generation and bring beneﬁt to local

    stakeholders.

    2. THE CONCEPT OF CITIZEN SCIENCE

    2.1. DEFINITIONS

    Citizen science is not an entirely new concept, but it is becom-

    ing increasingly popular in natural science research (Silvertown,

    2009). In broader terms, public involvement in science has

    also been referred to as civic science (Irwin, 1995; Kruger and

    Shannon, 2000), community science (Carr, 2004), and more

    recently, public participation in scientiﬁc research (Bonney et al.,

    2009; Shirk et al., 2012). The philosophy is also afﬁliated to

    concepts such as community-based monitoring (Whitelaw et al.,

    2003; Fry, 2011), community-based management (Keough and

    Blahna, 2006), and crowd-sourced data collection (Lowry and

    Fienen, 2013). What separates citizen science from less collabora-

    tive forms of public participation in scientiﬁc research is the ele-

    ment of an “active” engagement (Wiggins and Crowston, 2011, p.

    1); it is an approach whereby non-scientists are actively involved,

    to differing degrees, in the generation of new scientiﬁc knowledge,

    from which they also actively stand to beneﬁt either intrinsically

    (e.g., increased scientiﬁc literacy) or extrinsically (e.g., increased

    social capital).

    Citizen participation in science is a cross-cutting concept that

    has emerged from and across many disciplines. As a method-

    ology, it has been promoted for interdisciplinary research as it

    automatically fosters collective reﬂection (Wechsler, 2014). In

    the social development context, public participation as a strat-

    egy for achieving good governance and human rights has been

    embedded into mainstream discourse for decades (Gaventa and

    Barrett, 2012). Political economists also promote democratiza-

    tion of information to encourage debates and improve policy-

    making (Ostrom, 1990; Macknick and Enders, 2012). Recent

    developments in information science (e.g., remote-sensing, open-

    source software tools, cloud computing) have been central to

    the emergence of citizen science in ecology and biogeography

    (Silvertown, 2009; Dickinson et al., 2012), where citizen science is

    also prominently applied [e.g., Fernandez-Gimenez and Ballard,

    2008; Danielsen et al., 2009; Blossom, 2012; Stevens et al., 2013;

    Open Air Laboratories (OPAL), 2014; Paul et al., 2014]. In hydrol-

    ogy, the adoption has been relatively limited but is rapidly gaining

    momentum (see Section 3).

    2.2. MOTIVATION FOR ENGAGING IN CITIZEN SCIENCE

    Citizen science scholarship highlights the importance of citizen

    science in facilitating a better representation of local experiences

    and priorities. A strong motivation for the citizens i.e., the vol-

    unteers therefore is the scope that citizen science can offer for

    them to be part of the scientiﬁc process, and ultimately have a

    much broader role in decision making as part of a bottom-up,

    participatory process.

    This debate on citizen science is a long standing one, and

    its roots can be traced back to the growing mistrust of citizens

    about positivist science, especially in the aftermath of catastrophic

    failures of risk regulation (Freudenburg, 2003). For example, in

    the 1970s at Love Canal, at Three Mile Island, and at Wolburn,

    Massachusetts (to name a few prominent cases) citizens con-

    ducted their own “science” assessments to better understand the

    risks associated with their own exposure to toxics, in response to

    the discovery of toxic waste presence (Levine, 1982; Brown and

    Mikkelsen, 1990). Through a process that Brown (1992) coined as

    “popular epidemiology,” they exercised their own political power

    in science communication, and used their own scientiﬁc assess-

    ments to challenge expert opinion. An important outcome of this

    was that citizens involved in these assessments were able to assert

    their authority as knowledge brokers and to become more cen-

    trally involved in the planning of decisions that concerned the

    area where they lived and worked. The appropriate technology

    movement and approaches to participatory technology devel-

    opment that became popular in the 1970s also reached similar

    conclusions, highlighting the importance of citizens in the choice,

    design and delivery of technological development.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    Citizen science often emerges at the interface of political

    activism and volunteering. While on the outward they may

    come off as a hobby, motivational aspects are often complex.

    Volunteers’ involvement may be self-initiated as driven by an

    environmental concern, as well as scientiﬁc curiosity and a sense

    of fulﬁllment for being part of ﬁnding answers (Cohn, 2008).

    On the other hand, members of a community whose livelihood

    depends on their local environment (e.g., subsistence farmers in

    developing countries) may also seek scientiﬁc knowledge to form

    a better understanding of their environment, and further use this

    to gain political leverage in their community (Overdevest and

    Orr, 2004).

    Another strong motivational aspect of citizen science, but

    perhaps currently more from the professional scientists’ point

    of view, is about showcasing diversity, such as in terms of the

    ecologies as well as practices that people depend upon to sus-

    tain their livelihoods. In mountainous socio-ecological systems,

    which form the basis of the case study examples represented later

    in this article, the diversity of interactions between social and

    ecological changes vary signiﬁcantly not only across regions but

    also across communities. The case of Kyrgyzstan (Section 5.4)

    shows for example how communities are trying to adapt to,

    as well as comprehend, the change brought about in the after-

    math of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the particular

    economic and social restructuring process that subsequently fol-

    lowed. In the Nepalese context (Section 5.3), we see increas-

    ing interest by the citizens themselves to understand better the

    complexity of their own environments. In the light of this, it

    requires advocating that a stronger citizen involvement in infor-

    mation sharing and collection may ultimately lead to greater

    preparedness against abrupt change, and can potentially pro-

    vide an additional buffer for dealing with those shocks and

    stresses that are likely to be brought about as climate change

    and variability becomes exacerbated. Living with uncertainty

    and change therefore also presents new opportunities for citi-

    zens to become key actors in knowledge co-generation processes,

    actively contributing toward comprehending “fuzzy” science are-

    nas (i.e., climate change and hydrology) that are at present not

    just scientiﬁcally contestable, but at least to some extent unknown

    (Stirling et al., 2007).

    On the other hand, professional scientists and donors are

    also driven by a number of motives. Apart from purely scien-

    tiﬁc interest in the data collected and self-advancement, they

    may also be humanistic-altruistically motivated, for example in

    scientiﬁc outreach and education, promoting conservation, and

    improving societal conditions (Macknick and Enders, 2012).

    However, in spite of any goodwill on the side of the profession-

    als, volunteer motivations are highly dynamic, changing over time

    even if collective project goals remain constant (Rotman et al.,

    2012). Therefore, Rotman et al. (2012) suggests that particu-

    lar attention should be paid to ﬁrst contact between a citizen

    and the professionals, and also in the ﬁnal stage when volun-

    teers decide whether they will contribute to other initiatives.

    Interview studies in USA, Costa Rica and India found that moti-

    vations not only changed with time, but were also inﬂuenced

    by complex cultural and institutional settings. Speciﬁcally, Costa

    Rican projects beneﬁted from a national culture of environmental

    awareness and social responsibility, together with shallow hier-

    archical structures that encouraged regular mentoring and the

    building of trust between scientists and citizens (Rotman et al.,

    2014a). For citizen science projects to achieve sustained volun-

    teer participation, communication pathways between scientists,

    citizen scientists and non-participating community members

    need to be carefully considered. Attention needs to be paid to

    the clarity of training and the delivery of feedback throughout

    the project (Rotman et al., 2014a). If volunteers feel patron-

    ized or perceive that they are undervalued by professionals, the

    projects are likely to suffer from high attrition rates. This is

    likely to be of particular signiﬁcance in cultures where science

    and society are clearly demarcated (e.g., India, Rotman et al.,

    2014b).

    Research into collective intelligence suggests that bringing

    people together from diverse backgrounds promotes innovative

    thinking (Woolley et al., 2010). Furthermore, there is an oppor-

    tunity in the design of citizen science projects by means of

    citizen involvement to affect outcomes (Shirk et al., 2012) e.g.,

    the type of knowledge generated and the beneﬁts to be gained

    from it. Involvement of volunteers from multiple segments of a

    community can result in an improved relationship between dif-

    ferent institutional actors (Ridder and Pahl-Wostl, 2005), and

    this improves the prospects of future joint actions (e.g., con-

    tinued monitoring, planning and implementation of adaptation

    programs). However, the opposite outcome is equally probable—

    conﬂicts may arise from failures in communication or goals (a

    case in point is the Ethiopian case described in Section 5.2).

    Indeed, citizen science questions the classical divide between “sci-

    ence” as the knowledge producing process, and the “users of that

    knowledge,” such as communities who might want to partici-

    pate in “science” for educational purposes or to inform their

    actions/arguments with “true knowledge.” Instead, citizen sci-

    ence suggests a process of co-generation of knowledge, with a

    possible decentering of the central and key role of the scientiﬁc

    process in the knowledge production process. The complexity of

    social-ecological systems, their degree of inherent uncertainty and

    partially unpredictable interactions, may require a more interac-

    tive view on knowledge encounters and joint knowledge produc-

    tion in particular, in view of the creation of a sufﬁciently shared

    knowledge base to motivate adequately coordinated and coher-

    ent social action in poly-centric governance of ecosystem services

    (i.e., an evolving, emergent outcome of interactions between mul-

    tiple sources of governance in state, market or civic realms and

    at different scales of action, Ostrom and Cox, 2010). We begin

    to see traces of this polycentricity and the centrality of knowl-

    edge in ensuring its sustenance when we explore the intricate

    knowledge sharing mechanisms that have begun to form ties

    between upstream and downstream water user communities in

    the Peruvian case (Section 5.1). But inevitably this brings in inter-

    ests and power in terms of whose reality will prevail to support

    actions.

    2.3. LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT

    The broad range of citizen science activities yields different classi-

    ﬁcations or spectrum of models. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology

    initially proposed a continuum of research models, based on

    www.frontiersin.org

    October 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 26 | 3

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    the extent of citizen-scientist collaboration across each stage

    of the scientiﬁc process. This included the scientiﬁc consulting

    research model, participatory action model, and representing

    the most inclusive approach, the adaptive citizen science model

    which adopts a central platform for an interactive feedback

    mechanism (Cooper et al., 2007). Bonney et al. (2009) later pro-

    posed three models: contributory, collaborative, and co-created

    projects. Shirk et al. (2012) sub-divides projects even further with

    additional contractual and collegial models at either end of the

    public involvement spectrum. There is a high parallelism to the

    Extreme Citizen Science (ExCiteS) framework, which separates

    them into crowd-sourcing, distributed intelligence, participatory

    science, and extreme citizen science (Seymour and Regalado,

    2014). Such schemes may be drawing inspiration from the debate

    about participation in development, e.g., Pretty’s (1995) typol-

    ogy of participation: with control over the process running from

    full external control to dialogue and full internal control. From

    a monitoring perspective, Danielsen et al. (2009) identiﬁed ﬁve

    types of protocols based on the relative involvement of citizens

    and scientists in design, data collection, interpretation and utiliza-

    tion. Wiggins and Crowston (2011) developed ﬁve (i.e., Action,

    Conservation, Investigation, Virtual and Education) citizen sci-

    ence typologies by focusing more on the organizational and

    macrostructural elements of project design and implementation.

    In all, the different models essentially describe the same contin-

    uum of engagement as well as the beneﬁt obtained by the public

    volunteers from the scientiﬁc research. There is more emphasis

    on building social capital (by training) and local adaptive capac-

    ity at the extreme end of this spectrum where the objective of

    public engagement is to improve transparency and accountabil-

    ity, and to encourage discourse, learning, and collective action

    between multiple stakeholders (da Silva Wells et al., 2013). This is

    complementary to the tendency now to move away from merely

    capitalizing on volunteers as a low-cost workforce but to involve

    them in the intellectual aspects of the science (Lakshminarayanan,

    2007; Conrad and Hilchey, 2010).

    3. CITIZEN SCIENCE IN HYDROLOGY AND WATER

    RESOURCES MANAGEMENT

    Given the advanced technology needed for monitoring many

    aspects of the water cycle, hydrology is not an evident sci-

    entiﬁc discipline for the application of citizen science. But

    the development of more robust, cheaper and lower mainte-

    nance sensing equipment creates new opportunities for data

    collection in a citizen science context. At the same time, the

    importance of water resources for human development, and

    the threats that emerge from environmental change, fresh-

    water contamination, population growth and other stressors

    (Milly et al., 2008; Hipsey and Arheimer, 2014; IPCC, 2014)

    highlight the need for novel approaches to both the gener-

    ation of new knowledge about the water cycle, as well as

    new insights as to how this knowledge can be used in water

    resources management that supports sustainable development.

    The next sections review existing citizen science applications and

    opportunities brought by new technology in hydrology, before

    exploring their relevance for water resources management in

    Section 4.

    3.1. LITERATURE REVIEW

    Table 1 summarizes our review of documented citizen science

    projects in hydrology and water resources. From this list, we draw

    several inferences. Firstly, the scope is rather limited to water

    quality monitoring, possibly due to the relative ease of conduct-

    ing measurements of water quality parameters and therefore also

    coordinating these activities at large scale that include training

    and distribution/sale of measurement kits. Secondly, there is a

    clear geographic bias, with activities primarily occurring in devel-

    oped countries. There are more than 1800 programs in the United

    States alone (Volunteer Water Quality Monitoring, 2014). These

    observations are not inconsistent with citizen science applications

    which are more advanced in other ﬁelds such as ecology and bio-

    geography. Thirdly, in all the reviewed cases except one, the level

    of involvement by non-scientists are limited to data gathering.

    This clearly represents only a small subset of the levels of engage-

    ment reviewed in Section 2.3. As a result, the full potential for

    problem-identiﬁcation, data co-creation, and a joint analysis and

    co-generation of actionable knowledge (fully explored in Section

    4) is not realized.

    3.2. PROBLEM DEFINITION, PROJECT DESIGN, AND EXPERIMENTAL

    SCIENCE

    One explanation for the limited depth of engagement by non-

    scientists as revealed in Section 3.1 may be the geographical

    bias toward wealthy regions, instead of in areas where socio-

    ecological problems have more serious consequences (Halkay, M.,

    2011). Indeed, especially in cases that aim for sustainable devel-

    opment and poverty alleviation, such as those presented further

    in this paper, there is a clear need for a more bottom-up, inclu-

    sive approach to the identiﬁcation of most pressing concerns for

    action, problem deﬁnition and project design (Srinivasan et al.,

    2013). The social objective of citizen science projects in wealthy

    regions more often is to increase awareness and scientiﬁc literacy,

    as opposed to developing regions where the goals are more related

    to enhancement of community well-being such as poverty allevi-

    ation (Gura, 2013). Such deﬁnition of objectives and priorities

    necessarily results from political and social processes of con-

    structing management narratives within speciﬁc frameworks or

    “epistemic communities,” consisting of “experts sharing a belief

    in a common set of cause-and-effect relationships as well as com-

    mon values to which policies governing these relationships will

    be applied” (Haas, 1989, p. 384). These processes in their turn will

    have an impact on data collection and knowledge generation, e.g.,

    the variables that will be monitored and the points of data collec-

    tion. As a result, it is important that the citizen science process

    takes explicitly into account these multi-stakeholder processes of

    constructing the problems and frameworks, rather than a belief

    in an “objective” or “neutral” scientist-initiated approach. The

    application of citizen science in a water resources management

    context is clearly in its infancy in this regard, and in need of the

    adaptation of existing and the development of new frameworks to

    move from a technocratic-expert view on decision-making sup-

    port toward a joint creation-knowledge exchange model. This is

    further discussed in Section 4.1.

    A second potential reason for the hitherto limited uptake

    of citizen science in water related sciences is the difﬁculty of

    conducting experiments. In experimental science, system vari-

    ables are manipulated and the resulting outcome is observed

    to improve the understanding of processes and cause - effect

    relations. Such experiments are promising in a citizen science

    context given the direct link between cause and effect and thus

    their potential educational value. However, in hydrology and

    water resources controlled experiments are difﬁcult and often

    risky to set up, not only because of the large variety of uncon-

    trolled boundary conditions (e.g., land use change, climate con-

    ditions), but also because of the potentially wide-ranging and

    irreversible effects of perturbations to the water cycle. Yet exam-

    ples exist. Section 5.2 discusses the implementation and success of

    a small-scale experimental approach to assess the effectiveness of

    restoration strategies in the Ethiopian uplands. In the Peruvian

    case (Section 5.1), such a controlled approach is not possible,

    and therefore a comparative analysis of land-cover types is used

    as a proxy (sometimes also known as a “trading-space-for-time

    approach” Singh et al., 2011). However, in other cases simulation

    experiments will be the only alternative to experiments (Beven

    et al., 2012, Section 3.5)

    3.3. MONITORING, DATA COLLECTION

    Hydrological data collection typically relies on technologically

    complex and expensive measurements. Additionally, because of

    the large temporal variability of the water cycle, hydrological data

    analysis requires repeated measurements such as long time series

    of hydrological states and ﬂuxes (e.g., precipitation, discharge).

    Classic hydrometric practice has often been conﬁned to the pro-

    fessional environment and tailored to the speciﬁc needs of ofﬁcial

    monitoring networks (Herschy, 2009). This contrasts with a cit-

    izen science approach to data collection, which may require the

    compromise of data quality due to the use of different equipment,

    less frequent sampling, and less trained workforce, and which

    may be ephemeral in nature (Cohn, 2008; Devictor et al., 2010).

    The design of the monitoring may need to be technically sim-

    pliﬁed, and the procedure uniﬁed, so consistent samples can be

    generated; additionally, inferences need to be made from a larger

    volume of potentially lower quality data, which requires a differ-

    ent approach to data analysis (Cohn, 2008). At the same time,

    new technological developments also provide new opportunities

    for citizen science based monitoring (Table 2).

    3.3.1. Precipitation

    The simple design and affordability of rain gauges makes them

    particularly suited for application outside the traditional mon-

    itoring environment. Electronic sensors such as tipping bucket

    switches allow for convenient automatization. Yet, rain gauge

    measurements are very sensitive to the local aerodynamic con-

    ditions (World Meteorological Organization, 1994), and non-

    standard locations or varying local conditions (e.g., undergrowth,

    vegetation blockage), thus affecting the quality and interpretabil-

    ity of measurements. Hence, in a citizen science context, it will be

    crucial to document properly the local setting of the rain gauge

    and to apply and/or develop robust quality control protocols. New

    sensor technologies have the potential to make precipitation mea-

    surements more affordable and less prone to errors. For instance,

    disdrometers are increasingly used in precipitation monitoring,

    and are both cheap and robust in their measurements (e.g.,

    Löfﬂer-Mang and Joss, 2000). Other, more experimental methods

    for precipitation measurements, such as cellular communication

    interference (Overeem et al., 2013), are under development and

    may eventually provide new possibilities for citizen involvement.

    3.3.2. Streamﬂow

    Streamﬂow measurements are complex by nature, because most

    methods are based on indirect measurements such as ﬂow veloc-

    ity, cross sectional area and/or river stage, which are subsequently

    converted into volumetric ﬂux (Herschy, 2009). Traditional water

    level monitoring is complex and requires extensive maintenance,

    and is further complicated by property laws, regulations and

    other legal issues. Nevertheless, cases of successful measurement

    of river level and ﬂow in a citizen science context exist, such as

    the Peruvian case (Section 5.1). At the same time, new meth-

    ods are emerging that are more compatible with citizen science

    approaches. For example, camera-based water level measure-

    ments have been shown to have a good relative agreement (within

    16%) with a traditional installation (Royem et al., 2012). These

    can be further improved by combination with emerging remote

    sensing methods, such as high-resolution digital elevation and

    Citizen participation in water quality monitoring is often lim-

    ited to the collection of data in the form of water samples, basic

    hydrochemical parameters, or other indicators (e.g., macroinver-

    tebrates) because of the specialized knowledge and/or equipment

    needed for more advanced analysis (Overdevest and Orr, 2004).

    Benchmarking studies of the accuracy of the data collected by

    citizen scientists have reported differing outcomes (Au et al.,

    2000; Nicholson et al., 2002; Canﬁeld et al., 2002; Shelton, 2013).

    Nevertheless, new sensing technologies open up perspectives for a

    wider range of data collection. Aquatic sensors increasingly incor-

    porate water quality related measurements such as temperature,

    dissolved oxygen, turbidity, conductivity/salinity, pressure, redox

    potential, and pH, so there is already opportunities to automate

    the data collection for continuous sampling. An example of this

    under development is the WaterBot system that includes a Sensor

    that continuously measures temperature conductivity, a Gateway

    that relays this information using wiﬁ to a central data server,

    and a Wiewer that enables real-time observation (CREATE Lab,

    Carnergie Mellon University, 2014).

    3.3.4. Soil moisture

    Soil moisture measurements are increasingly automated, e.g.,

    by using time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors and related

    technology. Automated measurements are typically still less accu-

    rate for estimating actual volumes, and may suffer from speciﬁc

    technical limitations related to the range of soil conditions for

    which the sensor is useful operationally, such as variable appar-

    ent permittivity, and frozen soils. Yet, the measurements can

    be useful to capture moisture ﬂuctuations in the ground after

    precipitation events. The increasing affordability and robustness

    of the technology also allows for a broadening array of temporary

    and continuous uses, especially in an agricultural context, e.g.,

    irrigation.

    3.3.5. Vegetation dynamics

    In a hydrological context, vegetation dynamics are important for

    their impact on the distribution of hydrological ﬂuxes includ-

    ing interception of precipitation, canopy evaporation and surface

    runoff generation. Some of these ﬂuxes can be measured with

    above mentioned technologies such as rain gauges and soil mois-

    ture sensors. But the spatial interpolation of these processes, for

    instance in hydrological models, still relies on a limited num-

    ber of highly generalized vegetation parameterization (e.g., Clark

    et al., 2011). While remotely sensed methods for vegetation char-

    acterization are improving rapidly, there remains a need for ﬁeld

    veriﬁcation of vegetation types, spatiotemporal dynamics of veg-

    etation change, and aspects of ecosystem system stability, which

    cannot be observed through remote sensing. The use of acces-

    sible technologies such as geotagged photography may provide

    opportunities for stronger involvement of non-experts in data

    generation and local evaluation of remotely sensed products. Such

    data may even be sourced from public repositories of photographs

    if adequate metadata (e.g., location, time) are available.

    3.3.6. Water use

    While the abovementioned methods focus on the measurement

    of ﬂuxes that determine water availability, sustainable water

    resources management is often as much hindered by a lack of

    a proper characterization of water demand. Therefore, quantiﬁ-

    cation of abstraction volumes and other types of water use may

    play a crucial role in the optimization of water resource man-

    agement. Technology exists for the direct (e.g., water meters) or

    indirect (e.g., canal level) measurement of such ﬂuxes. The advent

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    of smart sensors allows for such measurements to be distributed

    and integrated in more complex analysis systems. However, con-

    ﬂicts, misuse, and data tampering may emerge if the role of water

    use data for example, in water allocation, becomes too direct.

    3.4. DATA TRANSMISSION AND PROCESSING

    Most hydrological measurements have a low temporal frequency

    (e.g., hourly rainfall, daily streamﬂow measurement) which facil-

    itates automatic transmission using internet or mobile phone

    connections. Even in remote regions such as mountains, mobile

    phone coverage is increasingly common. For instance, statis-

    tics of the (International Telecommunication Union, 2014) show

    that mobile phone penetration in countries such as the Kyrgyz

    Republic amounts to 92%. Even when mobile phone networks

    are not equipped for internet access, data transmission via daily

    text messages is a viable option. Telephone coverage in Nepal, a

    less developed country with extreme topographical variations, has

    crossed 70% of the population covering the whole country, out of

    which around 11% have access to internet. But low education lev-

    els and unavailability of data transmission in local language have

    limited its use in rural areas.

    As sensors become increasingly automated and easy-to-use,

    standards are emerging for interfaces that plug into a variety of

    devices such as mobile phones and home networks. Web-based

    services make it easy to connect devices and products with appli-

    cations to provide real-time control and data storage (Williams

    et al., 2011; Vitolo et al., in press). Data exchange standards such

    as the OGC Sensor Observation Service (e.g., Williams et al.,

    2011) and related assimilation methods facilitate the integration

    of data from citizen science with other data sources and process

    them in near-real time.

    Data robustness can be evaluated by comparing across sam-

    ples (Cohn, 2008), and it is possible for this quality-assurance

    procedure to be fully integrated in the real-time data collection.

    For explicit treatment of uncertainties, benchmarking studies of

    citizen science against conventional technologies/strategies could

    be completed before data collection commences, and examples of

    these are as discussed above in Section 3.3.

    Assimilation of uncertain data in hydrological simulation

    models is a well developed and active research ﬁeld (Beven, 2009).

    Yet, hydrological models still typically require speciﬁc, high-

    quality and long-term time series for calibration and validation,

    which may not be compatible with the distributed, temporary,

    and potentially lower-quality nature of citizen-science generated

    data. The integration of citizen science data with traditional data

    sources through interpolation or other merging techniques to cre-

    ate combined datasets may be one approach to solve this issue.

    For instance, methods to merge rain gauge data with satellite

    imagery to generate gridded precipitation products are well devel-

    oped (e.g., Shefﬁeld et al., 2006) and may highlight the value of

    short duration ground based measurements to locally calibrate

    large scale products.

    As for the calibration of hydrological models, Seibert and

    Beven (2009), among others, highlight the value of short-

    duration discharge time series for the calibration of hydrological

    models. Distributed measurements, even of short duration, may

    also be particularly useful for regionalization of hydrological

    models (Vandewiele and Elias, 1995; Parajka et al., 2005; Buytaert

    and Beven, 2009). Lastly, multi-objective calibration methods can

    address the issue of heterogeneous data availability of river basin

    modeling (e.g., Vaché et al., 2004; Parajka et al., 2007).

    For hydrological models to be incorporated in decision sup-

    port systems, modeling systems will need to represent the

    decision-making processes. Common methods include multi-

    agent system modeling, agent based modeling, and coupled

    human-environment system modeling (Gunkel, 2005; Srinivasan

    et al., 2013), among many others (e.g., Harrison et al., 2007;

    Matrosov et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). One particular value

    of this modeling approach for participatory data collection is

    in the integration of uncertainties, the treatment of incomplete

    data (Uusitalo, 2007), and the continuous updating of the model

    parameters with the incoming stream of data (Castelletti and

    Soncini-Sessa, 2007a).

    3.5. COMMUNICATION OF RESULTS, SCENARIO BUILDING, AND

    PARTICIPATORY MODELING

    Citizen science participation in data collection is probably the

    more straightforward type of engagement. A more fundamen-

    tal way to enhance citizens’ participation to the science pro-

    duction process is through joint analysis of the obtained data,

    which requires platforms for visualization and communication

    of results, joint scenario and hypothesis formulation, as well as

    data processing and hypothesis testing. Many relevant concepts

    and technologies have recently been developed in the context

    of science-supported decision support mechanisms (e.g., Olsson

    and Andersson, 2007; McIntosh et al., 2011).

    Visualization and communication ensures that scientiﬁc con-

    tent is comprehensible for the layperson, so that citizen scientists

    can directly gain from participation, which will also incentivise

    them for further engagement. This process is facilitated by the

    increasing availability of web-based technologies, which allow for

    rich, easy to update graphics potentially embedded in tailored

    applications and user experiences intended for a non-technical

    audience (so-called infographics, Spiegelhalter et al., 2011). Such

    systems improve communication outside the scientiﬁc discipline.

    Their interactive nature allows for feedback, commenting and

    rebuttal. The most immersive and interactive of such applications

    are sometimes referred to as Environmental Virtual Observatories

    (Beven et al., 2012; Buytaert et al., 2012), referring to the com-

    bined use of observed and virtually enhanced environmental data.

    But given the potentially very different nature and quality of

    citizen-science generated data, novel methods for data quality

    control, assimilation, and simulation will need to be developed.

    A major challenge in such applications is the communication

    of indirect observations and modeling results (e.g., interpolation

    and simulations), including their assumptions and uncertainties

    (Olsson and Andersson, 2007; Beven et al., 2012).

    Such virtual platforms also often provide a convenient and

    engaging platform for facilitating scenario building and hypoth-

    esis formulation, for instance as a graphical support for classic

    participatory scenario building (Andersson et al., 2008; Faysse

    et al., 2012). More advanced virtual approaches to scenario build-

    ing are simulation games (Le Bars and Grusse, 2008). An example

    of such approach is the Spatial Information Exploration and

    Frontiers in Earth Science | Hydrosphere

    October 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 26 | 8

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    Visualization Environment (SIEVE, O’Connor et al., 2005), which

    employs a gaming engine for 3D visualization of geospatial data,

    which can be both raw (e.g., digital terrain) and modeling output.

    Their work focused on the visual communication, for example,

    by introducing a switch option between environments that are

    tailored toward experts vs. non-expert (“multiskilled environ-

    ment”). This approach assumes that a layperson connects better

    to the information that is visualized using textures (“realistic”)

    instead of symbols (“abstract”). Additionally, the environment

    allows for multi-way interaction via a chat window. This again

    enables joint-testing of new hypothesis (i.e., co-creation of new

    knowledge), even if the modeling is done ofﬂine by the only by

    the expert, who returns to report the outcomes of the experiment.

    A similar early experiment utilized the virtual environment

    of the local landscape projected in 3D on a large screen for an

    immersive experience (Stock and Bishop, 2005). Here, a group

    of people in the same physical location interact with this vir-

    tual environment using a handheld computer device, voting on

    different scenarios and varying degrees of land use changes that

    are more aligned with their local experience. The impact on

    water volumes and quality as associated with each land cover

    change as modeled by simple GIS-based models is also displayed.

    This system allows the simultaneous incorporation of traditional

    knowledge from multiple non-scientists and is a useful method

    to ﬁnding a point of agreement between the experts and non-

    experts in terms of the most relevant hypotheses (in the form of

    scenarios) to test.

    Yet, the most immersive collaboration between scientists and

    non-scientists is through joint data analysis aiming at hypothesis

    testing and knowledge generation. The most common approach

    to this is the use of participatory modeling (Castelletti and

    Soncini-Sessa, 2007b; Olsson and Andersson, 2007). In this pro-

    cess, actors from different backgrounds jointly construct a model

    of the system under study. The purpose of this process is often

    direct decision-making, but may extend to social learning (Hare,

    2011). In the latter case, models are used to facilitate sharing

    perspectives and to clarify arguments.

    Bayesian belief networks are often suggested as tools for

    participatory modeling, e.g., in the groundwater application of

    Henriksen et al. (2012). In this modeling approach, a system

    network is constructed that link various biophysical processes

    to environmental outcomes, and various decision scenarios can

    be explored to predict impact to the outcomes. Advantages of

    Bayesian networks include their conceptual simplicity, graphi-

    cal support, friendly semantics, and possibility for interaction

    among different actors (Castelletti and Soncini-Sessa, 2007a;

    Henriksen et al., 2007). The development of a Bayesian net-

    work representation of the system under study, either ofﬂine

    or online, may help in structuring the thinking process, iden-

    tifying causal relations, integrating different knowledge bases,

    and making assumptions and limitations of datasets and models

    more transparent (Henriksen et al., 2007; Olsson and Andersson,

    2007). Nevertheless, setting up successful participatory moni-

    toring activities requires not only strong buy-in from relevant

    stakeholders, the process itself is time-consuming and relies upon

    a high level of leadership and interpersonal skills (Henriksen et al.,

    2007).

    4. NEW CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE USE

    OF CITIZEN SCIENCE IN SUSTAINABLE WATER

    RESOURCES MANAGEMENT

    If citizen science aims to be effective in producing positive effects

    on the governance of natural resources such as water, it needs

    to relate to the myriad of actors whose actions interact with

    the hydrological processes and who play a role in the explicit

    or implicit governance of the resources. Since the governance of

    natural resources in general, and water in particular, is inher-

    ently multi-scalar and polycentric (Ostrom and Cox, 2010), we

    cannot sufﬁce with a too simple technocratic model, where the

    “objective” expert-scientist (making use of citizens to co-generate

    data for the scientiﬁc models) provides the “real knowledge” to

    users-decision-makers. The relationships between “knowledge,”

    “scientiﬁc knowledge,” “decision-making,” and “actions” should

    be conceptualized differently, and more in line with ideas of

    polycentric, multi-scalar governance in complex social-ecological

    system (Ostrom and Cox, 2010).

    The concept of citizen science with the term “citizen” and

    its political connotations, suggests a political—as opposed to

    a technical-neutral—dimension, and it requires a decentering

    and different articulation of the scientiﬁc knowledge process

    within the broader social process of co-creation of sufﬁciently

    shared “actionable knowledge” that becomes the basis of changed

    “actions” within the management of resources. It is crucial to

    think about this process in terms of “knowledge encounters,” or

    even “battleﬁelds of knowledge,” where different bodies of knowl-

    edge and meaning, are vying with each other to make sense of

    complex reality, and strive to occupy a prominent place in the

    multi-scalar, poly-centric decision-making about the actions that

    affect livelihoods (also to be understood beyond a mere mate-

    rial content as sense-making for a “life one has reason to value”)

    and the use of the resources such as water about which sci-

    ence makes a knowledge contribution in interaction with the

    stakeholders. Of course, different from certain scientists, peo-

    ple are not hydrologists; they are not only interested in water,

    even when it might be of crucial importance to them. This also

    implies that the ideas and institutions that, respectively, inspire

    and guide the actions of people are usually not specialized, nor

    focused on particular issues. The inevitably reductionist approach

    of most scientiﬁc analysis, however, requires a focus on particular

    resources, and therefore also tends to look for, or contributes to

    the creation of specialized institutions for the governance of that

    particular resource. In practice, much of the relevant actions of

    citizens are however not inspired and determined by such specif-

    ically crafted institutions, but rather the outcome of a process

    of “bricolage” (Cleaver, 2002), an interactive encounter of exist-

    ing (multi-purpose) institutions (i.e., contributing to make sense

    of the life of people and not just of water or another ecosys-

    tem service) in which sensible ideas, rules and practices can

    -interactively- become incorporated in the received wisdom of

    existing societies (Hall et al., 2014).

    4.1. TOWARD A MODEL FOR JOINT KNOWLEDGE CREATION AND

    EXCHANGE

    The space for most productive collaboration is where citizens’

    and scientists’ questions overlap and where the mutual beneﬁt of

    www.frontiersin.org

    October 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 26 | 9

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    actors can be optimized. Citizen’s questions can be quite different

    from those of professional scientists. Even in such conditions, citi-

    zen science projects may be successful if mutual beneﬁts outweigh

    the compromise of adjusting research questions to the interests

    of the other parties. From a professional scientist perspective,

    immediate beneﬁts will often consist of help with data collection

    and analysis with the aim of creating general knowledge, while

    for the involved citizens, immediate beneﬁts may result from the

    relevance of the gathered data for local issues.

    However, as argued above, citizen science may open perspec-

    tives for a more fundamental model of mutual beneﬁt, which

    relies on joint knowledge creation and exchange. Especially in

    the context of ecosystem services management, multiple forms

    of local or situated knowledge exist within rural communi-

    ties. These include traditional knowledge, i.e., intergenerational

    understanding of ecosystems and beliefs that condition ecosys-

    tem services (Berkes, 1993), as well as more recent situated

    understandings of ecosystem services and associated management

    practices (Robertson and McGee, 2003) and personal insights

    derived from individual experience (Fazey et al., 2006). Such

    local knowledge contrasts with more formalized scientiﬁc knowl-

    edge on ecosystem services, often generated by external agencies

    (including extension agencies, rural experts and researchers) and

    based on hypothesis building and testing. Connecting these dif-

    ferent forms of knowledge goes beyond the recording of data

    and requires sustained interaction between citizens and scientists

    such that scientiﬁc and local knowledge systems can enrich each

    other.

    Research on ecosystem services management conﬁrms the

    beneﬁts of knowledge exchange and knowledge co-generation,

    both within remote rural communities and between commu-

    nities and external agencies (Cundill and Fabricius, 2009).

    These include the production of hybrid (local/science), user-

    oriented knowledge, potentially enabling more efﬁcient and effec-

    tive resource use in remote rural areas (Berkes, 2009); greater

    community involvement within marginalized groups, leading

    to enhanced social capital (Cundill and Fabricius, 2010) and

    resilience (Lebel et al., 2010); and improved trust and reci-

    procity between external agencies and rural communities (Jodha,

    2005). Overall, several potential beneﬁts emerge from establish-

    ing forms of knowledge co-generation. The most direct outcome

    may be a better management and beneﬁt extraction from ecosys-

    tem services. Secondly, new knowledge can improve access of

    marginalized and excluded groups to ecosystem services. Lastly,

    the process of co-generating knowledge affords greater participa-

    tion by marginalized groups in the development of community-

    wide strategies and plans to access ecosystem services.

    The potential of citizen science to achieve such objective is

    strongly related to the nature of social action and governance of

    natural resources. The real world governance of natural resources

    is an evolving, emergent outcome of interactions between multi-

    ple sources of governance in state, market or civic realms and at

    different scales of action (Ostrom and Cox, 2010). Policy-oriented

    scientiﬁc activity in general, and the citizen science mode in par-

    ticular, cannot escape and will therefore need to engage actively

    in these interaction, which generate actionable knowledge in and

    for multiple arenas.

    Citizen science that aims to promote democratic inclusion of

    poorer groups in society can select problems that are primor-

    dially raised and framed by the concerns of these priority groups.

    Scientiﬁc knowledge (and scientiﬁc activity) about these prob-

    lems can then not only increase evidence-based understanding

    of these particular concerns, but also contribute to enhanced

    legitimacy of these issues within the local political arenas and con-

    tribute to balancing unequal power relations without being too

    optimistic or naïve about the possibilities to achieve substantial

    results. The link of the participative scientiﬁc activity with crit-

    ical concerns and explicit or implicit struggles in local political

    arenas will be an important source of motivation for local peo-

    ple to participate in the scientiﬁc knowledge generation process.

    We elaborate on some of the preconditions for this process in the

    following sections.

    4.2. LEGITIMACY OF THE GENERATED KNOWLEDGE

    If citizen science generated knowledge is to be used to sup-

    port decision-making, it is important to ensure that there is a

    strong foundation of trust and legitimacy among the involved

    actors, and to be attentive toward how those become effectively

    ascribed to different bodies of knowledge. This also implies a need

    to focus explicitly on discursive struggles within local decision-

    making arenas, as the construction of evidence-based “expert

    knowledge” can quickly become decontextualized inputs for the

    generation of certain policies and institutional logics molded by

    local power geographies (e.g., Büscher, 2012). Often in water

    resources related bureaucracies of the developing world (i.e.,

    where decision-making around hydrology, water resource man-

    agement and technology development tends to take place almost

    exclusively by scientists), it may be difﬁcult for citizen science

    accounts to feed into decision-making – that is, even when that

    knowledge is being collected through an institutionalized process

    (Birkenholtz, 2008; Mollinga, 2009). This is partly because it may

    not adhere to the same evaluation and validation criteria that

    scientiﬁc hydrological knowledge needs to adhere to or because

    of misalignment and contestation between what citizen knowl-

    edge is proposing and what is being proposed by the scientiﬁc

    knowledge in question (Fischer, 1993; Dunn et al., 2008).

    This apparent tension between classic scientiﬁc knowledge and

    citizen science highlights that questions around how knowledge

    is created and represented within a socio-institutional context

    are at least as important as the design and practice of collecting

    citizen-based evidence in the ﬁrst place. This issue of knowl-

    edge representation and legitimacy can be complex, for example,

    when citizen accounts rest primarily on tacit or experience-based

    accounts of context speciﬁc concerns. While this paper is focused

    more on the useful inputs of citizen science in hydrology, as

    opposed to processes of contestation and legitimacy per se, we

    recognize that in addition to questions about the characteristics

    of the citizen knowledge itself, we also have to ask how we can

    ensure that this kind of knowledge is likely to feed into demo-

    cratic institutional structures and has an equally meaningful and

    durable impact on deliberative decision-making processes, given

    that we also recognize that knowledge is political. In low-income

    countries where citizen based information may open opportu-

    nities for achieving a range of ecosystem service safeguards and

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    poverty alleviation outcomes, raising this question is particularly

    pertinent (Daw et al., 2011).

    4.3. IMPROVING CITIZEN ACCESS TO DECISION MAKING

    Citizen science’s democratic nature may promote a more equi-

    table form of decision-making by giving citizens more infor-

    mation about natural resources and allowing for meaningful

    contributions to discussions and policy-making (Bulkeley and

    Mol, 2003). The use of collective intelligence to refashion more

    traditional scientiﬁc practices can push the boundaries for under-

    standing and inventiveness using the ideas from a larger set of

    people, thus promoting inclusiveness (Seymour and Regalado,

    2014). However, in practice, inclusion may still be biased as vol-

    unteers in citizen science projects tend to be people who are

    interested in and committed to closer engagement with speciﬁc

    projects, or forms of scientiﬁc enquiry (Cohn, 2008). It may also

    appear that the outcome of participatory workshops, for exam-

    ple, are democratic, consensual conclusions by all participants,

    whereas in practice they often mainly represent the dominant

    mainstream views that are allowed to surface into the public

    arenas, thus transforming “participation” into a tyranny of the

    dominant and the mainstream. Similarly, although new technolo-

    gies can attract a large sector of the society, the exclusion of the

    remaining sector who are averse to them or lack the competency

    to learn them is not fully preventable (Newman et al., 2012).

    Thus, a signiﬁcant amount of outreach efforts is required to reach

    out to the segments of society for whom the project can have the

    most life-affecting outcomes.

    Furthermore, in a context of sustainable development, almost

    by deﬁnition (Bastiaensen et al., 2005), the poorer people will

    have difﬁculty to voice their concerns and even more to articu-

    late them to (scientiﬁc) outsiders. So more often than otherwise,

    we therefore expect that participative citizen science will address

    more mainstream concerns of the local majority, or even of small

    dominant local elites. But in view of the post-research application

    of scientiﬁc ﬁndings, this usually has the advantage to facilitate

    rallying more and more relevant local support to implement rec-

    ommendations through social action, while evidently risking to

    bypass critical concerns of disadvantaged groups and even to con-

    tribute to the deepening of their dispossession and exclusion. This

    constitutes a tricky, but often unavoidable dilemma in the imple-

    mentation of citizen science, and requires a careful analysis of

    the social interface between the citizen science practices and the

    learning and struggle in local political arenas. By no means, how-

    ever, does this dilemma reduce the potential contribution that

    science and citizen science can make to local bricolage toward

    better governance.

    4.4. FEEDBACK LOOPS IN THE UPTAKE OF CITIZEN SCIENCE BASED

    KNOWLEDGE IN DECISION-MAKING

    Being locally relevant and legitimate is a precondition for citizen

    science-based knowledge to be useful for decision-making. But

    to ensure knowledge uptake, the link between citizen science and

    decision-making needs to be clear and transparent. This link can

    be understood in terms of feedback loops at different levels, and is

    probably most promising when it is multi-functional across these

    different levels. At the individual level, an immediate feedback

    loop depends on the relevance and usefulness of the informa-

    tion collected by the citizen scientist for his or her individual

    decision-making. This depends also on technical possibilities or

    design features such that the individual citizen scientist can actu-

    ally read out, understand and record the information rather than

    just passing on unaccessible or unintelligible bits. Another feed-

    back loop is possible at the level of collective decision-making, be

    that national, regional or local, e.g., when a water user association

    relies on information collected by one or some of its members to

    take decisions about the distribution of irrigation water. Lastly, yet

    another feedback loop is possible when scientists are involved in a

    process of knowledge co-generation, where they combine locally

    collected data by citizen scientists with other existing datasets to

    add value to that information, and make the results accessible for

    individual and collective decision-making arenas.

    4.5. FOSTERING LONG-TERM CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT

    Involving citizens from the start has the potential to enhance

    the prospects that the knowledge generated will be locally rel-

    evant of its long-term sustainability, especially if the setup is

    interweaved within existing institutional structures and if the

    connection to local societal beneﬁt exists (Danielsen et al., 2005).

    An ideal outcome would be that the most underprivileged sec-

    tions of the community have a sense of ownership over the

    system being collaboratively set up and can attune it toward

    answering questions that concerns them. For this to be real-

    ized in practice however, each knowledge and valuation system

    would need to be understood as legitimate in its own right, even

    when citizen- and science-based knowledges are pursued sepa-

    rately (Tengö et al., 2014). In pluralizing knowledge systems for

    water resource management, one must also remain attentive to

    the power relationships which inﬂuence cooperation and learning

    between disparate knowledge systems (Pahl-Wostl et al., 2007).

    Toward this end, it is fundamental to acknowledge that there will

    always be power issues when connecting different branches of sci-

    ence with citizen-derived knowledge (Agrawal and Gibson, 1999;

    Keeley and Scoones, 2000; Karpouzoglou and Zimmer, 2011).

    Thus, despite existing opportunities in hydrology for identifying

    areas of complementarity between different knowledge systems,

    it is essential to remain attentive to the fact that there are always

    aspects of each knowledge system that cannot be fully trans-

    lated into each other, partly because of the different approaches

    that exist (within disciplines and across different knowledge sys-

    tems) to generate, validate or award legitimacy to knowledge

    (Schweizer, 1998; Martinez-Alier, 2014).

    A different kind of institutional support is necessary to fos-

    ter the kind of dialogue across different knowledge perspectives.

    This may imply, for instance, that research funding includes sup-

    port for the development of strong interpersonal connections in

    more open knowledge arenas (Cornell et al., 2013). Without these

    connections any efforts to address the important perspectives of

    citizens are likely to appear piecemeal or biased by the established

    scientiﬁc disciplines and “epistemic communities,” and institu-

    tional norms toward the validation of knowledge in research

    programmes.

    In practice however, a more pragmatic approach may be

    needed. For instance, experience from the Tana Lake case study

    www.frontiersin.org

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    (Section 5.2) learns that unlike citizen science in developed coun-

    tries where volunteering is a pastime activity, in developing coun-

    tries, the citizen observers very often derive their income from

    their engagement. The concept of volunteering and sending data

    to a central point is not very well established, and it may be

    necessary to employ people at local wages, to incentivise partic-

    ipants while the value of their participation in and the outcome

    of the monitoring activity are still uncertain to them. However,

    one must be aware of the danger of “motivation crowding-out,”

    i.e., the fact that monetary or in-kind payments (i.e., extrin-

    sic motivation) for “socially-expected behavior” can crowd out

    more intrinsic behavior (originally treated in more psychology-

    related and economics literature; e.g., Frey, 1997) and future

    social motivations.

    5. CASE STUDIES

    In this last section, we present 4 geographically dispersed case

    studies with either active citizen science initiatives or local inter-

    est in setting up such activities. They serve as an illustration

    to the viability and relevance of the concepts reviewed above.

    The cases are located in remote mountain environments, which

    are typically environments that combine fragile and understud-

    ied natural systems with accelerated environmental change and

    vulnerable populations that are strongly reliant on ecosystem

    services. In such a context, it is pertinent to investigate the

    potential of more inclusive methods to generate knowledge on

    improved uses of ecosystem services that supports sustainable

    development and improves human well-being. The discussion

    focuses particularly on:

    • The motivation and level of engagement by the non-scientists,

    • The type of data monitored, and potential for participatory

    modeling and knowledge exchange,

    • The legitimacy of the generated knowledge,

    • The sustainability of the citizen science activity,

    • Potential uptake in decision making/resource governance.

    5.1. PERUVIAN ANDES

    Andean water resources are extremely variable in time and space.

    This is most notable on the Paciﬁc side of the Peruvian Andes,

    where annual rainfall varies from virtually no precipitation at

    sea level around the city of Piura (except for El Niño years),

    to 1500 mm at 3500 m altitude (Figure 1). Humid air masses

    originating from the Amazonian region pass the Huancabamba

    depression and penetrate a few tens of kilometers into the basins

    of the Chira and Piura rivers on the Paciﬁc slopes of the Andes.

    The water that drains to the Paciﬁc side of the Andes through

    Citizen science for hydrology

    this mechanism is of vital importance to small-scale as well as

    industrial-scale agriculture in the desert plains in several thou-

    sands hectares irrigation schemes such as San Lorenzo, Alto

    Piura and Bajo Piura. A new project of diverting a tributary of

    the Amazon, the Huancabamba river, through a trans-Andean

    tunnel, toward new desert lands, is currently under construction.

    Despite the economical importance of these irrigated lands

    and the crucial dependence on highland hydrology, attention for

    highland conservation was marginal until recently and knowledge

    of the highlands hydrology, including basic parameters such as

    rainfall input is very limited. However, in the Quiroz river sub-

    catchment, local stakeholders have now established a common

    platform to discuss beneﬁt sharing mechanisms in the catch-

    ment. These stakeholders include upstream subsistence farmers,

    downstream agrobusinesses and smaller farmers depending on

    irrigated agriculture in the desert, water authorities, and regional

    environmental authorities. This platform is in urgent need of rele-

    vant information that can feed into discussions and negotiations.

    Key information needs are current surface water availability and

    its spatiotemporal variability, as well as the potential impact of

    changing land uses in the upper catchment. The case is one of sev-

    eral that are accompanied by the “Incubator of Mechanisms for

    Retribution for Ecosystem Services,” an initiative of the Ministry

    of Environment of Peru.

    As a result of these drivers, the highlands of Piura have

    pioneered in citizen science-based hydrological monitoring led

    by a regional NGO (Consortium for Sustainable Development

    of the Andean Ecoregion, CONDESAN). The initiative for

    Hydrological Monitoring of Andean Ecosystems (iMHEA in

    Spanish, CONDESAN, 2014), was established in 2009 (Célleri

    et al., 2010). The network focuses on pairwise catchment

    monitoring to identify the hydrological impacts of land-use

    change, and the beneﬁts of restoration activities. At present,

    it consists of 20 catchments in the tropical Andes (Venezuela

    to Bolivia), including 5 catchments in the Piura highlands

    (Figure 2). Monitored variables are rainfall and streamﬂow,

    in some sites complemented with meteorological variables to

    of the iMHEA monitoring network in the Peruvian Andes.

    calculate reference evapotranspiration. Field monitoring is per-

    formed by non-specialist/non-researcher staff, but regular capac-

    ity strengthening events are organized by a coordinating NGO

    with support from regional and international scientists. In the

    case of the Rio Quiroz catchment, the monitoring is operated

    by an NGO, which acts as facilitator for the discussion platform,

    in close collaboration with the upland municipalities that are

    interested in quantifying the water they are “offering.”

    The case is a clear example of a bottom-up initiative emerg-

    ing from a local awareness about the need for better information

    on ecosystem services, and facilitated by the availability of cheap

    and robust technology (electronic rain gauges and water level

    sensors). As such, it has obvious potential to inﬂuence negotia-

    tion processes and decision-making in the catchment. This con-

    trasts with information that originates in the standard national

    hydrometeorological network operated by the national hydrome-

    teorological ofﬁce (SENAMHI), which does not reach the remote

    upland areas that are key for water supply, but is also not focused

    on the speciﬁcity of the water yield and regulation of speciﬁc

    ecosystems and land use regimes. Additionally, local actors ﬁnd

    difﬁcult to access and expensive.

    While the long-term sustainability of the initiative is difﬁcult

    to assess given its short time span, the local buy-in provides it

    with a stronger legacy compared to traditional, external sources

    of information. Identiﬁed bottlenecks toward increased uptake of

    the generated information include the need for data processing,

    quality control, visualization and the development of modeling

    systems for scenario analysis and prediction.

    5.2. LAKE TANA BASIN, ETHIOPIA

    Livelihood security in the rural area around Lake Tana, Ethiopia

    is strongly dependent on local ecosystem services generated from

    the land and the land cover. Rapid population increase has led

    to rapid land use and land cover change (Moges et al., 2014),

    and current management of the land providing ecosystem ser-

    vices such as food, feed, and fuel for the current generation is

    unsustainable. The increase in cultivated land, combined with

    traditional practices such as plowing land continuously and along

    the slopes, causes land degradation including hardpan forma-

    tion and a decreasing soil depth. The degrading resources in turn

    hamper the ability of the land to provide further essential ecosys-

    tem services such as groundwater recharge and carbon ﬁxation.

    To minimize such degradation, and to maintain the produc-

    tive capacity of the land, various natural resources management

    options have been developed by the central government and

    implemented locally under governmental directive. These prac-

    tices are usually ineffective in increasing short term and long term

    beneﬁts, and in some cases these practices accelerated the decrease

    in poverty alleviating ecosystem services.

    A main problem is the disconnect between the governmental

    or donor recommended practices and what farmers are will-

    ing to maintain voluntarily without governmental interventions.

    For instance, government agencies recommend the installation of

    60 cm deep and 30–40 cm wide swales on the contour to intercept

    excess rainfall and to allow it inﬁltrate into the subsoil. In contrast,

    the indigenous soil conservation practice is to plow small 10–

    15 cm furrows just off the contour to transport the excess rainfall,

    which ponds temporarily over slowly permeable layer. This mini-

    mizes erosion by preventing long rills going down the slope. This

    dichotomy in practices, and the resulting lack of local buy-in,

    often results in poorly implemented land-management practices

    that increase erosion and land degradation (Mitiku et al., 2006)

    despite the fact that upland and gully erosion in the watersheds

    are well understood (Tebebu et al., 2010). Another large source of

    erosion are gullies that form in the periodically saturated lower

    lands. Rehabilitation of these gullies has not been very successful

    in the past, mainly because there is little experience and farmers

    have not been involved.

    Nevertheless, a citizen science experiment in the upper Birr

    catchment has shown promise in addressing this issue that fails to

    be addressed at a governmental level (Ayele et al., 2014, Figure 3).

    The study initiated local collaboration, by ﬁrst discussing with

    the religious leaders and local respected elders, and later with

    local village farmers about some ideas for restoring gullies. The

    religious leaders, local elders and farmers were originally skep-

    tical and hesitant, as they believed these gullies were created by

    God as a punishment for their wrongdoings. Only after they

    were shown photos of other rehabilitated gullies and two farmers

    were brought to visit a rehabilitated gully, that an agreement was

    reached for them to start a trial on one location. Twenty farmers

    of the community and surrounding farmers agreed to contribute

    labor and wood to fence for the protection of the gully and share

    equally the produced grass at the end of the rainy season. They

    also set a ﬁnancial punishment for anyone who allowed their

    animal into the enclosed gully. Following this agreement, a meet-

    ing was organized with the local community, religious leaders,

    administrators, extension workers, and the village expert to share

    responsibilities. Nevertheless, the process was not always smooth.

    Grass grew well in the gully after closure during the rainy season,

    but then a conﬂict emerged when the 20 farmers whose land sur-

    rounded the gully refused to share the resulting beneﬁts, i.e., the

    grass produced on the protected area. The conﬂict was resolved

    by the elders in the village by having the 20 farmers apologize and

    FIGURE 3 | Discussing ecosystem degradation resulting from farmers

    whose land surrounding the rehabilitated gully being unwilling to

    share the grass in the Tana Lake Region, Ethiopia.

    sign a promissory note to contribute labor and wood in the next

    program to rehabilitate on the second village’s gully (Figure 3).

    Clearly the success of this program was due to capitalizing on

    the informal decision process. Although the formal decision mak-

    ing process is strongly centralized following the decision from

    regional and federal administrators, an informal decision mak-

    ing process exists in parallel, and is centered around the the elders

    and clergymen whose authority is very well respected. Therefore,

    any new knowledge generated within the community, particularly

    with the key community representatives such as local elders and

    religious leaders, can be easily received if channeled by/through

    these ﬁgures. One could also argue that the farmers’ willingness

    to participate is the conviction, due to the trust in their elders,

    that there is something for them to gain.

    A key element in this process is the reconciliation of views

    rather than falsication of a particular view. Gully creation is the

    result of a combination of human activities and natural causes

    such as soil instabilities (i.e., external factors). Elders explain the

    external factors from a religious perspective but both perspec-

    tives acknowledge that part of the erosive process is inevitable,

    yet that impacts should be minimized. To achieve this, the reli-

    gious leaders preached to the community on Sunday that God

    sends a messenger (the researcher) to give a solution. As a result,

    they requested the community to give help to the researcher for

    rehabilitating gully.

    The case illustrates that a collaborative engagement in a citizen

    science experiment is achievable in the context of an Ethiopian

    farmers community, and how citizen-science generated results

    can have on dynamics of ecosystem management and beneﬁt.

    Tailoring the design to local decision-making processes improved

    the relevance and legitimacy of the results, and thus their assimi-

    lation. At the same time, it shows the potential risks and pitfalls of

    altering local balances of resource use. Lastly, despite the straight-

    forward experimental design, the use of educational material such

    as photos helped in setting up the experiment and creating local

    buy-in.

    5.3. UPPER KALIGANDAKI BASIN, NEPAL

    The Upper Kaligandaki basin is located in the Mustang district

    of the Trans-Himalayan region of Nepal, bordering the Tibet

    Autonomous Region of China to the northeast. The Mustang

    district has a population of around 15,600 inhabitants, and a lit-

    eracy rate of 57%. It is the the driest region of Nepal, with an

    annual precipitation under 200 mm/year. The local communities

    are mostly agro-pastoralists, cultivating barley, wheat, potato and

    buckwheat in isolated areas close to the river, and raising yak,

    sheep, and goat.

    Traditionally, water resources were exclusively used for irrigat-

    ing croplands (through canals) and managed by cooperative man-

    agement practices among local communities (Messerschmidt,

    1986). More recently, there are competing demands from

    domestic use, hydropower generation and cultural signiﬁcance

    (National Trust for Nature Conservation, 2008). Furthermore,

    there is an increasing water stress due to changes in snow-

    fall and rainfall. The available water resource became highly

    contested resource among individuals, communities and social

    groups (National Trust for Nature Conservation, 2008). To adapt

    with the changing environment, they have developed sophis-

    ticated methods of crop cultivation and water harvesting that

    allows them to cope and sustain their livelihoods (often with little

    or limited government inﬂuence, Chapagain and Bhusal, 2013).

    For example,

    two adjacent

    communities,

    Phalyak and

    Dhakarjong, used to share a common stream by dividing total

    ﬂow into parts, using a wooden trunk with equal opening spaces

    placed in the stream bed (Figure 4). This was in practice for

    several decades but also created disputes and misunderstandings

    among communities. According to a senior community member

    (aged 88 years), the problems were: (i) small debris often blocked

    or altered the ﬂow at respective openings, (ii) some community

    members deliberately changed the water ﬂow manually to get

    more water into their side, and (iii) the wooden structures were

    usually difﬁcult to ﬁx at the stream bed and continued washed

    away by occasional ﬂash ﬂoods. This pushed local people to ﬁnd a

    better sharing mechanism, and the stream is now diverted in days

    turn—3 days for Phalyak and 2 days for Dhakarjong. This sharing

    practice seems more sustainable as it is operating smoothly.

    Despite a high level of creativity in their response to change,

    there remain concerns being voiced by farmers about the direc-

    tion of future trajectories of change. The ﬁrst phase of research

    in Mustang has explored for example aspects of farmer per-

    ceived climate change. In this context, farmers have referred to

    signiﬁcant changes in local hydrological processes including dis-

    appearances of small lakes and water reservoirs, as well as changes

    in glacier composition. Farmers further recognize the long term

    implications of changing climate dynamics for their livelihoods

    and potential risks that these may present for their agricultural

    based economies. Perhaps because of this we perceive great inter-

    est by the farmers themselves to work together with natural and

    social scientists to develop a better sense of their surrounding and

    and the impact of emerging socio-economic and environmental

    drivers upon their livelihoods. There are indications that this can

    only work as a two-way dialogue and knowledge co-generation

    process between scientists and local communities. Insights into

    local experiences can furthermore facilitate the formulation of

    a more contextually speciﬁc understanding of change on the

    basis of a more balanced representation of citizen and expert

    knowledge.

    In recognition of the data scarcity and high uncertainties, there

    is evidence of policy making acknowledging the fact that new

    understanding and potential solutions can be achieved through

    wider public participation. One example is the involvement of

    volunteers in the collection of hydrological and meteorological

    data since the establishment of hydrological and meteorological

    services in Nepal. Although the volunteers receive a monthly wage

    from the Nepalese Hydrology and Meteorology Ofﬁce, it is very

    small (the price of a cup of tea) and do not form a part of income

    contribution.

    Little is known about the precise mechanisms that motivate

    volunteers to contribute to data collection, though it is clear

    that complex range of factors are involved. This may include for

    example a sense of national pride, since these volunteers per-

    ceive that they are helping the Nepalese meteorological authorities

    to collect basic data. Recently, the successful implementation of

    community-based ﬂood warning system on the West Rapti, Babai,

    and Karnali Rivers in Nepal has also demonstrated that there is an

    ample scope of saving lives and properties in an inexpensive man-

    ner if the government organizations work with non-government

    organizations, and communities (Practical Action, 2008/2009).

    Thus, citizen science approaches (or people’s participation) in

    water resources monitoring/management could become a useful

    alternative to address many challenging issues for water resource

    management practices in a high mountainous region of Nepal.

    5.4. NARYN REGION, KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

    The Naryn region in Kyrgyzstan covers a remote mountainous

    watershed in the Central Tien Shan range in Central Asia. While

    for many centuries this area was inhabited mainly by Kyrgyz

    herders following traditional resource use patterns, in the Soviet

    era collectivized state farms were established. As these farms were

    specialized in livestock production, all arable land was used for the

    production of fodder crops to feed a variety of livestock, mainly

    sheep, goats, and cattle. Within the collective farms, specialized

    employees were given instruction by educated pasture, cropland

    and water management specialists from academic institutions,

    and supported with well-equipped infrastructure to monitor cli-

    mate, river runoff and pasture land conditions. However, despite

    training and equipment, since the 1980s Soviet scientists reported

    increasing pasture degradation attributed mainly to overuse of the

    natural resources (Kerven et al., 2012).

    As aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan

    faced another restructuring process, with consequent major polit-

    ical and societal upheavals. Moving from a planned economy to a

    market-based economy through the 1990s, privatization and land

    reforms led to a signiﬁcant redistribution of assets such as crop-

    land, livestock and state farm equipment. Simultaneously there

    was a drastic increase in poverty following independence due

    to economic factors and changes in livelihoods (United Nation

    Development Programme, 2011/2012). Additionally, the majority

    of families became very dependent on subsistence farming, with

    livestock as the primary source of household income. This major

    socio-economic transition was accompanied by deterioration of

    the transport and irrigation networks and the environmental

    monitoring infrastructure, matched also by inadequate collabora-

    tion and data-sharing among institutions involved henceforth in

    more localized (decentralized) decision-making. This trend has

    continued to the present, however the patterns and drivers of

    degradation have changed over time. Ongoing climate change is

    Citizen science for hydrology

    further exacerbating the above challenges and is impacting nat-

    ural resources, leading to higher frequencies of natural disaster

    occurrence.

    From a perspective of water availability and management,

    the main challenges in Naryn include limited public investment,

    high inter-sectoral competition (e.g., hydropower vs. irrigation),

    scarcity due to shortage and waste, and increasing occurrence

    of upstream/downstream tensions. Regarding water shortage and

    related resource management, a dual strategic response is gen-

    erally adopted: increasing irrigation water availability with con-

    struction and rehabilitation of infrastructure, and strengthening

    and improving water governance institutions. Current develop-

    ment projects in the region mostly address the organization of

    water administration including the promotion and institutional

    development of water users associations (WUAs), improvement

    of water allocation mechanisms among farmers and between vil-

    lage WUAs, and the promotion of technical improvements for

    more efﬁcient water use.

    At present there is little opportunity or local capacity in

    rural areas of Naryn to monitor water resources. However, a

    participatory citizen science approach is promising for such a

    data scarce region – and could be used proﬁtably not only to

    ﬁll data and information gaps, but also to work collaboratively

    with pastoral communities to generate relevant management-

    oriented knowledge. The use of citizen science can help provide

    a mobilizing and empowering effect within the community if

    appropriate motivational factors are clearly identiﬁed. Through

    development of long-term partnerships and joint elaboration of

    key research questions or problems to address, both scientists

    and community members may value such collaborative work and

    together develop participatory processes to monitor water ﬂow

    and collect relevant environmental data, and to collaborate in

    data processing, analysis, knowledge generation, and transparent

    monitoring. Local motivation for participation in joint work is

    likely to include both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including

    both personal development and curiosity as well as an anticipa-

    tion of future economic advantages. Finding an inclusive research

    approach that reconciles traditional (“pre-Soviet”) and modern

    knowledge types presumably will be another signiﬁcant factor

    for the acceptance and successful application of citizen science in

    the top-down, “expert”-oriented decision-making legacy that still

    remains in Kyrgyzstan. Furthermore, the effective application of

    citizen science for knowledge generation is likely to depend on

    identifying and working alongside unique innovative individuals

    who are willing to consider and trial new collaborative manage-

    ment approaches. From a technical perspective, a variety of new

    mobile tools and instruments, e.g., for canal runoff measurements

    or precipitation monitoring, are now available at low cost and

    can easily be used even by inexperienced community partners or

    students from nearby colleges.

    There are, however, some challenges to the uptake of cit-

    izen science as a community-endorsed concept. Of particular

    importance is the persistence of a “Soviet mindset.” While citi-

    zen science has a potential to overcome entrenched legacies by

    empowering communities to engage in the creation and pro-

    duction of “their own” relevant knowledge, this participatory

    approach to science faces challenges due to many people in

    transitional post-Soviet contexts still tending to rely on external

    expertise rather than developing their own capacity. Some ben-

    eﬁciaries of the current social status quo – often former (Soviet

    era) elites – may also have an interest in preserving their sta-

    tus and privileges. Yet in the democratizing Republic there is

    generally a sustained growth of local people’s involvement in

    governing processes, even though sometimes there remain (or

    are increases in) asymmetric power relations that complicate the

    development of strong civil institutions and consensual decision

    making. Additionally, as a result of recent changes in national

    pasture legislation, there is a potential for increased village-level

    engagement in the development of pasture management plans.

    Individual herders thus have increasing opportunity to make their

    own natural resource management decisions, as well as to be rep-

    resented on village pasture management committees. Thus, in

    the context of recent socio-political development in the Kyrgyz

    Republic, despite some continuing legacy of Soviet times, there

    are clear opportunities for the emergence of citizen partnerships.

    As part of a UK-funded Ecosystem Services for Poverty

    Alleviation (ESPA) project, community meetings have now taken

    place over several months along with the collection of baseline

    information (e.g., regional maps, demographic datasets) for the

    research team to better understand the social-ecological system

    in Naryn. Through this process, several ecosystem services have

    been identiﬁed including the provision of grassland forage, fod-

    der, livestock products such as milk and wool, water for irrigation,

    water ﬂow regulation, soil erosion control, biodiversity and car-

    bon sequestration. All these ecosystem services beneﬁt or impact

    directly on pastoral livelihoods, and nearly all are related to the

    water cycle. From this perspective, the project team deems it to

    be a sensible hypothesis that the legitimacy of local knowledge

    will be increasingly recognized and its uptake into local decision-

    making will increase during the process of production of new

    local knowledge about water and related environmental variables

    with engaged community members. The process of identifying

    topics of common interest and speciﬁc questions deemed to be

    of local signiﬁcance is on-going.

    6. CONCLUSIONS AND CHALLENGES

    Despite being an intrinsic part of the scientiﬁc discovery and

    knowledge generation process, the concept and potential of cit-

    izen science in itself only recently received increasing scientiﬁc

    attention. New technological developments are supporting novel

    and more efﬁcient methods for data collection and process-

    ing, visualization and communication. These opportunities make

    reﬂecting upon the challenges and opportunities of citizen sci-

    ence, especially in a context of managing natural resources and

    leveraging them for human well-being, timely and relevant. This

    is particularly the case for water resources, which is often one

    of the most fundamental ecosystem services and a signiﬁcant

    bottleneck for sustainable development and poverty alleviation.

    Our review of technologies reveals a large potential for increasing

    involvement of citizens in data collection because of the availabil-

    ity of inexpensive, robust and highly automated sensors, and the

    possibility to combine them with powerful environmental models

    to create rich and interactive visualization methods. But in order

    to leverage citizen science for water resources management and

    Citizen science for hydrology

    poverty alleviation, we identify the following major research and

    implementation challenges.

    • Scientists’ perceptions: Although met with enthusiasm in some

    quarters, citizen science is still seen as a rather vague term in

    much of the scientiﬁc community. If value and validity of citi-

    zen science continues to be poorly communicated, such ambi-

    guity has the potential to damage the reputation of researchers,

    and ultimately, discourage innovation. We suggest that, whilst

    it is important to remain optimistic about the potential of citi-

    zen science, limitations need to be reﬂected by setting realistic

    goals that minimize disappointment if projects fail to deliver

    (Riesch and Potter, 2014).

    • Problem deﬁnition: Given the multi-level nature of decision-

    making and conﬂicting interests of managing scarce natural

    resources, there is a need to understand better how resource

    management issues can be deﬁned in a transparent and deliber-

    ative process that favors the inclusion of traditionally marginal-

    ized and resource-poor actors. Even participatory approaches

    have a tendency to introduce bias in the participation process,

    which can only to some extent be used to alleviate (and, if not

    applied properly, may reinforce) this bias.

    • Resource intensity: Despite the potential to distribute the

    effort among multiple actors, citizen science is human-resource

    intense, especially in the need for coordination among actors

    and the need for adequate training and education, and main-

    taining an acceptable level of participation in the project (Gura,

    2013).

    • Technology: While evolving quickly, the technology underpin-

    ning citizen science requires further scientiﬁc effort. Ensuring

    that technological applications are affordable, user friendly,

    reliable, compatible, and versatile will be vital for their uptake

    (Silvertown, 2009; Royem et al., 2012, among others). However,

    the selection of technology, if effective, would contribute to an

    empowerment of local communities to take charge and deliver

    for themselves some solutions to particular needs (Newman

    et al., 2010).

    • Communication and exchange of knowledge: Citizen science

    results need to be presented in a way that little to no tech-

    nical knowledge should be required to enable interpretation

    (Royem et al., 2012). A further consideration is that sharing

    data and opening up to a larger scientiﬁc audience of their

    local environment may cause some apprehension (Seymour

    and Regalado, 2014). Furthermore, communication of results

    needs to be done carefully to avoid making impressions that

    can potentially become a permanent misunderstanding.

    • Legitimacy and polycentric governance: Governance of natu-

    ral resources in general, and water in particular, is inherently

    multi-scalar and poly-centric (Ostrom and Cox, 2010). The

    citizen science concept clearly shows the deﬁciencies of the

    technocratic model of knowledge generation. Therefore, it is

    a useful environment to explore the political—as opposed to a

    technical-neutral—dimension. This requires a decentering and

    different articulation of the scientiﬁc knowledge process within

    the broader social process of co-creation of sufﬁciently shared

    actionable knowledge that becomes the basis of changed actions

    within the management of resources.

    SHARE ABSTRACT Basic meteorological data are essential for evaluating impacts
    of spatiotemporal variability in climate forcing on hydrology and agroecosystems.
    The objective of this work was to develop high-resolution grids (0.25∘ × 0.25∘)
    of daily precipitation, evapotranspiration, and the five climate variables generally
    required to estimate evapostranspiration for Brazil. These five variables are
    maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind
    speed. We tested six different interpolation schemes to create the grids for these
    variables. The data were obtained from 3625 rain gauge and 735 weather stations
    for period of 1980–2013. We used a cross-validation approach that compares point
    observed data to point interpolated estimates to select the best interpolation
    scheme for each climate variable. We also present the performance of the best
    interpolation for each climate variable at daily timescales and for river basins.
    The inverse distance weighting and angular distance weighting methods produced
    the best results. Performance of all methods was poorer prior to 1995 because
    of fewer stations and available data. The performance of the interpolation varies
    for different seasons for almost all variables. Forecasting capability was tested
    for precipitation only and performed adequately for the system state (wet or dry).
    Variations in the interpolation schemes across river basins are primarily attributed
    to differences in gauge or station network density. This freely available gridded
    meteorological data set significantly advances the availability of climate data
    in Brazil. 1 Introduction It is becoming increasingly important to have available
    and reliable meteorological data to understand trends in climate variables and
    climate extremes, as well as their impacts on water resources and agriculture
    (Jones et al., 2003; Steduto et al., 2009). The two dominant components of water
    budgets in most regions are precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET). There are
    a variety of global products available for precipitation and ET. For example,
    global precipitation products based solely on satellite data include the US National
    Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center (CPC)
    Morphing Technique (CMORPH) and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)
    with daily precipitation data since 1998 at a spatial resolution of 0.25∘ × 0.25∘
    (Huffman et al., 2007). Other products based solely on ground-based station data
    include those from the NOAA Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and
    the East Anglia University Climatic Research Unit (CRU). Some meteorological and
    climate products combine satellite and ground-based data. The Global Precipitation
    Climatology Project (GPCP) is one such product with daily precipitation data at
    1∘ of resolution from 1996 to present (Huffman et al., 2001). The US PRISM (Parameter-elevation
    Regressions on Independent Slopes Model) incorporates point data, a digital elevation
    model, and other information to provide digital grid estimates of daily, monthly,
    and annual precipitation (Daly et al., 2008). There are also a number of global
    satellite-based ET products, including MOD16 based on MODIS (Moderate Resolution
    Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data (Mu et al., 2011), NOAA AVHRR (Advanced
    Very High Resolution Radiometer) product (Zhang et al., 2010) and others using
    ground-based eddy covariance station data (FLUXNET) (Jung et al., 2009), and a
    gridded monthly data set generated from meteorological stations by CRU (Harris
    et al., 2014). Global land surface models also include precipitation forcing data
    and simulated ET products (Global Land Data Assimilation System, Rodell et al.,
    2004). While these products are available at variable spatial and temporal resolutions,
    it is important to compare satellite and model-based products with station data.
    For example, GPCP and TRMM measurements generally require validation, and this
    validation is performed by comparing to ground-based rain gauges (Karaseva et
    al., 2012; Li et al., 2012). Thus, ground-based station records provide a fundamental
    building block on which to evaluate other meteorological products. The objective
    of this study was to develop a gridded data set of precipitation and reference
    ET (ETo) based on the most comprehensive ground-based station data available for
    Brazil. Because many applications of meteorological data require a uniform gridded
    data set (e.g. to compare with satellite observations or climate model calculations),
    it is important to process ground-based station data to develop such a product.
    We present the data at 0.25∘ (approximately 28 km at the equator) spatial resolution
    and at both daily and monthly temporal resolutions. In order to compare the interpolation
    methods used to estimate values for each grid cell, we used a cross-validation
    procedure that compares point observed data to point interpolated estimates. That
    is to say, while our goal is to produce a value for a grid cell that inherently
    provides a metric of a given meteorological variable (e.g. precipitation) that
    is assumed to be representative of the entire grid cell, our only procedure for
    assessing accuracy of our interpolation methods is to compare a point interpolation
    estimate to a point measurement (Haylock et al. (2008) also discuss this concept).
    The main sources of weather data are those measured directly from rain gauges
    and weather stations. In Brazil, there are large areas without any rain gauges
    or weather stations. Furthermore, the data quality is sometimes poor with a large
    number of missing data. However, these are common problems for creating gridded
    data sets. One existing product, for precipitation only, is a daily gridded (1∘
    and 2.5∘) data set from Earth System Research Laboratory (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.south_america_precip.html)
    for South America using rain gauge data for 1940–2012 (Liebmann and Allured, 2005).
    The ESRL (Earth System Research Laboratory) gridded data sets include large areas
    of missing values, because they do not include interpolation beyond the local
    area of each grid point. This contrasts with the added value of interpolation
    in the new gridded product. Many projections indicate that Brazil may be one of
    the few areas where food production can be substantially increased to meet rising
    global food demand (Bruinsma, 2003). In 2012 for worldwide crop production, Brazil
    ranked first globally in production of sugar cane, green coffee, and oranges;
    second in production of soybeans, dry beans, and papaya; and third in production
    of maize (FAOSTAT, 2014). In addition, Brazil is a model area for biofuel production
    using sugarcane which has also been expanding in the past decade (ICONE, 2012).
    Calculating the water footprint of agriculture requires basic meteorological parameters,
    such as precipitation and reference evapotranspipration (ETo). Developing a reliable
    meteorological product helps in addressing whether ET in existing and expanding
    agricultural regions exceeds precipitation. Thus, we then have requisite data
    to understand water demand versus availability in regions across Brazil, and to
    assess the need and availability of water for irrigation, municipal supply, and
    other demands. The organization of this article is as follows. Section 2 describes
    data sources, equations used to calculate ETo, and interpolation methods for creating
    the gridded data. Section 14 then compares each of the interpolation methods for
    each meteorological variable using several statistical measurements for comparison.
    We selected the best interpolation method for each variable over the entire time
    span of our data. 2 Data and methods 2.1 Data sources Generally, the required
    variables to calculate ETo are maximum and minimum temperature (Tmax and Tmin),
    solar radiation (Rs), wind speed at 2 m height (u2), and relative humidity (RH).
    Individually, some of these variables can be used to estimate crop productivity
    (Tao et al., 2014). Our data set includes daily observed data collected from rain
    gauges as well as conventional and automatic weather stations from the period
    of 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2013. The meteorological data types are maximum
    temperature (Tmax, ∘C), minimum temperature (Tmin, ∘C), mean RH (%), wind speed
    at 2 m height (u2, m s−1), precipitation (pr, mm), and either the daily duration
    of sunshine (n, hours) from conventional weather stations or daily solar radiation
    (Rs, MJ m− 2) from automatic stations. We also include two indicators of the quality
    of each grid cell: the number of included stations with data, and the geodesic
    distance of the nearest reporting station with data. The sources of the data are
    the ‘Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia’ (INMET), the ‘Agência Nacional de Águas’
    (ANA), and ‘Departamento de Águas e Energia Elétrica de São Paulo’ (DAEE). Table
    1 shows the number of weather stations per major water basin in Brazil. INMET
    data are from weather stations that collect all of the aforementioned weather
    variables. The data from ANA and DAEE are limited to precipitation pr. ANA provides
    the major source of pr data via 2436 rain gauge stations (67% of all the rain
    gauges). We checked if there were any duplicate rain gauge or weather station
    data provided by more than one agency. We observed six pairs of rain gauges with
    the same coordinates, but in each case, the data were not duplicated. We did not
    observe any weather station data with duplicate coordinates. Thus, we did not
    remove any rain gauge or weather station data from our data set. Table 1. Total

    quality control check for the raw data by discarding all data that failed any
    of the screening tests listed in Table 2. For example, for pr, 94 of the approximately
    32 million days with observed data have values exceeding 450 mm. Because the targeted
    use of our gridded data is for crop ET and growth analysis, our main goal is to
    remove ‘obvious’ outliers, or extreme values. A more complete analysis would require
    confirmation of the discarded data per Table 2 to confirm whether the data are
    valid. While there could be worthwhile benefits to assess all of our discarded
    data, it is beyond the scope of this work (Wijngaard et al., 2003; You et al.,
    2007). Table 2. Tests applied on the observed data to validate them. Variable

    1) 0 ≤ u < 100 Shafer et al. (2000) 0 We also applied a qualitative test for homogeneity
    of each type of data, except for the precipitation data. We did not apply an objective
    quantitative test for homogeneity of the data, but instead used only a simple
    visual comparison of data with those from surrounding stations. Several methodologies
    for analysis of homogeneity are described in Peterson et al. (1998), where one
    of the primary tools is checking historical metadata files, but the metadata are
    not available to us for this study. Application of an objective homogeneity test
    requires construction of a reference against which to test the candidate station.
    As mentioned previously, Brazil has a low density of weather stations in most
    areas, and several stations have a great number of missing data. Difficulties
    in testing homogeneity for South America data are discussed in Haylock et al.
    (2006) for daily precipitation. Haylock et al. (2006) did not perform statistical
    homogeneity tests due to a lack of nearby surrounding stations and interannual
    variability in precipitation due to El Niño Southern Oscillation. Vincent et al.
    (2005) tested the homogeneity of 68 stations with maximum and minimum daily temperature
    data where 19 and 22 stations, respectively, presented potential inhomogeneity.
    However, they did not remove the potentially inhomogeneous data because of the
    limited data availability. Therefore, for our data set, we did not perform homogeneity
    analysis for pr. For the variables Tmax, Tmin, Rs, RH, and u2, we performed a
    visual homogeneity check. This visual homogeneity test plots the time series of
    data from the candidate station along with the average of data from several surrounding
    stations. This average approximates data as if from a validated reference station.
    The number of surrounding stations was selected such that we had at least five
    surrounding data to calculate the average. For example, if we are checking homogeneity
    of Tmax, and the five nearest surrounding weather stations have no missing data,
    then we only need to use these five stations. However, if for 1 day only two of
    the stations have observed Tmax, the next three closest stations with observed
    Tmax on that day must be selected. In general, less than 20 weather stations were
    used to calculate an average time series for our homogeneity test for any candidate
    station. When we observed a clear inhomogeneity in trend in some part of the time
    series of the candidate station, we removed those data. In Figure 1, we show examples
    of data that were removed, and Table 3 indicates the number of stations with inhomogeneous
    data and the quantity of data removed. The variables Tmin and u2 have more days
    with inhomogeneous data, although they are few compared to the total amount of
    data (for each variable, < 0.4 % of the raw data were removed). We can only speculate
    on the causes of the inhomogeneities. For example, in Figure 1(a), (b), and (d)
    (Tmax, RH, and u2), the instruments seem to be temporally defective, while Figure
    1(c) (Rs) indicates that the problem could be the temporary use of different units.
    This type of units problem could be fixed if we had access to the station metadata.

    data for each variable required to estimate ETo. Variable Number of stations with

    2.2 Reference ET We calculated daily reference ET using the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Penman–Monteith method (ETo, Allen et
    al. (1998); Raes (2012)) shown in Equation 1 for both the conventional and automatic
    weather stations. The variables used to calculate ETo are the observed daily Tmax,
    Tmin, RH, u2, and Rs or n. We calculated ETo at weather stations only for days
    in which all required data are available and remain after the screening process
    per Table 2. For example, if for 1 day and station all variables are present except
    for u2, then we did not calculate ETo. (1) In Equation 1, ETo is reference ET
    (mm day− 1), Rn is net radiation (MJ m− 2 day− 1), G is soil heat flux density
    (MJ m− 2 day− 1), T is air temperature at 2 m height (∘C), u2 is wind speed at
    2 m height (m s− 1), es is saturation vapour pressure (kPa), ea is actual vapour
    pressure (kPa), es − ea is the saturation vapour pressure deficit (kPa), Δ is
    the slope vapour pressure curve (kPa ∘C− 1), and γ is the psychrometric constant
    (kPa ∘C− 1). In our case, G was considered zero; T was the average of Tmax and
    Tmin; ea was estimated with the aid of RH, Tmax, and Tmin as follows: (2) where
    e∘(Tmax) and e∘(Tmin) are saturation vapour pressure at the air maximum and minimum
    temperatures, respectively. Rn was calculated as follows: (3) where Rns is incoming
    net shortwave radiation that is a function of albedo (assumed as 0.23 for hypothetical
    grass reference crop), and Rnl is the outgoing net longwave radiation that is
    a function of Tmax, Tmin, ea, Rs, and Rso, where Rso is clear-sky radiation (MJ
    m− 2 day− 1) that is calculated. Rs is directly measured in the automatic weather
    stations. For the conventional weather stations, Rs is estimated with the aid
    of n, the maximum possible duration of sunshine (N, hour), and the extraterrestrial
    radiation (Ra, MJ m− 2 day− 1) as: (4) where Ra and N are calculated as in Allen
    et al. (1998). 2.3 Interpolation methods Developing a gridded meteorological product
    from station data is challenging because stations represent points with varying
    densities in a region, stations come online at different times, and many stations
    have periods of missing records. A variety of approaches have been developed to
    interpolate station data, and we compare these methods for each of our weather
    variables. We tested six interpolation methodologies and selected the best one
    for precipitation and each variable needed to estimate ETo: (1) average inside
    the area of 0.25∘ × 0.25∘ (AVERAGE), (2) natural interpolation (NATURAL), (3)
    thin plate spline (THINPLATE), (4) inverse distance weighting (IDW), (5) angular
    distance weighting (ADW), and (6) ordinary point kriging (OPK). During cross-validation
    analysis for each of the interpolation methods, we used the five nearest available
    stations with data in the neighbourhood of the query position. For comparison,
    New et al. (2000) used eight nearest stations in monthly interpolation of weather
    data. When the query position was outside the convex hull (e.g. on the border
    of Brazil), the nearest data were used. We did not use elevation data as input
    for interpolation. For all variables except pr, within each 0.25∘ × 0.25∘ grid
    square, we considered the centroid as the single interpolation location. For pr,
    we used a different approach because of the higher density of precipitation data
    (e.g. there are often many observed data within each grid square). Because of
    the higher density of precipitation gauges, we calculated a single value for a
    grid point from the average of 25 individual interpolations within that grid taken
    at 0.05∘ spacing, similar to the approach used in Haylock et al. (2008). 2.3.1
    Arithmetic average We calculated the arithmetic average (AVERAGE) equal to the
    sum of the data divided by the number of data. For each 0.25∘ × 0.25∘ grid square,
    we considered the centroid as the interpolation location and included a maximum
    of five nearest data. Our approach differs from that used by Liebmann and Allured
    (2005) for the South American gridded precipitation product. They used the average
    in a corresponding geographic ellipse, with no explicit limit on the number of
    stations, and while Liebmann and Allured (2005) did not assign any value to grid
    cells that did not have any station data, we assigned a data point that was nearest
    to the centroid, but lies outside, the grid cell of interest. 2.3.2 Thin plate
    spline The THINPLATE is a common interpolation technique used for weather data
    (Xia et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2014), particularly for regions with sparse station
    data (New et al., 2002). Our calculations were performed in Matlab using the internal
    function TPAPS. 2.3.3 Natural neighbour We included natural neighbour interpolation
    (NATURAL) as part of the normal suite of methods (Sibson, 1981; Hofstra et al.,
    2008). NATURAL uses Thiessen polygons and triangulation to select which nearby
    data points to use, while weighting each of them based upon its associated area.
    The interpolation surface is constructed to reproduce the observation data at
    the surrounding weather stations. Our calculations were performed in Matlab using
    the internal function GRIDDATA with the ‘natural’ method. 2.3.4 Inverse distance
    weighting In the IDW method, the interpolated quantity at a location is based
    upon a weighting (Equation 5, Wk) that is inversely proportional to the distance
    between the point and the data from the kth nearby weather station. (5) Here,
    d is the geodesic distance of station k and the specified point, and p is the
    power parameter that we set equal to 2, as suggested by Ly et al. (2011). The
    number of weather stations to consider for interpolating at a chosen point were
    the nearest five, selected after cross validation. 2.3.5 Angular distance weighting
    In the ADW method, the weighting for the data from the surrounding stations is
    calculated using both the distance and the angles (or orientation) between weather
    stations. The distance weight is calculated using a correlation decay function
    with the empirically derived correlation decay distance (CDD) (see Equation 6).
    (6) In Equation 6, x is the distance from the gridded point of interest and a
    nearby weather station. For each station, we calculated the correlation (r) with
    all other stations. Then, we solved for the CDD that minimizes the least squares
    error between the values of rk corresponding to the xk calculated using observed
    data and r(x) using Equation 6. On average, our CDD values are around 200 km for
    pr (similar to those of Hofstra and New (2009), Europe) and 800 km for the other
    weather variables (similar to those of New et al. (2000), temperature global).
    The distance weighting for each station (k) is calculated using Equation 7: (7)
    where we selected the exponent m for each meteorological variable during cross
    validation (see Section 12), testing for each variable the integer values 1–8.
    We selected the following exponents: m = 1 for pr and u2; m = 6 for ETo, Tmax,
    and Rs; and m = 4 for Tmin and RH. The second part of the distance weight is the
    angular weight (ak, Equation 8) for each of the nj = 5 (for our study) selected
    stations used for interpolation: (8) where θj(k, l) is the angle formed by stations
    l and k with the vertex at the interpolating point of interest. To weight the
    values of the surrounding stations for interpolating at the point of interest,
    the distance and angle weightings are combined for each kth station (Wk): (9)
    2.3.6 Ordinary point kriging The OPK methodology has an expected average error
    of zero. To weight the spatial dependency of the observed data, OPK uses the variogram
    estimator (Webster and Oliver, 2007). We used monthly variogram estimators as
    the average of the daily semivariances for each month. During our cross-validation
    process for comparing interpolation methods, we decided to use the spherical model
    to model the semivariance. 2.4 Cross validation We used a cross-validation procedure
    for comparing the accuracy of the interpolation methods. The process is as follows.
    For each observed data point at a test weather station (i.e. for each observed
    variable at each station and each day), we ‘remove’ it from the data set. We then
    use each of the interpolation methods to estimate the weather variable at this
    test station. This procedure is similar to that used by Daly et al. (2008) and
    Hofstra et al. (2008). For precipitation, for example, we have approximately 32
    million observed daily data. Thus, the total number of cross-validation calculations
    was approximately 192 million (32 million of data times six interpolation methods).
    We used the following statistics to compare the accuracy of the observed data
    (X) with our interpolated estimates (Y): the coefficient of correlation (R), the
    bias, the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the compound
    relative error (CRE), the critical success index (CSI), and the percent correct
    (PC). (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) In Equations 10-16, and are the mean
    of X and Y, and n is the number of observed data available. CSI and PC are forecast
    quality measurements where a is number of hits (correct forecast), b is number
    of false alarms (event was forecast but not observed), c is number of missed forecasts
    (event occurred but was not forecast), and d is number of correct rejections (event
    did not occur and was not forecast) (Hofstra et al., 2008; Wilks, 2011). CRE and
    R are measurements of similarity, where CRE is zero when X equals Y. R measures
    the degree of linear dependence of the variables, varying from −1 to 1. Bias indicates
    whether the interpolated estimates tend to be lower or higher than the observed
    data (a bias of zero is ideal). RMSE and MAE measure accuracy, such that when
    observed and estimated data are similar, RMSE and MAE are close to zero, indicating
    a more accurate interpolation. RMSE calculates the square of deviation between
    observed and estimated values, and is thus more sensitive to larger errors. Bias,
    RMSE, and MAE have the same units as the variable. PC was calculated only for
    pr to verify whether the interpolated methods were able to forecast the state
    of pr. The state of pr was defined as ‘wet’ or ‘dry’, where a wet state is defined
    as pr > 0.5 mm day−1, and dry otherwise. With CSI, we test whether the interpolation
    methods are able to forecast extreme values. Extreme values are those that fall
    below the 5th (CSI low, CSIL) percentile or above the 95th percentile (CSI high,
    CSIH) in the observed and estimated data (see Hofstra et al. (2008)). Because
    of a very high number of low and zero rainfall data, we tested pr only for CSI
    and CSIH (as per Hofstra et al. (2008)). For each statistic used to determine
    the accuracy of the interpolation methods, we determine a ‘skill score’, that
    is the ranking of the interpolation method (1 = best, 2 = second best, etc.).
    The overall skill score for a given interpolation method is the average of the
    individual skill scores. For each meteorological variable, the best interpolation
    method is the one with the lowest (best) overall skill score. Once we determined
    the best interpolation methodology for each variable (Section 15), we show the
    results of cross validation: (1) at a daily timescale, considering Brazil (Section
    17); and (2) in the major river basins in Brazil, considering all time series
    (Section 24). In Section 25, we show the results of gridded data sets that we
    generated. 3 Results 3.1 Spatial and temporal distribution of rain gauges and
    weather stations The spatial distribution of all rain gauges in our data set and
    temporal variability in the average number of rain gauges available during the
    years analysed are shown throughout Brazil and within the river basins (Figure
    2(a), (b), and (c)). In 2012, the year with the highest number of available stations
    and data, the Amazon river basin has the lowest density of rain gauges, approximately
    0.1 station per 1000 km2, while the Atlantic (east and north/northeast basins),
    Parana, and Uruguay river basins have the highest density of gauges, approximately
    1.0 per 1000 km2. The average density of rain gauges for Brazil overall in 2012
    was 0.4 stations per 1000 km2. For comparison, the United States has approximately
    1.1 stations per 1000 km2 (NOAA, 2010). There is also a wide range in distribution
    of rain gauges within river basins. In the Amazon river basin, large areas have
    no weather stations, and subsequently our interpolations for pr are the least
    accurate and precise within the Amazon basin. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Major river basins of Brazil and spatial distribution of all rain gauges in the
    data set (a); the historical count of rain gauges in Brazil (b) and for each major
    river basin (c). Throughout Brazil and within our data set, the total number of
    rain gauges with data generally increases from 1854 in 1980 to 3358 in 2012 before
    decreasing in 2013 (Figure 2(b) and (c)). We attribute the decline in 2013 to
    a time delay for government agencies to organize the data and make them available.
    We observe this same time delay for data from weather stations (see Figure 3(b)).
    Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Major river basins of Brazil and spatial
    distribution of weather stations (a); annual average of the number of weather
    stations in Brazil (b) and for each major river basin (c). Similar to the spatial
    and temporal distribution of rain gauges, the Amazon river basin has the lowest
    density of weather stations (Figure 3(a)). The average number of available weather
    stations has generally increased at a constant linear rate since 1980, with some
    downward fluctuations in the early 1990s (Figure 3(b) and (c)). For two river
    basins, the South Atlantic region and Uruguay river, there were no available weather
    station data for the years 1986, 1987, and 1990. Most of the weather stations
    installed before 2000 were of the ‘conventional’ variety and are mostly still
    functioning. After 2000, most installed stations are automatic. 3.2 Evaluating
    interpolation methods 3.2.1 Skill scores for all observed data In interpolating
    each meteorological variable at a given rain gauge (for pr) or weather station,
    the most accurate interpolation method might differ for each variable. The gridded
    data sets (in multiple individual files grouped by variable type and time span)
    are available for download via a file sharing system of the University of Texas.
    Table 4 shows the statistics and their skill scores of the relationship between
    all daily observed and estimated data for pr and ETo (see Table S1, Supporting
    Information, for the other variables; direct link to data: https://utexas.box.com/Xavier-etal-IJOC-DATA.

    For pr, the statistics were calculated from approximately 32 million pairs of
    observed and estimated data per interpolation method. For the other meteorological
    variables and ETo, there are approximately 3.5 million pairs of data. Table 4.

    overall skill scores were generally obtained using ADW and IDW, where ADW was
    best for the variables ETo, Rs, RH, and u2 and IDW for pr, Tmin, and Tmax. THINPLATE
    is almost as accurate as IDW and ADW in interpolating temperatures and solar radiation,
    Rs, as these variables change more smoothly over short distances. For pr, IDW
    and ADW are clearly superior to the other methods. THINPLATE, OPK, and NATURAL
    methods result in intermediate skill scores, and the AVERAGE interpolation method
    always has the worst skill score. We found a high correlation in the cross validation
    for ETo, Tmax, Tmin, Rs ,, and RH (R approximately 0.8–0.9) while much lower correlations
    exist for pr and u2 (R approximately 0.4–0.6). All R values are statistically
    significant at p - value < 0.05. Biases are generally small for all variables
    and methods when we consider the magnitude of the variables. RMSE, CRE, and MAE
    are quite similar for all interpolation methods for a given variable, but ADW
    and IDW usually show better results (lower error statistics). The ability of the
    interpolation methods to ‘forecast’ the state of pr, wet or dry, is moderately
    high (see PC and CSI, Table 4). In the case of PC (the fraction of correctly interpolated
    days as ‘wet’ = pr > 0.5 mm day−1 and ‘dry’ otherwise), the AVERAGE method is
    most accurate at 81%, whereas ADW is the least accurate at 77%. We attribute AVERAGE
    providing the highest PC to the fact that it best represents the true spatial
    variability in precipitation. All of the other methods perform more smoothing
    of the data, effectively overestimating rainfall when there is none (e.g. 0 mm
    day−1) and underestimating high precipitation events. This smoothing and underestimation
    of high precipitation days explains why CSIH is low (< 0.3) for all interpolation
    methods, with the better results obtained using ADW and IDW. The interpolation
    results for u2 are the least accurate overall as compared to the other meteorological
    variables. This finding is expected, as local geography can highly influence wind
    speed and gusts. CSIL and CSIH (observed and estimated values fall below/above
    the 5th/95th percentiles) are particularly low for u2, indicating similar difficulties
    for interpolating low wind speeds as for low precipitation. For the other variables,
    only low values are shown to be forecast with reasonable accuracy, slightly lower
    than those found in Hofstra et al. (2008). The statistical values for our most
    accurate interpolation methods are generally slightly lower than those obtained
    by Hofstra et al. (2008) who interpolate weather over Europe, based on a much
    higher geographical density of weather stations. For example, Hofstra et al. (2008)
    obtain the following R values: 0.75 (global kriging), 0.98 (THINPLATE three dimension),
    and 0.96 (global kriging), for pr, Tmax, and Tmin, respectively. The highest R
    values for those same variables in our Brazil study are 0.62 (ADW for pr), 0.91
    (IDW for Tmax), and 0.91 (IDW for Tmin). 3.2.2 Spatial distribution of the best
    models The spatial distribution of the best interpolation method (best average
    skill score) for the rain gauges/weather stations for each meteorological variable
    is shown in Figure 4 for pr and ETo (see Figure S1 for the other variables). The
    two interpolation methods with the highest frequency (number of stations) of being
    the most accurate are ADW and IDW, where IDW is accurate most frequently for the
    variables pr, Tmax, and Tmin, and ADW for ETo, RH, Rs , and u2. OPK, THINPLATE,
    and NATURAL methods show intermediate frequency of being the most accurate, and
    the AVERAGE interpolation is usually the least accurate. Interestingly, there
    does not appear to be any spatial or geographic pattern that explains why a given
    interpolation method is most accurate. Hofstra et al. (2008) found, for example,
    for the European stations that OPK method was the best for the pr, while NATURAL
    was the best for Tmax and Tmin. They also observed that in regions with dense
    station network and with less topographical complexity the local kriging (similar
    to OPK method, but with different variograms at each interpolation point) showed
    better results for pr. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The most precise
    interpolation method, as measured by highest average skill score, is indicated
    for Brazil overall (relative frequency histogram in lower left of each plot) and
    for each station (coloured dots on the map) for both pr (a) and ETo (b). Each
    interpolation method from top to bottom in the legend is represented from right
    to left in the histograms. 3.2.3 Analysis of daily data The daily statistical
    results of our cross-validation procedure are based on interpolating weather variables
    at the location of each station at daily time resolution. Figure 5 shows an example
    of calculating the statistical metrics for a single day, 1 January 1980. We show
    two variables: pr and ETo. If the interpolation estimate is perfect, then all
    data points would lie on the line with a slope 1 (1 : 1 line). Across Brazil for
    this single day, there are 1854 rain gauges and 135 weather stations with available
    data. Thus, there are 1854 and 135 pairs of observed and estimated data for pr
    and ETo, respectively, for the cross-validation procedure. We estimated pr and
    ETo using IDW and ADW interpolations, respectively, as described previously (Table
    4). For pr on 1 January 1980, for example, R is 0.71, RMSE is 11.0 mm, and bias
    is −0.05 mm (Figure 5(a)). Other statistics for that day can be observed in the
    Figure 5(a) and (b). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Scatter diagram
    of estimated versus observed pr (a) and ETo (b) using, respectively, IDW and ADW
    method for 1 January 1980. Each plot shows the individual skill scores for that
    single day. We repeated this cross-validation procedure for every day, and we
    summarize the results for pr and ETo in Figures 6 and 7, and for the other variables,
    Figures S2–S6. The results in Table 4 are the summarized skill scores averaged
    from all days. Both Figures 6 and 7 follow the same format for displaying the
    individual daily calculations. For the upper scatter plot for each skill score,
    rows indicate the years (1980–2013) and columns indicate the days (1 January to
    31 December) for the calculation. The colour bar indicates the skill score for
    each daily calculation. Below each coloured scatter plot is a line plot indicating
    the average skill score across each year for a given day. The value of this line
    plot is to assess whether certain times of the year are more accurately estimated
    than others. For example, Figure 6 shows that for RMSE is much lower, and PC is
    much higher, when interpolating precipitation during the winter months (July and
    August). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Daily skill scores of the relationship
    between observed and estimated pr when interpolating using IDW. Figure 7 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Daily skill scores of the relationship between ETo
    calculated using observed data versus estimated data when interpolating using
    ADW. 3.2.3.1 Precipitation Figure 6 presents our interpolation results and skill
    scores using the IDW interpolation method. Daily R and bias (Figure 6(a) and (b))
    do not indicate a clear seasonal trend between them, except for perhaps higher
    R in the winter season. The daily averages are approximately constant at R = 0.50
    and bias approximately 0.00 mm. RMSE is much lower, and PC is much higher during
    the winter months (July and August) indicating that precipitation is more easily
    predictable in the winter due to lower precipitation as compared to spring and
    summer (see Figure 6(d)). In the dry seasons (fall and winter), the forecast of
    the state of precipitation (PC) and the 95th percentile (CSIH) are both more accurate.
    CRE seems to show higher accuracy in fall and early winter, but with greater uncertainty.
    3.2.3.2 Evapotranspiration The skill scores for ETo, Figure 7, are based on comparing
    ETo calculated using observed input from the weather station to ETo calculated
    using interpolated data for that same weather station. Most of the skill scores
    are relatively uniform for all days throughout the year. RMSE is lowest during
    the fall (April and May) and highest during the spring. A few of the skill scores
    are poor for 1990 because of a relatively high quantity of missing data from weather
    stations. 3.2.3.3 Temperature The behaviour of Tmax and Tmin is similar (Figures
    S2 and S3) except for one metric. Tmin shows a clear increase in RMSE in the winter
    months that is not present in Tmax. For Tmax and Tmin, between 1980 and 2005,
    the daily R, mainly in summer is lower than during the fall and winter. After
    2005, R is much higher throughout the year. We attribute this anomalous trend
    to the higher number of missing data in the data set during that period (1980–2005)
    and less variation in temperature over all Brazil in that season. The autumn and
    winter seasons have high temperature variations in Brazil, with low temperature
    in the south region and high in the north of Brazil. Thus, there is an increased
    possibility of higher R in the cross validation across all of Brazil for autumn
    and winter. The forecast (CSI low, CSIL, and high, CSIH) is greater in the recent
    years (2005–2013). This trend is due to the increase in number of weather stations
    such that there is increased power for interpolating the data. 3.2.3.4 Solar radiation
    As with precipitation, Rs has higher interpolation accuracy (e.g. lower RMSE,
    higher CSI low, see Figure S4) during the winter than summer months, likely due
    to less variability in cloud cover and lower radiation magnitude. A few of the
    skill scores (R and CRE) are poor from 1990 to 1995 due to a relatively high quantity
    of missing data from weather stations. 3.2.3.5 Relative humidity For interpolating
    RH (Figure S5), there is both highest R and RMSE in the late winter and early
    spring. During that time of the year, many regions in Brazil are dry, but the
    Amazon region still has high RH. Thus, there are some places with consistently
    low RH and some with consistently high RH, and both situations promote a high
    R metric for RH during late winter and early spring. This increased RMSE during
    this time is mostly present in the data before 2005, and correlation, R, is highest
    after 2005 during the spring. These trends for R and RMSE might be driven by peculiar
    aspects related to data collection via conventional weather stations dominating
    pre-2005 data and automatic stations after 2005. It is also possible that the
    increased accuracy of measurement post-2005 is due to simply having a higher number
    of active weather stations. A few of the skill scores (R, bias, and CRE) are poor
    before 1995 due to a relatively high quantity of missing data from weather stations.
    3.2.3.6 Wind speed Generally, the skill scores are poor for interpolating u2 (Figure
    S6). Correlation is less than R = 0.6 over the course of the year, and the interpolation
    method has a slight downward bias. A few of the skill scores (R, bias, and CRE)
    are exceptionally poor before 1995 due to a relatively high quantity of missing
    data from weather stations. For some stations, we calculated negative R because
    of so much missing data. Overall, estimation of wind speed is expected to be poor
    because of localized effects, including elevation factors that were not included
    in our analysis. 3.2.4 Interpolation results for river basins To evaluate spatial
    variations in meteorological parameters across Brazil, we calculated cross-validation
    skill score statistics for major river basins in Brazil (see Table 5). We used
    the interpolation method with the best overall skill score for each variable as
    discussed in Section 15. Skill score statistics are poorest for the Amazon River
    basin for all variables because of the low number and density of available weather
    stations. Basins with a greater number of stations and station density provide
    much better results. Basins with high station density are the Parana, Uruguay,
    South Atlantic region, and São Francisco basins. Table 5. Cross-validation results
    for interpolation methods per variable and per basin. Variables (methods) Basin

    to compare results in Table 5 to those in Table 4. For example, for pr, we use
    IDW that has R = 0.61 and PC = 0.78 for Brazil overall (Table 4). Comparing results
    from the river basins with those for Brazil overall shows that five river basins
    have higher R and PC, one is equal to and two (Amazon and Tocantins) are less
    than each metric for Brazil overall. As another example, consider ETo using ADW
    which results in R = 0.88 and RMSE = 0.78 for Brazil overall (Table 4). Two of
    the river basins have R greater than, three approximately equal, and three lower
    than R for overall Brazil. For RMSE of interpolating ETo, one river basin (North
    Atlantic region) has greater, six have approximately equal, and two have less
    than the RMSE for overall Brazil. 3.2.5 Gridded data sets Using the interpolation
    method with the best skill score for each weather variable, we created gridded
    daily and monthly weather data across Brazil at 0.25∘ × 0.25∘ spatial resolution.
    The data are in Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) that includes grid coordinates,
    dates, and other relevant information. They are available online see: http://careyking.com/data-downloads.
    Our grid coordinates coincide with those in the TRMM data set. Thus, our data
    complement TRMM data that are available since 1998. For instance, it is possible
    to compare our gridded station-based precipitation to estimated precipitation
    in TRMM. We also include two indicators of the quality of each grid cell: the
    number of included stations with data, and the geodesic distance of the nearest
    reporting station with data. Figure 8 compares observed pr (left) at each station
    with our interpolated gridded data (right) for two days, 1 December 1980 and 1
    December 2010. These two days have 1869 and 3390 rain gauges, respectively. In
    this example, we observe that large areas, for example in the Amazon river basin,
    with few rain gauges cause large areas to have similar pr estimates in the gridded
    data. As the number of rain gauges increased through 2010, the gridded data in
    turn were able to provide higher resolution. This same pattern toward higher resolution
    is observed for the other weather variables (e.g. see Figure 9 displaying ETo
    calculated at weather stations versus calculated using interpolated gridded data).
    To generate gridded ETo data, we calculate ETo only at weather stations that have
    all the necessary data at the weather station for a particular day, and then interpolate
    these ETo from the weather stations to the grid. We do not first interpolate the
    underlying individual weather data for ETo to a grid and then estimate ETo from
    those gridded interpolations. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Scatter
    diagram of observed pr and its respective gridded map in two dates, 1 December
    1980 and 1 December 2010. Grey dots points are rain gauges or weather stations
    with pr = 0 mm on the respective day. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Scatter diagram of calculated ETo using observed data and its respective gridded
    map on two dates, 1 December 1980 and 1 December 2010. Oftentimes researchers
    and planners use models with monthly data instead of daily data. Thus, we provide
    data at both daily and monthly time steps to facilitate different models. For
    example, the decision support systems for agrotechnology transfer (Jones et al.,
    2003, DSSAT) models use daily inputs, and CROPWAT (Smith, 1992) can use monthly
    or daily inputs. Figures S7 and S8 show the monthly average pr and ETo, respectively,
    for the period of 1980–2013 in Brazil. One can see the low pr in the São Francisco
    river basin as half of the year has monthly precipitation of less than 20 mm.
    Further, this basin has relatively large values of ETo, suggesting that, without
    irrigation, water could be a limiting factor for crop yields. These monthly data
    can be used for broad planning purposes such as agroecological and crop zoning
    and drought analysis (e.g. Rubel and Kottek, 2010; Jabot et al., 2012; Assad et
    al., 2013; Cook et al., 2014). 4 Conclusions We studied the potential of six different
    interpolation methods to estimate six weather variables (Tmin, Tmax, RH, Rs, u2,
    and pr) and reference ET, ETo. We obtained the weather data from 3625 rain gauges
    and 735 weather stations that recorded data any time from 1980 through 2013. Using
    cross-validation analysis, we determined that IDW or ADW were the best interpolation
    methods for all variables. We found that performance depends on both the amount
    of data available and the season. For example, generally, the performance of the
    interpolations is better in recent years due to the increased number of weather
    stations. Because of lower precipitation levels during autumn and winter, the
    interpolations for precipitation are more accurate during those seasons. The forecast
    of extreme high or low values for weather variables is always weak (< 65 %), and
    wind speed (u2) has the lowest interpolation accuracy of all weather variables.
    Skill scores for meteorological variables are lower (with more accurate interpolation)
    for river basins with higher gauge or station densities (e.g. Uruguay River, Central
    and South Atlantic regions). In contrast, the Amazon River, with the lowest data
    density, has the worst skill scores for all variables studied. Daily and monthly
    gridded data were generated for the variables, at a resolution of 0.25∘ × 0.25∘.
    Development of daily and monthly gridded weather data for Brazil will significantly
    advance our ability to assess the reliability of satellite-based products and
    to evaluate the impacts of climate variability on water resources and crop production.

    results from multiple experiments. • The ICASA V2.0 standards allow flexible description
    of field experiments. • Major categories of data are management, soil, weather
    and crop responses. • The standards may be implemented in diverse digital formats.
    • Planned improvements emphasize data quality and appropriate usage. Abstract
    Agricultural research increasingly seeks to quantify complex interactions of processes
    for a wide range of environmental conditions and crop management scenarios, leading
    to investigation where multiple sets of experimental data are examined using tools
    such as simulation and regression. The use of standard data formats for documenting
    experiments and modeling crop growth and development can facilitate exchanges
    of information and software, allowing researchers to focus on research per se
    rather than on converting and re-formatting data or trying to estimate or otherwise
    compensate for missing information. The standards developed by the International
    Benchmark Sites Network for Agrotechnology Transfer (IBSNAT) project and subsequently
    revised by the International Consortium for Agricultural Systems Applications
    (ICASA) were of considerable value for describing experiments. However, the resulting
    ICASA Version 1 standards did not consider important management practices such
    as tillage and use of mulches, lacked descriptors for certain soil and plant traits
    (especially related to nutrient levels), and contained minor logical inconsistencies.
    The ICASA standards have evolved to allow description of additional management
    practices and traits of soils and plants and to provide greater emphasis on standardizing
    vocabularies, clarifying relations among variables, and expanding formats beyond
    the original plain text file format. This paper provides an overview of the ICASA
    Version 2.0 standards. The foundation of the standards is a master list variables
    that is organized in a hierarchical arrangement with major separations among descriptions
    of management practices or treatments, environmental conditions (soil and weather
    data), and measurements of crop responses. The plain text implementation is described
    in detail. Implementations in other digital formats (databases, spreadsheets,
    and data interchange formats) are also reviewed. Areas for further improvement
    and development are noted, particularly as related to describing pest damage,
    data quality and appropriate use of datasets. The master variable list and sample
    files are provided as electronic supplements. Previous article in issue Next article

    1. Introduction Efficient interchange of data among researchers, especially for
    use in simulation models and other decision support tools, requires use of a common
    vocabulary and strategy for organizing data. The agricultural research community
    increasingly encounters research problems that require interdisciplinary collaboration.
    Physiologists and molecular biologists work together to develop a better understanding
    of the genetic control of productivity-related traits. Agronomists, soil scientists
    and irrigation specialists combine efforts in order to increase the efficiency
    of crop water use. In such collaborations, efficient data interchange is essential.
    Furthermore, as data increasingly find use in applications that can affect the
    livelihoods of producers and other stakeholders, there is an ethical imperative
    for researchers to allow other people to examine their data. Taken together, these
    arguments create a powerful consensus for the need to promote data sharing in
    agricultural research (White and van Evert, 2008). Genomic data are widely available
    through publicly accessible databases (Blanchard, 2004, Jung et al., 2011), and
    daily weather records and soil profile data are increasingly available through
    the Internet. The International Research Institute for Climate Prediction (IRI)
    developed two daily weather data download sites (IRI, 2006 IRI, 2009). Similarly,
    the NASA Prediction of World Energy Resource web site (NASA/POWER; Stackhouse,
    2012) includes an option for downloading modeled daily weather in the ICASA format.
    The “World Inventory of Soil Emission Potentials” (WISE) database developed by
    the International Soil Reference and Information Centre in The Netherlands has
    been formatted for crop model applications (Gijsman et al., 2007, Romero et al.,
    2012). Field research data, however, are seldom available through public databases.
    Furthermore, information that is accessible often lacks key details such as on
    soil initial conditions and the timing and amounts of irrigations. Although various
    initiatives have developed systems for reporting and storing data from field research
    (e.g., van Evert et al., 1999a, van Evert et al., 1999b, Bostick et al., 2004,
    McLaren et al., 2005), no single system is widely used. Among the largest, sustained
    efforts to promote the use of standards in relation to field research was that
    of ICASA and one of its predecessors, the IBSNAT project. As early as 1983, IBSNAT
    began developing data standards for documenting field experiments. A key event
    was the International Symposium on Minimum Data Sets for Agrotechnology Transfer,
    with representatives from over 20 countries (ICRISAT, 1984, Uehara and Tsuji,
    1998). The standards and their implementation in plain text (“ASCII” or American
    Standard Code for Information Interchange) files facilitated interactions among
    experimenters and simulation modelers (Hunt et al., 1994, Jones et al., 1994).
    The plain text format was implemented in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology
    Transfer (DSSAT) software system (Tsuji et al., 1994, Jones et al., 2003, Hoogenboom
    et al., 2011) and was adopted by the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystem project
    (GCTE) for use in documenting experiments and regional yield investigations (GCTE,
    1996). Within GCTE, the standards greatly assisted comparisons among simulation
    models (Goudriaan, 1996, Jamieson et al., 1998, McMaster et al., 2008) that led
    to model improvements. Recently, the global Agricultural Model Improvement and
    Intercomparison Project (AgMIP; www.agmip.org), which seeks to improve characterizations
    of the effects of climate change on agriculture, has adopted the ICASA standards
    as a means of harmonizing and managing the data used by the numerous participating
    crop modeling teams. Experience with the IBSNAT standards and files showed that
    they contained ambiguities and lacked descriptors for characterizing certain crops
    and management practices. Members of ICASA and other organizations began revising
    the standards to reduce ambiguities, facilitate processing by a wider range of
    software, and include more types of crops and crop management practices. Use of
    the resulting ICASA Version 1.0 standards (Hunt et al., 2001, Hunt et al., 2006)
    highlighted additional issues that needed attention such as providing more extensive
    metadata and describing tillage and mulching practices. Furthermore, stakeholders
    requested that the standards permit other digital formats such as spreadsheets
    and relational databases. Thus, the ICASA standards have been further revised
    and expanded, with emphasis on standardizing vocabularies, clarifying relations
    among variables, and providing for description of additional management practices
    and types of measured data. The goal of the ICASA standards, following the thrust
    of the earlier IBSNAT standards, is to provide a reliable and flexible structure
    both for documenting field experiments (or their equivalents in greenhouses or
    growth chambers) and for specifying realistic conditions for dynamic simulations
    or other applications. As an admittedly idealized goal, based on the information
    provided in a data set, one would be able to replicate perfectly the described
    experiment. To fully document an experiment, detailed information is required
    on weather, soil, crop cultivars, weeds, diseases, pests, and crop management,
    along with measurements of crop growth and of dynamic soil characteristics. In
    practice, of course, it is exceedingly difficult to reproduce an experiment under
    field conditions due to the inherent season-to-season variability in weather,
    soil conditions, pest populations and crop management. Thus, a consensus has evolved
    over a level of description time that balances completeness, meaningful level
    of detail, and feasibility for data recording and management. The standards were
    originally developed under the “minimum data set” concept, which was elaborated
    at the 1983 symposium at ICRISAT (Nix, 1984). We emphasize, however, that because
    of the diversity of experiments that are considered, the list of variables documented
    in the standards is closer to a “maximal data set.” Indeed, since the standards
    can be extended to accommodate new variables, and a given implementation can be
    limited to a small subset of variables, the standards are better viewed as describing
    an “open data set” concept where databases are structured to satisfy the needs
    of specific lines of research or decision support. While interest in standards
    largely originated to support crop modeling, the standards are applicable in many
    disciplines. Most notably, this is through meta-analyses such as have been conducted
    for crop response to water (French and Schultz, 1984) and to elevated CO2 (Kimball
    et al., 2002, Lam et al., 2012), fate of nitrogen in cropping systems (Gardner
    and Drinkwater, 2009), and environmental impacts of organic farming (Tuomisto
    et al., 2012). Meta-analyses are often profitably extended through inclusion of
    simulation studies of generated variables, as illustrated by the review of 74
    studies on impacts of no-till management on soil carbon where the Century model
    was used to estimate soil organic carbon stocks (Ogle et al., 2012). This paper
    describes the ICASA Version 2.0 standards, which include much more detailed and
    structured metadata, provisions for describing tillage and use of mulches, and
    more flexible identification of variables. We present examples as implemented
    in plain text and as a spreadsheet, describe an implementation developed for AgMIP,
    and review options for other digital formats. The standards will continue to evolve,
    both through addition of new variables and new architecture to manage, for example,
    indicators of data quality. Updates to the definitions will be posted through
    the DSSAT Foundation web site (dssat.net/data/standards). 2. Overview of the standards
    The basic organization of the data is intended to allow description of essentially
    any field experiment or commercial crop production situation. A dataset thus may
    describe an experiment involving multiple sites and years as well as various crop
    and weed species, initial conditions and management practices. Data are organized
    through a central group of data that specifies the treatment structure, and which
    indexes replicates (if any), sequences within a crop rotation (if applicable),
    species components in multiple-cropping (if applicable), cultivars grown, crop
    management, and weather and soil conditions. This indexing also links the data
    from corresponding subsets that describe measurements of crops, soils or the aerial
    environment in a given experiment. The relations among classes of data are presented
    as an entity-relationship diagram (Pedersen, 2004) in Fig. 1. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Entity-relation diagram (Pedersen, 2004) for the ICASA
    Version 2 standards. Entities are represented by two-part boxes. The top, gray
    part contains the entity name. The bottom section lists the attributes. The connectors
    (lines) indicate relations among entities, with beginning and ends of connectors
    characterizing the type of relation (e.g., mandatory; one-to-one or one-to-many).
    Captions above the different groups of entities represent the major subsets of
    an experiment dataset. Various types of crop management are simplified by not
    showing the sub-groups describing individual events (e.g., for applications of
    organic materials, agrochemicals or for specific tillage practices). Attributes
    of summary and time series will vary greatly according to the experiment being
    documented. Measured field data typically include crop developmental stages, yield
    and yield components, and growth analysis data such as leaf area index (LAI),
    stem, leaf, aboveground and grain biomass, but they can include measurements of
    soil water content, soil nutrient levels, pest damage or other variables deemed
    relevant. Measurements may be recorded in two separate groups within the subset
    MEASURED_DATA. The group SUMMARY contains data recorded once for a given treatment,
    rotation, or crop component during the course of the experiment, such as the date
    a specific growth stage was attained, the grain yield, or the season total of
    water applied through irrigation. The group TIME_SERIES consists of measurements
    that are recorded at specific times throughout the experiment, thus representing
    a time series and being referenced to the specific dates when the measurements
    were made. Growth stages may be reported both as summary values (e.g., as time
    of anthesis or physiological maturity) or as time series (e.g., as stages attained
    at specific dates, most often using codes to identify specific stages). Variables
    of similar types (e.g., plant growth measurements, crop water balance descriptors,
    or pest effects) are arranged by sub-groups. Weather data and general descriptions
    of soil profiles are assigned to separate datasets because a single weather or
    soil data set may apply to multiple experiments. 2.1. Data items The fundamental
    unit is a data item that contains a name plus one or more values, which may be
    numerical data, identifiers, codes, or descriptive text. The names are character
    strings with no distinction between upper and lower case. The information in a
    data item can be either for a variable (a data attribute), which contain data
    pertinent to the experiment/situation documented, or level indicators that are
    used to link related assemblages of data items (relational attributes). Examples
    of variables include grain yield, the date an experiment was planted, the name
    of a cultivar used, and the name of a specific treatment. Level indicators are
    specified as integers and typically relate treatments in an experiment or components
    of management treatments such as for irrigation or fertilization. The dictionary
    of variables recognized in the standards is provided in Supplement A. The dictionary
    somewhat parallels efforts to develop data ontologies in other branches of plant
    and agricultural sciences (The Plant Ontology Consortium, 2002, Shrestha et al.,
    2010, FAO, 2012). Allowed data types for variables are numeric (integer or real)
    or character strings. A given variable must be of one data type. Units of measurement
    for numeric variables largely follow the International System of Units (SI), but
    centimeter (cm) and hectare (ha) are permitted in order to conform to dominant
    practices in agricultural research. Codes are provided for non-numeric variables
    where some degree of standardization is convenient or required, such as for describing
    fertilizer types, irrigation methods, or planting methods. Examples of codes are
    presented in Table 2, and the complete list of codes is included within Supplement
    A. 2.2. Datasets, subsets, groups and sub-groups To facilitate the management
    of different types of information, items are organized according to thematic categories
    or expected use. Four levels of hierarchy are recognized, i.e., datasets, subsets,
    groups (the term “group” is used in place of the more cumbersome “sub-subset”)
    and sub-groups. Datasets represent the highest level of aggregation within the
    standards. An experiment dataset contains the metadata, treatment structures,
    crop management and any measurements of systems responses (e.g., crop growth and
    changes in soil nutrients or moisture). A second dataset may contain one or more
    soil profile descriptions, usually from a single location or geographic region
    or data source, and the third dataset contains daily weather data from one or
    more recording stations. Subsets allow connected but not necessarily related data
    to be kept together. Three types of subsets within an experiment are recognized
    (Table 3). The metadata subset describes the objectives of the experiment, identifies
    the responsible researchers and institutions, and provides other background information.
    The management subset contains groups for treatment combinations, initial conditions,
    and details of crop management practices. The measured data subset contains measured
    crop and environmental responses, including yield, phenology and plant growth
    details. Both management details and measured data are linked independently to
    the specific details of the treatment (i.e., number, replicate, sequence and crop
    component). Data groups are comprised of related data items such as those describing
    one type of field operation, one soil profile characterization or one weather
    station. The group describing field locations provides the links to the associated
    soil profile and weather datasets. Within the management subset, most groups correspond
    to management activities (e.g., planting or irrigation) or to field measurements
    (Table 3). Sub-groups are used for types of events occurring at multiple times
    (e.g., for irrigation) or for data related to layers in a soil profile. 2.3. Naming
    conventions Experience from managing data from large numbers of experiments demonstrated
    the value of identifying datasets, subsets, groups and variables in a consistent
    manner. Furthermore, relatively short names facilitate manipulation in software
    such as spreadsheets or statistical packages. Recognizing, however, that flexibility
    is necessary in naming datasets and subsets in order to accommodate user needs
    and established local practices, users may propose identifiers that deviate from
    the preferred convention or establish translation lists that allow their data
    to be mapped onto the Version 2 dictionary (Supplement A). 2.3.1. Dataset names
    and identifiers Datasets are named as being of one of three types, EXPERIMENT,
    SOIL or WEATHER (Table 3). Individual datasets are further assigned a specific
    identifier that indicates the contents of the set. These are constructed differently
    for experiments, soils, and weather. For experiments, an identifier is constructed
    by combining an institution or region code (three characters, e.g., “UFL” for
    “University of Florida”, “CAN” for “Canada”), a code for the site or set of sites
    (three characters, e.g., “GNV” for “Gainesville”), a year code (four characters
    usually representing the year in which the experiment was initiated or harvested),
    an experiment number or code (four characters), and a crop, multi-crop (for mixed
    cropping or crops with weed populations) or sequence (for rotation experiments)
    code (three characters). Thus, the third experiment (0 0 0 3) conducted by the
    University of Florida (UFL) at Gainesville (GNV) in 2006 with soybeans would be
    identified as “UFLGNV20060003SBN”. For weather datasets, identifiers can be constructed
    from Institution and Site codes plus, if desired, four digits to indicate the
    starting year (e.g., UFLGNV2006). Optionally, a fourteen-character code may be
    used where the first four digits indicate the number of years of data, and the
    last four characters identify other characteristics of the set. Thus, “UFLGNV196825M1”
    might indicate a 25-year series from Gainesville, Florida that started in 1968
    and that used a method “M1” for estimating daily solar radiation. For soil data,
    specific set identifiers can be constructed using a three-character code for the
    institution or region, plus a three-character code for the site or collection
    of sites. Longer names (within a fourteen character limit) can be used to provide
    information on the contents of the set. Thus, “ARIZONA” could be used as a general
    name for a dataset containing soil profile descriptions from diverse sites in
    Arizona. 2.3.2. Names and identifiers for data subsets and groups For experiments
    in which each dataset is restricted to data from that experiment, the general
    names (Table 3) identify each subset (e.g., METADATA, MANAGEMENT or MEASURED DATA)
    and group (e.g., TREATMENTS, PLANTING or TILLAGE). Weather and soil datasets often
    contain information for multiple weather stations or soil profiles, so specific
    subset or group identifiers may need to be appended to the basic name to uniquely
    identify the data items. For weather subsets that contain only a part of an overall
    dataset, e.g., a single year or portion of a year, the subset should be identified
    with the general name plus a suffix that provides more specific information, such
    as WEATHER_STATION:UFLGNV2004S1, in which the suffix “S1” might indicate “Season
    1”. For soil subsets (single soil profile descriptions), the specific identifiers
    are 14-characters long. The Institution and Site codes occupy the leading six
    positions, the year the profile was described is in the next four positions, and
    a specific profile identifier occupies the remaining four positions. Thus, a valid
    soil subset identifier would be SOIL_PROFILE:UFLGNV20040001. 2.3.3. Names for
    variables The length of many variable names in the ICASA Version 1 standards were
    limited to four or five characters to permit displaying a name as a label over
    a column of data that contained no more than five digits. The extension of the
    standards to other digital formats has reduced the need for short variable names,
    so the ICASA V2 standards allow two primary name formats, a long variable name
    and an abbreviated name (Table 1). The long name is generally 12–24 characters
    long and uses complete words as much as possible, with the words being separated
    by the underscore (“_”) character. Abbreviated names for most data are four or
    five characters long to permit their use as compact column headings. The names
    often correspond to those used in DSSAT, but some variables have been re-named
    to improve clarity. Table 1. Examples of variables used to describe inputs, crops,
    management practices, environment, and other aspects of an experiment as specified

    The naming strategy for abbreviated names of measured data emphasizes consistency
    in use of each character position in the name string. For observed data relating
    to plant organ weights or nutrient content, the first character indicates the
    tissue type, and the second describes the quantity being measured. Thus, for LWAD,
    “L” is for leaf, and W is for dry weight (“F” for fresh weight). The third and
    sometimes the fourth character(s) indicate, the measurement reference, such as
    “A” for land area basis, “PC” for percentage and “NO” for number (counts). The
    final character indicates the time or frequency of measurement or observation,
    such as “D” for specific sampling or observation dates and “H” for data recorded
    at harvest. For display purposes, variable labels are also defined based on the
    abbreviated names. The main differences are that variables where values are given
    as percentages are indicated through use of “%” in place of “PC” and as counts
    through use of “#” in place of “NO”. Most variables names are unique, even when
    the same basic variable is described in different datasets or subsets. This ensures
    that the variable can be used independently of its assigned dataset or subset.
    Situations of multiple instances of a variable name primarily involve metadata
    (e.g., e-mail address of data providers), dates, soil depths and application methods.
    3. Implementations of the standards The standards are designed to permit implementations
    in whatever digital formats meet the needs of users. The primary requirement was
    that the dictionary of variable names, identifiers and codes should include definitions
    and units of measurement, be comprehensive enough to embrace experiments conducted
    with different objectives, and allow use in different digital formats. Thus, the
    Version 2 master list of variables includes the variable names, definitions, units
    of measurement, data types and suggested allowable minimum and maximum values
    (Supplement A). An additional requirement was to define the relations among variables
    so that treatment structures and sampling regimes (e.g., dates or positions within
    a soil profile) could be described accurately. This required that the master list
    also assign variables to their corresponding positions within the hierarchy of
    datasets, subsets, groups, and if applicable, sub-groups. 3.1. Implementation
    in the plain text format When the standards are implemented in plain text, a single
    file may correspond to a dataset, subset or group. Data items are formatted in
    columns that are headed by the abbreviated variable name. The names are presented
    above the variables or level indicators on a header line that begins with the
    symbol ‘@’ (Fig. 2). Multiple names can occur on one line. Headers for long text
    variables are extended to the expected length by appending a string of periods
    after the variable name to indicate the full allowed length of values for the
    respective variable (e.g., “TRT_NAME…” under treatments in Fig. 2). Blank lines
    may appear anywhere in the file. Comments are indicated by an explanation point
    (“!”) as the first character in the line and may appear in any part of a dataset.
    Fig. 2 presents a dataset for a single experiment, without the measured crop,
    weather and soil data. Supplement B contains the complete description. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Example of an ICASA experimental details dataset
    implemented as a flat file. Lines that start with “!” are comments. 3.1.1. File
    organization and naming The usual file organization is for data from a given dataset
    or subset to reside within a single file. The file is named using a conventional
    name-plus-extension format where the name identifies the specific set or subset,
    and the file extension specifies the type of dataset. The name is simply the identifier
    as described in Section 2.3.1. File extensions may be of three main types. The
    extension “EXP” identifies an experiment, “SOL” identifies a soil profile dataset,
    and “WTH” identifies a weather dataset. The subset for observed and measured data
    from an experiment is often assigned to two additional, separate files for summary
    and time-course groups. Their respective extensions are “EXA” for summary data
    and “EXT” for time-course data. Large weather datasets can be subdivided to simplify
    file handling. In such cases, the subset names indicate the time period covered
    and are used as the file names. Thus, a dataset with the name UFLGNV19750020,
    having 20 years of daily data starting in 1975, could be broken into two 10-year
    subsets, identified as UFLGNV19750010.WTH and UFLGNV19850010.WTH. 3.1.2. Special
    characters for file processing Within individual files, specific symbols are used
    to guide digital parsing as well as visual inspection. Datasets are identified
    with a dollar sign ($) in the first column of the first line. This symbol is followed
    by the general name and the specific identifier. Three valid examples are $EXPERIMENT:UCADAV19960001SBN,$WEATHER:UFLGNV2001
    or $SOIL:ARIZONA. Subsets and groups are identified by placing two dollar signs
    ($$) for subsets and an asterisk (∗) for groups in the character positions before
    the identifier, for example, ∗TREATMENTS, ∗IRRIGATIONS or $$WEATHER_STATION:UFLGVN2004S1.
    An “@” symbol indicates the start of a row of column headers given as abbreviated
    variable names. 3.1.3. Linking data across datasets and subsets Numeric level
    identifiers and character strings link information across datasets, subsets, groups
    and sub-groups in a manner analogous to how keys link tables in a relational database.
    Links among assemblages of data require multiple identifiers in order to accommodate
    combinations of treatments, replicates, crop rotations and crop or weed associations
    as specified in the TREATMENTS subset (Table 4 and Fig. 2). Treatment levels and
    the associated links are identified with integers, preferably numbered from 1
    to the maximum number of levels within a given experiment. A value of 0 for the
    replicate implies that the values represent means across replicates. Table 4.

    and means and of different plant species components (wheat and weeds). Note that
    while data for individual replicates are given for wheat, the weed component is
    only specified at the level of means of the two replicates. 3.1.4. Special syntax
    and formatting rules To simplify parsing by software and to facilitate viewing
    and manual checking of the files, the plain text implementation limits the line
    length to 254 characters. Variable name abbreviations, variables, level indicators,
    and dataset and subset identifiers are allowed up to 31 characters. Specific rules
    for comments, missing data, non-applicable data, data flags, sub-samples, and
    end-of-file markers are summarized in Table 5. Missing numeric data are identified
    by −99, and missing character strings or text, by the string “−99”. Missing information
    such as for application methods, irrigation types or fertilizer types are identified
    with specific codes (Table 2). Dates for growth stages are presented using four
    digits for the year and three digits for the day (“year-day of year” format such
    as “2009253” for day 253 of 2009). Table 5. Special syntax and formatting rules
    for the ICASA standards. Item Syntax or formatting rule Comments Information on
    data quality, problems with treatments, or aspects of an experiment that are difficult
    to quantify should normally be recorded under the metadata subset for an experiment.
    Note that specific comment fields are provided for methods, production constraints
    and unexpected complications that arise during experiments. However, comments
    can also be inserted immediately after a dataset or subset identifier, or after
    a line of data using ‘!’ as the first character in the line (used only in the
    plain text implementation) Missing data Indicated by a value of −99 for numeric
    data and the string “−99” for text data Non-applicable data Indicated by a value
    of −99. For example, row width and spacing for a crop that is broadcast sown End-of-file
    The symbol ‘=’ can be entered as the only character on the last line of a file
    to indicate the end of a file. Its use is recommended to indicate whether a file
    has unintentionally been truncated (used only in the plain text implementation)
    3.1.5. File additions and modifications To incorporate new data items in a dataset,
    additional abbreviated names are defined, and the corresponding columns of data
    items are added within an existing or new group. Adding additional data items
    at the end of existing long rows of data items is discouraged. Two exceptions
    are when the variable is needed as a link to data elsewhere in the file, e.g.,
    additional factors in the treatment subset, or when adding data at the end of
    existing rows of data items might disrupt the overall configuration of the file
    (e.g., for a new daily weather variable). 3.2. Implementing the standards in other
    digital formats 3.2.1. The AgMIP Crop Experiment database as an alternative digital
    implementation The AgMIP Crop Experiment (ACE) database contains data from detailed
    field experiments as well as less-detailed data from variety trials conducted
    by international agricultural research centers, universities and the private sector
    (Villalobos, 2012). The database is designed to hold descriptions potentially
    of thousands of field experiments and to permit concurrent access by a global
    user community. ACE is implemented in a non-relational database using the Riak
    platform (wiki.basho.com). Riak is an open source, hybrid, key-value data storage
    system that is deployed in a clustered fashion where data are distributed across
    multiple nodes (locations). Riak is intended to be simple to operate, to tolerate
    failures at individual nodes, and to scale easily from prototypes to large databases.
    Data are sorted into “buckets” that store keys and “values”. The values are type-agnostic,
    so digital formats may range from integers to text files to complex objects. In
    ACE, experiment-related data are divided into the buckets, with each experiment
    assigned a unique key. A separate metadata bucket stores and indexes a searchable
    subset of the experiment data, enabling fast searching within the database. Since
    information from a given experiment is stored in a single bucket, rather than
    multiple tables, fast retrieval times for large amounts of data are possible.
    In ACE, the actual data that describe an experiment are stored using JSON (JavaScript
    Object Notation, www.json.org) structures, so this is the main component of ACE
    where the ICASA standard is applied. A sample JSON structure representing a maize
    experiment is presented in Fig. 3. The experiment has two treatments, rainfed
    and irrigated. Data from treatment 1 are used in treatment 2, except where explicitly
    overridden by the new data entries, in this case, irrigation records. Irrigation
    data are stored as nested JSON structures. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 3. Example of a portion of a crop experiment described using a Java Script
    Object Notation (JSON) data structure as used by AgMIP. The dataset corresponds
    to a maize experiment which was planted on 26 Feb 1982. Explanatory notes are
    given in comments delineated by “/∗ comment ∗/”. 3.2.2. Other digital formats
    Relational databases are widely used to store and query large sets of data. The
    groupings of data recognized in the ICASA standards readily permit implementation
    as a relational database. Groups and sub-groups correspond to tables in a relational
    database. Individual data items are stored in database fields within tables. Relations
    among tables would follow those defined in the entity-relation diagram given in
    Fig. 1. While the ICASA standards focus on ensuring accurate characterization
    of single experiments, the standards are readily extended to storing multiple
    experiments using a relational model. Spreadsheets are widely used for data entry,
    are available on most personal computers, and can be read with a range of other
    software. Similar to relational databases, individual sheets can be created that
    correspond to a group or sub-group and are named accordingly. Each column in such
    a sheet would contain a variable name as a header and the corresponding data values
    in the cells below the header. Supplement C provides an example spreadsheet based
    on the wheat dataset used in Fig. 2 and Supplement B. In this example, three header
    rows are given, providing the full variable name, the units of measurement and
    the display name. Data interchange formats such as JSON (used in the ACE database)
    and XML (eXtensible Markup Language; XML Core Working Group, 2008) provide further
    examples of options for implementations of the standards. The preferred approach
    with XML is to define an XML schema or document type definition (DTD), so that
    XML-compatible software can read the file, perform basic validation checks, and
    correctly interpret the data for subsequent processing (XML Core Working Group,
    2008). Typically, parties having a shared interest in a discipline develop an
    XML standard for the subject matter of interest. We are currently examining XML
    standards proposed by other groups involved in agricultural research or industry
    and expect to develop an XML prototype that is consistent with the ICASA standards.
    4. Applications of the standards The ICASA standards are intended to support any
    activity that requires detailed descriptions of a field experiment or commercial
    production situation. To date, the foremost use of the standards has been in simulation
    modeling where datasets have been used to specify initial conditions, weather
    inputs, soil inputs, and management for specific cropping situations and to provide
    measured data on crop responses that are used in model development and cross validation
    (e.g., White et al., 2008). Nonetheless, datasets can also be used for meta-analysis
    using regression and other techniques. For example, to compare a large set of
    measured and modeled datasets of solar radiation, White et al. (2011) prepared
    the daily data in weather datasets. 5. Standards documentation, revisions and
    expansions Complete definitions of variable names, variable codes, dataset and
    subset names, and relations are maintained as a set of tables accessible at the
    DSSAT Foundation web site (dssat.net/data/standards). The standards allow for
    new datasets, subsets, groups and variables to be defined according to the needs
    of specific users, but the utility of the standards requires a uniform vocabulary.
    Users are encouraged to propose new variable names and codes, as well as subsets,
    groups and sub-groups, together with concerns over inconsistencies in the overall
    standards. Use of the standards by AgMIP is illustrative of the types of revisions
    made in producing Version 2. Recognizing the need to provide better background
    descriptions of experiments, new variables were defined in the METADATA subset
    to indicate the experiment duration, whether it was conducted on a research station
    or on a farm, and whether it was managed by researchers, a producer or others.
    Also, descriptors for persons, locations and citations were expanded. A second
    example of the revision process is taken from a project by the University of Florida
    to develop a prototype data management system for the Florida Department of Agriculture
    and Consumer Services. In reviewing the data to be reported, an agronomist noted
    that although plastic mulches are widely used for vegetable production, they were
    not considered in the standards. To introduce a new category of management practices,
    the category is defined as a group and provided a link to the TREATMENTS group
    of the MANAGEMENT subset. Individual events need to be described in terms of dates,
    methods and materials. Thus, the group MULCHES was created with level indicators
    that linked to the TREATMENTS group. Since mulch types differ in thickness, portion
    of ground cover provided, and other characteristics, variables were defined for
    mulching dates, type of mulch applied, mulching application method, and date of
    mulch removal. Subsequently, mulch removal proved to be a substantially different
    operation from mulch application, so separate sub-groups for mulch addition and
    removal were created. We anticipate that the variable list and codes for mulching
    will be modified as additional field data are processed using the standards. One
    unresolved issue is how best to deal with organic mulches that are expected to
    decompose and contribute to soil nutrient and carbon pools since the standards
    also recognize the group ORGANIC_MATERIALS. One area for improving the standards
    concerns documentation of grazing, pest and other types of damage such as defoliation
    by wind or hail. The sub-group PEST_POPS_EFFECTS under TIME_SERIES of MEASURED_DATA
    currently defines pest population effects, which includes variables for pest populations
    (e.g., of unspecified root worms) and for levels of damage in terms of mass consumed,
    leaf area reduction or other effects. For insects, variables have been defined
    for specific species and instars, so the potential for proliferation of variables
    is large. Most likely, damage needs to be indexed by species (if known) and developmental
    stage of the pest in a manner similar to how soil data that linked to profile
    layers. However, it is unclear how best to link types of damage to causal species
    or mechanisms because crops are often affected by multiple problems. Another area
    requiring attention is indicators of data quality. Statistical indicators such
    as the standard error should be associated with values of quantitative field measurements
    such as grain yield or volumetric soil moisture content. A second example is when
    data describing crop management practices are based on estimated dates or amounts
    in lieu of detailed measurements. Fertilizer applications and irrigation amounts
    are often reported as total season amounts and numbers of applications (e.g.,
    “a total of 150 kg ha−1 of N was applied preplant and at two dates after emergence”).
    While fertilizer type, dates of application, amounts per application, and depths
    of incorporation might be inferred accurately based upon local knowledge, any
    such estimations should be documented within the dataset. One strategy is to indicate
    the completeness of the original data by providing single-letter flags for completeness
    of data for dates, amounts, methods, or other characteristics. A related issue
    is to how to indicate appropriate usage or value of a given dataset. This requires
    more precise metadata relating to the objectives of individual experiments, measurement
    protocols and presence of field problems such as weed, insect or disease problems.
    The value of a given dataset might be assessed by the experimenter or a subsequent
    user of the dataset. Additional thematic areas where expansions are under discussion
    include ratoon and perennial crop management, characterization of germplasm (e.g.,
    for genetic loci, growth habit and phenology), socioeconomic data (monetary costs
    and labor), carbon costs, life cycle assessments, and near-instantaneous measurements
    (e.g., leaf gas exchange), including measurement conditions and protocols. Suggestions
    for additions or modifications to the ICASA standards are reviewed frequently
    and updates to the standards are made as necessary. Backward compatibility will
    be maintained by retaining synonyms and presenting these in the master list of
    standard variable names, which is downloadable from the ICASA site. Comments or
    suggestions on the ICASA standards may be submitted through the DSSAT site (dssat.net/contact-us)
    or to the corresponding author of this paper. An associated web site for the ICASA
    Data Exchange (dssat.net/data/exchange) allows users to store and share datasets.
    6. Concluding remarks The ICASA V2.0 standards for documenting field experiments
    have the goal of facilitating exchange of information and software tools. Wider
    use of the standards can help to focus research on science issues rather than
    on re-formatting shared data and to promote greater consensus in documenting field
    experiments. Too often in working with data from secondary sources, one finds
    that key data on initial soil conditions or crop management are not provided even
    though the original study likely recorded the data. In the past, incomplete reporting
    was an accepted practice because researchers lacked efficient mechanisms to manage
    and store the data and the journals sought brevity in methodology. With improved
    software and declining costs of electronic data storage, the main obstacle to
    more efficient management of research data appears to be a lack of consensus on
    how to organize data. The ICASA standards represent an attempt to promote such
    a consensus. We emphasize that the ICASA V2.0 standards are meant to be flexible
    and dynamic. Given the potential diversity of research applications for datasets,
    it is unlikely that the agricultural research community would agree to a single
    digital format or that this would even be desirable. Similarly, new types of variables
    continually arise that merit inclusion in descriptions of experiments. Nonetheless,
    the foundation provided by an existing standard is expected to facilitate orderly
    evolution of such descriptions and promote more efficient use of research datasets.

    The Cropland Data Layer (CDL) contains crop and other specific land cover classifications
    obtained using remote sensing for the conterminous United States. This raster-formatted
    and geo-referenced product has been widely used in such applications as disaster
    assessments, land cover and land use research, agricultural sustainability studies,
    and agricultural production decision-making. The traditional CDL data distribution
    channels include paper thematic maps, email data requests, CD/DVD media, and ftp
    bulk downloading. To effectively and efficiently meet the growing needs of our
    customers, CropScape (the name invented for a new interactive Web CDL exploring
    system) was developed to query, visualize, disseminate, and analyze CDL data geospatially
    through standard geospatial Web services in a publicly accessible online environment.
    CropScape not only offers the online functionalities of interactive map operations,
    data customization and downloading, crop acreage statistics, charting and graphing,
    and multitemporal change analysis as well in an interoperable manner, but also
    provides Web geoprocessing services such as automatic data delivery and on-demand
    crop statistics for uses in other applications. This system delivers dynamic user
    experiences with its comprehensive capabilities in an open geospatial context,
    and facilitates delivery and analysis of geospatial cropland information for decision
    support and various research endeavors. More than 17,000 users around the world
    have visited CropScape in its first 5 months of availability. Highlights ► The
    development of an effective and efficient method of distributing CDL data. ► The
    building of CropScape to visualize, customize, and analyze on-demand CDL data.
    ► The implementation of Web services to facilitate the CDL data applications.

    statistics 1. Introduction Knowledgeable agricultural decision-making and policy
    formulation are critical to US and global agricultural sustainable development,
    food security, and economic prosperity. Farming decisions are becoming more complex
    because of the internationalization of agricultural product markets, global climate
    change, and the need for farmers to adopt sustainable farming practices (Lynch
    et al., 2000). Incomplete information is one of the main constraints for decision-making
    (Bacic et al., 2006). The availability of and access to geo-information are particularly
    crucial for the design, implementation, and monitoring of agri-environmental schemes
    (Castelein and de Bruin, 2007). The systematic process and system for collecting,
    processing, storing, archiving, preserving, retrieving, visualizing, analyzing,
    and disseminating agro-geoinformation are critical for the best use of agro-geoinformation,
    the agricultural-related geo-information that supports agricultural decision-making
    and policy formulation. Geo-information technology, such as remote sensing technology
    for mapping the land cover of the Earth (agricultural land, forest, wetland, etc.)
    from satellites (Jensen, 2004), geographic information systems (GIS) for capturing,
    storing, manipulating, and displaying geographic information in digital form (Clarke,
    1997, DeMers, 1997), and communication technologies, notably the Internet, for
    accessing, processing, and disseminating agro-geoinformation has offered appropriate
    technology for establishing such a systematic process and developing such a system.
    US Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural Statistics Service
    (NASS) collects and provides timely, accurate, and useful statistical information
    in service to US agriculture. The Spatial Analysis Research Section (SARS) within
    the Research and Development Division of NASS has produced a yearly Cropland Data
    Layer (CDL) product based on mid-resolution satellite data and high quality ground
    truth since 1997 (Boryan et al., 2011). This agricultural geospatial data is a
    crop and other specific land cover classification encompassing the entire contiguous
    United States. It provides geo-referenced, high accuracy, 30 or 56 m resolution,
    crop specific cropland land cover information. This product has been extensively
    used by policy and decision makers, scientists, researchers, educators, and farm
    producers for land cover monitoring, agricultural sustainability, crop acreage
    and yield estimation, disaster assessment, bioenergy crop inventory, food security
    policy, environmental assessment, carbon accounting, and other research interests
    that are of vital importance to American agriculture and its economy (Kutz et
    al., 2012, Liknes et al., 2006, Maxwell et al., 2010, Muller et al., 2008, Shao
    et al., 2010, Shore et al., 2006, Shore and Gregory, 2010, Sun et al., 2008, Wang
    et al., 2011, West et al., 2010). This valuable CDL product was historically disseminated
    to users via paper thematic maps, CD/DVD media, or FTP download via zipped files
    from the NASS (NASS, 2011) website or the USDA Geospatial Data Gateway (NRCS,
    2011). The CDL users had challenging tasks in locating, acquiring, accessing,
    visualizing, analyzing, manipulating, or consuming this geospatial data product.
    The need for special visualization and analytical software or tools also became
    a burden for users. Moreover, the traditional dissemination channels did not provide
    any data access, manipulation, processing, and analysis capabilities to the end
    users or any Web services to other desktops or distributed applications. Obviously,
    the current dissemination methods were ineffective, and could no longer meet the
    growing and demanding needs of the agricultural community and general public domain.
    A fast, open and interoperable data access and dissemination application system
    with online data navigation, visualization, and analysis capabilities and services
    was badly needed. This paper describes CropScape (http://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/),
    a Web service-based and rich internet application that handles large volumes of
    data, intensive computation, concurrent access and spatial–temporal intensity.
    The paper also addresses major issues involved in agro-geoinformation utilization
    and explores how to integrate different geospatial data handling tasks and services,
    such as easy and open access, online visualization, geospatial navigation and
    querying, reformatting and transformation, delineation of area of interest, on-the-fly
    data analysis, data processing, and dissemination, into an agro-geoinformation
    application based on distributed geospatial services and components. CropScape
    uses intuitive building of the end user’s skills and experiences to design a user
    interface that is effective for both beginners and advanced users. The scalability,
    reusability, interoperability, performance, and efficiency are balanced in the
    application of a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and in the implementation
    of Web services. These services along with CDL agro-geospatial data can be shared,
    and integrated by third parties into their geospatial Web applications. Finally,
    the described CropScape application was used in assessing the impact of the 2011
    Mississippi River flood disaster on cropland damage in Mississippi County, Missouri.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as the following: Section 2 introduces
    the CDL product background, the system requirements and specifications, architecture
    framework design along with its implementation, and the detailed system functionalities
    and their Web service implementations. Section 3 presents CropScape application
    case studies. Section 4 discusses applications of CropScape and future work. Section
    5 summarizes conclusions. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. CDL data USDA/NASS classifies
    US crop cover types using satellite imagery from the Advanced Wide Field Sensor
    (AWiFS) and Landsat TM 5 and ETM+ 7. It uses USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) Common
    Land Unit (CLU) data and associated Administrative Data 578 attribute data (which
    includes all crop specific information such as crop type, status, and intention
    codes), NASS’s June Agricultural Survey (JAS) data, and US Geological Survey (USGS)’s
    National Land Cover Datasets (NLCD) as ground truth to produce the categorized
    geo-referenced annual CDL product. The NLCD derived products, such as the National
    Elevation Dataset (NED), percent tree canopy, and the percent impervious product
    data are used as an ancillary dataset for classification (Boryan et al., 2011).
    The result of this classification is a crop-specific, 30 or 56 m resolution land
    cover image (thematic map) encompassing the entire contiguous United States, as
    shown in Fig. 1. The CDL product is a geo-referenced raster dataset. The standard
    product is projected in the Albers equal area projection and distributed in GeoTIFF
    format. NASS also provides the metadata files in .html and .xml formats, and the
    “super-matrix” accuracy assessments of all states CDL data for the crop year 20091
    and 20102 on its website. The published CDL data dates back to 1997. The spatial
    resolution of most CDL data is 30 m, but for the crop years 2006–2009, the resolution
    is 56 m. Starting from 2009, the CDL product covers all 48 conterminous states.
    This geospatial product derived from remote sensing and ground truth data delivers
    approximated acreage estimates by counting pixels within a given area of interest
    (AOI), an estimate that is not considered as a NASS official estimate, and provides
    detailed geolocation information on the planted crops. All available CDL data
    needed to be served online to facilitate users to visualize, retrieve, analyze,
    and utilize the data. However, the mid-resolution, huge data volume, and large
    spatial coverage of the CDL raster data (A state CDL data file could be up to
    700 MB or more) presented a big challenge to achieve the online visualization,
    dissemination and analysis over the Web. The traditional distribution channels
    as previously described greatly limited the effectiveness and efficiency for the
    CDL data publishing, equal access, dissemination and usage, and could not meet
    the growing needs from the community. Therefore, this paper focuses on answering
    questions about how to serve all CDL data online and how to provide the capabilities
    of geospatial querying, exploring, and analyzing online via a Web application.
    The raster data to be served online also includes the Global Land Cover Data,
    which is served as a background map layer for reference purposes. This dataset
    classifies the global land surface into 22 categories at 300 m resolution (POSTEL,
    2008). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. 2009 Cropland Data Layer: a
    thematic map in raster format. In addition to the CDL raster data, different boundary
    layers are served to define the specific AOI for visualization, navigation, and
    analysis. The latest 2010 TIGER/Line Shapefiles for the 48 contiguous states and
    their counties as well as the District of Columbia from the US Census Bureau website
    (US Census Bureau, 2010) were used as boundary feature data in CropScape. Moreover,
    the Agricultural Statistics District (ASD) was also included as an important boundary
    for crop acreage analysis. An ASD is defined by a group of counties which have
    similar cropping practices, geographic features, and climate conditions within
    a state. The ASD boundaries are pre-generated by merging the boundary files of
    counties within the same district. Beyond these predefined state, county and ASD
    permanent boundaries, the user defined, simple boundaries are also supported in
    the form of AOI to meet the user’s specific analysis needs. In CropScape, the
    USDA NASS (2007) tabulated county statistical data was also considered for spatial
    queries. The county level major crop acreages from the Census of Agriculture were
    included for comparison (NASS, 2007). 2.2. System requirements and specifications
    The business and system requirements for the proposed Web-based application were
    collected and refined by intensively communicating with stakeholders and users.
    The system requirements reflected the needs of most users, especially those who
    do not have GIS software or GIS skills and experience. It was required that the
    proposed CropScape application should provide the capabilities of accessing, customizing,
    downloading, analyzing, and disseminating CDL data, and online user guides and
    help documents to users. In addition, some open and standards-compliant Web geospatial
    services should be offered with detailed descriptions and technical support. Those
    web services can enable the CDL data served with CropScape to be easily integrated
    with other third party geospatial applications. A successful Web-based decision
    support application system should be fast and user-friendly, and provide sufficient
    and highly useful capabilities to end users (Keil et al., 1995, Fernandez and
    Neal, 2007). The latest Web technologies and Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
    standards offer the best solutions to develop an open geospatial Web application
    to meet all these requirements (Iosifescu-Enescu et al., 2010) and to support
    serving the CDL to the general public and the business, science, research, and
    educational communities. Such an agricultural geospatial Web application will
    help users access, query, visualize, customize, download, and analyze CDL data
    interactively at any geographic level using common Internet browsers, and provide
    other applications standard Web geospatial data retrieval and processing services.
    In particular, the specified CropScape functionalities include common map functions,
    layer display control, defining any AOI by a boundary or geometry, multiple data
    retrieval options, support of various output format and projection, acreage statistics
    calculation, chart and table exporting, land cover change analysis and display,
    and map export and printing, etc. These functionalities are implemented in either
    callable Web services or internal functions. The detailed software implementation
    specifications are further developed based on these function definitions and system
    design. 2.3. Architecture framework design A general 3-layer framework is adopted
    to share and distribute geospatial data and to achieve the objectives of this
    system, as shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. System
    architecture framework. SOA allows for quick response to new requirements for
    other geospatial data and assimilates new geospatial data and processing services
    from service providers (Granell et al., 2010). It also provides maximum system
    scalability for future system augmentation. Open Web standards and OGC geospatial
    data and processing standards are adopted in this extensible framework to make
    it accessible, interoperable, and reusable. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the application
    layer includes various geospatial applications that support standard Web and OGC
    services; these applications like ArcGIS Explorer (ArcGIS Explorer Desktop, 2011)
    could mash-up available online data services with local data layers or invoke
    Web processing services in their own environment. The service layer contains OGC
    standard compliant Web Feature Service (WFS) (Vretanos, 2005), Web Map Service
    (WMS) (de la Beaujardière, 2006), Web Coverage Service (WCS) (Whiteside and Evans,
    2008) and Web geoprocessing services to provide geospatial data and processing
    services. The Data Layer offers various geospatial and attribute data which are
    stored in files or databases, and could be accessed directly or indirectly by
    geospatial data and processing services. The data from Data Layer are processed
    and or served by Web services contained in the Service Layer. The processed results
    or data retrieved from the Data Layer are sent back to the clients in the application
    layer. The next sub-section will discuss these three layers in details. 2.3.1.
    Application layer In the implementation of CropScape, open source JavaScript libraries,
    ExtJS (ExtJS 4, 2011) and OpenLayers (OpenLayers, 2011), are used to develop an
    Ajax-powered rich Internet application (as shown in Fig. 2) which can be accessed
    through most common browsers, for example, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari,
    Opera, and Chrome, without installing any additional software or plug-in (Han
    et al., 2011, Lawton, 2008). Users, even those who do not have specialized computer
    skills or GIS experiences, can use this Web application easily (Han et al., 2009).
    ExtJS is a free cross-browser JavaScript framework that provides a wide range
    of user interface components and APIs to build responsive Web applications (Sencha,
    2011). ExtJS is among the most popular open source JavaScript packages because
    of its valued community support, high performance, and ease of maintenance. OpenLayers
    offers an Ajax-enabled open source Web mapping framework that supports map layers
    from OGC WMS and WFS, Geography Markup Language (GML), Google Maps, Yahoo Maps,
    and Bing Maps, and interacts with these layers through a suite of map controls.
    A user-friendly interface as shown in Fig. 3 is designed using different groups
    of application functionalities. A user interface design principle is adopted with
    no submenu deeper than three layers. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    3. CropScape user interface. In the user interface that uses ExtJS, the map layer
    control is created with radio boxes and check boxes to show or hide the layers.
    The transparency of these layers can be adjusted by moving the slide bar. The
    legend window provides the category names with the specified colors and the boundary
    layer names. An overview window maintains the global view of the current map view
    location. A common toolbar, which contains a set of common functional buttons
    across the pages, is created to facilitate map operations and data analysis. It
    gives consistency in look and feel as well as implementation. And the geo-location
    of the current cursor position is displayed on the toolbar. The Help and FAQ buttons
    on the right side of the toolbar together with the DEMO link at the bottom provide
    users with assistance in use of the CropScape application. The map view is implemented
    based on OpenLayers to support Web-based map display and map operations like zoom
    in/out, drag-box zoom, and panning. HTTP GET/POST requests are utilized in the
    communications between clients and the server through messages in XML or JavaScript
    Object Notation (JSON) format. Overall, CropScape client interface offers users
    a direct, interactive, and responsive way to view, query, download, and analyze
    CDL data. 2.3.2. Service layer The service layer contains open Web geospatial
    data services and specially developed Web geo-processing services. MapServer (Kropla,
    2005) deployed in Apache’s Common Gateway Interface (CGI) acts as the server of
    WFS, WCS, and WMS because of its popularity, high performance, and robustness.
    In CropScape, a browser client sends a WMS GetMap request to render map layers,
    including: background layer, CDL layers, and political boundary layers, a WMS
    GetFeatureInfo request to query the detailed information of specified features,
    and a WFS GetFeature request to retrieve boundary features in GML. The boundary
    features are to be displayed and highlighted in the map view. Other operations
    defined in these OGC standards can also be accessed by users in their applications
    to interoperate with geospatial data deployed in CropScape. The standard GetCoverage
    operation in the OGC WCS specification supports CDL data retrieval only within
    a specified bounding box defined in a spatial reference system (SRS) that is defined
    by OGC’s Spatial Feature Access and its corner coordinates. For ad hoc analysis,
    the coverage in most cases is a political boundary such as a state, ASD, or county.
    These boundaries are usually not rectangular in shape and are not supported by
    the GetCoverage operation. Therefore, a new geoprocessing service named GetCDLFile
    is implemented in CropScape to fetch irregularly shaped CDL data utilizing Federal
    Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes of a state and county or ASD code.
    Its detailed implementation is discussed in Section 2.4.2.4. Similarly, several
    other geospatial processing services, GetCDLValue, GetCDLImage, GetCDLStat, ExtractCDLByValues,
    and GetCDLComp are developed to provide different special functionalities. These
    services provide common GIS functions which can be accessed in the browser client
    and called in other geospatial applications. The GetCDLValue service finds the
    pixel value at a given location, and the corresponding category along with the
    location and color will be displayed in a popup balloon window in the browser
    client of CropScape. The GetCDLStat service computes the statistical information
    (crop acreage) of the CDL data defined by the AOI based on pixel counting. The
    approximated crop acreage (not a NASS official estimate) is calculated from the
    pixel count and the pixel size. The GetCDLStat service sends the results in JSON
    for display in table, pie, and bar charts in the browser client of CropScape,
    or for export as a spreadsheet in CSV format. The ExtractCDLByValues service extracts
    values of the crops of interest from the CDL data within the AOI, composes a thematic
    map only with the crops of interest and exports it to an image file in GeoTiff
    format. The GetCDLImage service generates the preview images of the customized
    CDL data and the Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file with links to actual images
    that can be displayed in Google Earth. The GetCDLComp service performs cropland
    change analysis by comparing the pixels of the cropland area defined by AOI between
    two given years. The results of comparison are sent to the browser client in JSON,
    and shown in a table or thematic map. 2.3.3. Data layer The data layer includes
    raster, vector, and tabular data. The raster data includes all historical CDL
    layers, and a background map layer. The vector data includes different boundary
    layers, such as state, ASD, and county boundaries. The tabular data includes the
    USDA NASS county level acreage statistics from the 2007 Census of Agriculture.
    Historical state CDL data range from 1997 to 2010. The spatial resolution of the
    CDL data for crop years 2006–2009 is 56 m. For all other crop years, the resolution
    of CDL data is 30 m. From 2009, the spatial coverage of the CDL encompasses all
    48 conterminous states. The annual state CDL data are mosaiced into a single raster
    file, converted to ERDAS Imagine (.img) format, and built into tiled pyramid levels
    for better display performance. These data files are served by WMS to provide
    images for the CropScape client and other geospatial applications, and by WCS
    and WFS to retrieve CDL data within the AOI. The background map layer, Global
    Land Cover Data, produced by POSTEL Service Centre from the European Space Agency
    (ESA) is also served by WMS in CropScape. The vector data, such as the 2010 TIGER/Line
    Shapefiles for 48 contiguous states and their counties as well as the District
    of Columbia, and the ASD boundaries files are served by WMS to provide the images
    of these vector layers and to define the AOI for display. Other feature data such
    as tabular data of county level acreage information from the 2007 Census of Agriculture
    are served by WFS to query feature information in the browser client. 2.4. System
    functionalities implementation with Web services The application system functionalities
    were implemented by integrating and/or reusing existing Web services, including
    OGC web services and web geoprocessing services especially developed for CropScape
    in the SOA environment. As indicated in Section 2.3.2, the OGC Web services include
    WMS, WCS, and WFS while the specially developed web geoprocessing services comprise
    GetCDLFile, GetCDLValue, GetCDLImage, ExtractCDLByValues, GetCDLStat, and GetCDLComp.
    The user interface of each function was implemented in the CropScape application
    client, which is responsible for capturing and sending parameters and specifications,
    and requesting messages to the server to invoke the service, and receiving and
    displaying the feedback results from the server. The invoked service processes
    the geospatial data layer(s) on the server and sends back the processed results
    to the client that requested the services. All geospatial data layers are stored
    on the server. Some preprocessed data are stored in the cache directory on the
    server side for fast response. The data flow diagram Fig. 4 illustrates the geospatial
    data processing flow and the relationships of data layers, processing services
    and CropScape’s client or other geospatial applications. The next several sub-sections
    will provide implementation details for functional diagram blocks depicted in
    Fig. 4. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Data flow diagram. 2.4.1.
    Functionalities implemented with OGC Web services 2.4.1.1. CDL map service OGC
    Web geospatial data services like WCS, WFS, and WMS provide open access to CDL
    data and other geospatial data on the CropScape server without storing them locally.
    CDL data are served by the standard OGC WMS and WCS services using MapServer.
    Other geospatial applications like ArcGIS Explorer can access the CDL layers along
    with the associated legend from CropScape and add them as map layers by sending
    standard WMS requests to the CropScape application server. The detailed information
    on the selected county or other AOI can be obtained by sending a WMS GetFeatureInfo
    request to the server. An example of WMS GetMap request is illustrated in Table
    1. Similarly, CDL data can be discovered, described, and retrieved with the standard
    WCS request. Table 1 demonstrates a WCS GetCoverage request example that obtains
    the interested CDL data within the specified bounding box. The feature data such
    as state and county boundary layers are served using the WFS and WMS services.
    The client sends the WFS GetFeature request to the server to retrieve the feature
    data as shown in Table 1. Overall, these standard OGC Web services greatly facilitate
    CDL data discovery, access, retrieval, visualization, and dissemination, and promote
    its uses in various applications. Table 1. WMS, WFS, and WCS request examples.

    2.4.1.2. AOI definition Change analysis and statistics calculations for CDL data
    for a given AOI are extremely useful for many CDL data users. The AOI can be defined
    by specifying a state, ASD or county from the dropdown list, or by drawing a polygon,
    rectangle or circle on the map view. A WFS GetFeature request with the specified
    FIPS code or ASD code (as shown in Table 1) is then submitted to the server to
    retrieve the boundary of the specified AOI in GML format, and the retrieved GML
    string will be drawn and highlighted in the map view on the browser client. The
    coordinates of the user-defined AOI like rectangle, polygon, or circle are transferred
    to the server side and stored in a GML file for sub-setting and rasterizing. 2.4.2.
    Functionalities implemented with Web geoprocessing services Web geoprocessing
    services were specifically developed for CropScape as complements to the OGC Web
    services. These Web geoprocessing services, GetCDLFile, GetCDLValue, GetCDLImage,
    ExtractCDLByValues, GetCDLStat, and GetCDLComp, were specially developed to fulfill
    functionalities such as pixel level information query, CDL image data dissemination,
    selecting crops for extraction and mapping, crop acreage statistics calculation,
    and cropland change analysis. These open and standard Web services support HTTP
    GET and POST requests with Key–value Pair (KVP) and Simple Object Access Protocol
    (SOAP) binding. They can be discovered and described in Web Service Definition
    Language (WSDL), a XML based language, at http://nassgeodata.gmu.edu:8080/axis2/services/CDLService?wsdl.
    The following subsections describe the details of these Web geoprocessing services.
    2.4.2.1. Information query Interactive information query capabilities are provided
    to query the crop category and feature information in CropScape. This function
    help users find exactly what crops were grown and their geographic location in
    a selected crop year. The feature information, county name, state name, FIPS code,
    total crop acreage, and total irrigated crop acreage, can be retrieved via WMS
    GetFeatureInfo request as shown in Table 1. The crop type information such as
    category name, category value, and color can be extracted with a GetCDLValue request
    as shown in Table 2: Table 2. CDL Web services request examples. Service Parameters

    At the client side, query results are displayed in a popup balloon window when
    clicking a location of interest in the map view. As shown in Fig. 5, the table
    in the balloon window illustrates the county level agricultural census information
    of a total of 305,090 acres of cropland and 51,158 acres of irrigated cropland
    in Cuming County, Nebraska in 2007. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5.
    County information display. 2.4.2.2. Land cover acreage statistics Land cover
    acreage statistics provides estimated acreage for a defined AOI for a given year
    based on pixel counts and pixel size. To capture the geographic location of different
    crop types and generate the estimated crop acreage is an important decision support
    function. CDL data for a given year for a given AOI is first identified, and the
    acreage of land cover category within the AOI is then estimated by counting the
    pixels in each category and changing the pixel areas to acres using a conversion
    factor. The statistical information is returned in JSON format to the CropScape
    client for display in table, pie or bar chart formats, and for exporting to CSV
    format. The resultant table can be sorted by pixel value, category, pixel counts,
    or acreage. The bar and pie charts make the statistical data more visually informative
    and interesting. Through the ExtractCDLByValues service call, as shown in Table
    2, the selected crop type(s) from the table can be previewed and exported in GeoTiff
    format for future uses in other geospatial software. Fig. 6 shows a table of statistical
    results of Lee County, Iowa. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Statistical
    information of CDL within AOI. The GetCDLStat service is developed to provide
    service for Web requests from other applications. Requests with the crop year
    and FIPS code or bounding box coordinates (as shown in Table 2) are processed
    on the server side, and statistical information (for example, value, category
    name, and acreage) is returned in JSON, plain text or CSV format. 2.4.2.3. Change
    analysis The objective of GetCDLComp service is to analyze land cover changes
    by comparing CDL data in two different years. As shown in Table 2, the differences
    of the land cover (as characterized by CDL data) between two selected years can
    be obtained. For any given two years with different spatial resolutions, the defined
    CDL AOI with higher resolution is resampled using the nearest neighborhood interpolation
    method to the same resolution as the one with lower resolution. The comparison
    results including category change, pixel counts, and estimated acreage are returned
    in JSON format for display in the table. Similarly, the results can be exported
    into CSV format, and previewed in the image and exported as a GeoTiff. In addition,
    the selected change in the comparison results table can be previewed and exported.
    As seen in Fig. 7, the cropland changes from soybeans in 2008 to corn in 2009
    and their extent and distribution are captured. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Specified change preview (from soybeans to corn). 2.4.2.4. CDL data
    download and export CropScape offers different options for CDL data download to
    address the special needs of different users. Those who are interested in CDL
    data for all states can specify a specific crop year only and download the corresponding
    compressed file at the CropScape client, or download the compressed CDL data file
    directly by accessing the file link (e.g. http://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/nass_data_cache/tar/2010_cdls.tar.gz)
    via browser or ftp software. Those who want CDL data for a given AOI can specify
    the available crop years for an AOI, the preferred projection, and whether to
    compress the output file, and then submit their requests. The output CDL file
    can be previewed interactively, downloaded in GeoTiff format for analysis in other
    software or exported in a KML file. Google Earth will automatically be invoked
    if an open option is selected in the exporting process as shown in Fig. 8. Legends
    for crop categories are also injected into the KML file for interpreting crop
    type and spatial patterns of crops in Google Earth. The GetCDLImage service can
    be invoked in other applications to obtain the preview image or the KML file by
    sending the requests as seen in Table 2. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    8. Display in Google Earth. For those users who want to use CDL data in their
    applications or work flow directly, the GetCDLFile service is implemented in CropScape
    for requesting CDL data. HTTP GET requests with crop year and FIPS code or bounding
    box coordinates (as indicated in Table 2) are processed on the server side. When
    receiving the request with year and FIPS or ASD code, the GetCDLFile service submits
    a GetFeature request internally with this code filter to the WFS service. The
    GML file returned is kept in a specified directory on the server side. When handling
    requests with year and bounding box, the bounding box coordinates are also stored
    in a GML file. These GML files are to be used in the process of sub-setting and
    rasterizing CDL data for the given year. The URL of the output file will be returned
    for downloading and future use in XML. These CDL data dissemination options offered
    in CropScape greatly facilitate CDL data application in the agricultural community.
    3. Results The implemented CropScape was officially released on January 10, 2011.
    It provides a user-friendly web browser-based client side interface with effective
    online geospatial capabilities of CDL data access, navigation, query, visualization,
    analysis and dissemination. Moreover, its standard Web services extend the reach
    of CDL data and CropScape functional services. These web services and browser-based
    online capabilities have been widely utilized by many users in their geospatial
    applications, and provided fast and useful agricultural information for decision
    support. In the next two subsections, two CropScape applications are illustrated.
    3.1. CDL data mash-up via Web service Many CDL users have utilized CDL WMS services
    and KML files from CropScape to mash-up CDL data with their own online base maps
    or local geospatial data and integrate the Web services of CropScape with their
    own Web applications to create and share the customized maps, and exploit the
    valuable information. One such example application is the Bioenergy Knowledge
    Discovery Framework (KDF, https://bioenergykdf.net/) funded by US Department of
    Energy. KDF aims to build a collective knowledge system to visualize and analyze
    vast amounts of information and support the bioenergy industry. Shortly after
    CropScape launched, KDF started to utilize CropScape’s WMS services to serve CDL
    data. KDF has registered the CDL WMS service as one of land cover and cropland
    data sources in its data library. CDL data can be discovered, selected, and displayed
    as one important supporting dataset in the KDF online system. The layer of Renewable
    Fuels Association (RFA) Biorefinery Locations (Renewable Fuels Association, 2011)
    and 2010 Cropland Data Layer are added together in KDF to display the spatial
    distribution of biorefineries and crops in the Midwestern United States (Midwest).
    Most of these biorefineries are corn-based. The Midwest is the major corn growing
    region in the US, and provides a large and constant supply of corn biomass. CropScape
    provides the detailed spatial distributions of specific bioenergy crops along
    with their location across the US and can be leveraged for energy security decision
    support (e.g. biorefinery site selection). The standard Web services developed
    in CropScape extend the reach of CDL data. These services have been widely utilized
    by many users in their geospatial applications, and provided the fast and useful
    agricultural information for decision support. 3.2. CDL data application via CropScape
    A practical CropScape application example used CDL data within CropScape for the
    2011 Mississippi River flood disaster assessments. In early May 2011, the US Army
    Corps of Engineers proposed to explode a large section of a Mississippi River
    levee near the town of Wyatt, Missouri, the so called the Bird’s Point-New Madrid
    floodway in order to reduce the threat of major flooding from the swollen Mississippi
    and Ohio Rivers in nearby Cairo, Illinois. The blasts would likely unleash a muddy
    torrent of water into farmland and around evacuated homes in Mississippi County,
    Missouri. However, the loss caused by farmland and homes inundated was one of
    the most critical decision support factors whether or not to support such a proposal.
    Therefore, the acres of prime Missouri farmland that might be flooded and the
    number of homes that would be destroyed had to be predicted to properly estimate
    the potential loss. Missouri Congresswoman Joann Emerson also requested the Food
    and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, University of Missouri, to provide
    an after-the-fact assessment of the potential crop loss value from the Bird’s
    Point Levee breach on May 2, 2011 (Brown et al., 2011). This information proved
    critical for further disaster relief decision making and operational efforts.
    In the assessment, NASS data and tools, most prominently CropScape and CDL data
    were utilized. Both analysts at the NASS Missouri Field Office and researchers
    at the University of Missouri used CropScape to assess the cropland loss caused
    by flood inundation. As shown in Fig. 9, the 2010 CDL was selected for assessment
    and the AOI polygon function was used to define the predicted to be (or already)
    inundated cropland area as the area of interest in Missouri’s Mississippi County.
    Fig. 10 illustrates the actual May 2011 flood in Mississippi County, Missouri.
    Fig. 10(a) shows the May 7, 2010 Landsat image which depicts no flooding while
    Fig. 10(b) May 10, 2011 image illustrates flood inundation in Mississippi County
    after the levee was breached. As shown in Fig. 10, the inundated area after levee
    breach is consistent, in most locations, with the predicted area as shown in Fig.

    With the area of interest defined, the statistics function was then invoked to
    estimate acreages of all crops grown in the inundated area of interest in 2010
    based on pixel counting. The estimated crop acreage results were summarized as
    shown in Fig. 9. The value of the previous year’s crops that were in the inundated
    area could be estimated by applying the 2010 season average prices to the AOI-defined
    inundated area. In this assessment, it was assumed that all soybean and corn fields
    were completely rotated, that is to say, every acre of corn was planted to soybeans
    and every acre of soybeans was planted to corn. The projected current year crop
    acreage could then be deduced from last year’s results with this assumption. The
    number of acres that had already been planted and the number of acres that would
    not be planted could be estimated by using the current year Crop Progress and
    Condition survey data. Assuming 2011 season average crop prices remain at the
    same level as 2010, the value of crops in the inundated area defined by the AOI
    could ultimately be determined. The estimated loss of crop value provided a solid
    foundation for flood disaster mitigation and decision support analysis. This case
    study manifests that CropScape is an effective decision support tool that can
    help decision makers efficiently access, retrieve, and analyze critical crop acreage
    information and make knowledgeable science-based decisions. 4. Discussion CropScape
    has provided considerable public service to the US agricultural and scientific
    communities since its official release on January 10, 2011. By May 10, 2011, over
    seventeen thousand users have visited the website from federal, state, and local
    governments, companies, academic institutions, and non-profit organizations in
    just five months. Over 200 GB of CDL data was downloaded in multiple ways by users
    each month. CropScape delivers, for the first time, online geospatial CDL data
    access, navigation, query, visualization, and analysis using interactive maps
    in the public domain. Moreover, this application offers various Web services for
    users to discover, access, invoke, integrate, and execute remotely. The standards-based
    geospatial Web services enable automated delivery of custom CDL products to our
    customers. Users can reuse, integrate, and execute CropScape Web services with
    distributed geospatial web services from different sources. The capability of
    exporting CDL data directly to popular Google Earth enriches spectrum of users’
    geospatial toolboxes. CropScape not only greatly saves the expense of printing
    and shipping media and facilitates low carbon geospatial cropland information
    delivery for decision support, but also significantly improves the efficiency
    and effectiveness for agricultural related decision support. CropScape’s capability
    of generating standard State and county cropland maps and exporting maps to pdf
    files great reduces NASS staff’s burden of map production and help NASS transition
    into an electronic-map era. CropScape’s various data visualization and geospatial
    data query tools provide users with easy, capable, and useful online functionality
    for data visualization and geospatial query without special geospatial software
    installation nor any geospatial information system skills and experience required.
    The overall performance of CropScape is fine-tuned though it is primarily dependent
    on the internet speed and traffic. CropScape’s performance can be further improved
    by moving it to a more powerful server cluster or moving it to Cloud computing
    platform. In the future, more CropScape capability enhancements are needed to
    meet different customers’ requirements. The capabilities of adding customer’s
    data layer(s) at the client side, measuring length and area, adding map notes
    with multiple shapes and information inputting, supporting WMS layers from other
    providers, and controlling data layer display order will be developed in CropScape
    to enrich its functions and provide better decision support to users. 5. Conclusions
    This paper presents an overview of the architecture and design of CropScape, a
    service-oriented Web application providing geospatial data and analytic services
    to users. The CropScape application proves that state-of-the-art geospatial information
    technologies are effective and efficient in enhancing open access to, visualization
    of, online analysis of, and dissemination of agricultural geospatial information.
    The OGC standards compliant design makes CropScape open and interoperable with
    third party applications, thereby increases utility of the CDL data and interactivity
    with outside applications. The CropScape application case studies demonstrate
    that the CropScape Web application system facilitates greater utilization of agricultural
    geospatial information for agricultural business and emergency response decision
    support. The performance of CropScape is acceptable even though the huge volume
    of raster format CDL data and boundary data layers are served over internet. Acknowledgements

    AgroDSS was developed. • Users can upload own data and process it using the online
    data mining tools. • AgroDSS provides predictive modeling, explanation and time
    series analysis. • Case study of pest population dynamics illustrates the potential
    for the use. Abstract Decision support systems, data analysis and data mining
    have become significant tools for improving business in professional world. The
    emerging technologies are making the precision agriculture omnipresent and allow
    potential for enriching it with computer-assisted decision support systems for
    farm management. In this paper we describe a novel system AgroDSS that bridges
    the gap between agricultural systems and state-of-the-art decision support methodology.
    The described system is intended for integration into the existing farm management
    information systems and provides a cloud-based decision support toolbox, allowing
    farmers to upload their own data, utilize several data analysis methods and retrieve
    their outputs. The implemented tools include predictive modeling with explanation,
    accuracy evaluation, time series clustering and decomposition, and structural
    change detection. They can help users make predictions for simulated scenarios
    and better understand the dependencies (interactions) within their domain. We
    apply the AgroDSS system on a case study of pest population dynamics, illustrating
    the potential for its use. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords
    Decision support systemAgricultureFarming 2000 MSC 68U3568T05 1. Introduction
    In mid 1990s, Heuvel (1996) wrote about precision agriculture – the big information
    upgrade in agriculture that was yet to arise. In his work he emphasized that the
    emerging technologies are driving the development of agriculture, which will be
    able to evolve to a more efficient level in terms of agricultural production and
    land stewardship. It seems that today we are in the era of making precision agriculture
    omnipresent, whilst trying to enrich it with computer-assisted Decision Support
    Systems (DSS) for entire farm management (with the goal of optimizing returns
    on inputs while preserving resources). The majority of marketed state-of-the-art
    software products for agriculture utilize various sensors to collect data, in
    contrast to history that involved manual data input (Kaloxylos et al., 2012, Sørensen
    et al., 2010). Although this results in large amounts of stored data, data is
    most frequently analyzed only with basic statistical or visualization methods.
    The latter neglects the potential for application of advanced data analysis tools
    that stem from the fields of data mining. The reason for this mostly lies in the
    fact that the development and deployment of advanced data mining methods demand
    cutting-edge knowledge and skills in understanding these methods. In this paper
    we describe a novel system AgroDSS that bridges the gap between agricultural systems
    and state-of-the-art decision support methodology. The described system is intended
    to provide computer decision support to farmers in an approachable manner. The
    system is designed as a decision support toolbox, where farmers can upload their
    own data of interest, utilize several offered artificial intelligence (data mining
    and statistical) tools and retrieve their outputs. The output results are intended
    to provide users with automated decision support, predictions for simulated scenarios,
    better understanding of the submitted data and explanation of the dependencies
    (interactions) within the data. As motivated by related work (Fountas et al.,
    2015a, Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Sørensen et al., 2011), AgroDSS is implemented
    as a cloud-based service, which enables various software products for agriculture
    to facilitate decision support to users. As many other existing decision support
    systems, we aim AgroDSS to be a tool that can improve business value through savings,
    avoiding risks, better planning and taking better advantage of resources. As AgroDSS
    can be used with different problem domains, business benefits depend on each individual
    business case; we conclude the paper by summarizing such a case study. The paper
    is structured as follows. In Section 2 we provide a historical overview of how
    the computers and decision support systems have been used in agriculture and farming.
    In Section 3 we describe the design, functionalities and the implementation of
    the novel AgroDSS system. We proceed in Section 4 by providing a brief case study
    of pest analysis in orchards and fields, which serves as a demonstrative proof
    of concept. We conclude the paper in Section 5. 2. Related work Before the advent
    of precision agriculture, only a few works about use of information technologies
    in farming or agriculture were published. Through the time, use of decision support
    systems, data analysis, and data mining have become more significant tools for
    improving business in professional world. One of the earliest systems that provided
    computer-assisted decision support was CropSyst (Stöckle et al., 2003). Its development
    started in early 1990s and evolved into a suite of programs that include a cropping
    simulator, a weather generator, GIS (Geographic Information System) cooperator
    program, a watershed model, and several miscellaneous utility programs. According
    to the website1, the developed model simulates the soil water budget, soil-plant
    nitrogen budget, crop canopy and root growth, dry matter production, yield, residue
    production and decomposition, and erosion, using several parameters, such as cultivar
    selection, crop rotation, irrigation, nitrogen fertilization, tillage operations,
    and residue management. An important advantage of the contemporary systems is
    availability in a cloud (Ampatzidis et al., 2016, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), which
    can ensure greater availability of the systems to users and applications. Crop
    simulations and predictions. Many such systems for simulating crops through a
    myriad of tweakable variables were developed and evaluated with different crops
    and climate conditions. In more recent publications, Abedinpour et al. (2012)
    performed an evaluation of AquaCrop model for maize crop in a semi-arid environment.
    This model attempts to balance accuracy, simplicity and robustness by using a
    relatively small number of explicit and mostly intuitive parameters and input
    variables. These simulators can be successfully combined with other models; for
    example, García-Vila and Fereres (2012) combined AquaCrop with an economic model
    for the optimization of irrigation management at farm level. Irrigation management
    had become very important so dedicated models have spurred. Bazzani (2005) developed
    a Decision Support System for Irrigation for short and long term analyses of water,
    labor and machinery, considering different types of soils, irrigation systems,
    water-yield functions and seasonality trough multicriterial mathematical programming
    techniques; Paredes et al. (2014) examined partitioning evapotranspiration, yield
    prediction and economic returns of maize under various irrigation management strategies.
    Today, soil moisture is analyzed with inferential frameworks that combine data
    to infer moisture, precipitation, temperature and canopy coverage variation (Ghosh
    et al., 2014). Giusti and Marsili-Libelli (2015) proposed a fuzzy decision support
    system, intended to improve the irrigation based on given crop and site characteristics.
    It comprises an inference system that outputs the best irrigation action to keep
    the soil moisture in the suitable bounds, resulting in significant water savings.
    In theory, the proposed models could be used with arbitrary crops, though in practice,
    many specific simulators for specific crops have been developed. For example,
    Mohanty et al. (2012) parameterized the APSIM model (Keating et al., 2003) for
    soybean and wheat crop of subtropical central India; Sepaskhah et al. (2013) developed
    a dynamic yield and growth model for saffron under different irrigation regimes;
    Dreassi et al. (2014) dealt with semicontinuous skewed spatial data of grape wine
    production; Sun and Ren (2014) assessed crop yield and optimize water scheduling
    for winter wheat and summer maize using soil and water assessment tool. In order
    to cope with the vast variability of nature and the uncertainties of agricultural
    production, the concept of crop biometrics was defined as the scientific analysis
    of agricultural observations confined to spaces of reduced dimensions and known
    position with the purpose of building prediction models (Rovira-Más and Sáiz-Rubio,
    2013). Dairy farms. Allore et al. (1995) made a data-driven decision support system
    MAST to systematically summarize the data related to mastitis; Kerr et al. (1999)
    developed a knowledge-based decision support system for strategic planning on
    sub-tropical dairy farms. More recently, Bryant et al. (2010) evaluated Farmax
    Dairy Pro that can predict annual yields (per cow and per hectare) for milk, fat,
    protein and milk solids. Baudracco et al. (2012) proposed e-Cow that predicts
    herbage intake, milk yield and live weight change in dairy cows grazing temperate
    pastures with and without supplementary feeding. Other examples of DSS for farming.
    Perini and Susi (2004) focused on design issues faced during the development of
    a DSS to be used by technicians of the advisory service performing pest management
    according to an integrated production approach. Abdullah and Hussain (2006) put
    decades worth of pest scouting recordings, agriculture and metrological data into
    a novel Pilot Agriculture Extension Data Warehouse and present some interesting
    findings through data mining using an indigenous technique based on the crossing
    minimization paradigm. Xu et al. (2008) proposed a systematic approach based on
    integrated information systems for agricultural ecosystem management that extracts
    and integrates data about terrain, land use and planting. Sustainable agriculture
    was discussed by Kurlavičius (2009), where they proposed a DSS that predicts what
    kind of crops should be grown in particular areas, what/how many animals should
    be kept and what/how much of resources are required under the environmental and
    other conditions. Antonopoulou et al. (2010) proposed a Web-based Decision Support
    System to help farmers select the alternative crops and provide the information
    about the cultivation period. Cloud-based decision support services. Kaloxylos
    et al. (2012) surveyed the key functionalities of Farm Management Information
    Systems (FMIS) and possibilities for their future improvement. They emphasized
    that farmers need the global market of services in the cloud, which can collect
    joint intelligence that can be used to extend their FMIS. Furthermore, the authors
    predict that the solutions/tools for intelligence might in the future be located
    solely in the cloud, which requires the intelligence to be distributed between
    the cloud and farms to compensate for lack of a stable Internet link in fields
    and rural areas. In their further work, Kaloxylos et al. (2014) presented a conceptual
    implementation of a cloud-based FMIS for managing a greenhouse. Farmers who evaluated
    the FMIS characterized the use of services in the cloud as valuable due to possibility
    of selecting and changing a service provider, availability of decision support
    services, and open and standardized interfaces of the cloud FMIS that can enable
    cooperation among stakeholders. Fountas et al. (2015a) have explored future perspectives
    of FMIS and advocate that cloud computing will be one of the key drivers in their
    future development. Nikkilä et al. (2010) and Tayyebi et al. (2016) argue that
    FMIS for precision agriculture needs access to various systems and propose a concept
    of multi-tier architecture where any application can access FMIS data through
    web services exposed by FMIS. Sørensen et al. (2011) explore the concept of external
    assisting services, such as ones that can be implemented in a cloud, to facilitate
    standardized data exchange formats, data semantics, and transformation of data
    into useful knowledge for decision making. Tan (2016) brought to attention that
    the further development of precision agriculture requires advanced tools to process
    data and transform them to practical decision actions. He developed a cloud-based
    decision support system, which allows easier extensibility, integration of data
    from various sources (in different formats and semantics) and centralized control
    of field devices. 2.1. Decision support systems methods and approaches In the
    related work, several different decision support models and approaches, which
    are based on data mining, have been used. In the following we summarize their
    most common occurrences in the literature: • Probabilistic and optimization models:
    For sow herding, Pla et al. (2004) developed a decision support system based on
    an embedded Markov model, while Pomar and Pomar (2005) developed a system in Milord
    II for efficient early identification of sows having low prolificacy performance
    in commercial pig farms. Scott et al. (2015) proposed a method for selecting appropriate
    suppliers that considers stakeholder requirements. They integrated their basic
    method, called Analytic Hierarchy Process–Quality Function Deployment (AHP–QFD),
    with constrained programming and validated it within the bioenergy industry. Thomopoulos
    et al. (2015) proposed an argumentation-based decision support system for agri-food
    chains that aims to optimize the nutritional, sensorial, practical and hygienic
    value of the food quality. Their system incorporates backward logical reasoning,
    starting from the goal, utilizing knowledge elicitation from domain experts or
    scientific papers. Although the authors conclude that the task of knowledge modeling
    cannot be automated, they emphasize the importance of argumentation and modeling
    in decision support systems. • Supervised learning models: It is worth mentioning
    that the well-known data mining software WEKA (Witten et al., 2016) started as
    a project, funded from 1993 by the New Zealand government, aimed to create a data
    mining workbench for contributing also to the agricultural industries (Hall et
    al., 2009). WEKA today features an abundance of supervised learning algorithms,
    used by a wide research community. For example, Ramesh and Ramar (2011) used WEKA
    to be the first to evaluate data mining techniques for Tamil Nadu (state of India)
    soil data sets. They compared the performance of the decision trees, naive Bayes
    classifier and random forests and achieved 100% classification accuracy with the
    latter two. Today, many other implementation of classification and regression
    algorithms have been applied in various application areas; we provide some typical
    examples below. Cortez et al. (2009) used the support vector machines (SVM) to
    outperform neural networks and multiple regression for predicting the human wine
    preferences (quality of wine) from objective physicochemical analytical tests.
    Their model revealed, which variables can be controlled during the production,
    providing a direct insight into ways for improving wine quality. Rumpf et al.
    (2010) tackled the problem for an early detection of sugar beet diseases using
    the SVM. They achieved the classification accuracy of up to 97% for differentiation
    of healthy vs. diseased leaves and classification accuracy between 65% and 90%
    (depending on the type and stage of the disease) for early detection of diseases.
    Pradhan (2013) compared the prediction performance of decision trees (DT), support
    vector machine and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for landslide
    susceptibility problem in Malaysia using aerial photographs. They built several
    models from different input attribute sets and achieved good predictive performance,
    especially with DT and ANFIS. Irmak et al. (2006) applied the back-propagation
    neural network to predict the spatial distribution of soybean yields and to understand
    the causes of yield variability. The goal of Panda et al. (2010) was to investigate
    the strength of key spectral vegetation indices for corn crop yield prediction
    using neural network techniques. They showed that the corn yield was best predicted
    (with accuracy of 83.50–96.04%) using models that used the means and standard
    deviations of perpendicular vegetation index grid images. Karimi et al. (2006)
    compared the performance of support vector machine with artificial neural networks
    (ANN) for classification of hyperspectral images of corn fields in order to predict
    nitrogen application and weed infestation rates. They achieved favorable results,
    showing lower misclassification rates of SVM for that task than those of ANN.
    In the last decade, the advantages of the random forest classifier have been emphasized,
    including its non-parametric nature, high predictive ability, internal evaluation
    of attributes, robustness to noise, and lack of proneness to overfitting. Several
    researches have shown its high predictive value: Oliveira et al. (2012) compared
    it with the multiple regression on a fire occurrence in Mediterranean Europe domain;
    Rodriguez-Galiano et al. (2012) evaluated its use for land cover classification;
    Tatsumi et al. (2015) used it for crop classification of homogeneous landscapes.
    • Bayesian models: Wang et al. (2012) developed a Bayesian hierarchical model
    that naturally combines information from multiple monthly surveys measured on
    different temporal supports, including field measurement surveys and two farmer
    interview surveys. Their results indicate that the hierarchical model produces
    superior forecasts to both the panel of experts and the composite estimator of
    the mean of a normal distribution, while providing an accurate measure of uncertainty.
    • Other classification models: The paper of Waheed et al. (2006) investigates
    the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing data for providing better crop management
    information for use in precision farming. In the study, the ability of the classification
    and regression trees (CART) decision tree algorithm were examined to classify
    hyperspectral data of experimental corn plots into categories of water stress,
    presence of weeds and nitrogen application rates. Li et al. (2012) were modeling
    maize irrigation with WOFOST simulator, they performed an additional analysis
    of uncertainty that revealed new insight into the risks associated with individual
    decisions. Du et al. (2013) presented a new algorithm for forecasting demand for
    perishable farm products, based on the support vector machine. To fit a Gamma
    model, to get small area estimates and to evaluate their precision, Dreassi et
    al. (2014) used a hierarchical Bayesian approach in their Small area estimation
    for semicontinuous skewed spatial data (an application to the grape wine production
    in Tuscany). • Time series analysis: Michel and Makowski (2013) compared the performance
    of seven basic statistical models and the dynamic linear model, for analyzing
    yield time series and prediction of yield trends. They visualized yield increase
    rates obtained with a dynamic linear model for wheat from 1960 to 2010. • Genetic
    programming: Alhadidi et al. (2012) proposed and evaluated a mathematical model
    that describes the reported data on crop pests to get an accurate prediction of
    production costs, food safety, and the protection of the environment. Their proposed
    approach is based on genetic programming and is explicitly directed at solving
    the symbolic regression of crop pest forecasting. Forecasting agricultural output
    with an improved grey forecasting model based on the genetic algorithm was performed
    by Ou (2012). Rose et al. (2016) surveyed the available decision support tools
    in the UK and discovered that 49% of farmers used some kind of decision support
    tool to inform decisions. They determined that effectiveness of decision support
    is influenced by fifteen following characteristics: performance, ease of use,
    peer recommendation (encouragement of knowledge exchange), trust, cost, matching
    to farmers’ existing habits, relevance, targeting of advisers, user age compatibility,
    scale of business, farming type, IT education, infrastructure (internet, devices,
    workflows), compliance with market and legislation, and level of marketing. Based
    on the surveyed work we conclude that decision support systems have been extensively
    studied for various aspects of agriculture and farming. The related work shows
    an increasing demand for (1) predictive modeling, (2) data understanding and (3)
    statistical data analysis, which motivates us to propose a system that can provide
    a simplified utilization of such algorithms. In regard to positive characteristics
    of random forests (Oliveira et al., 2012, Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012, Tatsumi
    et al., 2015), which include the model’s non-parametric nature, high predictive
    ability, internal evaluation of attributes, robustness to noise, and avoidance
    of overfitting, we decide to implement it as a predictive model within AgroDSS.
    We intend to address at least six factors of effectiveness, given by (Rose et
    al., 2016) (performance, ease of use, matching to farmers’ existing habits, relevance,
    farming type) that can be easily addressed technologically and by offering non-domain-specific
    data mining algorithms. We present the chosen data mining algorithms and the proposed
    system in the following sections. 3. Decision support system AgroDSS In the recent
    years, farm management information systems (FMIS) have evolved from simple farm
    recordkeeping into sophisticated and complex systems to support all aspects of
    production management (Fountas et al., 2015b). The purpose of modern FMIS is to
    manage demands to reduce production costs, comply with agricultural standards,
    and maintain high product quality and safety by ensuring access to timely information,
    elaborate estimation, simulation and decision making tools. Decision support system
    that integrates all of the above is therefore a crucial step in both day-to-day
    and strategic decision making. In this paper we describe a novel decision support
    system for agriculture and farming, called AgroDSS. The decision support aspect
    of the proposed system is based on data mining approaches, which can extract useful
    information from large volumes of data. Data mining uses advanced algorithms to
    analyze the data and identify trends, distributions and find patterns that can
    be hard to see with the naked eye. The newly acquired knowledge can help better
    understand the data, see how data changes in time and help predict the future
    impact of different actions. The modular architecture of AgroDSS allows easy (generic)
    integration of API services into existing FMIS, and also exposes a simplified
    Web user interface (UI) to the end-user (farmer). While the integration with web
    services is intended as a primary use of AgroDSS, the Web UI only represents an
    additional demonstration/evaluation tool. The main production use of the AgroDSS
    will therefore originate from within FMIS, where data is to be prepared and submitted
    for evaluation, and results presented without unnecessary user interaction. The
    intermediate purpose of the AgroDSS will be to model the data and evaluate the
    produced models. Although AgroDSS utilizes data mining algorithms, it is designed
    in a way that is approachable also to non-experts in the field. While integration
    of API services into existing FMIS requires a programmer’s knowledge (only during
    the integration), the farmers are the primary users that should provide the domain
    knowledge prior to the integration, i.e., define what the problem for the analysis
    is (e.g., prediction of a certain phenomenon, what is a target prediction variable,
    change detection, seasonality analysis etc.). After the integration, the use should
    become routine, allowing farmers to run and understand the analyses with no difficulty.
    We approached planning, design and implementation of the AgroDSS system by considering
    the well-known Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) (Chapman
    et al., 2000, Shearer, 2000), illustrated in Fig. 1. This standard encompasses
    good practices for applying data mining techniques and defines the phases of data
    mining process: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation,
    modeling, evaluation and deployment. The CRISP-DM process model therefore breaks
    down the life cycle of a data mining project into the six phases, which all include
    a variety of tasks. The relation of CRISP-DM phases to the AgroDSS workflow steps
    is depicted in Fig. 2. The workflow steps (step 1 – dataset creation, optional
    step 2 – dataset update, step 3 – quick data analysis, step 4 – training a predictive
    model, step 5 – model evaluation, and step 6 – predictive analysis) typically
    comprise one or more CRISP-DM phases. CRISP-DM phases are related to AgroDSS workflow
    steps (Fig. 2) as follows: 1. Business (problem) understanding: focuses on understanding
    the project objectives from business (user’s) perspective and transforming it
    into a data mining problem (domain) definition. At the end of the phase the project
    plan is produced. In AgroDSS, this phase is a precondition for step 1 (users –
    farmers – should know what their farming problem is). 2. Data understanding: starts
    with an initial raw data collection and proceeds with activities such as getting
    familiar with data, discovering first insights into the data and identifying possible
    data quality problems. In AgroDSS, this phase is a precondition for step 1. In
    order to utilize the AgroDSS Web user interface, the user (farmer) should possess
    a reasonable amount of domain and technical knowledge. He should be able to define
    the decision problem (e.g., how to improve cattle feeding in order to increase
    milk production), identify relevant collected data (e.g., feed composition, daily
    milk production), format and upload the data, and review the results. However,
    in a real-life situation the AgroDSS services will be integrated into a FMIS that
    will handle the problem definition (if not pre-defined) and all the data handling
    process. 3. Data preparation: covers all activities to construct the final data
    set from the initial raw data including selection of data, data cleaning, the
    construction of data, the integration of data and the data formatting. In AgroDSS,
    this phase corresponds to steps 1, 2 and 3 (creation of a dataset and partial
    uploads of data, as well as basic data analysis – descriptive statistics). While
    the data preparation step is mandatory and time-consuming for the demonstrational
    AgroDSS Web interface users, this will be different in practice – the data will
    be collected and preprocessed in FMIS, and after selecting the required analysis,
    the data preparation phase will commence automatically, followed by communication
    using the AgroDSS API services. 4. Modeling: covers the creation of various data
    mining models. The phase starts with the selection of data mining methods, proceeds
    with the creation (training) of data mining models and finishes with the assessment
    of the models. Some data mining methods have specific requirements on the form
    of data and the step back to data preparation phase is often necessary. In AgroDSS,
    this phase corresponds to step 4 (depending of the problem type, users can select
    appropriate data mining methods). 5. Evaluation: evaluates the data mining models
    created in the modeling phase. The aim of the model evaluation is to confirm that
    the models are of high enough quality to achieve the business objectives. In AgroDSS,
    this phase corresponds to step 5 (depending of the problem type, users can visualize
    evaluation reports for their datasets). 6. Deployment: comprises of activities
    to organize knowledge gained through data mining models and present it in a way
    users can use it within their decision making workflow. In AgroDSS, this phase
    corresponds to step 6. The selected trained model is stored for future re-use,
    and can be retrieved and utilized at any time. The storing of the model is performed
    by serializing an R model object (R Core Team, 2014), which is returned after
    the model’s generation, and saving it as a string into the database. Download

    AgroDSS System. The boldface text denotes the CRISP-DM steps and text in the rounded
    rectangles denotes the AgroDSS workflow steps. The latter are: dataset creation
    (step 1), update (optional step 2), quick data analysis (step 3), training a predictive
    model (step 4), model evaluation (step 5) and predictive analysis (step 6). Steps
    within the workflow relate to corresponding phases of the CRISP-DM model. We designed
    the AgroDSS system with the following main goals: • We aimed to implement a flexible
    and easy-to-use system that can be also used by non-experts from the data mining
    field. • The data mining tools should work with data from various domains; the
    system should therefore allow users to upload and process their own data. Minimal
    requirements about the data format (tabular form) should be defined. • The implemented
    collection of data mining tools should be general enough to be used with various
    problem domains. It should cover analyses from diverse subfields of data mining,
    such as supervised learning (predictive modeling), unsupervised learning (clustering),
    and time series analysis. • Users should receive numeric or visual feedback with
    the results of their queries. • The system should be online and easily accessible
    to users. • The system’s tools should be accessible by other information systems
    through an application programming interface (API). The final architecture of
    the AgroDSS system is illustrated in Fig. 2. In step 1, the data for the analysis
    needs to be uploaded (in CSV format, target/dependent variable in the first column)
    to be made available for the data mining algorithms. To do this, the users create
    and name a new dataset. At any later time, data can be optionally appended to
    existing uploaded datasets (step 2), which is useful if we are dealing with periodic
    data collections (e.g. daily measurements). Afterwards, users can either run any
    of the quick data analyses (step 3; clustering, structural analysis and sequence
    decomposition) or train a predictive model (step 4) that is required for making
    predictions. Users can either evaluate the accuracy of the predictive model on
    training or on independent test data (step 5) or use model to make predictions
    (step 6) for new, yet unseen data or for the simulated scenarios. 3.1. Decision
    support functionalities Following the goals, described in the previous section,
    we implemented the following data mining function within the AgroDSS system: 1.
    Data upload and preprocessing. The function provides the farmers to upload their
    data, which subsequently becomes stored on the server. The uploaded data is required
    to be in tabular form, where the rows represent individual observations (examples)
    and columns represent attributes (different descriptives of the current example).
    Since the input data may contain missing values and many data mining algorithms
    require a full data table, the preprocessing options allow automatic imputation
    of missing values. For imputation, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (with k = 10)
    was used, which utilizes the most similar examples to deduce and fill-in the missing
    values. 2. Predictive modeling with explanation. (a) Predictive modeling function
    builds a data mining model from a given dataset (training dataset) that was uploaded
    to the server. The resulting data model can be afterwards used to make predictions
    for examples in another dataset from the same problem domain (testing dataset).
    To model the data, random forest prediction model was used. Along with modeling
    the training set, the model performance is also estimated using the out-of-bag
    (OOB) error that is assessed internally as the random forest is being constructed.
    Each tree in the random forest is namely trained using a different bootstrap sample
    (leaving out about one third of the examples) and its performance is unbiasedly
    estimated on the left-out examples. The system automatically selects the appropriate
    performance measure, depending on the type of the target variable – classification
    accuracy for classification problems (discrete target variable) and the mean squared
    error for regression problems (continuous target variable). Additionally, the
    random forest model also outputs the importance of individual attributes (estimated
    by the accuracy decrease given different attribute permutations and by the Gini
    index decrease after a node split over all trees) for predicting the outcome,
    which can be useful for post hoc feature selection performed by the user in FMIS.
    (b) Prediction computation function for computing predictions for testing dataset
    or new examples. (c) Explanation of the learned knowledge in the model that computes
    contributions of examples’ attribute values and returns its visual representation.
    The computed contributions represent the explanation of the learned knowledge
    within the prediction model (Štrumbelj et al., 2009, Štrumbelj and Kononenko,
    2010). The absolute size of a contribution value is an indicator of the attribute’s
    influence on the final decision, while its sign signifies whether the particular
    attribute value influenced the class probability in a positive way (by raising
    the predicted probability of the class) or negative way (by lowering the predicted
    probability of the class). As such, they explain the importance of different attributes
    and may reveal new knowledge about the problem domain. (d) Predictive accuracy
    analysis plot that shows the dependency of the predictive error on the number
    of trees, returned from the random forest prediction model. 3. Time series analysis:
    (a) Time series clustering that is intended for discovering similarities within
    a dataset and represent them in separate data groups. To implement this function
    we used the Permutation Distribution Clustering method (Brandmaier, 2015) that
    is tailored to clustering time series. The clustering method finds similar time
    series by observing differences between data permutation distributions. The method
    is robust and suitable for time series with changing distributions (i.e. containing
    concept drift) and with changing lengths. (b) Time series decomposition function
    decomposes a time series into seasonal, trend and irregular components using moving
    averages. The function is intended for detection of periodic as well as extraordinary
    events in the time stream. The decomposition was peformed using function decompose
    within statistical package R (R Core Team, 2014). (c) Structural change detection
    that is intended to detect abrupt changes in dynamics of time series. Such function
    can be beneficial in case of population or parameter modeling, where alarms need
    to be raised in case of big data changes. For implementation of this function
    we utilized the strucchange library (Zeileis et al., 2003) in statistical package
    R (R Core Team, 2014). 3.2. System architecture We implemented the data mining
    infrastructure using the WildFly Application Server2, custom R server and PostgreSQL
    DB Server as a data persistence layer. The system architecture (shown in Fig.
    3) allows use of the data mining services via a REST API. The core of data processing
    and computation is implemented in R – a statistical software package suited for
    data mining tasks (R Core Team, 2014). For the purposes of development and service
    exploration we have also implemented an HTML web interface. We used the following
    R libraries: • RCurl: for connecting to external data sources, • RPostgreSQL:
    for connecting to the PostgreSQL database, • jsonlite: support for JSON data format,
    • cluster: for data clustering, • strucchange: for finding structural changes
    in time series, • pdc: for clustering time series data, • randomForest: for classification
    and regression using random forests. Download : Download high-res image (123KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Architecture of the implemented AgroDSS
    system. The database provides storage for users’ data, requested tasks, and their
    results. Task execution is performed asynchronously, guided with task queuing
    and facilitated using the Wildfly application server (EJB Message Driven Beans).
    When user requests a data analysis, only meta-data (name of the dataset, analysis
    type and other parameters) are retrieved from the database and sent to the R data
    mining server. The R server afterwards requests the actual dataset contents and
    runs the analysis. The results are saved into the database and are available to
    be presented to the user, who can retrieve them using a task’s unique ID. The
    database also stores data from autonomous weather stations (in real time), provided
    by one of the AgroIT project partners (see Section 4), and sample test benchmark
    datasets. The weather data can be used to augment other data, if spatially proximate
    weather data is available. The available test datasets include: iris (prediction
    of the Iris flower species, Anderson (1935)), beavers (body temperature series
    of two beavers, Reynolds (1994)) and chickwts (chicken weights by feed type, McNeil
    (1977)). The REST API includes an option to adjust the randomForest modeling to
    specific use cases by providing alternative settings for default values of parameters:
    ntree (the number of trees to grow), mtry (number of randomly sampled variables
    at each split), and maxnodes (maximum number of terminal nodes). The services,
    implemented as Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), can be used through REST API3. Its
    main request/response interface is described in Table 1, and the user interface
    of the developed system is shown in Fig. 4. Table 1. Interface of the implemented

    an example of generated data explanation (top), model performance (middle) and
    test data output (below). 4. Case study: Population dynamics of the pests in orchards
    and fields After the development of the system, a small case study was performed
    on data that were obtained from one of the partners (EFOS d.o.o., Slovenia) that
    collaborated within the EU-funded project AgroIT. The goals of the AgroIT project
    were to implement a cloud platform for integration of existing applications for
    farming, and to facilitate the pilot use of those applications. As a part of the
    AgroIT, four pilot projects were initiated in four EU countries, including the
    TrapView4 platform that was implemented by EFOS. TrapView enables pest monitoring
    in vineyards and orchards through pest traps. Pests are lured into pest traps,
    where their photos are taken with a certain frequency and transmitted to TrapView
    servers over mobile network for analysis and pest recognition. Our case study
    was performed on pests data, collected by TrapView. The objective of the case
    study was to briefly demonstrate AgroDSS functionalities, illustrate the system’s
    use, and provide examples of the obtained results – thus, to serve as a proof-of-concept.
    The data includes measurements on various locations in four European countries
    between May 2014 and December 2015. Each measurement includes a description of
    the location (country, spatial coordinates and location type that can be one of:
    field, forest, orchard or vineyard), a description of the measuring device (model
    and device id), the timestamp of the measurement, the type of measurement (automatic,
    manually reviewed), the count of trapped pests, and the type of pest species.
    A sample of the collected data is shown in Fig. 5. One of farmers using TrapView
    was tackling the problems of predicting the pest population size, its dynamics
    and its potential anomalies (e.g. trap failure, maintenance problems). To address
    these goals, we decided to perform time series clustering for stream similarity
    detection (functionality 3a from Section 3.1), time series decomposition (functionality
    3b), and structural change detection (functionality 3c). We found that the remaining
    functionalities were not relevant for analysis in this problem domain; some of
    their use is, however, illustrated in the screenshot of the system in Fig. 4.

    study. Changes in the population of pests in each single location represent a
    time series, which we uploaded to the AgroDSS system and analyzed. A visualization
    example of such time series (data stream) is shown in Fig. 6. The data refer to
    the Plum fruit moth captured in an orchard in Poland. Each point represents the
    maximum value of the measurements from that day. Download : Download high-res

    clustering enabled us to perform stream similarity analysis, as shown in Fig.
    7. The clustering dendrogram (tree) shows separation of all available data streams
    into several groups according to their mutual similarity. By observing similarities
    one can quickly deduce that they differ in the pest population dynamics. Two sequences
    at the bottom (denoted with black lines) seem smoother than the above four sequences
    (denoted with grey lines). By further analyzing the results of clustering, it
    turned out that each group represents different pest species – the four black
    sequences represent species Ostrinia nubilalis and two black sequences represent
    the Codling moth species. This example demonstrates how clustering tools can be
    used to automatically detect similarities between independent data streams. Afterwards,
    users can further utilize this acquired knowledge to determine the factors that
    affect the detected data similarities, or to automatically detect the anomalies
    in the data. An example of the latter would be a detected sudden difference between
    expectedly similar data stream (measuring points), which could indicate a fault
    in measuring devices or procedures. Download : Download high-res image (138KB)

    us to detect abrupt changes in population dynamics. Fig. 8 illustrates points
    in time (dashed vertical lines) where the underlying methodology detected such
    changes, while the horizontal lines represent the average values of measurements
    on individual segments. Such sudden and unexpected changes in the structure of
    sequences can represent an argument for automatic raising of alarms and notifying
    experts about the event that could alternatively also indicate a malfunction of
    the measuring equipment. For the users of the AgroDSS Web user interface the alarms
    basically mean just significant structural changes in the time series. However,
    for a particular problem, and within an appropriately configured FMIS with automatic
    data preparation and evaluation, it will be possible to daily check for significant
    anomalies and raise alarms in order to notify either the farmer or the problem
    expert. In our specific case study of observing pests population dynamics, the
    farmer could be notified of anomalies, indicating an early need to replace the
    overfull sticky plate or the pheromone bait. On the other hand, for some anomalies
    (such as unseasonably early occurrence of specific pests) the domain expert (e.g.
    from the company EFOS) could be informed as well, so that he could raise the alarm
    for a wider area or nationwide. Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download

    sequence into the seasonal, trend and remainder (random) components. The trend
    component shows the overall movement in the measurements and offers the possibility
    of further analyzes (e.g. searching for causal relationships between different
    factors and the observed trend within the pest population). The seasonal component
    (in this particular case, the basic cycle represents one week) provides insights
    into processes that drive the pests population. Within our case study, the analysis
    allows detection of the increasing global trend of caught pest population over
    time, as well as detection of the seasonal periodic cycles that correlate with
    weekly cycles. The sum of the trend, seasonal and remainder components equals
    the original data series. The bars on the right hand side of the plot represent
    the same data range, allowing a relative comparison of the magnitudes of each
    component. Relatively low magnitudes of the seasonal component (denoted by a high
    vertical bar) suggest that the weekly variability in the pest population is negligible.

    allows better understanding of underlying patterns in a time series: the trend
    component represents a long-term change in the data, the seasonal component represents
    a repetitive pattern with a fixed period, and the remainder represents variations
    in the data that remain unexplained after the other components have been removed.
    The farmers and analysts from the AgroIT project team reported that the use of
    AgroDSS brought a significant added value to TrapView users. Although TrapView
    already contained its own decision support module that is based on monitoring,
    it was not able to make predictions for the future. AgroDSS supplemented the basic
    decision support with predictive functionalities that enabled farmers to effectively
    plan spraying according to the predicted population size of particular pest species.
    For example, given the prediction that a particular pest will be at the stage
    of deposition of larvae in three days at a particular location of TrapView, a
    farmer is able to timely purchase and plan the use of a spray that is dedicated
    exactly for that particular stage of larvae deposition. Additionally, the project
    analysts also calculated the financial outcomes due to the use of AgroDSS functionalities.
    Within the analyses, the data from the first two years of the AgroDSS use (2015
    and 2016) were compared to the average data of three years preceding the integration
    with AgroDSS (2012–2014). Table 2 displays the results for three farms (denoted
    with A, B and C) that were able to provide reliable data from their ERP systems.
    The data show that the use of the AgroDSS positively influenced two key factors
    that contribute to a better financial outcome: (1) the increased crop quality,
    resulting in higher gained price of crop, and (2) the decreased spraying costs,
    caused by a lower number of needed sprayings. Note that although the cost of insecticide
    sprays slightly differed between farms and between years (the difference was less
    than 1.5%), the number of yearly sprayings decreased from 6 or 7 to 4 or 5. Table

    4.020 5. Conclusion The emerging technologies are making the precision agriculture
    omnipresent and allow potential for enriching it with computer-assisted decision
    support systems for farm management. We developed a system AgroDSS that provides
    a cloud-based decision support toolbox, allowing farmers to upload their own data,
    utilize several data analysis methods and retrieve their outputs. The implemented
    tools include predictive modeling with explanation, accuracy evaluation, time
    series clustering and decomposition, and structural change detection. Within the
    short case study we outlined potential benefits of the implemented tools that
    can enable knowledge extraction from the data and optimization of business. While
    the AgroDSS Web user interface demonstrates the system’s functionalities, the
    main use is provided by the REST API that allows straightforward integration with
    existing FMIS and enables the full use of AgroDSS services even for non-technical
    users. The CRISP-DM process model, as described in full in the paper, is not a
    practical solution for the majority of users, as the first three steps (problem
    understanding, data understanding and data preparation) require domain expert
    and data expert knowledge. These steps are to remain firmly within the FMIS –
    a farmer will need to specify the problem and data sources, the data will be prepared
    and submitted to the AgroDSS service. AgroDSS therefore provides a tool to address
    the steps in the second half of the CRISP-DM that can be automated: modeling,
    evaluation, and the majority of deployment (by visually presenting the learned
    knowledge). Once deployed, a model will easily be utilized from the FMIS. Within
    our further work we shall pursue the implementation of additional functionalities
    within the AgroDSS system. The further development will include (1) development
    of additional predictive models (such as naive Bayes, decision trees and neural
    networks) and ensemble learning (bagging), (2) possibility of model evaluation
    on independent test sets (including computation of evaluation measures, such as:
    sensitivity, specificity and F1-measure for classification; (relative) mean squared
    error and (relative) mean absolute error for regression), and (3) inclusion of
    feature selection methods (ReliefF, information gain, Gini index). Although currently
    implemented random forests allows good accuracy and robustness, we shall implement
    the additional predictive models to offer additional tools that can improve either
    interpretability (naive Bayes, decision trees) or predictive accuracy. Namely,
    the developing field of deep learning using neural networks allows automatic construction
    of new features that can improve capabilities of predictive modeling systems.
    Evaluation on independent test sets, additional performance measures and feature
    selection methods shall allow users to evaluate data either prior to learning
    or longitudinally. They shall enable greater control of the built model’s quality
    and signal the possible need to repeat the learning process. Possibilities to
    implement other data mining algorithms are also open – however, this demand shall
    be driven by specific business requirements of users, who represent the crucial
    part of the AgroDSS development process. Acknowledgments The AgroDSS system has
    been developed within the AgroIT project, which has been co-financed through the
    European union programme CIP-ICT PSP. The authors thank EFOS d.o.o., Slovenia,

    147 Citations 117 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Climate change, increasing populations,
    competing demands on land for production of biofuels and declining soil quality
    are challenging global food security. Finding sustainable solutions requires bold
    new approaches and integration of knowledge from diverse fields, such as materials
    science and informatics. The convergence of precision agriculture, in which farmers
    respond in real time to changes in crop growth with nanotechnology and artificial
    intelligence, offers exciting opportunities for sustainable food production. Coupling
    existing models for nutrient cycling and crop productivity with nanoinformatics
    approaches to optimize targeting, uptake, delivery, nutrient capture and long-term
    impacts on soil microbial communities will enable design of nanoscale agrochemicals
    that combine optimal safety and functionality profiles. Similar content being

    in the agri-tech revolution Article 05 June 2019 Nano-enabled strategies to enhance
    crop nutrition and protection Article 05 June 2019 Main The Green Revolution of
    the 1950s and 1960s—also known as the third Agricultural Revolution—markedly increased
    the production yield of global agriculture, thereby avoiding the spread of famine
    and malnutrition. However, the world population has grown by more than 5 billion
    since the beginning of the Green Revolution, which has necessitated a continuous
    growth in crop production. The global agriculture and food security sector is
    facing a wide range of challenges, such as low crop yields, declining soil health
    and fertility, and low use efficiency of agrochemicals mainly due to excessive
    use of fertilizers and pesticides, shrinking arable land per capita and diminishing
    freshwater availability for irrigation1. Moreover, climate change arising from
    increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration leading to rising temperature is likely
    to further affect the resilience of agricultural soils and their ability to sustain
    productivity and ensure food security for an increasing human population. Nanotechnology
    offers great potential to enable precision and sustainable agriculture, the opportunities
    and challenges of which have been discussed in several recent reviews covering
    strategies to enhance crop nutrition and smart plant sensors2,3,4. With the application
    of nanotechnology, the delivery of fertilizer5 can be tailored by targeting to
    specific tissues or organisms and delivered in a controlled manner via stimulus-responsive
    release, potentially improving nutrient-use efficiency (NUE) by releasing the
    nutrient slowly for plant uptake6. Nano-enabled agriculture is also expected to
    target pests more efficiently using smaller amounts of pesticide7, thereby avoiding
    widespread effects on soil health and biodiversity, and improving soil function
    and nutrient cycling by enhancing the soil microbiome (optimization of nitrifying
    and denitrifying bacterial communities). Longer-term applications include development
    of smart ‘sensor’ plants, whereby the plant itself is adapted to sense abiotic
    stress using targeted delivery of nanomaterials8. Figure 1 summarizes four key
    areas in which nanotechnology is improving—and will continue to improve—the precision
    and sustainability of agriculture. Fig. 1: Applications of nanotechnology in agriculture,
    focusing specifically on crop production. Most applications are still at research
    stage, due to uncertainties regarding safety and complex and emerging regulatory
    processes for approval of agricultural chemicals, including plant-protection products,
    biocides and fertilizing products or plant biostimulants. NMs, nanomaterials.
    Full size image As with all new technologies, however, the risks must be evaluated
    in parallel with the benefits, and indeed several nanomaterials have been demonstrated
    to cause negative changes in soil community structure; for example, there were
    cascading negative effects on denitrification enzyme activity and substantial
    modifications of the bacterial community structure after just 90 days of exposure
    to a realistic concentration of TiO2-containing nanoparticles (1 mg kg−1 dry soil)9,
    and studies with silver-containing nanomaterials, which are well known for their
    antimicrobial activity, have shown that the impact on soil community composition
    over 90 days is affected by exposure time and physicochemical composition of soil,
    as well as the type and coating of the nanomaterials10. Thus, an important caveat
    at the outset of this Perspective is that nanomaterials represent a very broad
    range of chemistries, compositions and physicochemical properties, which are dynamic
    and evolving as the nanomaterials interact with their surroundings, and it is
    therefore difficult to generalize their applications in agriculture and challenging
    to predict any long-term effects. However, as previous reviews have noted2,3,4,
    the development of nanotechnology for agricultural applications is still at an
    early stage, although a range of first-generation products such as nanoemulsion
    and nano-encapsulation technologies are on the market (for example, Karate Zeon,
    Seltima and others) alongside commercial formulations of nanoscale silver and
    copper as biocides (for example, Nano Green and Kocide 3000) and nanoporous zeolites
    that stimulate plant growth (for example, Nano-Gro). The nanopesticide market
    was valued at US$410 million in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual
    growth rate of just over 15% during the forecast period from 2020 to 2027, reaching
    US$940 million in 2027 (https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/nanopesticide-market).
    However, much of this market relates to encapsulation technologies for existing
    active ingredients. A recent review by Hofman et al. provides a good overview
    of the status of the field11. Notably, important differences may exist between
    nanotechnology-based pesticides and conventional pesticides, including altered
    bioavailability, sensitivity, dosimetry and pharmacokinetics12,13. Challenges
    and barriers to exploiting the full potential of nanomaterials as sensors, soil
    enhancers and plant growth stimulators, and to enhancing NUE, include a limited
    understanding of plant–nanomaterial interactions, limited methods for efficient
    delivery of nanomaterials to plants and soil, risks of potentially hazardous effects
    of nanomaterials on human health from accumulation of nanomaterials and active
    ingredient residues in edible portions of plants3, and on long-term soil quality
    and soil health from the accumulation of nanomaterials and their degradation products
    in soil, and the resultant potential alterations in microbial biodiversity14.
    There is an urgent need to address these barriers and achieve a true win-win scenario,
    in which improved agricultural production, reduced environmental pollution from
    agriculture and lower costs for farmers can be achieved synergistically. A one-health
    approach to nano-agriculture was proposed by Lombi et al., which requires interdisciplinarity
    and the bridging of human and environmental health research15. In this Perspective,
    we suggest that computational approaches including artificial intelligence (AI)
    and machine learning modelling will have a critical role in driving the progress
    of nano-enabled agriculture; indeed, such approaches are already starting to gain
    regulatory acceptance for safety assessment of nanomaterials, facilitating safe-by-design
    nanomaterials for a range of consumer products and in medicine. We also present
    examples of where the integration of AI and nanotechnology in precision agriculture
    could accelerate development and provide the insights needed to overcome the current
    barriers. Nanoinformatics will have a vital role in probing the design parameters
    of nanomaterials for use in fertilizer and pesticide delivery to ensure minimal
    impacts on soil health coupled with low phytotoxicity and minimal nanomaterial
    residues remaining in the edible tissue portions; in exploring and predicting
    the plant and ecosystem responses to nanomaterials across different climate and
    soil conditions and over multiple growing seasons; and in optimizing the interplay
    of nanomaterials and plant responses for safe and sustainable agriculture. By
    leveraging advances in cheminformatics for de novo design of drugs16 and for multi-objective
    optimization17 to simultaneously optimize numerous or competing objectives, and
    advances in nanoinformatics for prediction of cellular attachment, uptake, toxicity,
    biodistribution and safe-by-design optimization of nanomaterial properties18,19,20,
    it is clear that, despite current limitations in data availability and harmonization,
    the time is ripe for application of AI and machine learning approaches to nano-enabled
    agriculture. For example, AI may predict nanomaterial impacts on the agricultural
    ecosystem and their performance in improving agricultural production (NUE and
    reduction in air and water pollution from key elements) by integrating experimental
    data from across different soil conditions and different plant species or climate
    conditions, and from nanomaterial physicochemical properties to develop predictive
    models to optimize the efficacy of delivery, while minimizing pollution and ensuring
    a high safety profile for the nanomaterials in soil and minimal residues in the
    edible plant parts, as part of an overall approach for safer-by-design development
    of nano-agrochemicals. Current challenges and applications of AI in agriculture
    The application of computers and AI in agriculture is not new—for example, articles
    addressing software for integrated resource management21, image digitization for
    soil and crop science21, and light and temperature monitoring and control for
    plants22 were published 35 years ago. The rise of remote sensing and integration
    of remote sensing data in decision-support tools for contemporary farming systems
    is expected to improve yield production and management while reducing operating
    costs and environmental impact23. Models of agricultural systems have emerged
    over the past 50 years, spanning field, farm, landscape, regional and global spatial
    scales and engaging questions in past, current and future time periods. Integrated
    agricultural systems models combining grasslands and cropping models, livestock
    models, pest and disease models and risk-behaviour models are also emerging, although
    data gaps exist across all aspects, hampering their implementation24. A comparison
    of the capabilities of a random-forest machine-learning-based model and a physics-based
    model (a two-dimensional solver of Richards equation using HYDRUS 2D) to predict
    soil matrix potential in the root zone of a cranberry field over 72 h found that
    although both models can accurately forecast the soil matrix potential in the
    root zone, the machine-learning-based model achieved better performance compared
    with the physics-based model, but its forecasting accuracy decreased rapidly toward
    the end of the 72 h lead time25. The main driver for innovation in agritech is
    the need to optimize productivity to feed the increasing human population with
    the decreasing global per capita agricultural land area while ensuring the conservation
    of soil health and the protection of environmental quality26. The intensification
    of agriculture for enhanced productivity has resulted in extremely poor NUE globally27,28
    (less than 50%), which poses a serious threat to environmental quality as large
    amounts of nutrients are lost to water and air, causing eutrophication and greenhouse
    effects (nearly 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions are from agriculture29).
    Rockström et al. recommended a reduction of reactive nitrogen (N) use in agriculture
    from 150 MtN yr−1 to about 35 MtN yr−1 globally to ensure sustainability30. Such
    a reduction may be achieved through a combination of targeted nano-enabled delivery
    of fertilizer to match plant demands and thus avoid excessive losses, development
    and availability of low-cost in situ nutrient-sensing technology to help farmers
    plan fertilization efficiently, and identification of crop breeds that are efficient
    in nutrient uptake or fixation of atmospheric N2 directly or through enhanced
    symbiosis31. Recent efforts to enhance NUE include the use of biofertilization
    to enhance microbial biodiversity32 and the application of a range of N management
    tools across the growing season, including soil testing, plant tissue testing,
    spectral response, fertilizer placement and timing, and vegetative indexes (leaf
    area index and normalized difference vegetation index) using AI-enabled drones,
    handheld sensors and satellite imagery33. Global agricultural yields are also
    impacted by crop loss due to competition from weeds, insect damage and plant diseases.
    Weed competition causes 34% of crop loss on a global scale, and microbial diseases
    and pest damage cause a further 34% of crop loss34. The application of synthetic
    herbicides and pesticides thus increases yields (reducing crop loss) and, in the
    case of herbicides containing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, improves food
    quality through enhanced nutrient uptake and retention35; however, these agrochemicals,
    which are designed to kill, also cause severe adverse impacts on the health of
    human and non-targeted organisms and soil fertility, and result in contamination
    of water, soil and air36. Misuse of agrichemicals on poor-quality soils, soil
    degradation as a result of farming intensification, decreasing water availability
    and water quality, and globalization of diseases have led to low resilience of
    agriculture systems37. Moreover, climate change effects, such as increased atmospheric
    CO2 levels and increasing temperatures, will also impact the future of agriculture38.
    Nanotechnology applications in the agricultural sector have great potential to
    improve all aspects of crop production—that is, to increase crop production yields
    and resource-use efficiency while reducing agriculture-related environmental pollution—thereby
    ensuring global food security while ensuring future agricultural sustainability.
    The convergence of AI approaches and nano-enabled agriculture is in its infancy
    and thus this Perspective aims to stimulate the development of this important
    area. Coupling existing models for nutrient cycling and crop productivity with
    AI and machine learning to optimize targeting, uptake, delivery, nutrient capture
    and soil microbial composition will enable design of nanoscale agrochemicals that
    combine optimal safety and functional profiles and implementation of nano-agrichemicals
    into mainstream agricultural systems management. A roadmap to achieve this, and
    the existing components that can be leveraged from nanosafety research more broadly,
    are laid out in the following sections. Leveraging progress in nanosafety and
    nanoinformatics for nano-agrochemicals Before maximizing the use of nanomaterials
    in agriculture and agronomy, some concerns need to be addressed, including the
    potential toxicity of the nanomaterials to target and non-target organisms and
    adverse impacts on ecosystems39,40, their persistence and mobility in the environment
    and those of their breakdown or transformation products. As with all agrochemicals,
    concerns about potential residues in edible portions of plants also need to be
    addressed as part of an overall risk assessment of nano-enabled agrochemicals41.
    Since the use of nanomaterials on farmland will require large quantities of nanomaterials—the
    synthesis of which requires high energy input—evaluating the cost of production
    and the cost–benefit trade-offs should be considered in the development of nanomaterials
    for application in agriculture. The rapid pace of the development of nanotechnologies,
    the enormous diversity of physicochemical properties of nanomaterials and their
    dynamic interactions with, and transformations by, their surroundings (including,
    for example, biomolecule corona formation, dissolution and sulfidation42,43) lead
    to a need for in silico approaches to predict and assess their safety19. Nanoinformatics
    emerged a decade ago in the context of development and implementation of nanotechnology
    in the real world requiring the harnessing of information at the nexus of environmental
    and human safety, risk assessment and management, physiochemical properties and
    function. Through the application of AI and machine learning for in silico risk
    assessment44, nanomaterials grouping and classification45, and safe-by-design46
    nanomaterials design, as well as for prediction of nanomaterials corona formation47
    and consequences of cellular attachment and uptake48,49,50, nanoinformatics has
    had a notable role in the area of nanosafety and nanomedicine. Deep learning approaches
    have been applied, for example, to microscopic images of the aquatic indicator
    species Daphnia magna exposed to nanomaterials in a range of representative waters
    of different ionic strengths and natural organic matter contents, and can automatically
    detect possible malformations—such as effects on the length of the tail, overall
    size and uncommon lipid concentrations and lipid-deposit shapes, which are due
    to direct or parental exposure to nanomaterials—and can classify the nanomaterials
    as toxic or non-toxic20. An early application of Bayesian networks modelled the
    risk of silver nanomaterials exposure in aquatic environments51, which was subsequently
    used for sensitivity analysis52. A Bayesian network combining physicochemical
    properties and exposure potential of nanomaterials was used to perform hazard
    assessment53. Bayesian networks can also underpin the development and quantitative
    analysis of the causal relationships in adverse-outcome pathways (AOPs) and AOP
    networks54. For example, the causal relationships between the building blocks
    of an AOP relating the reproductive failure of Caenorhabditis elegans through
    oxidative stress caused by silver nanomaterials were established using Bayesian
    networks55. This highlights an important difference between Bayesian and machine
    learning approaches, which is that the former requires that causal relationships
    are known or are assumed, whereas the latter does not require any a priori causal
    relationships. A key challenge in the development of nanoinformatics models has
    been the accessibility of datasets, although there are considerable efforts underway
    currently to curate, harmonize and integrate nanosafety data and to enrich them
    with environmental, gene, protein, geospatial and other data. Tools and approaches
    to automate data mining have been developed, including workflows that simplify
    the handling, processing and modelling of cheminformatics and nanoinformatics
    data, including the Enalos toolbox of more than 25 processing modules called Enalos+
    nodes, which extract useful information and analyse experimental and virtual screening
    results in a chemoinformatics or nanoinformatics framework via KNIME56. Other
    approaches applied in the nanosafety area to overcome the limitations of dataset
    size include application of read-across approaches for gap filling57 and enrichment
    of datasets through image analysis58,59 or by generation of computational descriptors60,61,
    for example, which are then correlated with toxicity. The increasing availability
    of nanomaterials models that can make predictions without the need for any experimental
    input, using only knowledge of nanomaterial structure and composition (that is,
    physics-based models62) enables developers to screen nanomaterials in silico before
    actually producing them, thus ensuring that the properties of concern are reduced
    or eliminated, which should make the nanomaterials safe by design63,64. For nanomaterials
    and individual molecules, the starting level of the data is quantum chemical,
    and includes explicit representation of all atoms and valence electrons. To set
    up such simulations, input of the nanomaterial chemical composition, including
    impurities, as well as nanomaterial crystal structure is needed. At this level,
    atomistic and quantum-chemical representation can be used to evaluate the electronic
    structure of the nanomaterial and to parameterize a coarser representation: an
    atomistic model, by development of appropriate force fields and material constants.
    This procedure can combine physics-based multiscale modelling for calculation
    of advanced descriptors and properties of nanomaterials with nanoinformatics methods
    for evaluation of their complex properties and functionalities63. By scanning
    the main groups of engineered nanomaterials, specific properties can be identified
    that might be responsible for causing a particular toxic effect and lead to a
    particular adverse outcome, which needs to be modified or avoided. This provides
    a means of grouping and read-across characterization of nanomaterials and enables
    development of nanomaterials that are safe by design, and is currently an area
    of very intensive research. As the available pool of fully validated nanoinformatics
    models and tools with well-defined domains of applicability grows, the nanosafety
    field is becoming less reliant on animal testing and more targeted towards the
    safe-by-design principles for early stages of nanomaterial development. Integration
    of models into predictive risk assessment frameworks, such as Integrated Approaches
    to Testing and Assessment (IATA) are the next step, combining nanomaterials exposure
    and hazard characterization for complete risk assessment. IATA use existing information
    coupled with the generation of new information in an iterative approach to answer
    a defined question in a specific regulatory context, and can include a combination
    of methodological approaches (such as quantitative structure–activity relationships
    (QSARs), read across in silico, in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo) or omics technologies
    (for example, toxicogenomics). As AI and machine learning models for nanosafety
    emerge, they are increasingly being incorporated into IATA. In these IATA, the
    output from one model can be the input for the next, and predictions from several
    different models can then be integrated in a final machine learning modelling
    and predictive analysis. The analysis can then be applied to generate, for example,
    development of nanomaterial fingerprints—predictive and informative physicochemical,
    biological and computational descriptors that describe a set functionality—that
    is, the minimum set of descriptors required as input to predict specific nanomaterial
    functionalities63. Standard nanoinformatics methods for modelling have thus far
    ignored the multi-objective nature of the problem and have focused on optimizing
    each biological or material property individually as they become available during
    the material design process. Multi-objective optimization (MOOP) methods introduce
    an innovative approach for optimization founded on compromises and trade-offs
    among the various objectives17. The aim of MOOP methods is to discover a set of
    satisfactory compromises and through them, the global optimal solution, by optimizing
    numerous dependent properties simultaneously. The primary benefit of MOOP methods
    is that local optima corresponding to one objective can be avoided by consideration
    of all the objectives simultaneously, thereby escaping single-objective dead ends
    and leading to a more efficient overall process. Several methods have been developed
    for the in silico optimization of small molecules that account for the multi-objective
    aspect of the drug-design process, enabling scientists to optimize in multiple
    spaces simultaneously. Although MOOP models have not yet been explored properly
    in the area of nanomaterials, a pool of well-validated nanoinformatics models
    and tools, assisted by physics-based models, is available, and efforts to integrate
    these and facilitate multi-factor optimization of safety and functionality as
    the basis of safety by design are now beginning63. For example, multi-perspective
    AI- and machine-learning-based modelling techniques can be used to optimally aggregate
    and integrate experimental information and outcomes of the multi-scale modelling
    methods and eventually increase confidence levels concerning evidence of particular
    hazards. The resulting commercial benefits will include improved market access
    for agricultural applications and reduced costs for the exposure, hazard and risk
    assessment of nanomaterials, including safe-by-design screening before production
    to optimize both functionality and safety. The examples highlighted above demonstrate
    that there is ample scope to apply nanoinformatics in nano-enabled agriculture,
    although this has yet to be explored and is thus the rationale for the current
    Perspective to inspire the community to begin to apply the wealth of knowledge
    and existing approaches to the specific challenges of nanomaterials applied to
    agriculture. Areas ripe for application of nanoinformatics and modelling include
    prediction of nanomaterial interactions with and impacts on rhizosphere secretions
    (both proteins and metabolites), nanomaterials transformations before and during
    uptake and translocation, nanomaterials impacts on soil microbial communities
    and for prediction of plant uptake following foliar or soil application. Experimental
    data are emerging in all these areas14,65,66, and a dedicated effort to integrate
    and curate these data and present them in a format suitable for modelling is currently
    underway within the nanoinformatics e-infrastructure projects NanoCommons and
    NanoSolveIT63. Coupling these approaches with existing models for nutrient cycling67,
    NUE68 and crop productivity69, and the aforementioned agricultural systems models
    into overall IATA with MOOP capabilities, will begin to enable co-optimization
    of nanomaterials for use in agricultural systems that combine safety and functionality
    profiles (including enhancing NUE and calorific value of crops) enabling precision
    agriculture, as shown schematically in Fig. 2. Fig. 2: Applications of machine
    learning to nano-enabled agriculture. Application of machine learning in risk
    assessment and safe-by-design nanomaterials design and the potential for extension
    of machine learning approaches to support nano-enabled agriculture, building on
    advances in both nanoinformatics and agricultural systems modelling and emerging
    developments related to MOOP modelling. Integrating a range of different modelling
    and experimental approaches via an IATA will lead to enhanced prediction power
    in terms of optimal nanomaterials properties for safety and functionality across
    the range of potential nano-agriculture applications, and faster and safer implementation
    of precision nano-enabled agriculture. Full size image Experimental studies using
    nanomaterials for agriculture in the laboratory, mesocosms and field are expensive,
    time consuming and complicated, limiting the range of conditions that can be varied
    systematically. Conclusions may be ambiguous, because the interpretation of the
    results is influenced by factors such as experimental procedures, protocols, duration,
    nanomaterials types, doses, soil types and plant species. Integration of the existing
    data—albeit with gaps and limitations—and supplementation with predictive modelling
    and machine learning approaches—including Bayesian networks53,70, which can be
    dynamically updated as new knowledge emerges—into IATA underpinned by MOOP approaches
    offer exciting new directions. Development of a nano-agriculture IATA case study
    using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development IATA case study
    approach71 seems to be a logical next step as shown schematically in Fig. 2. AI
    and machine learning for nano-enabled agronomy Here we present current and future
    applications of AI and machine learning applications in agriculture. AI and machine
    learning approaches As computational capabilities grow and the value of data as
    knowledge to be exploited is increasingly realized, AI and machine or deep learning
    approaches are emerging as means to identify patterns in large datasets that are
    predictive of future outcomes. One of the most widely used approaches involves
    neural network algorithms, which use an unbiased subset of the total available
    data as the training set to develop a model that makes predictions using the rest
    of the data—the validity of the predictions is evaluated to ensure that they could
    not arise randomly. The size and range of the dataset used to train the model
    provides the limits of its predictive power, or its domain of applicability—models
    cannot predict reliably outside the range of these data. Box 1 describes the various
    types of data-driven machine learning models, which include models that link structure
    or properties (for example, of a chemical or nanomaterial) to specific effects
    or impacts on the environment—QSARs or quantitative property–activity relationship
    models72, and Bayesian networks, which are a powerful tool for incorporating uncertainty
    into decision-support systems73—by providing a basis for probabilistic inference
    and facilitating assessment of changes in probabilistic belief as new evidence
    is entered into the model. The larger the dataset available to train a machine
    learning model, the more powerful it will be—for example, in drug discovery or
    cheminformatics, models typically use data from thousands of different chemicals
    to develop a prediction. Similarly, genomics and related approaches, in which
    hundreds of thousands of data points are available, enable generation of strong
    gene-interaction networks and assessment of effects of specific genetic perturbations;
    these are used, for example, to understand gene-regulation networks in plants74.
    For application of AI and machine learning in nano-enabled agriculture, it will
    be necessary to mine the existing publicly available datasets, including those
    on nanomaterials safety and nanomaterials impacts on plants and soil microbial
    communities, existing plant omics databases such as the Plant Omics Data Center75,
    an integrated web repository for interspecies gene-expression networks incorporating
    information on eight plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Solanum
    lycopersicum, Sorghum bicolor, Vitis vinifera, Solanum tuberosum, Medicago truncatula
    and Glycine max) with functional annotation of the genes to facilitate biological
    comprehension, the plant proteome database, the Plant Secretome and Subcellular
    Proteome KnowledgeBase (PlantSecKB76) and similar databases for soil microbiota,
    and integrate these with relevant agricultural databases such as the global gridded
    data of soil physical properties, hydroclimatic and agricultural variables, socio-economic
    metrics, and historical pesticide usage data (for example, table 1 in Maggi et
    al.77). The utility of such an approach of integrating disparate datasets has
    recently been demonstrated with the establishment of PEST-CHEMGRIDS, a comprehensive
    database of the 20 most-used pesticide active ingredients on 6 dominant crops
    and 4 aggregated crop classes at 5 arcmin resolution (about 10 km at the equator)
    projected from 2015 to 2025. The use of automated data extraction, curation and
    integration via the Enalos+ KNIME tools, which has already been demonstrated for
    drug discovery and nanoinformatics56, will facilitate this process, and new nodes
    for specific databases or data clean-up and integration will be developed for
    nano-agriculture datasets as needed. Box 1. The main types of machine learning
    algorithms and examples of their application in agriculture and/or nanomaterials
    design and safety assessment104 Show more Current AI and machine learning in agriculture
    A 2018 review of the use of machine learning in agriculture classified the application
    areas into (1) crop management, including applications in yield prediction, disease
    detection, weed detection crop quality and species recognition; (2) livestock
    management, including applications in animal welfare and livestock production;
    (3) water management (daily, weekly or monthly evapotranspiration rates); and
    (4) soil management such as prediction and identification of agricultural soil
    properties78. However, application of Bayesian networks to agricultural systems
    has remained challenging, as there are often insufficient data to compute the
    prior and conditional probabilities required for the network73. Several other
    machine learning methodologies can be investigated without the need for a priori
    relationships, and numerous models can be linked together to fill gaps in the
    data and predict missing values, as demonstrated successfully for a meta-analysis
    of 216 published articles on cytotoxicity of metal oxide nanomaterials79. In terms
    of the key areas identified for improvements in crop production, process-based
    machine learning models (for example, the SPACSYS model80) for plant growth—incorporating
    assimilation, respiration, water and nitrogen uptake, partitioning of photosynthate
    and nitrogen, nitrogen fixation for legume plants and root growth81—are emerging
    and being constantly improved. With increased understanding of the processes and,
    more importantly, the variables driving them, and the availability of intervention
    strategies such as precision nano-agrochemicals to target specific locations or
    release in response to specific stimuli, the potential of machine learning for
    optimization of agroecosystems has never been greater. Integrating machine learning,
    simulation and portfolio optimization can inform decisions and support selection
    of optimal seed varieties (for example, soybean) to grow, with resolution at the
    level of a specific farm with its individual crop rotation history rather than
    at regional scale based on soil type and quality82. Incorporating such information
    into multi-object optimization modelling of nanomaterial safety, soil management
    and plant yield offers exciting new possibilities. Indeed, a recent review of
    the potential impacts of AI on achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) suggested that AI will be an enabler for SDG2 (“improved nutrition
    and promote sustainable agriculture”), but highlights generally that the pace
    of development of AI may have implications in terms of a lack of regulatory oversight
    and insight, which could potentially result in gaps in transparency, safety and
    ethical standards83. Nanoinformatics models applicable to nano-enabled agriculture
    The application of machine learning in nanomaterial risk assessment and for design
    of safe and environmentally friendly nanomaterials has also been an area of intensive
    research over the past few years. For example, nanoQSAR models linking specific
    nanomaterials properties to uptake by, and impacts on, cells or organisms are
    emerging. Models that allow determination of surface functionalizations that enhance
    (or decrease), for example, protein binding and/or cellular association (as a
    pre-requisite for internalization84) are also emerging, and can be applied for
    design of targeting strategies in precision nano-agriculture. Although to date
    no nanoQSARs have been developed for plants, ecotoxicities of plant-protection
    chemicals to target and non-target species have been predicted using QSAR85, and
    as the corpus of data related to nanomaterials in plants and soil species is growing
    exponentially, it is only a matter of time before the first nanoQSARs for plants
    and soil microbiota are developed. Similarly, extending advances in nanomedicine
    to precision nano-agriculture will facilitate the design of optimized controlled-release
    agrochemicals86,87. For example, deep learning using an automatic data-splitting
    algorithm and evaluation criteria suitable for pharmaceutical formulation data
    has been developed for the prediction of optimal pharmaceutical formulations and
    doses88. From an agricultural perspective, understanding the factors (including
    nanomaterial, plant, soil and climate factors) that control the release rate of
    active ingredients, and the factors driving transport of the carrier can influence
    selection of formulation parameters and suitability of application to specific
    locations or climates. Such data-driven models require substantial amounts of
    data to train and validate them, which remains a barrier to their development.
    However, significant work is underway in the wider nanosafety arena to develop
    optimized workflows for generation of data and metadata (for example, using electronic
    laboratory notebooks89 to capture experimental data as it is generated, linking
    them to underlying protocols and calibrations, and facilitating curation and storage
    of the data in databases, thereby accelerating their accessibility and re-usability),
    annotation with relevant ontological terms mapped to the data schema of the receiving
    databases and automated upload to nanosafety knowledge bases90, which in the medium
    term will facilitate the aggregation, integration and reuse of nanosafety- and
    nano-agriculture-related datasets. However, as noted above, there are important
    concerns regarding the safety and risks of nanomaterials that must be addressed
    before their widespread intentional application to the environment can be sanctioned,
    and there are tight regulatory processes for approval of agrochemicals91. A recent
    review assessed the regulation of pesticides and the potential use of computer-based
    chemical modelling technologies to facilitate risk assessment of nano-enabled
    pesticides88, and concluded that quantum chemistry is an appropriate tool for
    characterization of the structure and relative stabilities of organic compounds
    and for studying degradation pathways. However, a re-evaluation is needed to determine
    its suitability for nano-enabled agriculture, using quantum nanomaterials descriptors
    for QSAR development. Among the quantum descriptors for nanomaterials are molecular
    and electronic properties such as band gap, ionization potential, atomic charge,
    electronegativity and adsorption energy, as well as interaction parameters for
    prediction of interactions of proteins and small molecules, such as binding energies,
    binding affinities, Hamaker constants and absorption energies, which can be used
    to predict biomolecule corona formation92. In due course as data emerges, the
    evolution of the adsorbed biomolecule as nanomaterials interact with, and respond
    to, soil and plant secretomes, and are transformed as shown in Fig. 3, will also
    be predictable through modelling, allowing tailoring of nanomterials to acquire
    the desired biomolecule corona. Fig. 3: The complexity of nanomaterial behaviour
    in the soil–plant environment and the potential impacts in soil–plant systems.
    Understanding and predicting nanomaterial translocation and transformation, and
    identifying the optimal nanomaterial forms to retain bioavailable N species in
    the soil, will facilitate design of sustainably functional nanomaterials for agriculture,
    enhancing NUE while simultaneously reducing pollution and the need for fertilizers.
    Coupling this knowledge with enhanced targeting and sustained, controlled release
    of pesticides can be facilitated using AI to design optimal nano-agrichemicals.
    Among the input data for machine learning (ML) models are the nanomaterials characteristics
    and those of the plants and soils exposed to the nanomaterials, as indicated (a
    non-exhaustive list). Gene expression, proteomics and secretomics information,
    global soil quality and other parameters can be mined from existing databases.
    NOM, natural organic matter; S, sulfur-containing functional groups; RCOO, carboxylate
    ion. Full size image Challenges and barriers to precision nano-agriculture Although
    nanotechnology has potential in a wide range of applications in agriculture, there
    are many challenges to be overcome to move this area forward and facilitate full
    commercial-scale application of many of the innovative nanomaterials presented
    in Fig. 1. These include a lack of mechanistic understanding of the interactions
    at the nanomaterial–plant–soil interface and nanomaterial uptake and translocation
    in plant vascular structure and organelles; insufficient understanding of the
    environmental safety and human health risks of intentional nanomaterial application;
    a lack of soil and large-scale field studies to demonstrate the efficacy of nanomaterials
    under realistic scenarios; balancing the adoption of new technology and the low
    profit margins in agriculture; and the challenges in collection and harmonization
    of the datasets needed for development of AI models. Long-term studies at ecosystem
    level under environmentally relevant conditions and at realistic nanomaterials
    exposure concentrations are currently lacking. For example, silver, zinc and copper-based
    nanomaterials have demonstrated potential to be applied as efficient pesticides
    or fungicides; however, the potential impact on non-target organisms (for example,
    beneficial plant rhizosphere bacteria and worms) and long-term impacts on soil
    quality are not known. While there remain challenges for the detection of nanomaterials
    in complex matrices, particularly at low concentrations, and access to state-of-the
    art facilities with sufficient resolution such as synchrotrons is limited, application
    of deep learning tools to plant spectral images (for example STXM. XRF etc.) is
    expected to enable advances in terms of determining and predicting nanomaterials
    localization and in situ transformations even with relatively limited datasets
    and against a background of naturally occurring particles. Indeed, as models are
    trained using existing high-resolution datasets for specific nanomaterial–plant
    combinations, they can be coupled with more generalized QSARs or physical models
    of nanomaterials transformations under specific environmental conditions, and
    supplemented with the development of functional assays that can provide the input
    data needed for models but under simplified conditions93,94. For example, surface
    affinity and dissolution rate have been identified as two critical functional
    assays for characterizing nanomaterial behaviour in soil systems. A range of functional
    assays for nanomaterials transformations, including binding of secreted proteins
    and small molecules or uptake using simpler hydroponic systems could be envisaged
    to begin parameterizing more complex predictive machine learning models. Although
    nanofertilizers may enhance the NUE, effects of nanomaterials on the nutritional
    quality of food (for example, alteration of the content of carbohydrates and macro-
    or micronutrients) have been reported95 and need to be assessed systematically,
    and predictive models need to be established. Nanomaterials may accumulate in
    seeds and their potential to cause transgenerational effects96,97 are largely
    unknown. The presence of nanomaterials may cause enhanced uptake of contaminants
    by plants—for example, through binding to the nanomaterial surface and co-transport—and
    may amplify their adverse effects98,99. Such effects need to be fully understood
    and the use of nanoQSAR, multi-object optimization and other machine learning
    approaches will support this understanding and prediction. Nanomaterials undergo
    numerous transformations (physical, chemical or biological) in soils and plants.
    For example, many nanomaterials based on metals and metal compounds such as zinc,
    copper and silver tend to dissolve and release metal ions, which can further react
    with soil and plant components such as phosphate, sulfur and chloride. These transformations
    may alter the original nanomaterial properties that were designed for the specific
    application. For example, antifungal nanomaterials such as those based on silver
    can be oxidized, dissolved and sulfidized in soil environments, either by interaction
    with the soil microbiome or within plants, and the antifungal property of the
    silver nanomaterials could be reduced or diminished100. Some transformations might
    release toxic components—for example, graphene oxide was reported to degrade under
    sunlight and release polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-like compounds that are likely
    to exhibit toxic properties and persist in the environment101. Development of
    QSAR or machine learning models that can predict the transformations of nanomaterials
    under a wide range of soil and temperature conditions will facilitate optimization
    of nanomaterials properties for specific locations. Substantial progress towards
    modelling of nanomaterials transformations in the environment has already been
    made, including environment fate models and process-based models. Combining current
    models with experiments will enhance next-generation nanomaterial fate and transport
    models in key areas, including descriptions of nanomaterial heteroaggregation,
    descriptions of reactive nanomaterial chemistry, increased temporal and spatial
    resolution and sensitivity analyses to allow simplification of model structure102.
    Efforts to develop functional assays to generate the data needed to parametrize
    these models are also underway43,93,94, and can be extended to include functional
    assays for rhizosphere secretions in response to nanomaterials—for example, using
    hydroponics systems or standardized soils. Computational tools that can predict
    nanomaterial transformation processes will enable manipulation or direct simulation
    of the transformation to maintain the nanomaterial function or modify its effects.
    However, the complexity of soil chemistry and the high responsiveness of plants
    and their secretions into the rhizosphere increase the variability and diversity
    of potential nanomaterial transformations (Fig. 3). Many such factors are interlinked;
    for example, nanomaterial transformations are affected by the soil and plant microbiome
    and the extracellular polymeric substances and plant root exudates around the
    rhizosphere. However, plant root exudate and the microbiome can affect each other
    and both may be altered by exposure to nanomaterials, which in turn can affect
    the nanomaterial transformation processes. Changes to the microbiome will affect
    the nitrogen-cycling processes in soil. Foliar applied nanomaterials can be translocated
    downwards to the roots and interact with phyllosphere components such as microorganisms
    and leaf exudates. All of the above areas are also subject to change and disruption
    as a result of climate change—for example, changes in CO2 concentration and temperature
    can shift nutrient cycling, alter rates of reactions and transformations and change
    plant susceptibility to nanomaterials, among other effects. Therefore, the dynamic
    nature of the whole system needs to be considered, making this a perfect candidate
    for AI and machine learning solutions, by integrating existing predictive models
    for nanomaterials corona formation (for example, those based on binding affinities
    and Hamaker constants92) or machine learning models using biophysicochemical characteristics
    of proteins, nanomaterials and solution conditions via random-forest classification47,
    with databases of plant and microbe secretomics and plant proteomes to develop
    corona evolution and exchange models. Compared with prediction of small-molecule
    toxicity, nanoinformaticians tend to work with smaller datasets (sometimes including
    only a few nanomaterial variants), and typically use exposure concentrations and
    time points as a means to expand the dataset. Thus, evaluation of the impact of
    nanomaterials on NUE in a hydroponic system, for example, could assess a panel
    of 8–10 nanomaterials and gauge their effects alone and in combination with fertilizer
    at different ratios and over different timescales, and determine the nitrogen
    concentrations in the water and plant mass and gaseous emissions under controlled
    temperatures and CO2 levels. This would provide a multi-factorial dataset for
    establishment of machine learning models to predict the NUE of a new nanomaterial,
    as long as its physicochemical characteristics fell within the domain of applicability
    of the model; that is, if at least one of the nanomaterials in the training and
    test set overlapped with the properties of the new nanomaterial. If the nanomaterials
    were characterized over time under different conditions—for example, in terms
    of their size, dissolution and acquired corona composition—further models could
    be built predicting corona composition and nanomaterials fate and behaviour, identifying
    the key nanomaterials properties and environmental factors driving the specific
    effect. If data on plant growth (roots and shoots) or localization of the nanomaterials
    in the plants were determined, increasingly complete models of NUE could be developed,
    taking into account the nanomaterial localization and speciation within the plant.
    System complexity can then be increased by moving to soils, where nanomaterial
    characterization is more challenging, but where models for the environmental fate
    of the nanomaterials—such as the NanoFASE soil–water–organism model, which predicts
    the fate of nanomaterials in the environment43—may already exist. Thus, the initial
    steps will be small, but as the datasets and models emerge, their integration
    with other models and tools into overall IATA and agricultural systems models
    will become feasible and achievable. A roadmap for progress Smart and nano-enabled
    agriculture combined with AI and machine learning capabilities offer an exciting
    convergence of technologies with the unique capability to address the overarching
    SDG2. The impetus for smart agriculture is therefore multi-pronged: from enhancing
    and sustaining productivity through nano-enabled (responsive) delivery of agrochemicals
    to crops, to reduction in environmental pollution and negative human health impacts
    from agriculture. The grand challenges in agriculture can only be solved if the
    power of nanomaterials can be harnessed safely, responsibly and sustainably. Nanoinformatics
    will have a vital role in probing the design parameters, the plant and ecosystem
    responses, and their co-optimization for safe and sustainable agriculture. For
    example, AI may predict nanomaterial impacts on the agricultural ecosystem and
    their performance in improving agricultural production (NUE and reduction in air
    and water pollution forms of key elements), by integrating experimental data from
    across different soil conditions, plant species, climate conditions and nanomaterial
    physicochemical properties to predict both the nanomaterials impacts on the agricultural
    system (on plants and soil) and the impacts of the agricultural system on the
    nanomaterials in terms of their transformations, transport and bioavailability.
    This will enable safer-by-design development of nano-agrichemicals and co-optimization
    of both safety and desired functionality of the nanomaterials. For example, the
    potential impact of nanomaterials for remobilization of pesticide residue contaminants
    of soil resulting from decades of pesticide use remains an unexplored area, and
    indeed monitoring of pesticide residues in soil is not currently required at the
    European Union (EU) level despite the known degradation of soil quality, in contrast
    to the water monitoring regulated by the EU Water Framework Directive103. Future
    research directions to address these challenges are outlined here and summarized
    in Box 2. Box 2 Future research needs • Determine the long-term fate of nanomaterials,
    including transformation, transport in soil, and uptake and translocation in plants,
    curate these data and the accompanying metadata into nanomaterials knowledge bases
    and enrich them with global soil and weather characteristics, knowledge of plant
    biology (including proteome, secretome and transcriptomics data), global pesticide
    use datasets, soil microbial community characteristics and any other relevant
    datasets to facilitate development of deep learning models tailored to specific
    nanomaterials being developed for nano-agriculture and the local environmental
    conditions, crop rotations and historical and future needs. Show more Understand
    the long-term fate of nanomaterials in agricultural environments Transformation
    of nanomaterials will change their original designed properties, which may affect
    their function as fertilizers, pesticides, carriers or sensors. The transformation
    could occur in soil, at the plant interface (for example, root or leaf surface)
    or inside the plant. In soil, the transformation could be driven by soil texture
    and chemistry, and by interactions with soil microorganisms and animals. Plant
    interfaces, including the rhizosphere and phyllosphere, are critical locations
    for nanomaterials transformation. The transformations in these regions are driven
    by the dynamic and complex composition, including plant metabolites and microorganisms.
    Nanomaterials may also be transformed during their translocation in plant vascular
    structure by interacting with plant fluids. All of these areas remain largely
    unknown and thus generation of datasets that are deposited in open access databases
    is urgently required. Another critical question is how to effectively deliver
    nanomaterials to target different locations in plants. This requires a clear understanding
    of the uptake and translocation of the nanomaterials. Both the leaf and root contain
    physiological barriers to prevent the entry of unwanted substances, and the structures
    of these two organs are very different. Nanomaterials that enter the leaf translocate
    downward in phloem, whereas those entering roots translocate upward in the xylem.
    The fluid composition and flow rate in xylem and phloem may greatly affect the
    translocation and accumulation of nanomaterials in plant. Data and predictive
    models for these questions are all required urgently. Assess the long-term life
    cycle impact of nanomaterials in the agricultural ecosystem Given the fact that
    repeated application of nanotechnology in agriculture will become possible in
    the future, long-term retention of nanomaterials in agricultural soil is inevitable.
    The majority of current studies regarding plant–nanomaterials interactions are
    phenomenological observations of nanomaterials toxicity under short-term, high-dose
    conditions. Long-term, low-dose effects of nanomaterials on agroecosystems therefore
    also need to be studied, addressing nanomaterial impacts on plant growth, microbial
    activity and community structure, soil health (for example, soil enzyme activity
    and nutrient cycling), trophic transfer of nanomaterials and transgenerational
    effects. Use of multiple doses, multiple sampling time points and a wide panel
    of nanomaterials, a range of different soil conditions or different plants under
    identical exposure conditions will facilitate implementation of data-hungry machine
    learning models, although meta-analysis and computational gap filling of smaller
    datasets is also helping to accelerate the pace of development of nanomaterials
    models. Take a systems-level approach to nano-enabled agriculture The behaviour,
    fate and impact of nanomaterials in the soil–plant system, plants and microorganisms
    are all interconnected. As shown in Fig. 3 and described above, change of one
    factor may induce a change of the whole system. Given the power of AI and the
    complexity of the optimization challenges facing nano-agriculture, it is clear
    that their convergence offers exciting new directions (Fig. 4). Using extensive
    existing models and datasets for soil quality, crop yield and NUE, for example,
    and combining these with models and datasets related to plant and microbial secretomes,
    nanomaterials physicochemical properties, transformations and bioavailability,
    and release of active ingredients, could enable important new insights into: (1)
    the probable transformation pathways for the nanomaterials and their resulting
    environmental transport and bioavailability; (2) the potential impact of the nanomaterial
    and its associated active ingredients (in cases where the nanomaterial is a carrier)
    on crop yield and NUE; and (3) potential identification of biomarkers of crop
    health and disease that can be used as early warning systems. Identification of
    data gaps can also drive the design of focused experiments to fill the gaps or
    to develop sub-models for gap filling or prediction of specific parameters, to
    be integrated into an overall model framework enabling design of combinations
    of nanomaterials and active ingredients that optimize NUE and minimize pollution
    while enhancing crop yield and potentially even nutritional (calorific) value.
    Integration of safe-by-design approaches and feeding forward the emerging knowledge
    into the updating of regulatory processes for advanced nano-enabled agricultural
    applications, both in fertilization and in plant protection, are also essential.

    of automated tools for harvesting data from public databases and pre-processing
    and curation of the data for direct input into the AI or machine learning models—for
    example, using the Enalos tools56 in KNIME—ensures that the output data from one
    model can serve as the input data for subsequent models, thereby facilitating
    model integration and development of increasingly multiplexed predictions for
    nano-enabled precision agriculture. A number of potential multi-object optimization
    machine learning modelling outputs are shown in the far right panel to inspire
    the development of the field. Full size image Systems-wide approaches can also
    support pre-emptive identification of potential challenges or solutions arising
    from use of nanomaterials. For example, integrating knowledge on the historical
    use of pesticides and the accumulation of pesticide residues in soils globally
    could potentially identify specific nanomaterials with high affinities for such
    residues, leading to their remobilization and unintended uptake into plants. Thus,
    the convergence of nanotechnology and AI or machine learning will also support
    efforts under the EU Green Deal, and could be used to identify hot spots and/or
    optimized nanomaterial compositions for soil remediation, for example, as well
    as supporting impact assessment and helping in efforts to protect soil fertility,
    reduce soil erosion and the overuse of nutrients, while increasing soil organic
    matter levels as part of an overall adoption of sustainable soil management practices,
    including as part of the forthcoming revision to the Common Agricultural Policy,
    which a recent report has suggested is only marginally consistent with the ambitions
    of the EU Green Deal11. Extensive changes to EU legislation are expected in 2021,
    including the EU Soil Thematic Strategy and the Zero Pollution Action Plan for
    Air, Water and Soil, which will encompass a range of chemicals including pesticides.
    Use AI and machine learning to identify key nanospecific properties that initiate
    the effects or functions of nanomaterials There are multiple physicochemical properties
    of nanomaterials such as size, shape, surface charge, surface area, surface reactivity
    and crystal structure that can influence their transformations and toxicities.
    AI and machine learning will enable selection of the most critical parameters
    that determine and predict the behaviour of nanomaterials in soil and plant systems
    from large datasets (Fig. 4). The use of automated data retrieval from public
    databases, data pre-processing and gap filling, and automated splitting of the
    data into test and validation sets for modelling56 will facilitate the in silico
    design of NMs that can be delivered to plants efficiently. Nanomaterial transformations
    in different soil conditions and different rhizosphere compositions under changing
    climate conditions could also be predicted by integrating predictive models, enabling
    optimization of nanomaterials for agricultural application in a range of climatic
    and local conditions. Wider ecosystem effects and prediction of tripartite (nanomaterials–soil–plant)
    behaviours under future climate scenarios can also be predicted using, for example,
    Bayesian networks and deep learning approaches. Such models are especially important
    as they can operate under data scarcity, yet can easily incorporate new data as
    they emerge. Application of these emerging models to address the broader issues
    of food security, and to tackle SDG2—improved nutrition and promotion of sustainable
    agriculture—will provide important new intersectional insights and suggestions
    for ways forward. References Shahzad, A. N., Qureshi, M. K., Wakeel, A. & Misselbrook,

    Abstract Data from agronomy experiments are typically collected and stored in
    a number of minimally documented computer files, with additional information being
    entered and archived in field books or diaries. Data manipulation is generally
    cumbersome and error-prone, and data loss is frequent. Modern database technology
    has the potential to resolve these issues. However, experience gained by an international
    network of experimenters and crop modellers (the International Benchmark Sites
    Network for Agrotechnology Transfer; IBSNAT) in using a database for agronomic
    experiments conducted by many workers at different sites highlighted problems
    of data entry, quality control, and changing requirements for storage and output
    variables. In an attempt to minimize these problems, IBSNAT reduced its focus
    on a central database, but considerably enhanced its effort on the design and
    use of a set of simple, standard experiment documentation and results files that
    could be established and edited easily, transferred directly among workers, used
    as inputs to analytical software and crop models, and read by database and spreadsheet
    software. The standard files which were developed, and which were used in a software
    package termed DSSAT V3, have recently been upgraded by a consortium of experimenters
    and modellers (the International Consortium for Agricultural Systems Applications;
    ICASA). These new files are described briefly here. The ICASA files constitute
    an advance in the potential for good documentation and storage of agronomic data,
    but only partly solve the problem of overall data management and use. There is
    still need for central and local databases that facilitate both the searching
    of information from different experiments, and the examination of relationships
    that may be apparent in a large array of data. A number of such databases have
    been developed for specific applications, and a few of these are briefly touched
    upon. In particular, recent work with one large database currently being developed
    by a number of international Agricultural Research Centers, National Research
    Organizations, and Universities, (the International Crop Information System, ICIS),
    is briefly described. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    1. Introduction For agronomic experiments, information detailing the planning,
    the sequence of activities and events during the conduct of the experiment, and
    the results, is commonly recorded first in notebooks, diaries, handheld tape recorders,
    or palmtop computers. Subsequently, this information may be transferred to prepared
    reporting sheets, to computer spreadsheets, or to computer files, and processed
    using statistical and other analytical software. The computer files so created
    may, in turn, be re-organized and updated such that it often becomes unclear as
    to which files contain original data, why changes to data were made, and which
    of the modified data are the most recent. Faced with such a problem, some workers
    (e.g. Van Evert et al., 1999a, Van Evert et al., 1999b) have argued that the information
    stemming from agronomic experiments should be stored in a computerized database,
    and managed using a database management system (DBMS). The computerized database
    per se would be a logically coherent collection of computer files that contain
    all the data (Elmasri and Navathe, 2000), and the DBMS, software to simplify the
    creation and management of such computer files. The concept of using computerized
    databases and management systems in agricultural research, however, is not new.
    Andrews et al. (1978) and Andrews and Hardwick (1982) described databases for
    use in plant breeding before the advent of the micro-computer, and Mulitze (1990)
    documented a commercial package that also included analytical software. More recently,
    CIMMYT (Fox et al., 1997) developed a package entitled ‘The International Wheat
    Information System’ for storing and managing genealogical and selected performance
    data. This system forms the base of the ‘International Crop Information System’
    (ICIS) that has received some attention in recent years (IRRI, 1997). One of the
    first attempts to develop and implement database and associated management software
    for an international array of experiments was made by a US Agency for International
    Development (USAID) project, the International Benchmark Sites Network for Agrotechnology
    Transfer (IBSNAT; Tsuji et al., 1998). The database, based on concepts developed
    by Nix (1984) and Wallach (1984), was documented in detail by IBSNAT (1991). It
    was implemented using commercially available database management software and
    was distributed in a software package called DSSAT V2.1 (IBSNAT, 1989). As part
    of the implementation process, data sheets were prepared and distributed to those
    wishing to make use of the software to create a local database, or to submit data
    to a central database (IBSNAT, 1986). Experience in using the database and software
    both at individual locations and at a central site handling data from many co-operators,
    highlighted a number of problems. These included: double handling of data, quality
    control, and changing requirements for storage and output variables. Such problems,
    however, merely reflected one overriding problem — viz. the considerable and continuing
    need for human resources both to enter and check data, and to maintain and update
    the management software. Given that competition for financial resources, and the
    need for change, will always exist, IBSNAT concluded that the fundamental problem
    in reality was not one of resources but one of resource disposition — one of failing
    to direct sufficient resources to activities targeted at developing a system that
    fully recognized how agronomists work, think, and interact with each other and
    their clients, the farming community. Effort was thus shifted from one with database
    design and maintenance uppermost, to one in which improvement of the notes and
    files already used by agronomists became pre-eminent, and in which attempts were
    directed at improving the usability, interchangeability, and general understandability
    of such files. Following this change of thrust, a set of simple, standard experiment
    documentation and data files that could be established and edited easily, that
    could be transferred directly among workers, and that could be directly used by
    analytical software and crop models was developed. These standard files, which
    were used in a software package DSSAT V3, were recently upgraded by a consortium
    of experimenters and modellers (the International Consortium for Agricultural
    Systems Applications; ICASA). These files, together with a description of experiences
    gained in using earlier versions, and with a description of efforts to develop
    databases and software for using agronomic information in a broader context, are
    described here. 2. First efforts — the IBSNAT files As with recent attempts to
    develop protocols for information exchange between email communities, IBSNAT recognized
    that three things were necessary for meaningful agronomic information exchange
    and interpretation — a common set of required information, a common vocabulary
    for presenting information, and a common file structure and format that would
    facilitate understanding of the contents of any file. Attention was paid to each
    of these aspects when designing a set of files. First, considerable time and effort
    was devoted to defining a ‘Minimum Data Set’ (MDS) that would allow for a balanced
    documentation (and hence interpretation) of field experiments. The MDS consisted
    of: site and soil information, conditions at the start of the experimental period,
    crop and soil management details, and weather and agronomic data (Table 1). Table
    1. Contents of the International Benchmark Sites Network for Agrotechnology Transfer

    unit (e.g. kernels) in dry weight terms Canopy (above-ground) dry weight at maturity
    (and at two earlier stages if practical) Harvest product individual dry weight
    (e.g. weight per grain, weight per tuber) Harvest product number per unit at maturity
    (e.g. seeds per spike, seeds per pod) Damage level of pest (disease, weeds, etc.)
    infestation (maximum) Number of leaves produced on the main stem N percentage
    of economic unit N percentage of non-economic parts The second requirement for
    easy information exchange and interpretation — a common vocabulary — was addressed
    by IBSNAT by defining one set of codes for variates measured before or during
    the conduct of an experiment, and a second set of codes for operations and inputs
    that could be carried out or supplied before or during the experiment. The codes
    were short, and thus somewhat indecipherable to a new user, but most were constructed
    according to a standard convention that facilitated understanding once a few simple
    rules were learned. The third requirement — a common file structure and format
    that would facilitate understanding — was handled by introducing a set of standard
    ‘mark-up’ symbols and headings for different file sections, data items, and comments.
    The symbols used included an ‘*’ for a section heading, ‘@’ for a header line
    specifying variables occurring below, and ‘!’ for a comment. Of these symbols,
    that for the header line was highly significant. Information on this line identified
    the variates that were placed below, and thus ensured that the files were virtually
    self-explanatory. The use of these symbols, along with a standard convention that
    data be organized into rows and columns, with data items separated by spaces,
    also made it possible to write software that could ‘read’ the file without specific
    format statements. The standard files, which were used in DSSAT V3 (Tsuji et al.,
    1994) and described by Hunt et al. (1994b), were sufficiently flexible both to
    allow for use for primary data entry and storage, and to allow for the addition
    of variables deemed essential to document specific experiments. They were also
    largely self-explanatory, thus facilitating not only the exchange of data among
    users, but also easy interpretation by the originator after the elapse of some
    years. 2.1. Experience with the IBSNAT files The standard IBSNAT files have been
    widely used by experimenters and modellers using the DSSAT system (Tsuji et al.,
    1994) and have been adopted by the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystem project
    (GCTE) for use in documenting experiments and regional yield investigations. Within
    GCTE, the standards have greatly assisted model comparisons (Goudriaan, 1996,
    Jamieson et al., 1998) that have led to model improvements. The formats have also
    been used for direct recording of information usually entered in a researcher''s
    diary or fieldbook, (e.g. within the Ontario, Canada, Winter Wheat Co-operation
    Performance testing system). Experience gained in using the file structures and
    standards revealed, however, that they contain inconsistencies and ambiguities
    and are not entirely suited for generic use. In addition, the standards made insufficient
    provision for entering specifically headed comments. Widespread use of datasets
    facilitated by the file standards has emphasized that datasets almost invariably
    contain errors, inconsistencies, and gaps despite the best efforts of experimenters.
    Any protocol for data storage must thus allow for the checking and/or verification
    of data items, for the documentation of any checking activity, and for the easy
    updating of data. To this end, a structure that allows for visual evaluation of
    all of the data is important, and the standard and columnar set-up of the IBSNAT
    files facilitated this. Once obvious errors have been eliminated, however, problems
    often remain, particularly in the following aspects: 2.2.1. Moisture contents
    Grain yield reported without a clear indication as to whether it represents fresh
    weight (i.e. an ‘as-is’ basis) or dry weight. 2.2.2. Units Measurements reported
    using non-standard units, without a clear indication as to the units and basis
    of measurement used. In some cases, this type of problem is easy to recognize,
    but in others (e.g. when yield data have been reported on a ‘per plot’ rather
    than ‘per unit’ area basis), the problem is virtually impossible to detect. 2.2.3.
    Conventions The conventions used to define the aspects measured are not adequately
    documented. For example, leaf area index reported without any indication as to
    whether senescent (yellow or partially yellow) leaves or parts of leaves have
    been included, or whether the area of non-lamina structures (e.g. stems or spikes)
    has been included. Similarly, specific leaf area is often reported without an
    indication as to whether mid-ribs, petioles or petiolules are included. 2.2.4.
    Discrepancies Yield component data (e.g. grain weight and number) do not match
    the overall yield data; canopy component data (e.g. leaf weight, stem weight)
    do not match with overall canopy weight; and end of season measurements often
    do not match with the final determination of a sequence of measurement made throughout
    the growing season. In many cases such discrepancies are explainable (e.g. different
    sampling techniques) and if so, this should be explained. If not, a user is unsure
    as to which measurement(s) are most reliable. 2.2.5. Manipulations Sometimes,
    the data in a file have been adjusted without any indication as to the reasons
    for the adjustment. Such adjustments could occur when a lattice design and analysis
    was used, but more frequently occur when plots were damaged in some way (lodging,
    animal trampling, etc.), or some of the harvest product was lost or damaged. Such
    changes must be clearly documented in the data file. In updating the file standards,
    therefore, particular attention has been paid to each of these aspects. Some consideration
    was given to directly associating all variates with their units, as advocated
    by Fowler (1997), but this was rejected as being too cumbersome for file use.
    Instead, the current approach, in which the name of a variate is associated with
    a unit, has been somewhat ‘tightened’. 3. Recent efforts — the ICASA files To
    minimize the problems identified when using the IBSNAT files, ICASA has devoted
    considerable time and effort to update the original IBSNAT files. The resulting
    standards (an example file is presented in Appendix) retain the basic structure
    used in the IBSNAT files. They use ASCII characters and have a line length restriction
    of 254 characters, with information arranged in columns that are headed by associated
    codes. Specific symbols are used to identify comments, missing data, software
    commands, and file endings, as summarized in Table 2. As with IBSNAT files, the
    files use ‘keys’ and character strings to link information in different parts
    of a file and in different files and are based on ‘relations’ that could easily
    be used in a large database containing information from many experiments. Table
    2. Summary of some of the syntax and formatting rules for International Consortium
    for Agricultural Systems Applications (ICASA) files Item Rule Comments A ‘!’ at
    the beginning of a line indicates a comment. Missing data ‘-99’, ‘-’ or ‘.’ Non-applicable
    data A ‘-99’ also indicates data that are not applicable as opposed to missing
    per se. For example, row width and spacing for a crop that is broadcast sown Data
    ‘flags’ To indicate outliers, data filled with an estimate, etc. place a reference
    number in a flag column and detail the problem and changes in a FLAGS section
    (group) of the file Commands The symbol ‘#’ at the beginning of a line indicates
    the start of a file statement that can be interpreted as a command by software
    (e.g. ‘#INCLUDE C:/ICASA/Newdata/FileA.dat’) Blank lines May be placed anywhere
    in a file End-of-file ‘=’ as the only character on the last line of a file. Its
    use is optional but it is recommended for electronic file transfer to indicate
    whether a file has unintentionally been truncated The new ICASA files have data
    organized into a more clearly defined hierarchy than was present in the IBSNAT
    files. This hierarchy has three levels: DATA CLUSTERS; DATA GROUPS, and DATA UNITS.
    The DATA CLUSTER is the most basic (smallest) aggregation, consisting of a number
    of variates and/or level indicators (‘keys’) clustered together under one line
    of codes. For example, a DATA CLUSTER could define a crop and cultivar that is
    to be used in an experiment. The DATA GROUP aggregates all variates as levels
    of a particular type. For example, a cultivar DATA GROUP would be followed by
    all cultivars that are in the experiment. The third and highest level of aggregation
    is the DATA UNIT. This level of aggregation was not present in the IBSNAT files.
    Its use allows a complete set of related data to be kept together. Examples of
    data that might be so aggregated are: (1) details of a particular experiment;
    (2) weather information from different sites within a region; (3) soil information
    for different sites from one institute; and (4) results of a particular experiment
    that involves several sites. These units can be placed in separate files or be
    aggregated into one OVERALL file to facilitate data transfer. The naming convention
    for the ICASA files follows that of the IBSNAT DSSAT V3 files. The reader is referred
    to the ICASA web-site (http://www.icasanet.org/) to obtain a detailed description
    of the file structure as well as a listing of all codes and their definitions.
    3.1. Overall data management While the ICASA file standards represent a major
    advance in terms of the accurate documentation of trials and the facilitation
    of data use and transfer, they only partially address the broad problem of efficient
    management and archiving of agronomic data. As noted earlier, relational data
    base software has been proposed for use in agronomic data management. The experience
    of IBSNAT and, more recently, ICASA would suggest, however, that database software
    and the associated specific databases could best serve to facilitate the searching
    and ordering of selected items of information drawn from the ICASA files, the
    primary storage units, and to aid the examination of relationships that may be
    apparent when a large number of data sets are considered, particularly relationships
    between performance characteristics and genetic information. Such an approach
    would allow for the construction of computerized databases and associated software
    for particular and well defined purposes, a fundamental tenet of computerized
    database design. A number of specialized databases for use in particular contexts
    in agriculture have already been developed and described (e.g. Townsend et al.,
    1994, Haley et al., 1999). The need to sort through datasets was not ignored in
    the second stage of the IBSNAT project, and database software was developed for
    extracting specific pieces of information from the standard files, and for sorting
    and searching through this information for experiments that meet desired criteria.
    The potential of this approach is being maintained and enhanced by workers within
    GCTE, who are developing software that will extract metadata directly from the
    ICASA files, and then allow for the searching and sorting of the metadata. The
    capture of specific pieces of information for sorting and searching in centralized
    databases may, however, be rendered unnecessary by the development of approaches
    that facilitate the searching of files on local computer servers. One such approach
    could involve the use of the ‘Extensible Markup Language’ (XML; see www.w3.org/xml/1999/xml-in-10-points).
    At the present time, however, the question as to whether resources in the long
    term would be better directed to the development of software that could translate
    ICASA files into XML, rather than to the development of software that can extract
    data from ICASA files, place such data into a centralized database, and then search
    through the information is still moot. Over and beyond the question of how best
    to search and sort through information in different files, however, there remains
    the need to aggregate information from many sources for use when exploring overall
    relationships. A general database for agro-ecological research that could aid
    in such an endeavour has been described and implemented by Van Evert et al., 1999a,
    Van Evert et al., 1999b, and a second database that can store both genealogical
    and experimental information is at the core of the International Crop Information
    System (ICIS Project, 1999). This latter could be of particular use in the exploration
    of performance-genotype relationships. The ICIS development has been based on
    the premise that to obtain the full benefits of a system for managing crop research
    data, the system should cover as broad a range of data as possible, potentially
    including information from biotechnology to plant breeding to farm-level agronomy
    (ICIS Project, 1999). Furthermore, recognizing that researchers may be reluctant
    to share all of their data, the system has been developed to permit storage of
    data both in local and central systems. It has been built on the experience of
    the International Wheat Information System (IWIS; Fox et al., 1997), but has taken
    more than 4 years of design effort to arrive at what appears to be a robust physical
    structure for both genealogy and data management systems (ICIS Project, 1999).
    The Genealogy Management System (GMS) handles out-crossing and self-pollinating
    crops as well as clonally propagated material and germplasm derived from specialized
    techniques such as mutation breeding, polyploidization and genetic transformation.
    The Data Management System (DMS) is used to store experimental details and crop-soil
    system performance data. The latter, which can be numerical or text, are linked
    to a trait management system that allows for different units and methods of measurement
    for a single trait. Supporting data on individuals, institutions, bibliographic
    references and locations are also readily stored. The ICIS Version 1.0 CD-ROM
    (ICIS Project, 1999) contains implementations for nine crops (barley, common bean,
    chickpea, maize, potato, rice, soybean, triticale, and wheat) as well as a special
    implementation for farming systems data. This first release emphasizes genealogy
    data which, for wheat (the International Wheat Information System, IWIS), can
    be presented back for 18 generations. Data input is direct, but the ICASA standards
    are seen as key for data input and output for subsequent versions. The development
    and implementation of a system as flexible and complex as ICIS has presented many
    challenges. Software development strives for modularization with reusable components,
    and ICIS developers have participated in efforts to specify object-oriented standards
    for agricultural decision support tools. They are involved to a degree with data
    entry and recognize, as did IBSNAT after DSSAT V2.1, that this is crucial to the
    success of a database. Their efforts in this area, as in the overall database
    and associated software design, parallel those of some major seed companies, who
    are developing in-house systems with similar scope. Such efforts reflect the consensus
    in the bio-informatics arena that effective data management will soon be a major
    challenge in crop improvement. However, efforts to develop extremely flexible
    and all encompassing systems may fall foul of the most basic tenets underlying
    effective database design and application — viz., the need for a requirements-driven
    approach. It is to be hoped, therefore, that subsequent developments will place
    most emphasis on ‘adding value’ to whatever is being recorded, handled, and analysed
    using existing systems and standards, prominent among which are the ICASA file
    standards, and to modelling the data for application in new and expanding areas
    of endeavour. Such a viewpoint is supported by the experience of a major agricultural
    research group (the Agricultural Production Systems Research Unit, APSRU, located
    in Toowoomba, Australia). This group had planned to develop a relational database
    of agronomic data for use with their crop modelling system, APSIM (McCown et al.,
    1996), but have recently abandoned efforts to develop a central database, leaving
    data organization to individuals with their own specific interests (Carberry,
    APSRU, pers. comm.). 3.2. Future needs The ICASA experimental details file contains
    the names of the cultivars included in any given experiment and, as an optional
    item, general information on the nature of the cultivars. The data set specification,
    however, does not require detailed information on cultivar pedigree and characteristics.
    This is a major weakness insofar as the nature of the cultivars may well determine
    the overall performance characteristics of an experiment. ICASA should thus work
    in co-operation with the international Agricultural Research Centers and others
    towards the definition of an array of phenotypically invariant trait coefficients
    that could be used to characterize cultivars. Naturally, some of these characteristics
    would be species specific, and some of the definitions would become clearer as
    a result of the analytical work associated with crop modelling. However, any attempt
    to define invariant coefficients will inevitably involve a consideration of the
    genomics that underlie phenotypic expression. A pressing need, therefore, is for
    the development of databases in which performance information is aggregated with
    genomic information. The ICIS endeavour, or something with similar international
    orientation, could play a pivotal role in this domain. An equally pressing problem
    stems from recognition that data defined for the current files, and used as input
    to a number of simulation models, have been inadequate to enable accurate simulation
    of the results of some experimental work (e.g. Landau, et al., 1998, Van Oijen
    and Ewert, 1999). While there may be many reasons for such discrepancies, the
    possibility that the variates included do not encompass some aspects that are
    significant to crop performance should not be overlooked. Aspects that can be
    mentioned in this context are windspeed and air humidity (Vijaya Kumar et al.,
    1996), soil micro-nutrient content (e.g. Engel et al., 1998), soil-borne organisms
    (e.g. Collins Johnson et al., 1992), and soil compaction (e.g. Soane and Van Ouwerkerk,
    1994, Lal, 1996). ICASA and others should thus continue work to refine and enhance
    standards for the documentation of experimental work, to ensure that results of
    field experiments can be effectively explained and realistically simulated. Over
    and beyond the need for specific data to be added to the files, there is a need
    for tools to enter and manipulate data within the files, and for wider recognition
    and use of the standard file configurations. A number of such tools is available
    in the DSSAT V3 package, but with the introduction of the ICASA standards, these
    need modification and enhancement. Some such tools will be produced by those directly
    involved with ICASA, but as with all sets of standards, there will always be a
    need for additional and improved tools. It is hoped that many individuals not
    involved directly with ICASA will develop tools and share those with ICASA and
    others. As regards the need for wider recognition and use, it is perhaps best
    to let this develop as workers recognize the interchange opportunities afforded
    by adherence to a set of standards, much as with the Internet (Twomey, 2000).
    Some further publicity, however, could be achieved by bringing the ICASA standards
    to the attention of groups that foster and support the development of standards
    for computer applications. The Life Sciences Research (LSR) Group, which is open
    and non-profit making (http://www.omg.org/homepage/lsr/intro.html/), is one such
    group focusing on the definition of data objects. 4. Conclusions The definition
    of a set of standards that can serve for experimental documentation, for data
    transfer, and for input to analytical programs, crop models, and specifically
    oriented databases has implications that extend well beyond the immediate issue
    of data handling. It has implications in crop modelling per se, where there is
    a recognized need for standardized inputs and outputs, both within the modelling
    community and among those who are not modellers themselves but are interested
    in the potential uses of models (e.g. Mutsaers and Wang, 1999). It also has implications
    that relate to the way that individual field experiments are conducted, on requirements
    for participation in joint experiments, and on requirements for publication of
    the results of experimental work. The contents of the set of standard files in
    essence constitute a ‘check-list’ that details what should be required of all
    those conducting field experiments. The work in developing the standards thus
    complements earlier efforts to define Minimum Data Sets for field experiments
    (e.g. Nix, 1984, Hunt et al., 1994a). For the interpretation of data from multi-site
    trials, including plant breeding nurseries, the collection of the defined minimum
    set of background information at each site appears essential for all trials other
    than those distributed for disease virulence identification. For publication,
    both to obtain maximum utility from the experiments reported, and to allow for
    checking of conclusions, a minimum data set in standard form should be available
    to other workers. Publishing houses involved with field research should thus consider
    requiring the submission of a minimum data set in standard form along with the
    usual manuscript, and to posting this along with the manuscript on their electronic
    site. Naturally, password protection may be required in some cases, but the implementation
    of such limitations no longer presents problems. Finally, we would like to re-emphasize
    the importance of a careful consideration of the files used by agronomists and
    plant breeders for initial data acquisition and note-taking, and of the value
    of standards that relate both to structure and to coding for such files. We contend
    that careful consideration of these aspects is important to allow for the rapid
    and yet structured addition of new variables at the prime data acquisition point,
    to facilitate data exchange amongst workers, and to simplify the implementation
    and continued maintenance of large agronomic databases, particularly those aiming
    at aggregating information from a wide array of collaborators. Without standardization,
    and without a design that allows for machine reading of the initial files, data
    verification and entry will inevitably become a bottle-neck demanding the time
    and effort of technicians and professionals beyond the reach of most if not all
    programs. The ICASA files represent an important step in the definition of standards
    for widespread use. They may need enhancement in the future, as some have argued
    (e.g. Van Evert, Plant Research International, pers. comm.), to allow for a more
    formal specification of the layout of an experiment, or of the measurements that
    were made. ICASA is taking steps to ensure that procedures are in place to formally
    upgrade its file standard, and will ensure that suggested enhancements are considered
    and introduced in a manner that does not compromise the simplicity and usability
    of the current files. Similarly, it may be necessary to develop a description
    of the files using formal notation. For the present, though, the description and
    demonstration files on the ICASA website (http://www.icasanet.org/) should serve
    for most applications, and these should be used widely by agronomists and plant
    breeders. Acknowledgements Many people have contributed to the development of
    the ICASA file standards, and we thank all of those who have made suggestions
    at one time or another. We particularly wish to thank Mr. D.W.G. Van Kraalingen

    Seasonal agricultural drought monitoring systems, which rely on satellite remote
    sensing and land surface

    models (LSMs), are important for disaster risk reduction and famine early warning.
    These systems require

    the best available weather inputs, as well as a long-term historical record to
    contextualize current

    observations. This article introduces the Famine Early Warning Systems Network
    (FEWS NET) Land Data

    Assimilation System (FLDAS), a custom instance of the NASA Land Information System
    (LIS) framework.

    The FLDAS is routinely used to produce multi-model and multi-forcing estimates
    of hydro-climate states

    and ﬂuxes over semi-arid, food insecure regions of Africa. These modeled data
    and derived products, like

    soil moisture percentiles and water availability, were designed and are currently
    used to complement FEWS

    NET’s operational remotely sensed rainfall, evapotranspiration, and vegetation
    observations. The 30+ years

    of monthly outputs from the FLDAS simulations are publicly available from the
    NASA Goddard Earth

    Science Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) and recommended for use
    in hydroclimate

    studies, early warning applications, and by agro-meteorological scientists in
    Eastern, Southern, and

    Western Africa.

    Background & Summary

    Using rainfall and other meteorological inputs (temperature, humidity, radiation,
    and wind), the Famine

    Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS)
    produces multi-

    model and multi-forcing estimates of hydro-climate conditions such as soil moisture,
    evapotranspiration,

    and runoff. The FLDAS system was created under a NASA Applied Sciences Program
    Water Resources

    grant as a collaboration between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources
    Observation and

    Science (EROS) Center, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), and the University
    of California

    Santa Barbara (UCSB) Climate Hazards Group (CHG). The FLDAS variables are relevant
    to agricultural

    and water resource monitoring and are used to produce indices, like soil moisture
    percentiles, that show

    how current hydrologic extremes compare to conditions observed over the past 30+
    years. Within FEWS

    NET, FLDAS outputs are combined with remotely sensed estimates, ground observations,
    and reports

    from the ﬁeld to identify potential food security crises. FEWS NET reports1,2
    regarding the 2015 Ethiopia

    Drought and 2015–16 Southern Africa drought are examples of this approach. Using
    multiple sources of

    information typiﬁes the FEWS NET ‘convergence of evidence’ framework3 for characterizing
    agricultural

    conditions and providing early warning for food emergencies.

    The ideal gridded land surface model (LSM) dataset for food and water security
    monitoring would be

    (1) driven by a rainfall product that performs well over data sparse food insecure
    regions; (2) available

    over a long historical record and near-real time for contextualizing current events
    and initializing

    forecasts; and (3) useful for both the drought monitoring and hydrological science
    communities by

    providing estimates of land surface states and ﬂuxes that can be used to further
    our understanding of

    drought dynamics and impacts. At present, the Global Land Data Assimilation System
    (GLDAS)4 does

    provide a suite of outputs at 1-month latency over a global domain, but relies
    on global rainfall products

    (speciﬁcally CMAP5 and Princeton6) that have not been optimized for data sparse,
    food insecure regions.

    From the drought monitoring community there are existing efforts like Africa Flood
    and Drought

    Monitor (ADFM)7. There are also global efforts: the Global Integrated Drought
    Monitoring and

    Prediction System (GIDMaPS)8, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Global
    Information

    and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture (GIEWS), and the Global Drought
    Information

    System Portal9. To complement these efforts and better meet the needs of food
    and water security

    monitoring, the FLDAS provides (1) ﬂexible use of different forcing products,
    including FEWS NET

    operational rainfall, (2) multiple land models, (3) routine evaluation, and (4)
    rapid and convenient data

    distribution. By relying on standard FEWS NET rainfall inputs FLDAS maintains
    consistency between

    the different FEWS NET drought metrics. This allows FEWS NET and FEWS NET partners
    to better

    harness the expertise of agro-climate scientists and food security analysts. This
    spatially distributed

    (African, American, and European) team of experts can provide feedback on the
    relationship between

    ﬁeld observed crop conditions, remotely sensed, and modeled hydro-meteorological
    variables.

    FLDAS’s capacity to use different land models, rainfall, and meteorological inputs
    allows FEWS NET

    to bracket model- and forcing-related uncertainty. FLDAS’ provision of physically
    meaningful

    quantitative information (e.g., runoff) can also be used to better characterize
    hydrologic drought and

    water availability. This is important given that water insecurity may often exacerbate
    food insecurity.

    Finally, this dataset (as highlighted in the Usage Notes section) can be used
    in conjunction with remotely

    sensed estimates e.g., evapotranspiration, to make effective characterizations
    of agricultural drought

    conditions and provide routine drought evaluations. An additional feature of the
    FLDAS is that these data

    can be visualized using the Giovanni online tool10 (http://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/)
    or

    downloaded from the NASA Godard Earth Sciences Data and Information Service Center
    (GES DISC),

    allowing researchers to ask questions and explore FLDAS outputs. Subsets of this
    data can also be

    easily compared with other indicators using the Early Warning eXplorer (http://ewx.chg.ucsb.edu:8080/

    EWX/index.html), and downloaded from the USGS FEWS NET Data Portal (http://earlywarning.usgs.

    gov/fews).

    Figure 1 shows the NASA Land Information System (LIS) framework’s11,12 customized
    instance

    of FLDAS with three main components: (1) meteorological and parameter inputs,
    (2) LSMs, and

    (3) post-processing for evaluation, calculation of drought indices, and archiving
    over three domains in

    Africa. Table 1 provides more speciﬁcs about the FLDAS speciﬁcations. In this
    Data Descriptor’s

    Methods section, we explain in detail the FLDAS LSMs and their parameters, meteorological
    inputs,

    FLDAS model conﬁguration and outputs, and LIS software code availability. The
    Data Records section

    provides details about the FLDAS monthly archive and repository. The Technical
    Validation section

    includes FLDAS comparisons with reference rainfall, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration
    datasets.

    We conclude with Usage Notes, which describes the FLDAS data and the interactive
    NASA Giovanni

    data interface, applied in different ways to assess the 2015–16 Southern Africa
    drought.

    Methods

    Most livelihood systems monitored by FEWS NET are based on subsistence agriculture
    and pastoralism,

    and consequently are vulnerable to hydroclimatic extremes, especially drought.
    For this reason, weekly

    assessments of growing season conditions are made using the latest monitoring
    and weather forecast

    products from NASA, USGS, UCSB CHG and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

    (NOAA). Remote sensing estimates of precipitation, vegetation, and snow are operationally
    ingested by

    USGS and UCSB CHG from NASA and NOAA and used to make a variety of information
    products,

    www.nature.com/sdata/

    SCIENTIFIC DATA | 4:170012 | DOI: 10.1038/sdata.2017.12

    including mapped estimates of anomalous precipitation, vegetation, crop water
    satisfaction, soil moisture,

    snow cover, snow water equivalent, runoff, and stream ﬂow. The FLDAS was created
    to help streamline

    and add consistency to this process. It includes the domains, data streams, and
    monitoring requirements

    associated with food security assessment in data-sparse, developing countries
    in Africa. The goal is to

    make more effective use of limited available hydroclimatic observations through
    the LIS framework’s data

    management and modelling capabilities.

    NASA LIS

    The NASA LIS framework is designed for high performance terrestrial hydrologic
    modelling, with

    development led by the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at NASA Goddard Space
    Flight Center (GSFC).

    LIS is structured to enable community sharing, the reuse of modelling tools and
    data resources, and

    promote transitioning the latest Earth science research into operations. Speciﬁcally,
    the LIS framework

    includes the Land Data Toolkit preprocessor, the Land Information System core
    modules, and Land

    Veriﬁcation Toolkit post processor. The LIS framework is the software that underpins
    the FLDAS, and,

    similarly, is used in other successful products like the NASA Global Land Data
    Assimilation System

    (GLDAS)4 and the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS)13. As an
    instance of the

    LIS, FLDAS uses speciﬁc features from each of these components, which we will
    explain in more detail.

    The LSMs in FLDAS require a large suite of time-invariant and climatological land
    surface parameters

    such as vegetation, soils and topography, among others (Table 2). The Land Data
    Toolkit (LDT; http://lis.

    gsfc.nasa.gov/documentation/ldt) is a data pre-processing environment for different
    LSMs that enables

    speciﬁcation of these parameters (Fig. 1).

    Routine evaluation of the FLDAS outputs is conducted using the Land Veriﬁcation
    Toolkit (LVT)14

    (Fig. 1), which supports both direct comparisons of the model outputs against
    independent (ground/

    satellite) measurements and indirect comparisons such as lagged ranked correlation
    of soil moisture

    against vegetation indices15. In addition, LVT also computes metrics of hydrologic
    extremes such as soil

    Figure 1. Schematic of the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land
    Data Assimilation

    System (FLDAS). The Land Data Tool Kit (LDT) is used to pre-process FLDAS landcover
    parameters from the

    IGPB and UMD classiﬁcation derived from the MODIS and AVHRR instruments, respectively.
    If required to

    solve energy balance equations, LDT transforms daily RFE2 and CHIRPS rainfall
    into sub-daily inputs for the

    land surface models. Additional meteorological inputs are from GDAS and MERRA-2.
    FLDAS includes

    Noah3.3, VIC4.1.2 and GeoWRSI models, which are run over three domains in Africa,
    and produce estimates

    of hydrologic states like soil moisture (SM) and ﬂuxes like runoff (RO), evapotranspiration
    (ET) and

    streamﬂow. Model outputs are used as inputs to the Land Veriﬁcation Toolkit (LVT)
    for evaluation or

    generation of drought indices. Evaluation includes remotely sensed ET anomalies
    from the Operational

    Simpliﬁed Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model, soil moisture from the European
    Space Agencies Climate

    Change Initiative (CCI-SMv2.2) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
    (NDVI), as well as in-situ

    observations from the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC). FLDAS routinely computes
    soil moisture

    percentiles, and has capabilities to compute the Standardized Precipitation Index
    (SPI), Standardized Soil

    Water Index (SSWI) and others. Monthly FLDAS outputs are available via the UC
    Santa Barbara Early

    Warning eXplorer (EWX), and different NASA Goddard Earth Science Data and Information
    Services Center

    (GES DISC) interfaces.

    FLDAS land surface models and parameters

    VIC.

    The Variable Inﬁltration Capacity (VIC)16 spatially distributed macroscale hydrology
    model has

    been widely used at global and regional scales and has been demonstrated to accurately
    capture the

    hydrology of different regimes17–19. The inclusion of VIC version 4.1.2 (VIC4.1.2)
    in the FLDAS was

    intended to promote interactions between research and applications. It is the
    main water balance model

    used by the Princeton Africa Flood and Drought Monitor7 and has been introduced
    to FEWS NET for

    seasonal hydrologic forecasting applications20. In contrast to these applications,
    however, FLDAS uses

    VIC4.1.2 in energy and water balance mode. The purpose of this is to better represent
    surface ﬂuxes in

    environments where evapotranspiration (ET) is a greater proportion of rainfall
    than runoff. The water

    balance simulation mode, run at a daily time step, does not solve the energy balance,
    eliminates the

    ground heat ﬂux solution, and assumes that the surface temperature is equal to
    the air temperature. In

    contrast, the energy and water balance simulation mode, run at a sub-daily time
    step, closes the energy

    balance though an iterative process that adjusts surface temperature and surface
    energy ﬂuxes (sensible

    heat, latent heat, ground heat, outgoing long wave radiation) to balance incoming
    radiation. There is a

    comparison of VIC simulation modes for the Rhine River21 and additional explanation
    and comparisons

    can be found as a technical note on the University of Washington VIC website http://www.hydro.

    washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/VIC/Documentation/TechnicalNotes/Modes.shtml.

    Evapotranspiration in VIC4.1.2 (and Noah3.3) includes three components: canopy-intercepted

    evaporation,

    transpiration

    from

    vegetation

    canopies,

    and

    evaporation

    from

    bare

    soil.

    Total

    evapotranspiration is the sum of these components, weighted by respective land
    surface coverage

    fractions.

    In VIC4.1.2, reference ET (RefET) is calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation.
    Canopy

    transpiration is calculated by scaling RefET with canopy resistance. Canopy-intercepted
    evaporation is

    calculated by scaling RefET with the canopy architectural resistance for humidity
    and the aerodynamic

    resistance for heat and water. The bare soil, or direct, evaporation is calculated
    by scaling RefET by

    current soil moisture conditions, wilting point soil moisture, and ﬁeld capacity.

    In VIC4.1.2, the surface runoff is determined by subtracting the precipitation
    and the inﬁltration

    capacity of the top (0–10 cm) soil layer. The subsurface runoff is computed as
    a nonlinear stepwise

    function of excess soil moisture from the bottom soil layer, as ﬁrstly introduced
    in the Arno model

    formulation22.

    VIC4.1.2 parameter inputs (Table 2) include soil textures and bulk density23,
    and soil characteristic

    curve parameters24, monthly climatology leaf area index25, the University of Maryland
    landcover

    classiﬁcation26 from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and

    parameters7,18,27.

    Noah.

    The Noah Land Surface Model28 is a four soil-layer water and energy balance LSM.
    It is a widely

    used model by both operational and research communities. For example, Noah is
    the operational LSM in

    the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) weather, climate
    and data

    assimilation systems and at the US Air Force 557th Weather Wing. There are a number
    of examples

    of Noah being used over different domains in Africa, e.g., West Africa29,30, Volta
    Basin31, East Africa32,33

    and coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for West Africa34
    and Kenya35.

    The FLDAS uses the Noah LSM version 3.3 (ref. 36). Later versions of Noah have
    been implemented in

    LIS and may be used in the future if the model physics, or other features are
    determined to improve water

    and energy balance estimates for FEWS NET domains of interest.

    Like VIC4.1.2, Noah3.3’s total evapotranspiration is the sum of canopy intercepted
    water evaporation,

    transpiration from vegetation canopies, and evaporation from bare soil, weighted
    by respective land

    surface coverage fractions. Different from VIC4.1.2, Noah3.3’s potential evapotranspiration
    (PET) is

    calculated using the Penman approach, which assumes saturated ground surface and
    no canopy

    resistance. Transpiration is calculated by scaling PET with solar radiation, vapor
    pressure deﬁcit, air

    temperature and soil moisture. Evaporation of canopy-intercepted water is calculated
    by scaling PET by

    intercepted canopy water content and the maximum canopy capacity. The bare soil
    evaporation is

    calculated by scaling PET by a factor of current soil moisture availability.

    In Noah3.3, Surface runoff is computed using a two-layer conceptual approach developed
    by Schaake

    et al.37 from the Simple Water Balance (SWB) model. The upper layer is a shallow
    bucket that produces

    surface runoff from excess precipitation when there is no soil moisture deﬁcit.
    Subsurface runoff is

    produced as gravitational drainage from the bottom soil layer, which is calculated
    using Darcy’s equation.

    Global

    Biosphere Project (IGBP)38,39 landcover map from the MODerate resolution Imaging

    Meteorological inputs

    FLDAS models use FEWS NET speciﬁc rainfall products, but also require additional
    meteorological

    inputs (e.g., temperature, humidity, radiation, and wind). To generate low-latency
    products FLDAS uses

    NOAA Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)42 3-hourly meteorological inputs available
    from

    2001-present ato1-day latency. For a longer historical record FLDAS uses NASA’s
    Modern Era

    Reanalysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2)43 (1979-present)
    1-hourly products with

    a two-week latency.

    Rainfall, as mentioned earlier, and described in detail later, is the most important
    input to the FLDAS.

    Temperature is also particularly important for both the water and energy balance.
    MERRA-2 provides a

    long record, sub-daily time step and has been shown to agree well, in terms of
    daily and annual bias

    (0–1 K) with CRU44 temperature estimates43. We compared monthly MERRA-2, GDAS
    and GLDAS

    temperature estimates (2001–2010, not shown) over our Southern, Eastern and Western
    Africa domains

    and found that all three products are well correlated (r >0.7). However, GDAS
    has a noticeable low bias

    (about 1 K) until ~2007 compared to MERRA-2 and GLDAS temperature ﬁelds. From
    2007-present,

    MERRA-2 and GDAS temperatures continue to be well correlated and have a similar
    mean.

    RFE2.

    The African Rainfall Estimation version 2.0 (refs 5,45) (RFE2) rainfall product
    is from the

    NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC). RFE2 is derived from satellite (infrared
    and microwave)

    observations and blended with World Meteorological Organization Global Telecommunication
    Stations

    (GTS) data. It is available from 2000 to present at 0.1° latitude/longitude (approximately
    10 km2) at a

    1-day latency (Table 3). Examples of RFE2 evaluation have been conducted for Burkina
    Faso46,

    Western Africa47–49, Mozambique50, the Nile Basin51, and Eastern and Southern
    Africa52,53. In addition

    to research applications, FEWS NET analysts use RFE2 operationally to track weather
    hazards on a

    weekly basis. More information is available at the CPC International Desk website
    under ‘Africa’

    (http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/international/africa/africa.shtml).

    CHIRPS.

    The Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS)54 dataset
    is an

    IR-station blended rainfall product that has been bias-corrected with monthly
    station climatologies, i.e.,

    CHPclim55. CHIRPS is available at the daily, pentadal (~5-day), dekadal (~10-day),
    and monthly time

    step, quasi-global (60S-60N), 0.05 degrees spatial resolution (Table 3) designed
    for drought monitoring.

    CHIRPS is released about 2-weeks after then end of the previous month (i.e., August
    1–31 daily CHIRPS

    is available on September 15th). CHIRPS has been evaluated for Burkina Faso46,
    Mozambique50, the Nile

    Basin51, and continental Africa54. On-going evaluations can be found at the UCSB
    Climate Hazards

    Group website (http://chg.ucsb.edu).

    Sub-daily disaggregation of rainfall

    For agricultural drought monitoring applications daily, dekadal, and monthly rainfall
    totals are favoured

    by decision makers56. In contrast, the LSMs that solve both the energy and water
    balance are run at

    hourly or ﬁner time steps (e.g., Noah3.3 at 30-minutes and VIC4.1.2 at 1-hour),
    requiring sub-daily

    rainfall inputs. To meet the needs of these LSMs, we developed a new module using
    the Land Data

    Toolkit (LDT) pre-processor to temporally disaggregate the daily RFE2 and CHIRPS
    rainfall, using an

    approach similar to the North American LDAS (NLDAS) precipitation downscaling
    method57. For this

    approach, we assume that the ﬁner timescale, reference dataset, e.g., 3-hourly
    GDAS precipitation,

    represents an accurate diurnal cycle. First we derive sub-daily (e.g., 3-hourly)
    disaggregation weights that

    represent the proportion of the 24-hour total precipitation that fell during the
    sub-daily period. If the

    total is zero in a area of non-zero precipitation then uniform weighting spreads
    precipitation evenly

    throughout the day. The daily rainfall is then multiplied by the weights to arrive
    at the temporally

    disaggregated ﬁelds. Since the reference dataset is only used to derive the disaggregation
    weights the daily

    summation preserves the total from the daily rainfall product. This new sub-daily
    time series is then used

    as the ﬁnal FLDAS precipitation input. Future work, particularly that involves
    higher spatial and

    temporal applications of FLDAS outputs, should explore the accuracy of the sub-daily
    rainfall

    distribution of a reference dataset.

    FLDAS model conﬁguration and outputs

    Meteorological inputs provided in their native resolution often do not match the
    spatial and temporal

    resolution of other datasets, or the resolution at which the user wishes to run
    the model. One of the

    important features of the LIS framework is its ability to match spatial and temporal
    grids at runtime. We

    have speciﬁed the LIS model spatial resolution to match the 0.1° × 0.1° RFE2 and
    CHIRPS rainfall inputs.

    However, the MERRA-2 has horizontal resolution of 0.5° latitude × 0.625° longitude,
    and the GDAS grid

    varies over time and is currently at approximately 0.2° (Table 3). We have chosen
    a bilinear interpolation

    option in LIS to spatially downscale non-precipitation ﬁelds. Using the method
    developed by the

    NLDAS57, the Noah-GDAS experiments have an environmental lapse-rate correction
    applied to surface

    pressure, humidity and downward longwave radiation. At the time of writing, VIC4.1.2
    and MERRA-2

    experiments did not have this capability. While this introduces some error, the
    implications for the 0.1

    degree Africa domain are relatively minor compared to regions with steep topography
    and ﬁner spatial

    resolution. Future versions of the VIC-GDAS and Noah-MERRA-2 experiments will
    include the

    topographic adjustment. All of the sub-daily inputs are linearly interpolated
    to 30-minute and 1-hour

    model timesteps for Noah3.3 and VIC4.1.2, respectively. Table 4 lists the routine
    FLDAS outputs and

    their units. At the time of writing, both FLDAS_A (RFE2+GDAS; Data Citation 1–6)
    and FLDAS_C

    (CHIRPS+MERRA-2; Data Citation 7–11 and Data Citation 12) outputs are updated
    on the NASA GES

    DISC once a month (see Data Records).

    Soil moisture percentiles

    Soil moisture percentiles are indicators of deﬁcits or excesses of land moisture
    states relative to historical

    distributions. The percentiles are calculated using the Land Veriﬁcation Toolkit
    (LVT)14 using soil

    moisture outputs from Noah3.3 and VIC4.1.2 simulations. First, the soil moisture

    Technical Validation

    Development of high quality hydro-meteorological data sets and conducting evaluations
    of these datasets

    is inherently challenging over data sparse regions. Product development continues
    to improve through

    improved sensors, algorithms and data fusion efforts. For product evaluation FEWS
    NET relies on a

    convergence of evidence approach—the use of multiple inputs, and by transforming
    rainfall inputs into

    estimates of, for example, soil moisture and evapotranspiration. With that, we
    are increasing the

    opportunities for comparison with other products like remotely sensed microwave
    soil moisture and

    remotely sensed thermal-ET. Evaluation is an on-going process as new products
    are developed, and

    different applications require different metrics—e.g., some products may be better
    for drought

    monitoring, while others for ﬂood forecasting.

    Rainfall input evaluation

    In addition to the precipitation evaluations mentioned previously (Methods; Meteorological
    Inputs), we

    compare here RFE2 and CHIRPS (2001–2010) to a reference dataset: the Global Precipitation

    Climatology Centre (GPCC) gridded monthly station product59,60.

    Following the methods in Funk et al.54, metrics are computed on a per-pixel basis
    for the rainy-season

    (deﬁned as the three-wettest months). Using GPCC as the reference dataset, we
    computed the

    Pearson correlation coefﬁcient61, bias ratio (Bias = Σ Input_rainfall/ΣGPCC) and
    mean absolute error

    (MAE = (1/N Σ|(Input_rainfall—GPCC)|)). Figure 2a,b show similar spatial patterns
    and magnitude for

    CHIRPS and RFE’s correlation with GPCC. RFE2 has higher correlations in southern
    and western Africa,

    while CHIRPS shows higher correlations in Ethiopia. Figure 2c,d show bias ratio,
    with CHIRPS tending

    to have a neutral or wet bias compared to GPCC, while RFE2 has a dry bias over
    eastern Africa and a wet

    bias over parts of the Sahel. Figure 2e,f show similar patterns in mean absolute
    error (mm per 3-month

    accumulation), with CHIRPS having less error in Ethiopia, and parts of Kenya,
    Tanzania, Mozambique,

    Zambia, and Niger. While RFE2 has less error in eastern South Africa and Zimbabwe,
    correlations tend to

    be lower over the humid forests of central Africa, which is important for broader
    applications, but this is

    not a domain included in routine FEWS NET drought monitoring. This lower correlation
    may be due to

    CHIRPS being an IR-only (no routine microwave inputs) product, a necessary prerequisite
    for its long

    period of record. The ﬁxed cloud detection threshold used in the CHIRPS might
    be another factor,

    resulting in poor detection of warm rainfall events in humid areas of the tropics
    and sub-tropics.

    Soil moisture and evapotranspiration validation results

    We compared monthly estimates of FLDAS-simulated soil moisture and evapotranspiration
    to equivalent

    remotely sensed observations using pixel-wise anomaly correlation.

    For the soil moisture comparison we used the European Space Agency’s Climate Change
    Initiative soil

    moisture version 2.2 (CCI-SMv2.2)62–64, which is a merged passive and active microwave
    estimate of

    near-surface soil moisture (1979–2015). In general, we ﬁnd that soil moisture
    estimates derived from

    CHIRPS (using either Noah3.3 or VIC4.1.2) have higher monthly anomaly correlation
    with CCI-SMv2.2

    than those derived from RFE2 rainfall inputs. The reason for this will require
    further research, but we

    hypothesize that the cause is related to the use of country-speciﬁc station data
    for bias correction in

    CHIRPS while no such station data is used in RFE2. We also found that Noah3.3
    soil moisture has higher

    correlations with CCI-SMv2.2 than that of VIC4.1.2. These results are consistent
    with previous work over

    East Africa by McNally et al.65, and work comparing Noah and VIC in the U.S. (ref.
    66). We also

    stratiﬁed correlations by vegetation type, and found particularly low correlations
    in pixels classiﬁed as

    permanent wetland. This can be attributed to microwave soil moisture retrievals’
    ability to detect

    persistent wetness, while wetlands are not represented in FLDAS models. Figure
    3a–c show anomaly

    correlations between monthly Noah3.3+CHIRPS+MERRA-2 soil moisture (0–10 cm) and
    CCI-SMv2.2

    soil moisture for the years 1992–2015. We used this time period based on analysis
    performed in East

    Africa by McNally et al.65 Considering all months (Jan-Dec) Eastern and Southern
    Africa are well

    correlated (r > 0.5) while correlation is less (r = 0.3–0.5) in Western Africa.
    We found that the modeled

    and observed seasonal cycles (start of season, peak, recession) were sometimes
    out-of-phase, likely because,

    as other studies have found, the default Noah LSM soil parameterization is not
    optimal for representing

    runoff and soil moisture dynamics in West Africa34. Data users should note that
    we found improved

    correlations when the analysis is conducted on individual months, particularly
    during the rainy season.

    For ET evaluations we used ET anomaly estimates from the Operational Simpliﬁed
    Surface Energy

    Balance67 (SSEBop) model. The SSEBop product provides percent of normal (PON)
    ET anomalies using a

    2003–2013 baseline and is updated once a month, which is important for routine
    comparisons with

    FLDAS. Using the same 10-year baseline, we computed the PON for each month with
    the FLDAS ET

    products and then performed pixel-wise anomaly correlation. We show anomaly correlations
    of the

    Noah3.3+CHIRPS+MERRA-2 estimated ET. There are moderate correlations (r = 0.4–0.75)
    in East

    and (c) Western Africa

    domains. Regions with no vegetation are masked in the FLDAS estimates, and regions
    with dense vegetation

    are masked in the CCI-SMv2.2.

    Africa (Fig. 4a) and Southern Africa (Fig. 4b), however, in West Africa correlations
    between these two

    products were relatively low (ro0.5) (Fig. 4c). Similar correlations were found
    with VIC ET anomalies.

    For further investigation we computed 1-month lagged rank correlation of FLDAS
    ET’s and MODIS

    NDVI (not shown) and found high correlations (r > 0.7) for vegetated pixels. Inspection
    of the SSEBop

    time series at sparsely vegetated pixels in Niger and Senegal showed ‘jumpy’ behaviour
    (e.g., long periods

    at 100% of normal with spikes to 250%), suggesting that energy balance characteristics
    of parts of the

    West Africa domain may result in instability of SSEBop PON algorithm. Similar
    to the soil moisture

    comparisons, correlations for individual months tended to be higher during the
    rainy season

    (not shown). Additional investigation is needed to further explain the contribution
    of both the LSM

    model physics and SSEBop datasets to low correlations in West Africa.

    compute a variety of drought indicators make FLDAS suitable for assessing agricultural
    and hydrologic

    drought conditions. We demonstrate how FLDAS can be used to support humanitarian
    relief efforts and

    put current water availability conditions in historic context. Southern Africa
    is known to be vulnerable to

    El Niño-induced hot and dry conditions68. Two consecutive dry years are threatening
    hydropower and

    irrigation schemes that have been critical for advancing development in the region69.
    CHIRPS rainfall and

    FLDAS-derived estimates of water availability anomalies have been used to illustrate
    the extent and

    severity of the Southern Africa 2015–16 drought1. In this sample application of
    FLDAS we

    i) compare how remotely sensed and modeled ET anomalies represent the extent of
    the drought in

    February 2016; ii) compare the FEWS NET operational drought index with soil moisture
    percentiles

    derived from FLDAS; iii) show how FLDAS experiments represent water availability
    over short and long

    time scales; and iv) show how FLDAS outputs can be accessed via GIOVANNI for user-friendly
    data

    interaction.

    Context—2015–2016 Southern Africa drought

    Southern Africa relies on agriculture for food and income and reservoirs for hydropower
    production,

    municipal water supplies, and irrigation. The strong El Niño conditions in 2015
    resulted in a late start to

    the Southern Africa rainy season, high temperatures, and below average rainfall
    totals. These severe

    drought conditions across the region negatively impacted crop and pasture growth1.
    While not an El

    Niño year, the 2014–15 season was characterized by anomalous dryness with low
    seasonal rainfall totals

    that negatively impacted crop growth and reservoir storage70.

    Comparison with operational ET estimates

    First, we compare SSEBop and FLDAS ET anomalies (Data Citation 8) for February
    2016 (Fig. 5). The

    broad spatial patterns from the two products agree in the extent and severity
    of the dry conditions. Both

    ET anomaly estimates show strong ET deﬁcits in central South Africa, Swaziland,
    Lesotho, southern

    Mozambique, southern Madagascar, south east Zambia, and western Botswana. Both
    estimates also show

    normal or above normal ET in Northern Mozambique, Tanzania, and southern Kenya.
    Given that these

    ET anomalies are derived from independent estimates, analysts can have conﬁdence
    in the direction of

    the anomaly in locations where the products agree, consistent with FEWS NET’s
    convergence of evidence

    approach. However, the two estimates do not agree in all locations. Eastern Botswana,
    for example, is a

    crop-growing region where SSEBop shows strong deﬁcits while FLDAS ET shows positive
    anomalies. In

    this case, analysts would consider additional sources of evidence, like NDVI,
    rainfall totals, and ﬁeld

    reports. For example, the GEOGLAM Early Warning Crop Monitor, which convenes international

    experts to discuss different data sources, concluded in a February report that
    sorghum growing

    conditions were poor in Eastern Botswana71. Positive anomalies in FLDAS ET could
    be attributed to

    errors in rainfall inputs, or the ET parameterization’s relative lack of sensitivity
    to temperature inputs.

    Future work could use both of these datasets to explore the relative roles of
    temperature and rainfall in

    drought.

    Rainfall derived agricultural drought indicators

    We next show two agricultural drought indictors, derived from rainfall, that provide
    insight into the

    overall performance of the 2015/16 growing season. First, 2016 End-of-Season (EOS)
    Water Requirement

    Satisfaction Index (WRSI) (Fig. 6a), computed with CHIRPS rainfall and USGS EROS
    reference ET72,

    where actual ET was consistently less than reference ET, indicating that there
    was widespread failure or

    no start of season across Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Southern Mozambique.
    The late or

    complete lack of start to the rainy season was anticipated to (and did) have severe
    negative consequences

    for agricultural outcomes70. Figure 6b is a drought classiﬁcation based on February
    Noah3.3+CHIRPS

    +MERRA-2 (Data Citation 8) soil moisture percentiles (0–10 cm). The soil moisture
    percentiles do

    indicate widespread negative moisture anomalies with some pockets of extreme drought
    in eastern South

    Water Requirement

    Satisfaction Index (WRSI) anomalies and (b) drought classiﬁcation based on February

    percentile values. WRSI is the seasonal ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration,
    and was computed with

    CHIRPS rainfall and USGS EROS reference ET derived from GDAS parameters. (b) Drought
    classiﬁcation

    based on February soil moisture percentile values computed from Noah33+CHIRPS+MERRA-2

    drought is 20–30th

    percentile, abnormally dry is 30–45th percentile, normal is > the 45th percentile.

    aggregation. Much of Southern Africa has been experiencing below average moisture
    conditions for at least

    2 years, which is impacting reservoir water supplies.

    Africa, southern Madagascar, Swaziland, and southern Malawi. February soil moisture
    percentiles,

    however, also reﬂect that Southern Africa monthly rainfall totals were average
    for January and February.

    The EOS WRSI metric, on the other hand, is designed to reﬂect deﬁcits during critical
    periods, like the

    crop sowing period in December, which was very dry. These differences in the seasonal
    representation

    explain why the EOS WRSI and February soil moisture percentiles show different
    spatial patterns, despite

    being driven by the same rainfall inputs.

    Water availability

    To characterize water availability during the Southern Africa 2015–16 drought
    we compute the

    Standardized Runoff Index (SRI)73 with FLDAS runoff. The SRI is calculated by
    ﬁrst ﬁtting a gamma

    distribution to a given historical time series of runoff (the historical time
    series at each pixel). Probability

    values are then calculated from the gamma distribution function for each value
    in the time series. Finally,

    the SRI for each probability value is computed (using SciPy stats.norm.ppf) as
    the inverse cumulative

    distribution function of a standard normal distribution. The SRI values obtained
    will approximately have

    zero mean and unit standard deviation. The one-month SRI-1 considers conditions
    of the current month

    (April 2016) while the 24-month SRI categorizes conditions for the current and
    previous 23 months. The

    map of one-month SRI (Fig. 7a) indicates that runoff is 0.5 to 3 deviations below
    average across much of

    the domain. The one-month time scale is relevant to the growing season of a rainfed
    crop and has a

    spatial pattern as similar to the evapotranspiration anomalies, drought classiﬁcation
    based on soil

    moisture percentiles, and the WRSI. Water supply reservoirs, on the other hand,
    are designed to store

    water between rainy seasons to provide stable supply for different uses such as
    irrigation, hydropower,

    and municipal uses like drinking and sanitation. A longer-term index is more appropriate
    for

    characterizing how these needs may be impacted by (hydrological) drought. The
    24-month SRI (Fig. 7b)

    shows that water reserves were likely impacted in Lesotho, Swaziland, South Africa,
    central and northern

    Lake Kariba

    Maputo Basin

    and

    and Zimbabwe. (b) SRI-24

    averaged over Maputo Basin. The SRI-24 computed from Noah3.3 and VIC4.1.2 CHIRPS+MERRA-2
    runoff

    show that 2015 is at or near record low levels experienced in 2004–05 and 1994–95.
    The RFE2+GDAS forced

    runs also shows low runoff in 2015 despite its relatively short record (2001-present)
    with respect to the

    24-month integration period.

    Mozambique, as well as Malawi and Zimbabwe. This interpretation of the SRI-24
    corresponds well with

    reported74 extremely low reservoir levels across the region.

    Time series of SRI-24, spatially averaged over the Zambezi basin above the Kariba
    reservoir (Fig. 8a)

    (west of 28.76 E) and the Maputo Basin, shared by Swaziland, South Africa and
    Mozambique (Fig. 8b),

    further demonstrates that 2015–16 ranks as one of the lowest runoff years in the
    past 30 years,

    comparable to severe droughts in 1994–95 and 2004–05. These time series also demonstrate
    the utility of

    FLDAS multiple-model and multiple-forcing features. In general the Noah3.3 and
    VIC4.1.2 runoff

    generated from the same forcings strongly agree (Fig. 8a,b) suggesting, for relative
    comparisons of runoff

    based drought indicators in this region, that model differences contribute negligible
    uncertainty.

    However, differences in the forcings, can result in considerable differences in
    SRI both from contributing

    data (e.g., CHIRPS has more ground observations and bias correction, RFE2 includes
    microwave

    visualize drought conditions during December of years from 1982–2015. For the
    domain selected, 2015 had the

    combined hottest and driest conditions on record. 2007 had the combined coolest
    and wettest conditions.

    retrievals) as well as the length of the record. For example, the RFE2+GDAS record
    does not include the

    1994–95 drought. Caution should also be used with aggregating over 24-months with
    the relatively short

    2001–2016 record. With respect to forcing data, continued evaluation, e.g., with
    respect to streamﬂow

    observations, can provide information regarding the accuracy of the input datasets.

    Data visualization with NASA’s Giovanni

    The NASA GES DISC provides tools for data exploration and visualization through
    the Giovanni

    interface (Fig. 9a). This allows users to explore the data before downloading
    and analysing on their own

    machines. This example selects rainfall and air temperature from a domain in Southern
    Africa (Fig. 9b)

    that was impacted by the 2015–16 drought. We selected a spatial average and time
    series of December

    conditions from 1982–2015. Plots can be generated and downloaded as image ﬁles
    (for example, .png,

    .jpeg, or .pdf) for individual variables, or the data from the plot can be downloaded
    and imported into a

    program of the user’s choice. Figure 10 shows a drought index (rainfall—temperature)
    plotted in rank

    order to visualize agrometerological conditions during the critical month of December
    (1982–2015). 2015

    had the combined hottest and driest conditions on record, while 2007 had the combined
    coolest and

    wettest conditions.

    Summary

    The FLDAS dataset presented here has been designed for drought monitoring in Africa
    where it is

    essential to (1) compare different modelled and remotely sensed datasets for accurate
    characterization of

    droughts, and (2) place current conditions in historical context for humanitarian
    decision support. While

    similar to other global land modelling or Africa drought monitoring systems, the
    FLDAS uses operational

    (RFE2) and research (CHIRPS) FEWS NET precipitation products to provide both low
    latency and

    research quality estimates, respectively. Meanwhile, choice of evaluation methods
    and derived drought

    indices are guided by the needs of food and water security analysts. Moreover,
    being an instance of the

    NASA LIS framework affords the potential to leverage other hydrological research
    and software

    development projects. In particular, soil moisture data assimilation and seasonal
    forecasting capabilities

    are being developed for several LIS-based projects that may beneﬁt FLDAS in the
    future. While

    improvements to FLDAS are already being made, e.g., improved latency to better
    track conditions as they

    are evolving, the current data products are well suited for characterizing the
    spatial extent and providing

    historical context to drought conditions.

    impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) in the agricultural field is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation
    has large potentialities to provide benefits for both producers and consumers;
    on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
    several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research
    activities, in the form of both research projects and scientific literature, with
    the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations,
    and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus
    on the EU territory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing
    and upcoming solutions to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next

    of ICT to agriculture. Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support
    efficient production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners,
    private and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging
    the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the ground. According
    to the European Union (EU), the most relevant technologies and techniques to be
    fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the use of agricultural robots, a larger
    use of sensor nodes to collect data, and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation. Those indications are contained
    into the declaration of cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future
    for European agriculture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
    According to the aforementioned declaration, the first obstacle towards a full
    implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connectivity, i.e., digital
    divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a situation in rural and
    low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must be still taken into account,
    as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging,
    not being covered by any Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end
    of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be
    identified towards the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary
    case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural European
    Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to close the gap between
    scientific knowledge and practitioners, in order to promote concrete solutions
    to be implemented. A solution can be defined as anything that makes the farming
    practice more controlled and accurate through ICT, reducing both the costs and
    the environmental impact, while also increasing the production. SF has the potential
    to also improve work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture
    [1], but its socio-economic implications are debated [4]. In this innovative approach
    of farm management, a key component is the use of hardware and software technologies,
    like the deploying of sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for
    imagery and positioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial
    and aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
    agriculture, but in making the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and
    of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle
    of the 80’s, but it has been practiced commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However,
    many farmers are still skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This
    can be explained by considering the profit and the direct benefits for the farm.
    In fact, it is not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering
    Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery,
    and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits
    only large holdings, both in crop and livestock production. This is linked to
    the perception of high costs and complexity of the involved technologies. What
    is lacking from this image is the possibility that innovative technologies might
    not be only large-scale and thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus
    small and cheap [7]. Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
    advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than business models
    for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable
    costs for farmers, also providing support services. Such an initiative can be
    categorised as cooperative farming, potentially increasing the penetration of
    SF in low-income areas. Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services
    and hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott
    sells a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
    services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging real-time
    data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be exploited through on-line
    services, like those provided by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available
    data can be accessed and fed to different management systems, thus offering a
    valuable repository for farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite
    imagery joint with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision
    Support System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides
    a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support services on top
    of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete
    robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to harvest, with a hydroponic system
    able to strongly reduce the water consumption. At last, traceability is experiencing
    a revolution thanks to digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately
    within the umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
    remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is betting
    on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers and intermediate
    actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm trading platform as well,
    highlighting how innovative paradigms can be adapted to different use cases in
    the agricultural field. The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives
    and scientific literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
    techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss
    still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of this work is structured
    as follows: Section 2 surveys research and innovation projects covering SF activities
    in the EU territory, then the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account
    the state of the art in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open
    challenges at today, considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally,
    Section 4 draws the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the
    art This section provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section
    2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the EU in the field
    of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention towards those activities,
    and then to identify the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of
    surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations
    as faced by the described research projects, and the technological solutions exploited
    in the latter ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific
    works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an
    overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2.

    2. Number of occurrences of relevant keywords (at least 50) as they appear in
    the surveyed literature: the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read
    internally, and each keyword is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs
    to. 2.1. EU research projects In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking
    R&I activities laying the ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting
    data-empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to support
    the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions and to sustain
    the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table
    1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects,
    spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies
    in this field; the 9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have
    the complementary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
    for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces
    to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple
    techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones.
    2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects
    that are related to monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability,
    soil moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with
    respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a more established
    option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management
    system for a sustainable and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply
    in Europe. The APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural
    management based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that
    provides farmers valuable, actionable and real-time recommendations for driving
    down costs and improving crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs
    as well, aiming at surveying a field from the air, then at performing a targeted
    intervention on the ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea
    is to provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applications.
    The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation.
    The AfriCultuReS project, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits
    the data collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
    to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based
    on remote sensing, to support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive
    use of big data techniques related to the raw material production from agriculture,
    forestry, fishery and aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials
    in a sustainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
    Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the
    just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers
    to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed
    to offer agricultural knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging
    several techniques. The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques
    in the context of viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis
    of large, diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use
    of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
    the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital technologies:
    in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in order to secure
    sufficient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening competitiveness of farming
    and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020
    to develop and test specific technological solutions in the following sectors:
    arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use
    of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned
    Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by
    taking advantage of the technological advancements in the fields of robotics,
    remote sensing and big data management, aims at designing an integrated system
    where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial robots)
    move within the orchards to collect data and perform common farming operations.
    The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to harvest sweet peppers in
    greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques to acquire both colour and
    distance information, and then storing collected peppers in an on-board container.
    Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
    reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also acquire
    detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by providing information
    at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed and built a satellite-guided
    autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite
    services to navigate, achieving good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses.
    The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques.
    The proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming robots
    that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural systems
    to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality. This platform is integrated
    with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring and decision-making
    solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered
    on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
    applying operational research to optimise farm production. 2.1.3. Satellite-based
    activities Several projects are mainly based on improving the information derived
    from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at delivering innovative
    algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops
    an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
    services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services to
    farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application of water, fertilizer
    and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave data obtained from different
    satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key information about water availability
    for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
    to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface soil
    moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE
    project provides soil moisture maps to decision makers in water management using
    GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites and UAVs. The project has developed
    a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project
    brings PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making extensive
    use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help farmers to make better
    decisions by monitoring the growth and health of crops, providing advice on when
    to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating the size of their harvest. The
    services are designed to be always available thanks to a web platform and a mobile
    application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other research projects are mainly
    focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their
    needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative
    sets up a self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
    effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the farming community,
    disseminating direct applicable research and commercial solutions, and capturing
    grassroots level needs and innovative ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy
    Decision For Farmers) focuses on the benefits provided by sensors in monitoring
    animals and environment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large
    repository of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
    brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28
    flagship innovation experiments for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable
    farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2
    is to strengthen the research within the area of PF and to develop a common research
    agenda concerning ICT and robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives
    are: mapping and analysis of existing research and future needs; development of
    instruments and procedures for transnational funding activities; development of
    strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations
    and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting
    up thematic networks with the objective of promote networking activities, data
    sharing and knowledge exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available
    ICT tools to promote their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to
    practitioners’ needs. The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect
    practitioners’ needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design
    ICT use cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
    fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives,
    in order to build a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally,
    FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and
    EO services. It launches a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using
    satellite technologies for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some
    considerations can be made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today,
    leveraging local and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up
    to satellites. Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned
    vehicles enable semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a
    major objective for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost
    all surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in
    fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives
    to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting
    automatic actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning
    techniques are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects
    we considered, such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise
    livestock production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents
    the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods,
    and techniques with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice
    in this sector. SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing
    [9], involving different hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused
    approaches have gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very
    recent and exemplary subset of the scientific literature on such a topic, then
    schematised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in recent
    scientific literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to
    the four thematic clusters we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted
    in its cluster according to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical
    application scenarios and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].

    techniques and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect
    data on the environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in
    the case of agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement
    data collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally,
    indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are
    used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index,
    the LAI, and so on. Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources
    in this context [12], the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers
    a valuable perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
    considered: the first two ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop
    management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil mapping, while the
    latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual
    approach versus a clustered one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing,
    came later, consisting in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors.
    It can be considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
    satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing
    spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data
    sources, increasing complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage
    of raw data and of subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13].
    2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning
    are key concepts towards automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards
    a larger use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
    minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can operate in
    fleets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems
    rely on GNSS techniques for precise positioning, and PF applications need large
    accuracy. Several commercial systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or
    more fixed Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing
    accuracy up to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
    machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to the technology
    and the scenario under consideration, specific spectral signatures are of interest,
    as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both local and remote sensing. Commercial
    devices, to be used on board, already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery
    (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than
    terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionising the practices in this
    sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with several commercial systems
    able to fly at different speeds and altitudes [24], ranging from fixed to rotary
    wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide
    spraying, which is a key application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be
    used for such a purpose in the case of large fields, jointly with multispectral
    techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
    where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention in the
    last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has been subject
    to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15] consider the use
    of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of satellites. In fact,
    according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites cannot classify the
    roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of UAVs. A RGB camera has been
    used for data collection and a visual assessment, and collected georeferenced
    data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means
    of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The
    proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
    RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used because
    of the richer information it provides. By combining these results with geometric
    features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping plants.
    NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well: in
    fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can be
    discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest

    Abstract

    Ecosystem Services (ES) are an established conceptual framework for attributing
    value to the benefits that nature provides

    to humans. As the promise of robust ES-driven management is put to the test, shortcomings
    in our ability to accurately

    measure, map, and value ES have surfaced. On the research side, mainstream methods
    for ES assessment still fall short of

    addressing the complex, multi-scale biophysical and socioeconomic dynamics inherent
    in ES provision, flow, and use. On

    the practitioner side, application of methods remains onerous due to data and
    model parameterization requirements.

    Further, it is increasingly clear that the dominant ‘‘one model fits all’’ paradigm
    is often ill-suited to address the diversity of

    real-world management situations that exist across the broad spectrum of coupled
    human-natural systems. This article

    introduces an integrated ES modeling methodology, named ARIES (ARtificial Intelligence
    for Ecosystem Services), which

    aims to introduce improvements on these fronts. To improve conceptual detail and
    representation of ES dynamics, it adopts

    a uniform conceptualization of ES that gives equal emphasis to their production,
    flow and use by society, while keeping

    model complexity low enough to enable rapid and inexpensive assessment in many
    contexts and for multiple services. To

    improve fit to diverse application contexts, the methodology is assisted by model
    integration technologies that allow

    assembly of customized models from a growing model base. By using computer learning
    and reasoning, model structure

    may be specialized for each application context without requiring costly expertise.
    In this article we discuss the founding

    principles of ARIES - both its innovative aspects for ES science and as an example
    of a new strategy to support more

    accurate decision making in diverse application contexts.

    Introduction

    The advantages of an ecosystem services (ES) view of coupled

    human-natural systems have been widely recognized in science,

    management and governance [1]. Focusing on both the biophys-

    ical mechanisms of ES provision and the socioeconomic implica-

    tions of their use can allow decision makers to directly link natural

    capital to the societies and economies that depend on it. An ES

    approach can also facilitate understanding and communication of

    the projected consequences of resource competition in the face of

    scarcity as well as global and local change. Once discussions on ES

    became mainstream - thanks largely to the seminal Millennium

    Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) [2] - and lessons from many

    individual case studies were learned [3], a first generation of

    integrated, multi-ES assessment methodologies and tools has been

    striving to meet the needs of an audience that cuts across the

    academic, governmental, NGO, and corporate sectors [4,5].

    Rapid assessment methods have come to command wide interest

    from all these communities [5]. Yet it is generally recognized that

    systematic use of ES in decision- and policy-making requires a

    degree of accuracy that is rarely met in practice [6,7]. Most early

    assessment studies [8,9] and some recent methods [1,10] infer ES

    values through production functions whose driving input is land

    cover type, alone or complemented by limited other structural

    information (e.g., vegetation type). Other methods [3] have

    proposed models of a more functional nature to more accurately

    represent the mechanistic underpinnings of ES dynamics [11–14].

    Much less well explored remain the issues of non-linearity,

    incongruent scales of provision and use, thresholds, feedbacks and

    tipping points [15,16] in and between the ecological and social

    systems that define ES dynamics [17–19]. In practice, both

    ecological and social sciences have struggled to understand and

    predict changes in large and complex dynamic systems [18–20].

    Even with adequate methodologies, the specificity and cost of

    assessments increase quickly with model sophistication [10], due to

    the need for both domain expertise and accurate time-series data

    for model calibration and parameterization. This makes detailed

    ES quantification impractical in most institutional contexts,

    particularly since decision making requires timely analysis [21].

    Applications are further complicated by the need for true

    interdisciplinarity to link the underlying science and policy sides

    of ES and to communicate results effectively across institutional

    and societal boundaries. Indeed, effective translation to policy is

    often as challenging as the search for suitable quantification

    methods.

    Despite these difficulties, better consideration of the dynamic

    aspects of ES provision is needed to understand the consequences

    of policy decisions impacting ES [7,11,12,22]. Overlooking

    temporal dynamics and spatial modes of service delivery to users

    makes it difficult to understand and communicate actual values of

    ES accrued by societies; instead, potential values are commonly

    estimated (e.g., the amount of floodwater potentially retained by

    green infrastructure instead of the amount of water actually

    prevented from impacting flood-prone people and property). This

    issue may be at the source of common criticisms of overstatement

    of value [23] and of a subsequent lack of confidence in ES-

    informed policy.

    Reconciling calls for simplicity and intuitiveness with the need

    for accuracy, specificity and dynamic resolution is challenging and

    risky. If on one hand decision makers (or even the scientific

    community) are skeptical of methods they see as complex and

    opaque, on the other hand the oversimplification of complex and

    highly diverse processes and trade-offs may yield ineffective

    assessments. True methodological innovation could result from

    incorporating enough flexibility to adapt models to diverse social,

    economic, and policy contexts without overly complicating their

    application. A previously published set of evaluative criteria for ES

    methods (Table 1, modified from [24]) enumerates characteristics

    that we believe crucial to wider consideration of ES in public- and

    private-sector decision making. ES assessment studies in the recent

    literature have begun to address these criteria, for example

    accounting for spatial aspects of ES dynamics [7,12] and

    attempting to quantify uncertainty, e.g., using Bayesian techniques

    [25,26]. Only a few of these advances have made their way into

    user-ready ‘‘tools’’ for decision-making [14,21,27]. The method-

    ology proposed in this article aims to consolidate these principles

    by providing them with a systematic scientific foundation, so that

    technologies can be designed that improve their accessibility to

    decision makers.

    The effort described in the next sections was structured around

    a set of core goals. We strived first of all to improve the ES

    narrative so that services are consistently quantified from the

    viewpoint of their beneficiaries. This approach emphasizes the

    spatial dynamics of ES flow and use by beneficiary groups, thereby

    distinguishing between potential ES values and actually accrued

    ones. We also aimed to explicitly quantify uncertainty by modeling

    ES supply and demand probabilistically when appropriate. To

    reduce the burden of data gathering and pre-processing for the

    end-user, we prioritized automatic retrieval of input data from

    web-accessible datasets using open standards wherever possible.

    Finally, we devised ecoinformatics advances that support more

    flexible, computer-aided model assembly, including the option of

    transparent integration with pre-existing process models (e.g., for

    hydrology or nutrient dynamics) when needed input data are

    available and in contexts where these models have proven their

    effectiveness. The rest of this article discusses the first results of the

    6-year, multi-investigator effort that grew from these initial goals,

    by addressing in each following section:

    The ARIES Methodology

    The ARIES (ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services)

    methodology has been in development since 2007 and in use,

    through case studies using prototypes of evolving sophistication,

    since 2010. ARIES aims to quantify ES in a manner that

    acknowledges dynamic complexity and its consequences, but keeps

    its models sufficiently simple to remain tractable, general and

    scalable to varying levels of detail and data availability. The

    method is founded on two main innovations:

    1. An extension of ES science intended to enrich the dominant

    MEA narrative with a renewed focus on beneficiaries,

    probabilistic analysis, and spatio-temporal dynamics of flows

    and scale. The result can heighten awareness of important

    distinctions such as that between potential and actual benefits.

    2. The capability to automatically assemble the most appropriate

    ES models based on a library of modular components, driven

    by context-specific data and machine-processed ES knowledge.

    A model structure fitting the goals, the context and the

    available data can thus be used for each situation, avoiding the

    pitfalls of the common ‘‘one model fits all’’ paradigm.

    The advancements made in these two research directions are

    interrelated, as the theoretical extensions (1) are designed to fit a

    modular modeling approach (2). The subsections that follow

    provide methodological detail on each point.

    Improving the ES Narrative: from Static Service Values to

    Dynamic Benefits

    The MEA defined ES using a typology of ‘‘supporting,’’

    ‘‘regulating,’’ ‘‘provisioning,’’ and ‘‘cultural’’ services [8,28–30].

    As this original classification became dominant in framing the

    discourse on ES, social components of ES were emphasized less

    strongly than ecological ones. As a result, the diversity of social

    values and uptake modes for the same ES in different social and

    geographical contexts remained relatively understudied [31].

    Problems with such ecosystem-centric classifications (e.g., the

    potential for ‘‘double counting’’ of ES values [32–34]) prompted

    suggestions to shift focus to the beneficiary side [25,35] and to

    better characterize the spatial locations of ES provision, benefi-

    ciaries, and spatial flows [7,12,22].

    Spatially explicit benefit flows.

    A redefinition of the key

    terms of the MEA language, now deeply ingrained in scientific and

    policy dialogue, would be impractical and undesirable. In order to

    extend the mainstream MEA conceptual model to support a

    systematic emphasis on beneficiaries while remaining compatible

    with its underlying framework, an ARIES assessment begins with

    the mapping of concrete and spatially explicit beneficiary groups,

    each uniquely characterized by their demand type and concep-

    tualization of value (this and other key terms are defined in a

    glossary available as Glossary S1). We define an ES benefit as the

    outcome of the set of processes that join a beneficiary group with specified

    source ecosystem(s) through a clearly identified spatio-temporal flow. A service

    in MEA parlance corresponds conceptually to a collection of such

    benefits. For example, the water supply service would include

    separate benefits for each type of water use in an area, such as

    irrigation, domestic, or industrial use. Aggregate service values can

    then be obtained by combining the values assigned to each benefit,

    which may be modeled at independent spatial and temporal scales

    and translated into human well-being in different ways (Figure 1).

    Emphasizing and spatially locating beneficiaries also helps to

    systematically identify appropriate spatial boundaries for ES

    analysis. The region of interest for each benefit can be identified

    in space by determining the supply area capable of providing a

    flow of benefits that intercepts the beneficiary groups under study.

    Emphasis on beneficiaries allows us to improve the detail

    of ES models and to clarify their scale, dynamics, and eventual

    valuation. Once beneficiaries have been identified spatially,

    quantifying and mapping ES flows that reach them becomes key

    to distinguishing between the potential for benefit provision by

    ecosystems and the benefits actually accrued by society. This

    approach can substantially improve the accuracy of ES valuation

    [15,22] and expand the value of ES assessments to decision makers

    [7]. In resource management scenarios, beneficiary-based maps of

    ES provision can be crucial for influencing management decisions

    that appropriately address distributional equities among ‘‘winners’’

    and ‘‘losers’’ [22,36]. Yet a mechanistic understanding of the

    dynamics of ES provision, use, and flow for such diverse and

    complex services as sediment regulation, pollination, or recreation

    is very challenging, and model outputs may be difficult for decision

    makers to understand. Like other mainstream ES models (see the

    review in [3]), ARIES currently uses production functions to

    model its main elements (source, use and sink regions: see Figure 2

    and description below). Such outputs can be independently

    compared to those provided by other methods. However, unlike

    in other methods, the supply component is intended to quantify

    potential benefit provision, as it does not account for society’s use of

    ES.

    ES benefit transport and delivery in time and space are

    handled in ARIES through dynamic flow models, whose algorithms

    use the production function output along with quantification of

    demand as inputs. This multi-stage approach is illustrated in

    Figure 2, where amounts of a service carrier produced in source

    (supply) regions flow to beneficiaries situated in use (demand)

    regions. Flows reach beneficiaries along physical or informational

    flow paths, which result from spatially explicit and dynamic physical

    processes. Demand may be rival (each user reduces the flow

    available for others) or non-rival (use does not appreciably reduce

    availability to others). The benefit connected with these flows may

    be provisioning (supplying a valuable good or service to users, such as

    scenic views, food, or drinking water) or preventive (where the

    contact with a biophysical flow is detrimental to human well-

    being, and the actual benefit is supplied by an ecosystem’s

    mitigation of that damaging effect, as in the mitigation of flood

    water, sediment, nutrients, disease, or wildfire). Along flow paths,

    sink regions may absorb or deplete the service-carrying medium –

    a beneficial process in the case of preventive benefits but a

    detrimental process for provisioning benefits. It should be noted

    that although the MEA ES classification uses the similar term

    provisioning services, we are not seeking to classify services when we

    distinguish between provisioning and preventive benefits, but

    instead to classify flow behaviors to enable a systematic description

    of how ecosystems provide benefits to people. As inputs, most

    ARIES flow models use the spatial distributions of the sources of

    service-carrying medium, beneficiary demand, and potential sinks,

    specified as maps covering the area under study.

    The conceptual model shown in Figure 2 does not necessarily

    depict a spatial reality directly: regions may overlap or be remote,

    and, depending on the type of benefit, flows may take place in

    diverse ways, for example through hydrologic, informational, or

    transportation networks. The amount of carrier that actually

    reaches the beneficiaries (for provisioning benefits) or is absorbed

    by ecosystems on its way to beneficiaries (for preventive benefits) is

    the basis for assessing accrued value. Areas where the flow

    trajectories for one or more benefit concentrate (‘‘area of critical

    ES flow’’ in Figure 2) can be critical to the delivery of the service

    even if they are not included in either source or use regions

    [13,22,27,37].

    Values accrued by society are, as introduced above, the

    result of the flow of a beneficial or detrimental carrier. The carrier

    may be physical (e.g., water in the case of water supply or flood

    regulation, CO2 in carbon storage and sequestration) or informa-

    tional (e.g., visual information in aesthetic services). The mode of

    transmission and resulting spatial patterns of ES flow are

    determined by the nature of the carrier, the type of benefit

    Methods that are well developed and documented have greater transparency and credibility,
    improving trust with decision makers and the public.

    Methods that can be applied in diverse ecological and socioeconomic contexts can
    be more consistently and inexpensively applied than place-

    (provisioning or preventive), the physical characteristics of the

    landscape, and the presence of human or natural features that act

    as sinks. ARIES quantifies such flows using a family of network

    flow propagation models [38] termed Service Path Attribution

    Networks (SPANs: [7,12,13,26]) that simulate carrier movement,

    absorption and delivery for different classes of carriers (Table 2).

    The appropriate SPAN models are chosen and linked during

    model assembly depending on the benefit type.

    The SPAN framework, covered in detail in Johnson et al.

    [12,13], reduces the great diversity of ES benefits to a small and

    general taxonomy of flow types [7], based on a uniform model of

    connectivity

    and

    accessibility

    across

    spatial

    networks.

    This

    approach offers less mechanistic accuracy than could be provided

    by a detailed physical model, such as hydrological or sediment

    transport, but offers the advantages of representing all ES in a

    unified way and, more importantly, of being able to run in most

    situations with probabilistic initial conditions and manageable data

    requirements. The interpretation of time in SPAN models is

    explicit but is intentionally not temporally referenced: an initial

    condition progresses toward completion of an ES flow across space

    taken as the description of legitimate ecosystem services, have the potential
    of causing ‘‘double counting’’ by identifying benefits that are

    ‘‘intermediate’’ and not ‘‘final’’, i.e., not directly linked to beneficiaries.

    and time without attempting to reference the specific time when a

    carrier completes its traversal of a flow path. The model stops

    when the entire study area has been populated with flow

    trajectories. This approach, while more abstract and limited in

    predictive

    capabilities

    than

    a

    full

    process-based

    approach,

    facilitates spatial analysis of benefit distribution with the data

    available to most management situations. When data allow, the

    ARIES infrastructure can integrate more sophisticated models as

    explained in the subsection that follows.

    Outputs of an ARIES assessment.

    The flow trajectories

    simulated are processed into different groups of mapped results.

    For provisioning benefits, a flow density map, displaying the amount

    of ecosystem benefit that has traversed each location during the

    course of the simulation, highlights high-value areas that are most

    critical to maximizing the transmission of a benefit to beneficiary

    groups (exemplified later on in Figures 3 and 4). For preventive

    benefits, flow density highlights areas where the damaging

    medium concentrates and can help spot areas where intervention

    is needed. Such maps can greatly aid planning, as in most cases it

    is difficult to relate flow information to either source or use areas.

    Because each trajectory is modeled individually, the specific

    amount of benefit flowing from a particular source region or to a

    particular beneficiary group can be determined; this can greatly

    aid targeted policy making. For example, targeted flow modeling

    could inform polluter- or beneficiary-pays policies based on service

    degradation or use [39].

    Other decision-relevant maps produced by an analysis of benefit

    flows are summarized in Table 3. Theoretical source and sink maps

    show the amount of value that could be produced in ideal

    situations for provisioning and preventive benefits, respectively,

    assuming that there is a demand for all of the service produced and

    that the benefit flow can reach all people. Possible source maps

    show the amount that has flow paths to reach beneficiaries, but

    may not due to the action of sink regions. Actual source maps show

    the source of the value that actually reaches users (provisioning

    benefit) or of the damaging medium that actually impacts them

    (preventive benefit). Comparison of these maps can aid in

    understanding the efficiency of service delivery: for example if

    the possible values of a provisioning benefit are much higher than

    the actual, there may be room for policy-driven improvements.

    The objective function for scenario analysis can be the actual value

    accrued or another metric, for example the distributional equity of

    a delivered benefit.

    Other maps link supply and demand in ways that may help spot

    problem areas in need of policy attention. The blocked source map

    shows the value from provisioning benefits that is produced by

    ecosystems but cannot get to people, because of issues such as

    pollution or stream diversion, or flows of preventive benefits, such

    as the amount of threat reduction provided to source regions by

    intervening landscapes (e.g., disease control, wildfire mitigation).

    Inaccessible source maps show the value that is produced by the

    ecosystem but cannot be accessed by people because of a lack of

    flow connections on the landscape. Blocked ES maps can be used,

    for provisioning benefits, to spot areas where intervention may be

    called for to restore service delivery. Inaccessible ES maps

    highlight areas where service production may be ‘‘underutilized’’.

    Result maps are produced in pairs, describing both the

    ecosystem sources and the human beneficiaries of each benefit.

    Depending on policy priorities, one or the other may be more

    relevant. For example, the blocked use map for water supply shows

    the spatial distribution of unmet demand by water users which

    could be met by ecosystems if benefits were not diverted to natural

    Figure 2. The ARIES conceptual model of ecosystem service flow dynamics.

    processes such as evapotranspiration, re-routed by infrastructure,

    or polluted beyond the point of usability. Conversely, the blocked

    source map identifies areas that produce water that is unusable for

    the reasons listed above. The inaccessible use map will show those

    areas in need that cannot be served without major structural

    intervention on the landscape to alter flow dynamics. For example,

    large water diversion projects were built over the last century to

    reroute previously inaccessible water to users in arid and semiarid

    environments. With training, a decision maker could learn to use

    these outputs to gain a deeper understanding of the actual service

    values, available policy opportunities, and location and extent of

    demand, both met and unmet, plus value provided for each

    beneficiary group [7,26].

    Treatment of uncertainty.

    To achieve the goal of making

    uncertainties explicit to the user, the initial conditions that enter a

    flow model (source, use and sink distribution) are often modeled in

    ARIES using a Bayesian Network (BN) approach [25,40,41]. This

    accounts for and quantifies part of the uncertainty inherent in the

    data and model structures that generate them. In the common

    occurrence of data scarcity, this also makes it possible to use

    informed prior probabilities gathered from local experts or prior

    statistical analysis [42]. The model specialization algorithms in

    ARIES ensure that BN models used in each context reflect

    available local knowledge. One practical advantage of BN models

    is their intuitive visual presentation, which helps decision-makers

    relate and contribute to the conceptual phase of model develop-

    ment in focus groups and participatory sessions [25,41]. The

    process of training [42] lends BN models their data-driven

    character. A BN is trained to replicate correlations in trusted

    datasets via an iterative process that adjusts the probabilities of

    each outcome to best reflect the evidence seen in data. The trained

    BN has ‘‘learned’’ the correlations in the data and is more accurate

    in predicting the probability distributions of each outcome given

    the input data submitted to the model. In cases where data are

    missing, these distributions will exhibit greater uncertainties,

    maintaining in most cases some value for decision support. When

    source, use, or sink distributions are modeled with BNs, ARIES

    aims to make their interpretation intuitive by visualizing each

    model result as a pair of maps. Viewed side by side, they show the

    most likely outcome per location along with its associated level of

    uncertainty, computed as the coefficient of variation (for numeric

    predictions) or as the Shannon index of diversity (for categorical

    ones). Because explicit uncertainty is valuable for decision-making,

    the uncertainties computed in spatial BN models are carried

    through the flow models in the SPAN algorithms, using methods

    such as Monte Carlo simulation and variance propagation [26] so

    that flow models can also produce uncertainty information, at the

    expense of longer run times.

    While probabilistic models do allow communication and

    quantification of some uncertainty, their linearity prevents them

    from incorporating and expressing feedback processes that affect

    natural and social systems. To partially alleviate this problem,

    ARIES only uses BN models to quantify initial conditions used as

    inputs for non-Bayesian dynamic flow models. This approach does

    address some of the complexity of ES flows, but of course does not

    completely honor the intrinsic complexity of coupled human-

    natural systems. In addition, the effectiveness of BN models

    depends on the availability of training datasets. Proper training of

    data-driven models can be problematic when training data are

    available at different resolutions and levels of reliability.

    Integrated Intelligent Modeling

    A ‘‘one model fits all’’ approach, which relies on parameteri-

    zation of a fixed model structure to accommodate differences in

    social and ecological contexts between case studies, is common in

    contemporary ES methodologies. In contexts as complex and

    diverse as those that characterize ES studies, the trivialization

    caused by such a model’s structural rigidity can compromise its

    utility in informing decision needs [43] and in addressing highly

    context-specific values and associated trade-offs [44,45]. On the

    other hand, customizing model assumptions, variables and

    equations to match complex decision contexts usually requires

    great amounts of knowledge, time and expertise, an investment

    that is often impractical [21]. In an attempt to alleviate this near-

    universal limitation of modeling applications, ARIES incorporates

    advances in ecoinformatics that allow model structures to vary

    ‘‘intelligently’’ based on the contexts in which they are run. This is

    accomplished through semantic meta-modeling [46], a technique

    that automatically selects model components from an extensible

    repository reflecting data availability and the specific features of

    ES in each application context. Although this method is not tied to

    any specific conceptualization of ES (or even to ES problem space

    in general), the view of ES as linked, independently described

    source, sink and use initial conditions joined through a flow

    process fits an automatic model assembly method optimally by

    virtue of its inherent modularity.

    Modularity, structural variability and structural validation of

    models have been hard-sought goals in modeling for decades [46–

    49]. Despite some success in the areas of model integration and

    synchronization [50,51] no previously established methods were

    available that could directly address the needs of ARIES. The

    scope of the ecoinformatics innovations pioneered in ARIES,

    collectively termed semantic meta-modeling [46,49], is three-fold:

    1. Adaptive modeling. Model structure is not defined a priori,

    but is built for each simulation to represent the best and most

    problem-specific knowledge available for the context of

    interest. Knowledge in this sense refers to both models and

    data, both of which are chosen at run time by ranking the

    available ‘‘building blocks’’ for degree of fit to the context and

    assembling them through a process driven by artificial

    intelligence (termed a resolution algorithm or, for brevity, a

    resolver). Context-specific expert opinion collected and orga-

    nized by ARIES modelers influences the choice of variables,

    algorithms, scale, and input data that determines the final

    model structure in each assessment. This approach relies on

    extensible, distributed data and model repositories made

    available as online services by the ARIES team and other

    independent research groups. Once a model has been

    assembled by the resolver, complete provenance information

    [52] is recorded, allowing a user to audit all data sources and

    model choices made by the system.

    2. End-user simplification: Adoption of any technology is

    dependent on the simplicity of the user-side workflow.

    Simplifying usage without compromising accuracy and detail

    has been a priority in developing ARIES, in an effort to

    sidestep the unavoidable tension between ‘‘keeping it simple’’

    and producing the most effective decision aid. The availability

    of an independently extensible model and data repository

    network (distributed over multiple servers) coupled with

    ARIES’ ability to automatically adapt data to models makes

    it possible to run many models without the user having to input

    additional data. Users need only provide data when otherwise

    unavailable, or to create ex-ante scenarios based on locally

    predicted changes. At the same time, the semantic validation

    provided by the ARIES resolver (see Model Resolution and

    Assembly) ensures that important factors and necessary

    variables are not overlooked.

    3. Independent extensibility: The modularity of the semantic

    meta-modeling approach implies that multiple models can be

    developed for very general concepts (such as ES benefits,

    individually or in bundles) or more specific variables (such as

    soil texture or land cover). Each repository can provide data

    and models for any concept, and all of the available knowledge

    is ranked prior to selection at the assembly phase. This

    paradigm facilitates extension of the model base through a

    community process where no top-level coordination is required

    beyond agreement on common ontological concepts (see

    Model Resolution and Assembly). The knowledge base can

    therefore grow independently with use. Provided that knowl-

    edge repositories adhere to an agreed semantics, interopera-

    bility and consistency of the assembled models will be ensured

    by the model resolution process.

    The main instrument to achieve these innovations is the ARIES

    knowledge base, which includes abstract concepts, models and data.

    In ARIES, two levels of description exist: abstract and model

    knowledge.

    Abstract knowledge is composed of individual ontologies

    [47,53] that organize concepts and relationships relevant to ES

    and biophysical modeling. Ontologies are a standardized way of

    representing conceptualizations as interdependent definitions of

    concepts and relationships [53] that can be easily extended and

    merged. They consist of computer-readable files that are used by

    widely available machine reasoning algorithms [47,54] and remain

    a very active research field in artificial intelligence. ARIES’ core

    ontologies are based on efforts led by NASA [55] and on

    foundational ontologies of recognized generality [56]. In the ES-

    specific ontologies developed by the authors, the MEA categories

    are broken down into an extensible classification of ES benefits

    (Figure 1), which is further broken into model-relevant ecological,

    social and economic concepts. Each ES benefit is interpreted

    according to the conceptualization described in the Methods

    section, using source, use, sink and flow concepts for organization.

    An extensive analysis of case studies across multiple ES and

    source of proximity value, the value for this non-rival service is multiplied
    by the number of users, so total flow values can exceed 100.

    contexts was the starting point for the assembly of these ontologies,

    which assist in the identification of particular beneficiaries and

    benefits within a target area and in model selection and assembly

    to best simulate their behavior.

    Model knowledge pairs models to individual concepts, subject

    to rules that guide model selection based on specific characteristics

    of the application context (e.g., geographic location or the values

    of observations like precipitation, biome, or per capita income). In

    semantic meta-modeling, a model can be defined as a strategy to

    observe its associated concept, and can simply consist of a semantically

    annotated dataset (the preferred alternative when available) or of

    an algorithm of varying complexity, which may in turn require

    observation of other concepts in order to be computed. Models are

    specified in a dedicated modeling language (documented so far

    only in early release forms [46]) also capable of ‘‘wrapping’’

    external models by providing semantics for their inputs and

    outputs, bridging to the concepts in the abstract knowledge base.

    Model resolution and assembly.

    After users choose their

    geographical context and the concept corresponding to their ES of

    interest (e.g., ‘‘water supply to domestic users’’), the ARIES

    resolver uses the abstract description of the concept to assemble

    the most detailed model allowed by the model knowledge

    (including available data). Model resolution proceeds top-down,

    identifying models according to the semantics of the context (e.g. a

    mountain watershed and a wetland region will trigger different

    ways of observing surface water flow), the scale of the observation

    (e.g. features that are only meaningful at large scales, like

    mountains in assessing aesthetic value, will not be included unless

    the region of interest is wide enough to allow their observation)

    and the available data (models that need input that cannot be

    observed will not be chosen). The resolution process builds a

    decision tree that resolves the principal concept to the most

    suitable model and, in turn, any other concepts required by the

    models chosen at each step, until all concepts are resolved into a

    computable algorithm. More than one model may be chosen for

    the same concept when the area of interest contains features that

    are different enough to require distinct model formulations in

    different spatial or temporal segments of the same run (e.g., if both

    water bodies and land areas are present). Because the model base

    is multi-purpose and distributed, it is common for one concept to

    be linked to more than one possible model; therefore it is critical to

    rank models by their suitability for the context. ARIES adopts a

    sophisticated, multiple criteria ranking algorithm that can mix

    objective criteria (such as spatio-temporal resolution or currency)

    with user-provided rankings of reliability and quality. Table 4

    provides an overview of the criteria currently used for ranking.

    The relative weighting of these criteria is important to the outcome

    of model resolution: while modelers can provide customized

    weights on a model-by-model base, current research in ARIES is

    directed to devising adaptive weighting schemata that can use both

    objective and subjective metrics of quality of the models produced,

    as described briefly in the Discussion section. All other ranking

    criteria being equal, the algorithm prioritizes specific, detailed

    models that have been tagged as appropriate for the region of

    interest over more general, coarser alternatives, as long as data to

    support them exist. This integrated modeling approach supports

    the mixing of data-driven and hypothesis-driven models to

    produce the overall model structure most suited to the application

    context [4]. A data-driven approach such as BNs is prioritized by

    ARIES to compute static components, like ES production

    functions, wherever accepted dynamic models or the data to

    populate them are unavailable. A hypothesis-driven approach

    (such as flow models or trusted external models that have gained

    decision-maker confidence through repeated application and

    refinement) is preferred where the dynamic complexity of the

    phenomena (e.g., sediment or water transport) is well understood

    and adequate data are available for parameterization. The

    modeling language (named Thinklab) and the infrastructure

    implementing the semantic meta-modeling approach are open

    source software [57], developed concurrently with ARIES and

    available under the terms of the GNU General Public License

    [58].

    Results from Application Examples

    Models addressing eight ecosystem services – carbon seques-

    tration and storage, riverine flood regulation, coastal flood

    regulation, aesthetic views and open space proximity, water

    supply, sediment regulation, subsistence fisheries, and recreation -

    have been developed so far using ARIES. Model components were

    developed and parameterized based on literature reviews and

    expert elicitation [27]. Efforts are underway to streamline and

    standardize expert elicitation procedures via surveys that can be

    used with future ARIES case studies. Case studies to date have

    focused on several locations in the USA [24,59], Latin America,

    and Africa [60,61]. Initial case study locations were selected to

    represent a range of ecological and socioeconomic conditions, data

    availability, and scientific expertise, in order to best serve as a

    foundation for the development of globally available models (see

    the Discussion section). To provide examples of early ARIES

    outputs, in this section we summarize key results from two

    contrasting case studies: water supply and quality in Eastern

    Madagascar and open space values in Washington State, USA.

    Such studies also provide examples of potential storylines (see the

    Discussion section) that users may replicate in a single action in

    different contexts, supported by ARIES’ automatic model building

    algorithms.

    Bank

    WAVES

    (Wealth

    were evaluated

    near a key conservation area termed the

    Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor (CAZ). ARIES flow analysis

    enabled comparison of water quantity and quality values for four

    classes of beneficiaries located within and outside a protected area.

    The CAZ, a largely forested, newly established protected area on

    Madagascar’s eastern escarpment, includes a population of nearly

    350,000 people in rural communities and also supplies water to the

    national capital of Antananarivo. To understand the value of a

    protected area in providing benefits to downstream water users, we

    compared water budgets and erosion for an area near the CAZ

    but hydrologically unconnected to the protected area and with

    intensive

    agriculture

    (area 1) versus

    another adjacent and

    hydrologically connected to the CAZ protected area (area 2,

    Figure 3). Using the models from the 2011 ARIES release [27], we

    modeled spatially explicit water demand, simulating water-delivery

    dynamics when accounting for precipitation, evapotranspiration,

    infiltration, runoff, and rival use [60]. We then computed a

    preliminary water budget for the region and aggregated the spatial

    results to provide total figures for beneficiaries located within the

    two areas. Water demand for irrigation, livestock, residential

    consumption and tourism was estimated separately, using best

    practice manuals and heuristic criteria to obviate the lack of

    primary data for most sectors [60]. Total water demand estimates

    by sector are shown in Table 5.

    64]. To better understand the CAZ’s role in regulating sediment, a

    model was developed to quantify and map areas of erosion and the

    hydrologic flow paths of waterborne sediment. Water supply and

    sediment sources and sinks were quantified, which enabled

    comparative analysis and future valuation when economic data

    become available. Soil erosion was computed using a hybrid

    approach, automatically applied by ARIES model specialization

    algorithms: the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE

    [65]) was used on gentle slopes and a probabilistic model

    considering soil, precipitation, and vegetation factors [27] took

    over when the slope was higher than 20%, too high for the

    RUSLE to be defensible [66]. The surface water supply and

    sediment transport flow models employed [27] simulate (i) the

    movement of surface water throughout the basins and (ii) transport

    and deposition of eroded sediment via hydrologic flows. Our

    models generated maps for which summary values of demand,

    supply and flow can be calculated for both sample areas and the

    CAZ overall (Figure 3).

    To estimate the sustainability of water supply in the region, the

    model was run repeatedly with increasing demand levels; this

    allowed us to estimate approximate critical thresholds of water

    supply in both sample areas. Results of this analysis for the largest

    water use (rice agriculture) are summarized in Table 6, which

    shows that while current levels of demand are essentially met in

    both sample areas, only sample area 2 has the potential to sustain

    much greater demand in a future when deforestation and climate

    change are likely to further strain water supplies.

    Results of the soil erosion and deposition analysis allowed us to

    estimate levels of sediment contamination in water, which are

    approximately 6 times higher outside the CAZ (area 1, 11.3 kg/

    m3.year) than adjacent to it (area 2, 1.9 kg/m3.year). As before,

    due to the great approximation and lack of primary data in all

    model components, these results must be considered only as

    comparative indicators. Still, the analysis supports the hypothesis

    that CAZ’s natural features are important in protecting water

    quality for its productive use by downstream beneficiaries, results

    that were previously highlighted in more in-depth studies for

    agricultural [67] and economic [68] productivity in other parts of

    Madagascar. While such results must be interpreted with caution,

    flow analysis enables a rapid semi-quantitative assessment of

    supply threats and mitigation effects that could not be obtained

    using other mainstream ES methodologies [3].

    Example 2: Aesthetics and Open Space Values in the

    Puget Sound

    A case study in the Puget Sound, Washington State, USA stands

    in stark contrast to the previous one, in terms of both differing

    ecological and socioeconomic contexts and data quality and

    availability. The Puget Sound, the second largest estuary in the

    USA, is a defining social, cultural and economic feature of

    Washington State and home to a human population of 4.4 million,

    including 15 American Indian tribes and the major port cities of

    Seattle and Tacoma. In a recent study, we differentiated between

    the theoretical provision of ES (i.e., ecosystems’ capacity to supply

    services) and their actual delivery when accounting for the location

    Table 4. Current criteria for ranking model components and data selected during
    model assembly.

    Scoring criterion

    Explanation

    Semantic specificity

    Prioritizes data and models that are specifically defined as applying to the semantics
    of the

    context of interest; e.g. ‘‘carbon content in top soil layer’’ over more generically
    described

    ‘‘carbon soil content’’ when the requesting model is defined to apply to the top
    layer.

    Scale specificity

    Prioritizes data and models that are more specific for the selected spatial and/or
    temporal

    context, by comparing the relative proportion of coverage for the data or models
    with the

    context chosen for simulation.

    Detail and resolution

    All else being equal, data and models of higher temporal and spatial resolution
    will be

    given priority.

    Semantic distance

    Data and models whose definition is closer to that of the model they are being
    applied to,

    for example by belonging to the same project or coming from related ontologies.

    Currency

    If no specific time period is specified for the simulation, the most current data
    and models

    are chosen preferentially.

    User-attributed quality rankings

    Users may attribute numeric ranks (0 to 100) to perceived data and model reliability.

    The value 50 is used if no value is specified. Other user-defined rankings can
    be used at the

    discretion of the modeler, for example for prioritizing public data over non-disclosable
    ones

    if the model needs to be audited externally.

    of beneficiaries and flow paths [59]. Here we map the value

    provided by ecosystems to property owners via open-space

    proximity within the Green-Duwamish watershed, which rises

    from Seattle to the slopes of the Cascade Mountains (Figure 4).

    Although hedonic analysis can be used to monetarily value open-

    space proximity for property owners, spatially explicit flow models

    enable a comparison of theoretical and actual service delivery

    values under landscape change scenarios (i.e., as a result of

    conversion of open space to developed land use and movement of

    new beneficiaries into the region). To address this, we compared

    year 2000 (baseline) conditions to managed (constrained) and

    unmanaged (open) development scenarios for the year 2060 [69].

    We expected widespread development to reduce theoretical open

    space sources that can provide value to residents, but at the same

    time increase the number of users and the total flow of proximity

    value to property owners.

    Open space proximity values were mapped by identifying: 1)

    ecosystems providing high-quality open space (sources), 2) features

    that impede access to open space (sinks), and 3) housing (use)

    locations [27]. The values of source and sink features were ranked

    using a relative scale (0–100) where higher values represent the

    most valuable open space based on hedonic valuation studies

    [70,71]. Sources, sinks and users were connected by a flow model

    simulating physical access to desirable spaces [27].

    While the total number of new users was greater in the open

    development scenario, there was less high-quality open space

    available to provide value to property owners than in the

    constrained development scenario (Table 7, Figure 4). As a result,

    urban growth increased open space flow values, but by a greater

    percentage in the constrained development scenario than the open

    development scenario (25.7% and 23.3% increases, respectively;

    Table 7, Figure 4). Theoretical source values increased slightly in

    the development scenarios because both increase the value of open

    space through the designation of new parkland.

    These results illustrate how placing more beneficiaries across the

    landscape may have the effect of increasing ecosystem service flows

    and, by consequence, actual values, but may simultaneously

    degrade the ecosystem’s underlying ability to provide the same

    services (i.e., theoretical values). In this case, an expansion of the

    urban footprint yields an increase in beneficiaries in locations

    where ecosystem service flows were previously inaccessible.

    However, land-cover change associated with new development

    often reduces an ecosystem’s capacity to provide services, i.e., their

    theoretical source values [7]. Thus a more measured approach to

    urban growth may actually lead to greater ecosystem service values

    and protection of a region’s underlying natural capital than an

    unconstrained development pattern.

    The differences between development scenarios become far

    sharper when a richer set of ES and management alternatives is

    considered, including for example when endangered species

    restoration (Chinook salmon and others), flood risk reduction,

    retention of local farmlands, port expansion, transportation

    development, carbon emissions reduction, wildlife conservation,

    and high-tech and industrial development are all pursued in the

    Puget Sound Basin. Ongoing ARIES applications in the Puget

    Sound can be used to better quantify geographical and temporal

    tradeoffs in ES flows for diverse beneficiary groups.

    Discussion

    In this section, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the

    different areas of innovation in ARIES and how they relate to the

    state of the art in spatially explicit ES modeling and valuation. We

    conclude by comparing our efforts to date against the evaluative

    criteria for ES assessment tools listed in the introduction.

    Improving Model Detail, Coverage and Transparency

    The ES assessment framework proposed in this article calls for a

    more detailed and systematic view of ES problems than that used

    in many of today’s ES applications (Table 1). Yet the practical

    value of this new approach remains undemonstrated outside of the

    case studies where it has been applied so far. The value of this or

    other approaches to quantitative ES assessment should be seen as

    comparative rather than absolute; the difficulty in validation and

    the necessarily simple nature of the models involved make them

    more suitable for comparing scenario outcomes than for obtaining

    reliable physical estimates. Widespread testing of ES tools against

    discipline-specific models is still needed to understand the

    limitations of ES-based approaches for accurate, consistent

    quantification of the biophysical processes underlying ES provision

    [24]. Yet incorporation of dynamics and uncertainty, and the

    possibility of composing contextually specific models, allows for

    improved precision and may make the methods described suitable

    for more sophisticated and rigorous ES-informed decision support.

    ARIES’ development has followed a bottom-up approach,

    starting with case studies of considerable detail conducted with

    partner institutions, then generalizing that knowledge to yield

    ‘‘global’’ models offering a bird’s-eye characterization of many ES

    in most locations, limiting data input requirements from users.

    The potential for large-scale adoption will clearly depend on

    completion of these generalized models, whose development is

    ongoing. These simpler models will provide a ‘‘bottom line’’ to

    which the artificial intelligence in ARIES can default, allowing it

    to produce results of variable detail in almost any geographic

    region using global data, but automatically switching to more

    detailed models when the knowledge base and data allow. When

    this stage of development is completed, ARIES will meet the needs

    of a larger share of potential users, growing in utility and

    sophistication over time. Although the integration of large model

    libraries poses many challenges, such libraries exist within

    academic institutions and agencies (such as Environmental

    Protection agencies or the US Army Corps of Engineers) that

    can be connected to ARIES. The potential of ARIES as a large-

    scale meta-modeling framework will be revealed as case studies

    and multiple ES analysis are further tested.

    ARIES runs on an extensive (3.5TB of data alone at the time of

    this writing) and fast-growing knowledge base that includes data

    from both public sources and local institutions. Where data are

    privately owned or protected by privacy laws, the ARIES team has

    obtained clearance from the respective sources to release the ES

    assessments as derived products, as long as the original data cannot

    be directly downloaded or displayed. This allows public use of

    information that would otherwise need to be obtained by users on

    a case-by-case basis, adding to the up-front user investment

    needed to conduct an assessment. On the model side, a variety of

    well-known, open source physical process models are being

    integrated into the ARIES model base. Among these, the

    CAESAR-LISFLOOD flooding and erosion model [72], the

    PRMS water balance model [73] and a general ecosystem model

    broadly inspired by LPJ-GUESS [74] are being included to

    improve the quality of descriptions of flood, sediment, nutrient,

    carbon and primary production dynamics. Adding these tools will

    not affect the usability and complexity of the system on the user

    and decision-maker side, although it may produce more outputs.

    As a corollary of the system’s built-in flexibility, ARIES is designed

    to be amenable to transparent updates of the knowledge base,

    making it possible to perform earlier assessments repeatedly while

    automatically benefitting from any improved data and modeling

    knowledge. This also provides a mechanism for testing relative

    gains obtained from using complex vs. more simple models.

    A precondition for effectively using ES in decision-making is

    acknowledging, quantifying and communicating the uncertainties

    that are inherent to any modeling endeavor [16]. ARIES is

    designed to use probabilistic initial conditions for most of its

    models, through the adoption of BNs, and to carry the uncertainty

    through the dynamic parts of its models, using methods including

    Monte Carlo simulation and variance propagation, so that

    uncertainties can be communicated to the user [26]. Importantly,

    only the components of overall uncertainty that relate to missing

    data or known data quality issues can be dealt with effectively in

    such a probabilistic model. No accounting is possible for the

    uncertainty that relates to the structure of the causal dependencies

    that define the Bayesian model, although this can be alleviated to

    some extent by adopting context-specific model assemblage rules.

    Understanding strengths and limitations of these uncertainty

    estimates is necessary to avoid engendering a false sense of security

    in the decision-making process, leading users to ignore other

    realms of uncertainty that may have a crucial influence on

    outcomes in those parts of the model where the explicit

    uncertainty is relatively low. Like any quantitative modeling

    approach, BNs can lead to subjectivity and error. Guidelines and

    best practices for BN development have been developed [45] and

    are being adhered to during the ongoing development of ARIES

    models.

    Simplifying User Workflows

    The multiple levels of detail in the ARIES model base are

    intended not only to produce more suitable models, but also to

    streamline workflows for end users, who will be able to query the

    system in simple ways and obtain results that automatically reflect

    the best available knowledge for their context. In doing so, ARIES

    hopes to overcome a common hurdle in ES applications today:

    complex usage of simple models, where models of relatively simple

    methodological sophistication still place a heavy burden on users

    for data pre-processing and parameterization. ARIES is designed

    to automate data choice, algorithm choice, data pre-processing

    and optimal attribution of levels of resolution for all ES, and to

    allow users to query ‘‘bundles’’ of ES with exactly the same

    workflow as single ES assessments, requesting user inputs only for

    knowledge that is not available. The artificial intelligence-assisted

    process pioneered in ARIES emphasizes user simplification

    without trivializing the application, a paradigm that could also

    be valuable for broader application in modern environmental and

    economic decision-making. Provenance information complements

    the outputs of each model run, describing data sources and model

    structure in the interest of transparency and traceability of

    problems.

    To further simplify user workflow, ARIES adopts the metaphor

    of storylines to organize and present observable concepts (e.g.,

    carbon sequestration) for the user and guide visualization after

    their resolution to models. Storylines connect observable concepts

    from the knowledge base with metadata that include explanatory

    descriptions of each concept, references, links, and descriptions of

    related case studies. Storylines are assembled automatically as

    models are built, documenting each model component and the

    rationale for its choice, and provide a blueprint for generating

    user-friendly documentation of results that can be viewed

    immediately or downloaded as digital media. ARIES is currently

    developed and used through a software interface geared towards

    modelers, which is a primary focus of current development. The

    intended end-user interface, however, is a web 2.0 application that

    allows users to search for storylines that describe concepts of

    interest in standard ‘‘web search’’ fashion, based on concept

    names as well as descriptions, locations, references and other

    metadata. Within a graphical user interface, the act of dragging

    and dropping one of the storyline links resulting from a search on

    an interactive world map specifies the geographical context and

    initiates model assembly and execution. The existing ARIES web

    interface prototype available at www.ariesonline.org [75] is,

    however, only demonstrational and based on an older release of

    the software; the described user workflow will become available in

    an updated application once the development of global models has

    been completed.

    A user workflow that hides complexities under familiar

    metaphors and can transparently produce sophisticated models

    can carry subtle but important disadvantages. Early pilot tests with

    users have highlighted that while even limited user-level complex-

    ity is poorly tolerated by users, a lack of it can be perceived as lack

    of sophistication in the approach and lead to incorrect assumptions

    that influence decisions. To obviate this, more feedback from the

    modeling system can be communicated to document choices and

    computations as they are made, at the cost of ‘‘more output to be

    understood.’’ Further, choices made by an automated system are

    typically questioned by users, even if they reflect the best available

    expert knowledge. Incorporation of user feedback on model results

    may provide additional ranking criteria for model selection

    (Table 4), and allow a degree of ‘‘crowdsourcing’’ to be

    incorporated in the model assembly process. This can have

    important implications in a field where objective validation is often

    not an option; it is of course paramount that all subjective criteria

    are used in a controlled and transparent way.

    ARIES and ES Valuation

    ES valuation has typically been interpreted monetarily. The

    realization that value is a highly multi-dimensional issue with deep

    ethical implications has become central in recent ES literature

    [76,77]. The definition of value can vary widely in different ES

    applications, for example in food security [61,78] vs. payments for

    ecosystem services [79], or the values reflected by indigenous

    communities vs. centralized governments [80]. Much as the

    biophysical science underlying ES provision demands careful

    contextualization

    while

    modeling,

    ES

    valuation

    cannot

    be

    trivialized with a simple definition and deserves case by case

    consideration within the comprehensive framework of equity [81].

    The development of ARIES has so far concentrated on the

    biophysical modeling of ES, leaving the translation to economic

    value and its implications to the end user. In some circumstances,

    biophysical outputs (particularly the possible and actual estimates,

    Table 3) can be seen as representing value directly, or provide a

    base for inferring value beyond mere ES supply quantification

    [60]. Yet, the many facets of equity [81] and value [82] make the

    problem of case-study specific value attribution difficult to resolve

    in general. As a consequence, a priority in ARIES is to remain as

    agnostic and pluralistic as possible in its approach to valuation.

    Independent of the definition, value in ARIES will ultimately be

    the result of a model, and the ideal representation of value for a

    system adopting an ‘‘intelligent’’ modeling approach would consist

    of a context-specific and customizable model of societal well-being

    that reflects locally established demand, customs and beliefs. If the

    application requires monetization, that can be accommodated via

    current valuation methodologies. ARIES is capable of incorpo-

    rating monetization models, but no value model of this kind is

    currently included in the knowledge base. For generality, value is

    best represented as a multiple-criteria problem whose definition

    greatly depends on the application context [82] and target

    stakeholder community. Still, the need for a ‘‘common currency’’

    to compare the effects of decisions across multiple ES and social

    sectors means that demand for economic estimates of ES value

    remains very high, no matter how controversial the surrounding

    issues. An often relied upon technique for estimating economic

    value of ES is value transfer [83,84], based on the adaptation of

    primary ES valuation studies done elsewhere to a new context of

    interest using a set of transfer criteria [85]. Although land-cover

    type has often been used as the sole transfer criterion [9], function

    transfer – the use of mathematical functions, often derived from

    meta-analyses – is considered a much more robust approach

    [86,87]. While ARIES does not offer benefit transfer algorithms,

    research on valuation is an important part of the project’s

    background [88–90] and the ARIES team is working with

    partners to provide bridges to valuation databases that can help

    generate

    more

    rigorous

    transfer

    functions

    [91].

    For

    such

    approaches, beneficiary-based biophysical estimates of ES flows,

    like the actual or possible estimates computed through flow

    modeling [7], may assist in the development of transfer functions.

    This would improve on a state of the art that most commonly uses

    theoretical values or static proxies for these purposes.

    Economic value changes in a highly nonlinear fashion in the

    vicinity of ecological thresholds as ES supply declines [92,93].

    Assessment methods must therefore be able to provide sufficient

    quantitative accuracy in assessing supply and demand, so that

    thresholds can be anticipated before they are encountered.

    Without such consideration, economic estimates should only be

    used when the relationship between service supply and marginal

    prices is known to be predictable and stable. The information on

    threats to supply that biophysical modeling can provide is key to

    the assessment of whether the linkage to economic values or prices

    is appropriate. For example, in the Madagascar pilot study

    illustrated above, supply threats have been discussed as a way to

    improve on the quality of the decision-making information that

    results from economic assessments.

    Dynamic Complexity and Trade-offs

    Non-linear dynamics determine catastrophic behaviors that are

    of utmost interest when investigating the consequences of policies

    on ES delivery. They include, for example, the sudden loss of

    homeostatic behavior (‘‘tipping points’’) that may be encountered

    as

    particular

    amounts

    of

    development-induced

    change

    are

    reached. Despite extensive research in both ecological and social

    sciences on the dynamic behavior of complex systems [18,19], our

    understanding of their general properties remains limited. As a

    result, we are unlikely to meet the various challenges related to

    accounting for complex human-natural system behaviors, like

    those listed by Carpenter et al. [16], without substantial further

    research. The question of how completely such non-linear

    dynamics can be realistically represented by ES assessment

    methods remains paramount. The adequacy of any model in

    predicting non-linear dynamics is very difficult to assess when

    detailed historical data are lacking, and few modeling studies exist

    that incorporate sufficient detail (e.g., employing a detailed and

    accurately calibrated hydrological assessment) to serve as a basis

    for qualitative cross-calibration. ARIES does account for flows

    using dynamic models, and the processes that underlie such flows

    are one of many sources of dynamic complexity. Analyzing

    spatially explicit and temporally referenced linkages between

    ecosystems and societies can provide a degree of dynamic

    description and the opportunity to address feedbacks, all of which

    can be useful for improved resource management. Yet, many

    other

    sources

    of

    ecological

    and

    social

    complexity

    remain

    unaccounted

    for

    when

    production

    functions

    are

    used

    for

    quantification. Agent-based models [38] that incorporate feedback

    on ecological systems from the societal side have begun to appear

    [94] and may prove useful to account for more dynamic

    complexity than the current state of the art in ES. The Ecosystem

    Services for Poverty Alleviation-Attaining Sustainable Services

    from Ecosystems through Trade-off Scenarios (ESPA-ASSETS)

    project [78] on food security and poverty alleviation through

    access to ES is one area where the ARIES methodology is being

    extended to consider such methods.

    Adaptable and Robust Ecosystem Services Assessment

    14

    March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e91001

    Trade-offs are ubiquitous in ES assessments and are of central

    importance in decision-making. Decisions can result in trade-offs

    between users of the same service, between different ES for the

    same users, or any combinations thereof, and have different

    meaning and relevance when considered over different space and

    time horizons [95]. There is currently no systematic methodology

    for addressing ES trade-offs, although guidelines meant for

    application with specific methods are appearing [96]. Systematic

    trade-off analysis is obviously not practical without a fully

    quantitative account of beneficiaries and accrued benefits. But

    modeling the multiple beneficiaries of a single ES can be difficult

    due to the collinearities resulting from rival services and societal

    feedbacks. An integrated approach where all such effects are

    modeled explicitly and simultaneously can help address the dual

    problem of access to and distribution of limited goods and services

    (‘‘winners and losers’’). For example, relatively simple outputs that

    hint at trade-offs can be obtained by intersecting multiple flow

    path outputs for a ‘‘bundle’’ of different ES, identifying landscape

    locations that are responsible for the transmission of a dispropor-

    tionate amount of one or more benefit within the area of interest.

    Such results can, however, only be obtained if multiple ES are

    modeled simultaneously – i.e., subjected uniformly to the influence

    of each scenario and their mutual effects on each other. This is

    difficult with most methodologies in use today, which are typically

    applied separately for each service. A common limitation of

    current ES practice is a narrow focus on single ES, or their

    ‘‘bundling’’ without explicit regard for their inextricable interac-

    tions. While the problem is widely recognized, even comprehen-

    sive and well-funded programs (such as REDD+ [97]) remain

    largely focused on a single ES and only hint at the integrated

    perspectives.

    By virtue of its computer-assisted modeling infrastructure,

    ARIES can produce integrated ES models with the same effort

    as those for single services. Land cover and other policy-controlled

    variables entering the models as inputs typically affect more than

    one service; the ARIES infrastructure ensures that a single

    dependency chain exists across the integrated model, so that a

    simulated policy intervention input affects all ES outputs. The

    granularity provided by ARIES in accounting for each class of

    beneficiaries also allows trade-offs between different stakeholders

    to be represented unambiguously, as each benefit and beneficiary

    is counted as an individual sub-model in the overall simulation.

    Even with improved methodologies, important limitations

    remain in the face of real-life, multi-stakeholder problems. For

    example, the different spatial and temporal scales that accompany

    each conflict or policy window require careful consideration of the

    assumptions made in an integrated model when planning

    scenarios and analyzing results. The ability to quantify flow paths

    and address individual beneficiaries does not solve all the

    difficulties inherent in modeling ES trade-offs. However, such

    results could be used within techniques such as multiple criteria

    analysis [98] to assess the concordance or discordance of a set of

    simulated outcomes with spatially explicit or aggregated social

    priorities [99]. Such techniques can help minimize conflict and

    rank the likelihood of successful outcomes when competing policy

    choices must be considered. The approach can assist when

    defining and analyzing complex scenarios, which from the user’s

    point of view simply become collections of modified data or

    models reflecting ex-ante predictions, such as modified land-use

    data or IPCC climate-change model outputs [100]. When a

    particular scenario in ARIES is selected for comparison with the

    baseline, the data and models contained in the alternative scenario

    override baseline conditions that would otherwise be used to

    model the same concepts. This way, scenario specifications will

    affect all levels of the model chain, and comparing results against

    baseline values will highlight all trade-offs when a full ES portfolio

    is evaluated.

    Increasing Participation and Valuing Community

    Knowledge

    Modularity and extendibility in modeling have two main goals:

    enabling a more flexible model assembly process and making it

    possible for independent communities to contribute knowledge

    that is reusable and linkable by design. ARIES was conceived from

    the start as a community process, where an initial model base

    contributed by the core team can be extended by modelers from

    diverse disciplinary backgrounds and application contexts. Be-

    cause the knowledge and model base are theoretically unlimited in

    size, the system can constantly ‘‘learn’’ to produce better models as

    new data and information are accumulated. Independent case

    studies can reuse model components or contribute new ones to

    expand the model base that, given its ability to rank and switch

    model components, can allow the system to grow and improve

    with application.

    Model validation through community adoption of complex

    paradigms is difficult and only possible over the medium- to long-

    term. Hopes of ‘‘viral’’ adoption for scientific projects in their

    beginnings are usually overenthusiastic at best. Yet interest in ES

    modeling is widespread and growing, and initiatives are in place to

    test this approach in practice. An intensive 2-week modeling

    school [101] is held annually by ARIES investigators; the models

    and ontologies resulting from associated workshops help address

    local problems brought in by participants while extending the

    existing model base for the benefit of future users. The first edition

    of the school, held in Spring 2013 [101], saw a large number of

    applications and the participation of thirty modelers and decision-

    makers from six continents with encouraging results. Preparations

    for the 2014 edition are currently underway. To support the

    growth of this community, ARIES development has prioritized the

    building of tools for model designers rather than model end users;

    the toolset used to develop and test ARIES models has been the

    primary focus of development, while the web 2.0 application

    designed for end users remains in an earlier stage.

    If the goal of building a model base with extensible coverage

    through community participation is achieved, the role of the

    model-ranking algorithms that select the most context-suitable

    model components will become increasingly important. Just as the

    success of web search engines depends on the page ranking

    algorithms they adopt [102], mechanisms that choose the ‘‘best’’

    model strategy can deeply affect model outcomes. This occurs

    despite the fact that models are merely assembled from well-tested

    and self-contained model components, that model choices are

    documented, and that ranking criteria can be inspected and

    modified by the user. In such cases, inclusion of crowd-sourced

    ratings of outputs from end users may prove useful. The current

    approach to ARIES capacity building, based on intensive

    application-driven case studies and courses focusing on ES

    problems of diverse nature, can also assist in developing and

    testing the effectiveness of different model-ranking strategies.

    Approaches based on careful community screening have proved

    very successful with relatively unstructured content (e.g., Wikipe-

    dia) but have not seen application in eliciting scientific data and

    models, where issues of validation are more nuanced and

    important. The consequences of choices in unsupervised, rule-

    driven model building may extend far and wide, and their full

    advantages and disadvantages will become clear only with

    continued use and development. In all cases, structural validation

    (both of semantic constraints through machine reasoning and by

    Adaptable and Robust Ecosystem Services Assessment

    15

    March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e91001

    solicited community feedback on the resulting models) is expected

    to play a large role in the future development, use, and delivery of

    ARIES as a service for decision makers.

    Conclusions

    Recent years have seen enormous demand for, and a growing

    supply of, decision maker-ready ‘‘tools’’ capable of quantifying ES

    for scenario analysis and improved decision-making [21,103].

    ARIES would most accurately be classified as a long-term research

    project based on a specific scientific interpretation of ES and a new

    modeling paradigm. Yet the method also addresses decision-

    makers as end users, which legitimizes the view of ARIES as

    another ‘‘tool on the market.’’ Moving a scientific target forward

    when potential users are so hungry for usable products is difficult,

    and efforts often had to be made to prevent community pressure

    for rapid developments from interfering with rigorous scientific

    thinking. The combination of a complex problem area where

    solutions are urgently needed but unifying theories, and even

    common definitions, are lacking is a serious hindrance to most

    applied sciences; this is particularly true for ES. In such cases,

    incompatible or weak assumptions may often be treated as equally

    legitimate and common validation criteria are difficult to identify

    and agree upon.

    Evaluation of the current ARIES effort against the criteria we

    laid out in the introduction shows both met and outstanding goals.

    While the goal of providing quantitative, spatially explicit results

    that account for uncertainty is addressed extensively, there are

    dimensions of ‘‘quantitative’’ – namely those relating to predicting

    non-linear dynamics and its policy implications – that can only be

    partially met at this stage. Also, while uncertainty information can

    be of great value in decision-making, our pilot experiences suggest

    that many end users are not yet equipped to consider it in the

    decision-making process. Identifying the best ways to use such

    information and to ensure its correct interpretation at the user end

    remains an open problem.

    In terms of resource requirements, ARIES proposes a different

    paradigm where user investments can be reduced drastically

    compared to methods that require extensive data gathering, pre-

    processing and supervision during model runs; yet, the achieve-

    ment of this paradigm depends on complex technology that will

    require time to reach a level of stability that satisfies user

    expectations, and abundant field testing will be needed before

    goals of parsimony and simplicity can be definitively achieved.

    The issue of open source and verifiability has similar corollaries:

    ARIES’ modeling platform and model base are both distributed

    under an open source license and every model is fully documented,

    but the novelty of the approach, use of BNs, and the considerably

    more expansive vision of ES emerging from ARIES outputs may

    yield initial impressions of opacity for some users. Areas where we

    believe ARIES can bring important innovations to the ES field are

    those of scalability and generalizability, due to the structural

    variability built into the modeling approach. This is of course

    contingent on satisfactorily addressing the novel challenges posed

    by the growth of a dynamic, modular model base. With respect to

    valuation, ARIES is currently not addressing the definition of

    ‘‘currencies’’ for ES results, either economic or non-economic, and

    relies on end users to interpret biophysical flow results as they see

    most appropriate. As integration proceeds with models that can

    more directly express value, such as those based on multiple-

    criteria analysis and value transfer, it will be easier to directly

    assess the added value of ARIES in meeting demand for valuation

    outputs.

    We believe that proper accounting for ES is one of the key

    scientific challenges for the new millennium, and that finding

    space for return-free intellectual development in this field can be as

    important as delivering methods to decision makers in the short

    term. The end goal of ARIES is both to seed new discussion in the

    science behind ES and to pioneer innovations in technology that

    can allow this science to become more readily usable to inform

    sustainable development. Important hurdles remain in achieving a

    vision as ambitious as the one described here. Yet, the field of ES

    has so far seen very simplified approaches aimed towards rapid

    assessment and quick policy advice. No current ES modeling effort

    has attempted to fully account for a coupled human-natural system

    dynamics that can only be investigated with in-depth and long-

    term scientific study. Indeed, the complex and multiple-scale

    modeling required for such assessments is likely to remain

    impossible or impractical, at least on a routine basis, for some

    time. Yet, with increased availability of remotely sensed data and

    low-cost computing power, more refined instruments to assist

    decision-making even in data- and resource-limited policy contexts

    become increasingly practical, and it is our hope that this work

    contributes to the scientific and policy discourse surrounding ES

    and their values.

    SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE ABSTRACT An Automated time-Lapse Electrical Resistivity
    Tomography (ALERT) system has been developed for the long-term monitoring of coastal
    aquifers. This ALERT system has been permanently installed in the River Andarax,
    Almeria, Spain to monitor and manage the impact of climatic change and land-use
    practice on the underlying Quaternary aquifer. An electrode array, nearly 1.6
    km long, has been buried below the normally dry riverbed with electrode take-outs
    at regular intervals of 10 m. The maximum depth of investigation is about 160
    m below ground level. An unmanned, permanent control station, in a secure location,
    allows the aquifer to be interrogated remotely from the BGS office in the UK.
    Volumetric geoelectric images of the subsurface can be obtained ‘on demand’ or
    at regular intervals; thereby eliminating the need for expensive repeat surveys.
    The entire process from data capture to image on the office PC is fully automated
    and seamless. The ALERT technology can provide early warning of potential threats
    to vulnerable water systems such as over-exploitation, rising sea levels, anthropogenic
    pollutants and seawater intrusion. The electrical images obtained (in space and
    time) are interpreted in terms of the hydrogeologic features including the seawater-freshwater
    interface. The timely detection and imaging of groundwater changes can help to
    regulate pumping and irrigation schemes. INTRODUCTION ALERT aims to develop a
    radically different strategy for monitoring and managing the impact of climatic
    change and land-use practice on scarce water resources. Monitoring groundwater
    properties by traditional borehole or well sampling is time-consuming, expensive
    and infrequent. Time-lapse surveys are now routinely deployed in geophysics (Johansson
    and Dahlin 1996; Tsourlos et al. 2003; Grellier et al. 2008) but the cost of manual
    repeat surveys can be prohibitively expensive. To overcome these limitations,
    innovative ALERT technology has been designed that allows the near real-time measurement
    of geoelectric, hydrologic and other properties ‘on demand’, thereby giving early
    warning of potential threats to vulnerable water systems. Permanent in-situ geoelectric
    measurements are used to provide surrogate indicators of hydro-chemical and hydrogeological
    properties. The ALERT survey concept uses electrode arrays, permanently buried
    in shallow trenches or attached to borehole casing (Kuras et al. 2005 2005; Ogilvy
    et al. 2007 2007, 2008 2008). This network is then interrogated from the office
    by wireless telemetry to provide volumetric images of the subsurface at regular
    intervals (Fig. 1). Once installed, no manual intervention is required; data are
    transmitted automatically according to a pre-programmed schedule and for specific
    survey parameters, both of which may be varied remotely as conditions change (i.e.,
    an adaptive sampling approach). The entire process from data capture to visualization
    on the web-portal is seamless, with no manual intervention. A similar but less
    integrated approach, has been described by Versteeg and Johnson (2008), Daily
    et al. (2004) and Versteeg et al. (2006). The ALERT technology and concept has
    been tested in the lower Andarax basin, Almeria, where the coastal aquifer is
    under threat from over-exploitation, rising sea levels, anthropogenic pollutants
    and seawater intrusion (Pulido-Bosch et al. 2006 2006; Jorreto et al. 2007 2007).
    OBJECTIVES The principal objectives of the project were i) to design new instrumentation
    for electrical imaging that could be permanently deployed in-situ and then interrogated
    using wireless telemetry to provide snap-shots of the subsurface at regular intervals,
    thereby eliminating the need for manual repeat surveys, ii) to relate the time-lapse
    geoelectric measurements to hydrogeologi-cal and hydrogeochemical properties and
    processes, iii) to develop a predictive numerical modelling capability to link

    resistivity tomography arrays and remote data transmission. This paper is concerned
    with the first objective only. Complementary studies on petrophysical relationships
    and numerical inversion (Nguyen et al. 2005 2005, 2007 2007, 2008 2008; Tsourlos
    et al. 2006 2006), hydrogeological modelling (Antonsson et al. 2007 2007, 2008)
    and decision support tools (Van Cauwenbergh et al. 2008 2008) are described elsewhere
    by the other project partners. THE ANDARAX COASTAL AQUIFER The study area selected
    for the project was the lower catchment of the river Andarax, Almeria, Spain (see
    Fig. 10). The large surface area of the catchment (almost 2,300 km2) encompasses
    a variety of physiographic, climatic and ecological conditions and land uses.
    Its climatic diversity is caused by its pronounced range in elevation (2,500 m),
    stretching from the mountain ranges that form the watershed of the catchment (Sierra
    Nevada, Sierra de los Filabres, Sierras de Gádor and Alhamilla) down to the coast.
    As a result, the climatic conditions range from the high mountain climate of the
    Sierra Nevada in the north and north-east (receiving more than 600 mm mean annual
    precipitation) to the coastal semi-arid climate (receiving some 250 mm) and the
    desert and sub-desert in the north-east of the catchment (200 mm annual rainfall,
    with marked evaporation). The climate determines both the vegetation cover and
    the ecosystems that occur, as well as the availability of water resources in the
    catchment. The river Andarax is usually dry but can be in spate two or three times
    each year. Despite this regime there has, in the past, been sufficient water for
    agriculture, forestry and urban water supply. However, more recently, horticultural
    cultivation under plastic has increased significantly and current water resources,
    including groundwater resources, are becoming limited. There is a growing need
    to employ recycled or desalinated water. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    Attaching downhole electrodes to borehole casing during drilling. The Andarax
    delta is a highly dynamic zone containing numerous changes in the vertical and
    horizontal planes, which make it difficult to establish a hydrogeological model.
    The shallow Quaternary aquifer comprises three to four metres of superficial silts
    overlying 30–40 m of coarse sediments that represent the prolongation of the alluvial
    deposits, (Pulido-Bosch et al. 1992, 2002). These deposits overlie finer Pliocene
    formations that form the impermeable base. The upper part of this marly, silty
    substratum contains some detritic levels, which form an artesian aquifer about
    10 m thick, whose piezometric level is very close to that of the free aquifer.
    The ALERT technology was developed to help regulate pumping and assess the impacts
    of over-exploitation on these shallow aquifers SURVEY METHODOLOGY ALERT system
    The ALERT prototype was deployed in the bed of the River Andarax, Almeria, in
    the lower part of the delta. The electrode array was buried in a trench about
    1 m deep and nearly 1.6 km in length, extending upstream from a point about 300
    m from the shoreline (Fig. 10). The riverbed is invariably dry for most of the
    year but flash floods often occur in the autumn and winter. The subsurface array
    has electrode take-outs at 10 m intervals. The permanent system used in the Andrarax
    has 288 electrodes all of which are addressable so any electrode array may be
    selected (e.g., Wenner, Dipole-Dipole or an optimized user-specified configuration).
    In this installation case however only 166 electrodes were selected. The array
    gave a maximum depth of investigation of ~160 m. For control purposes 3 deep boreholes
    were drilled through the Quaternary aquifer sediments into the relatively impermeable
    Pliocene marls at a depth of . These boreholes were spaced about 500 m apart on
    the line of the ALERT array to provide ground-truth and to assist image calibration.
    Electrode arrays of 100 m length with take-outs at 1 m spacing were attached to
    the outer PVC casing of two of the boreholes, from which 48 electrodes were selected,
    to facilitate surface-to-hole measurements (see Fig 3). The ALERT instrumentation
    (see Figs 4a and 4b) is located about 300 m from the river in secure housing,
    within a water treatment plant (Fig. 4c). The instrument is connected to a high
    capacity battery pack, battery charging source and a data communications link.
    It comprises a central processor that co-ordinates and controls all the major
    functions: data collection, storage and transmission. Subsurface cable conduits
    link the instrument to the array in the riverbed. The instrument is remotely configurable
    through customized software that can be run on a standard PC anywhere in the world.
    In this specific installation, it is linked to a BGS server via a PSTN modem interface
    – this being the cheapest of the available options. Other links are possible including
    satellite, GSM (GPRS, 3G) via a router or by direct internet link. Once installed
    the system has been designed to operate around a measurement schedule linked to
    specific command files that contain information on both the geo-electric measurement
    (resistivity, induced polarization, self-potential), electrode selections and
    data acquisition parameters (e.g., duty-cycle, number of stacks, standard deviation,
    sampling windows). In addition, the command files contain unique identifiers that
    allow resultant measurement data to be uploaded and automatically handled by the
    data management system. The system is serially based but has been configured to
    operate through TCP/IP protocols. Up to 100 scheduling events can be linked to
    locally stored command files. It is fully integrated in a single, field-hardened,
    water-proof sealed box, designed to withstand extreme conditions in remote localities.
    No PC is needed in the field. It is novel in the sense that one can install the
    system and literally ‘walk away’. A summary of the generic ALERT specifications
    is given in Table 1. The specific operational parameters used in the river Andarax
    are given in Table 2. Although the project ended in December 2007, the ALERT system
    is still acquiring data in real-time on a daily basis according to a pre-programmed
    schedule. These data are automatically captured, processed, stored in the relational
    data base, modelled and then displayed on a web-portal for future analysis (see
    Fig 5). Data have been collected using a Wenner-Schlumberger surface array and
    a Dipole-Dipole borehole electrode array. Reciprocal measurements were made by
    interchanging the current and potential electrode pairs and these results are
    shown in the histogram and cross-plot (Fig 6). Over 94% of all the reciprocal
    measurements agreed to within 2%. The inversion results are also of very high
    quality with minimal rms inversion errors (<3%). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer

    The technology has been shown to be robust and highly reliable for several years
    in a moderately hostile environment. Unfortunately, project funding expired before
    any detailed analysis of these time-lapse data sets could be carried out. This
    work is on-going, as and when resources permit. Data management The anticipated
    frequency of data acquisition and the unprecedented amount of raw data collected
    demanded a systematic approach to data processing and management. A fundamental
    component of the ALERT concept is the data management system, which is based upon
    a relational data base and implements a comprehensive relational data model for
    time-lapse ERT data. The data management system uses a Java-based architecture
    for web applications with a data base backend. The current deployment uses Open
    Source products for the relational data base(MySQL) and the J2EE application server
    (JBoss). The use of Open Source solutions contributes to the cost-effectiveness
    and portability of the ALERT data management concept. Figure 6 Open in figure

    7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Data processing pipeline. A schematic diagram
    of the project IT architecture is shown in Fig. 9. All functionality is provided
    by two central servers at BGS (Fig. 4d). A Dell PowerEdge 2850 hosts the data
    base and web application server (Fig. 4d). This machine also acts as a communications
    server by running customized control software, which automatically contacts the
    ALERT field system and controls the upload of measurement schedules and the download
    of measured data. A Dell PowerEdge 850 acts as a dedicated inversion server, running
    the numerical inversion code and accepting automated job submissions from the
    data management system (Fig. 9). The processing workflow for ALERT is illustrated
    in Fig. 7. After the field system has been set up to make scheduled measurements,
    it is polled at predefined intervals by the communications control software, using
    a telemetric link as appropriate. In the case of the River Andarax site, a dedicated
    phone line was used to establish contact. A screenshot of the control software
    is shown in Fig. 8. The main application window is subdivided into multiple tabs,
    each containing a particular aspect of functionality. The ‘Command Files’ tab
    allows the registration and upload of control sequences to the system, which can
    then be scheduled for operation at defined times using the ‘Unit Schedule’ tab.
    The ‘Modem Schedule’ tab determines the regime in which the remote system is contacted
    by the communications server via the appropriate telemetric link. The ‘Units’
    tab is used to register new field systems with the software and to store and maintain
    important information about these systems, such as serial numbers and details
    on telemetry. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Screenshot of the ‘Command
    Files’ tab of the PC Scheduler software used to remotely control the ALERT instrumentation.
    Once the control software has downloaded a data set, it automatically generates
    a raw data file in a designated watch folder on the data management system server,
    using a defined ASCII file format containing metadata alongside the resistance
    measurements. The data management system periodically scans this folder and automatically
    attempts to load any raw files that appear there. Using a predetermined set of
    inversion parameters, the data management system will then automatically generate
    an input file for the appropriate inverse modelling algorithm. This file is exported
    to the dedicated inversion server, where the inversion software is executed when
    triggered by a new input file. We are using the commercial Res2dinv and Res3dinv
    codes developed by Loke (2008). The output files generated by the inversion are
    written to another designated folder periodically scanned by the DMS. A Matlab
    script is automatically applied to model output files, creating appropriate visual
    output, such as 2D resistivity cross-sections or 3D tomograms. The resulting images
    are then displayed using the customized web interface of the data management system.
    Although a high degree of automation can be achieved with this methodology, it
    is usually necessary after installation to manually optimize results before finally
    automating the data collection procedure for long-term monitoring. Once the workflow
    is optimized for a specific site, the process from data capture to image visualization
    on the screen is seamless and automated for all further time-lapse data sets.
    Manual intervention is only required if automated quality checks fail or visual
    inspection shows large errors or dynamic changes in the image that would warrant
    a change in acquisition parameters (e.g., a change in sampling rate, or electrode
    configuration to better resolve a specific feature). Further developments are
    on-going to optimize image reconstruction (Wilkinson et al. 2006 2006) and to
    program the ALERT system for adaptive sampling based on predefined scenarios (trigger
    thresholds) to assist the pumping schedule. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    for electric-hydrologic imaging For ALERT images to be an effective surrogate
    for hydrogeo-logical monitoring it is important to have reliable petrophysical
    relationships for translating the electrical properties into hydro-logic parameters.
    This work is described elsewhere (Nguyen et al. 2005 2005, 2007 2007; Kemna et
    al. 2006 2006) and summarized in this issue (Nguyen et al. 2009). Briefly, laboratory
    derived relationships were used to convert the ALERT tomographic images of bulk
    electric conductivities (or resistivity) to water electrical conductivities. Freshwater
    saturated gravels are typically represented by resistivities of 1000 ohm.m or
    more; partially saturated sediments by 300–500 ohm.m and saline or brackish water
    by 1–10 ohm.m. The results indicate that the ALERT images can assist the recovery
    of hydrological parameters (e.g., salinity mass fraction) with a high degree of
    certainty and hence map the seawater-freshwater interface. Figure 10 shows a 2D
    ALERT image superimposed on an aerial photograph of the delta region. The image
    shows the influence of deep conductive saline water (dark blue), unsaturated surficial
    sediments (red) and a freshwater-saltwater mixing zone (green). The white dots
    denote buried electrode locations. The results show an increase in the depth of
    the saline interface inland, as expected. However, contrary to expectations, this
    image remained largely unchanged for the duration of the three-year project. The
    Andarax coastal aquifer system is complex and this behaviour is not easily explained.
    Our studies showed that large annual variations in inland hydraulic head levels
    (up to 7 m) did not generate corresponding hydraulic head variations in the delta
    area (Antonsson et al. 2007 2007). These tend to be only about 0.3–0.4 m. Thus,
    it appears that seasonal, annual or even hydraulic head changes over a few years
    have little effect on the hydraulic head in the delta area, indicating that the
    inland hydraulic head response and delta hydraulic head response are only weakly
    coupled. This limited connection explains why we observe only very small, if any,
    changes in the saltwater intrusion front. The primary factor controlling the saltwater
    intrusion in the coastal zone was found to be groundwater pumping for agriculture
    and horticulture irrigation, not natural forcing. Time-lapse images During the
    project anthropogenic activity had little short-term impact on the saltwater interface
    imaged by the ALERT installation. However, the flash floods that occur in the
    River Andarax during periods of high rainfall (mainly in the autumn) did induce
    detectable changes. These transient floods usually only last a day or two and
    hence the impact on recharge is rarely, if ever, captured by traditional sampling.
    Such a flood occurred on 22 September 2007 (Fig. 12). Figure 11 shows a sequence
    of time-lapse resistivity images captured by ALERT on the 19, 21 and 22 September
    2007. The data from 19 September 2007 were inverted using the Res2DInv software,
    with a finite-difference method, a complete Gauss-Newton solver, an L2 (smoothness)
    model constraint and an L2 (least-squares) data constraint, using the logarithms
    of the apparent resistivity data for stability (Loke and Barker 1995; Loke and
    Barker 1996). Subsequent data sets were inverted using time- lapse constraints
    to reduce image artefacts caused by data noise. Each subsequent set was inverted
    simultaneously with that from the 19th and used the preceding inversion as a reference
    model (i.e., the inversion of the 21 September data used the 19 September model
    as a reference; the 22 September data used the21 September model as a reference).
    An L2 constraint was imposed on the differences between subsequent models. The
    rms misfit errors for the 19, 21 and 22 September inverted models were 1.2%, 1.2%
    and 2.7%, respectively. Figure 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flash flood,
    river Andarax. The differential or sequential image (Fig. 11d) shows no change
    from 19–21 September but during the flash flood on 22 September there is clear
    evidence of infiltration. Although most of the surface water discharges as run-off
    into the Mediterranean Sea, the drop in formation resistivity (shown in blue in
    Fig 11e) can be attributed to freshwater saturation of the near-surface sediments.
    The increase in resistivity immediately below this drop (in red in Fig 11e) is
    probably an artefact of using a 2D inversion model for a heterogeneous 3D structure.
    It is likely that the larger misfit for 22 September is due to larger resistivity
    contrasts caused by floodwater at or near the surface electrodes. Such subtle
    effects are often difficult to detect with manual repeat surveys due to the inherent
    errors associated with re-locating the electrode positions. This illustrates the
    inherent benefits of permanent or semi-permanent arrays. CONCLUSIONS Preliminary
    assessment of the time-lapse ALERT images confirms that this technology can be
    used to map and monitor saltwater intrusion with greater confidence and efficiency
    than would be possible by the traditional sampling of wells. The results are supported
    by both 3D density-dependent flow models for the Andarax region and by localized
    measurements in deep boreholes. By tracking the freshwater-seawater interface
    from the ALERT images in near real-time, water resource managers and local regulatory
    authorities could assess the impact of pumping and irrigation on the aquifer depletion
    rate. This effectively removes, or at least minimizes, the need for the manual
    sampling of water samples and time-consuming laboratory analysis. This technology
    should not only permit a more sustainable approach to water management and conservation
    but will provide temporal and spatial sampling at a rate that has not previously
    been possible. ALERT should greatly assist our understanding of hydro-logic processes
    in coastal aquifers and provide more reliable evidence for high-level water management
    strategies, decision making and/or regional development planning. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    and content Abstract Environmental planning takes advantage of geographic information
    systems (GIS) to manage geographic data. GIS are, however, tools which require
    a great deal of training and programming expertise and, furthermore, have little
    support for decision makers during their planning activities. This paper presents
    WOrkflOw-based spatial Decision Support System (woodss) — a software developed
    at the University of Campinas, Brazil, to be used in conjunction with a GIS in
    order to provide spatial decision support involving environmental data. woodss
    was implemented on top of a commercial GIS and tested in the context of agri-environmental
    planning activities. woodss is centered on dynamically capturing user interactions
    with a GIS in real time and documenting them by means of scientific workflows.
    It keeps track of decision procedures, models applied and the choice of parameters
    in running these models. woodss''s workflows can be updated on the fly, allowing
    testing and comparison of alternative planning strategies. They can, furthermore,
    be used as building blocks for the construction of complex decision procedures,
    supporting a divide-and-conquer problem solution style. These workflows interact
    directly with the GIS, sparing environmental planners and decision makers the
    burden of low-level programming. Previous article in issue Next article in issue
    Keywords Geographic information systemsScientific workflowsSpatial decision support
    systemsEnvironmental planning 1. Introduction Spatial decision support systems
    (SDSS) are decision support systems where the spatial properties of the data to
    be analyzed play a major role in decision making. Usually, these properties refer
    to the data''s location on the Earth''s surface — the so-called georeferenced
    data. The term refers to data about geographic phenomena associated with its location,
    spatially referenced to the Earth [6]. Spatial decision support is one of the
    facilities that must be offered by environmental management information systems
    (EMIS) [18]. These are systems which are conceived to help users administer environmental
    information within an enterprise. One of the most important activities that must
    be supported by EMIS is environmental planning. This term encompasses a large
    set of planning and policy enforcement activities that have to deal with two (sometimes
    conflicting) objectives: exploitation of existing resources, to maximize profit;
    and preservation of these resources, to protect the environment. This type of
    planning is usually conducted collaboratively by groups of experts in different
    fields (e.g., earth and environmental sciences, agriculture, remote sensing, operations
    research) and may cover the entire life cycle of a given decision chain. For instance,
    in an agriculture context, it involves determining what to plant where (and when),
    how to prepare the soil, irrigation and fertilization policies, harvest and distribution
    logistics. The combination of {what, when and how} to {where} constitutes the
    core of spatial decision support, which must take into account the fact that solutions
    are valid for a specific temporal and spatial frame. A major tool in the framework
    of EMIS is provided by geographic information systems (GIS). A GIS is a software
    that provides mechanisms to store, analyze, manipulate and visualize georeferenced
    data. GIS are used to help decision makers in identifying geographic regions that
    satisfy one or more criteria, exploring spatial and temporal relations among georeferenced
    data and providing data for analysis and simulation models [40]. GIS are increasingly
    used to improve decision processes in environmental, urban and socio-economical
    applications. Even though the importance of GIS in spatial decision making is
    recognized, the capability of such systems is limited (e.g., Ref. [28]). They
    are, above all, pieces of software that provide a wide variety of analysis functions
    over georeferenced data, and offer advanced (cartographic) visual presentation.
    However, they do not provide any means for helping users select the appropriate
    functions to apply or to guide them in interpreting results. GIS can only be considered
    as SDSS insofar as they provide tools to generate different types of maps, from
    which EMIS users identify solution alternatives. Each map reflects the choice
    of a given set of models and decision procedures. The spatial decision process
    goes through two stages: (1) map generation using a GIS and (2) critical analysis
    of these maps. These stages can be iterated (e.g., critical analysis leads to
    generation of new maps), until planners are satisfied. Since environmental planning
    is a very recent activity, these stages are performed in an ad hoc manner, with
    insufficient documentation and very little support for interchange of expertise
    among groups of planners. Thus, a considerable amount of time is spent in reinventing
    solutions to problems, and much money is wasted in not profiting from past experience.
    The role of GIS within an EMIS and in spatial decision support is discussed in
    several contexts (e.g., Refs. 9, 18, 39). There is, however, consensus that more
    powerful tools have to be provided in order to help decision makers. This paper
    presents a computational tool which was developed with this objective in mind.
    This system, named woodss (WOrkflOw-based spatial Decision Support System), was
    developed in the Institute of Computing of UNICAMP. It is based on combining the
    concept of GIS as spatial decision support tools within an EMIS to the notion
    of scientific workflows [48]. The latter are a special kind of workflow suited
    to documenting and specifying scientific experimental activities within a laboratory.
    woodss captures planners'' interactions with a GIS in real time during their decision
    process, and has three main goals. ⋅ Documentation. Users'' interactions with
    GIS are monitored and transformed into an intermediate representation — scientific
    workflows. These are stored in a database (called WorkflowBase) to document previous
    solutions to similar spatial decision problems. This allows faster comparison
    between different methods for data analysis, promoting better conditions for participatory
    planning. As shown subsequently, this documentation format has the advantage to
    be easier to use and understand than standard GIS programming or interaction modes.
    ⋅ Support for decision making. This is ensured by the kinds of operations allowed
    by woodss. Indeed, workflows are not just yet another means of documenting planning
    activities, but also serve as executable specifications of these activities. This
    supports reproducibility of steps leading to a decision (an important asset in
    decision support systems). Furthermore, woodss allows interactive updating of
    workflows (thereby generating alternative decision procedures), their re-use as
    partial solutions to larger problems (again, fundamental in decision making) and
    their validation against predefined criteria (equivalent to validation of steps
    leading to a decision). ⋅ Modelbase construction. Scientific workflows present
    a concise notation for simulation models in environmental planning. Thus, at the
    same time that it allows documentation of user decision procedures, woodss also
    supports progressive construction of the Modelbase of the decision support system
    (dss). woodss was developed using the object oriented language Java™, and works
    in conjunction with idrisi [14], a GIS widely used in the environmental area.
    It is now being used by researchers and students of the Agriculture Engineering
    Faculty in UNICAMP, to document and speed up planning for agri-environmental problems.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. 2 Spatial decision support, 3
    Workflowsintroduce SDSS, and the application of scientific workflows to spatial
    decision support within EMIS. Section 4presents the woodss system architecture
    and Section 5mentions some implementation aspects and a case study. Finally, Section
    6presents related work and Section 7presents conclusions and future work. 2. Spatial
    decision support 2.1. Main issues A dss is a computer-based system designed to
    improve decision maker effectivity, by providing mechanisms to facilitate user
    interaction with data and analysis models 21, 45.4 A SDSS is a dss in which the
    spatial dimension of the data is fundamental to the analysis of decisions. Spatial
    decision support relies heavily on maps, which form the backbone upon which plans
    and policies are defined. Problems can roughly be classified into siting (i.e.,
    where to place some given object — e.g., a dam, a house, a park) and spatial allocation
    (i.e., for a predefined location, what is the best object among a class of objects
    to place there (e.g., a crop or building type). In the first case, the main issue
    is determining the location, whereas in spatial allocation the unknown is the
    object itself. Some problems may require combination of both characteristics (e.g.,
    in routing or urban expansion planning). Environmental planning, furthermore,
    involves studies of risk/impact assessment, and contingency planning, which combine
    what and where to when and how. Spatial decision making has traditionally been
    associated with the use of GIS. However, as stressed in Refs. 10, 28, GIS do not
    adequately support the spatial decision process because they lack the appropriate
    modeling capabilities and do not accommodate variations in context or process.
    If, on one hand, GIS lack support for spatial decision making, on the other hand
    current decision support systems do not provide adequate tools to solve spatial
    problems, especially those concerning environmental issues, which are fuzzier
    in nature than urban spatial problems. Indeed, traditional dss (e.g., Refs. 34,
    45) lack the cartographic presentation facilities essential to spatial decision
    making. Furthermore, traditional dss are frequently based on models which consider
    only one criterion, e.g., distance or cost functions to be optimized. In the spatial
    context, more complex realities must be considered, which must be analyzed through
    the combination of multiple criteria. Multiple criteria decision making techniques
    (e.g., Refs. 20, 24, 29, 47) allow users to select a satisfactory solution among
    alternative solutions, based on analysis of multiple criteria with different priorities.
    For example, erosion forecasts must consider factors such as land use, climate,
    slope, aspect and digital elevation model. 2.2. The spatial decision process The
    spatial decision process within an EMIS can be described as the repeated iteration
    of four steps, which are based on the methodology in Ref. [37]for the development
    of environmental planning applications. These steps, which have an immediate correspondence
    to the (non-spatial) decision steps described in Ref. [11]are: 1. Planning. This
    is a group decision making process and involves the definition of the objectives,
    the geographic area and the data and models to be applied. 2. Inventory/gathering
    of data. It consists in determining the relevant data and in collecting these
    data through, for example, air photos and satellite images. 3. Development. It
    corresponds to the implementation in a GIS of the models, using the data defined
    by the previous step. Models are implemented by constructing programs which invoke
    GIS functions. 4. Assessment. It involves impact assessment, interpretation of
    results and specification of policies. The first three steps correspond to the
    generation of a set of maps, whereas assessment consists in analyzing the maps
    to take decisions and calibrate the models employed. From a dss perspective, each
    map is the result of the execution of a model. Each map in the set may reflect
    an alternative solution scenario for a given problem, or the map set may describe
    complementary actions to be taken in a given situation. The entire process is
    complicated by the fact that data are very heterogeneous (e.g., collected by different
    devices, for distinct geographic scales and non-homogeneous spatial and temporal
    units) and that models vary according to the geographic region to which the problem
    applies. Thus, whereas map production for cartographic purposes is relatively
    straightforward (e.g., produce a map of the State of Parana in Southern Brazil,
    or the state of Bahia in NE Brazil), map production for spatial decision support
    is very complex. For instance, the models and simulations necessary to produce
    an erosion map for the State of Parana are very different from those applied to
    the State of Bahia, due to enormous differences in soil, climate, vegetation,
    relief and land use management. Data and models are furthermore temporally sensitive
    (e.g., seasonal changes) and subject to socioeconomical constraints. Assessment
    — map interpretation — is again dependent on the goals and expertise of the analysts,
    and on legislation and cultural issues. Thus, given one specific problem in environmental
    planning — e.g., define a schedule for sugar cane crop rotation for a specific
    region in Brazil — a multitude of map sets may be generated and, subsequently,
    multiple (and even conflicting) policies may be devised based on the maps. woodss
    provides support to the creation of maps, i.e., steps 1 through 3 of the decision
    process. 3. Workflows woodss is based on the concept of scientific workflows.
    A workflow denotes the controlled execution of multiple tasks in an environment
    of distributed processing elements [41]. It can be defined a set of tasks involved
    in a procedure along with their interdependencies, inputs and outputs. Each task
    is called an activity, and can be executed by one or more agents, in a given role
    — it is a unit of work. An agent is a person or software component able to execute
    one or more activities. Workflows are gaining increasing acceptance in the business
    world as a means of documenting and organizing procedures, as well as helping
    the coordination of groups. Workflows were conceived as a means for describing
    procedures in business environments which can be repeated over and over again.
    The goal of a workflow management system (WFMS) is to provide facilities to specify
    and execute workflows [8]. Traditionally, these systems distinguish between workflow
    modeling and execution. The modeling phase consists in creating a workflow specification,
    which is a description of activities, dependencies and agents. Activities may
    be automatic (executed by a software component) or manual (performed by a person).
    Dependencies describe constraints among activities and can be data, temporal and
    execution dependencies [41]. The execution phase consists in running (executing)
    a given workflow specification. 3.1. Scientific workflows The term scientific
    workflow 43, 48was coined to denote a specific kind of workflow which can be used
    to document and control the execution of scientific experiments and procedures
    — e.g., in DNA sequencing [33]or in geoprocessing 4, 32. Scientific work is characterized
    by a great degree of flexibility and presents a much higher amount of uncertainty
    and exceptions than business work. Thus, standard workflow mechanisms are insufficient
    to describe this kind of work. In business applications, the main motivation for
    introducing workflow management is the desire to “re-engineer” work to enhance
    efficiency. The motivation for workflow management in scientific applications,
    however, is less to enhance efficiency, but to control experiments, and to make
    available to scientific users the information on how experiments were conducted.
    Intuitively, scientific workflows differ from standard business workflows in two
    senses: (a) activities are experiment-oriented (as opposed to business-oriented);
    and (b) the “flow of the work” being modeled and the interactions among activities
    must support the trial-and-error and ad hocness of scientific experimentation.
    More precisely, scientific workflows are defined as extending traditional workflow
    functionality to support the following aspects 2, 43, 48. ⋅ Ad hocness and incompleteness.
    Scientific workflows can be executed even when incomplete. being progressively
    built during their execution. Modeling and execution phases are interleaved —
    it is only upon the completion of an activity that subsequent activities may be
    specified. Traditional workflows, on the other hand, must be totally specified
    before being executed. ⋅ Partial re-use. Scientific workflows differ from the
    traditional ones in the sense that they are considered to be building blocks for
    experiment specification. Thus, one can re-use partial workflows to specify new
    ones. ⋅ Abandon/rewind and dynamic modification. Scientific workflows allow not
    only re-executing an activity but also rewinding to a previous one, re-establishing
    its context and continuing the execution through another course of action, which
    corresponds to specifying a new workflow on the fly. ⋅ Tracing of invalid processes.
    In the scientific domain, decision processes are based in a trial and error mechanism
    (learning from mistakes). Hence, unlike business workflows, scientific workflows
    serve as a means to document both successful and unsuccessful processes. The latter
    should be, moreover, amenable to re-execution. ⋅ Specification from case. Traditional
    workflows are specifications that are expected to be executed frequently. Each
    such execution is called a case. Scientific workflows, on the other hand, may
    be executed only once (e.g., for unsuccessful trials). Furthermore, since they
    may be specified on the fly, their specification may be prompted by the case —
    i.e., the case defines the workflow, instead of the specification guiding the
    case. 3.2. Using scientific workflows to document environmental decision making
    We recall that map production is an important stage in spatial decision support.
    Users interact with GIS during their decision process to generate maps over which
    decisions are based. Some types of spatial decision procedures, especially in
    network-related problems, are already well understood (e.g., Ref. [36]). Environmental
    decision making is however still in its infancy, in part due to our yet incomplete
    knowledge of natural phenomena. Among the particularities of environmental decision
    processes, Mann [31]mentions: • The lack of precision in goal definition (e.g.,
    no standard definition for “sustainability” or “biodiversity”); • The complexity
    and dynamicity of the natural environment, where feedback paths entail evolution
    and continuous change; • The dependency of problems on the geographic scale, and
    the fact that the decision making process straddles many different approaches,
    reflecting planners'' varying views of natural phenomena; • Finally, several problems
    are new, sometimes one-of-a-kind, and do not occur frequently enough to warrant
    generalization of solutions or rigorous mathematical treatment. Environmental
    decision making has thus a strong component of empirical experimentation, with
    a long cycle of successive approximations through trial and error. It can thus
    be naturally expressed as a scientific experiment, in which the goal is to produce
    a map which will indicate how to solve a problem. woodss takes advantage of this
    analogy and uses scientific workflows to document and support spatial decision
    procedures for environmental problems. Environmental decision making through a
    GIS corresponds to defining and calibrating a model by using the GIS'' functions
    to construct a set of maps. Map generation is a partially ordered sequence of
    activities, which are related by data and control links. These activities intermingle
    direct interaction with the GIS (with the mouse) and coding (of macros or programs).
    This can be appropriately modeled by scientific workflows in the following aspects.
    ⋅ Ad hocness. Map generation in environmental planning has a strong empirical
    component, not being specified in advance but being determined during the decision
    process according to the GIS being used and the participants in the decision process.
    ⋅ Partial re-use. In spatial decision making, (parts of) maps can be combined
    to produce more complex maps. ⋅ Abandon/rewind and dynamic modification. The map
    sequences built during environmental planning are often discarded when users detect
    a trend that is not of interest. Map construction parameters can furthermore be
    dynamically modified by invoking distinct GIS modules to perform one given function.
    Decisions on which module to choose are data and context-sensitive — i.e., according
    to the way intermediate/partial maps look. ⋅ Tracing of invalid processes. Environmental
    planners often need to reproduce unsuccessful map generation procedures in order
    to identify error sources. ⋅ Specification from case. Many models are constructed
    while creating a map, rather than being specified in advance. This is a consequence
    of the fact that environmental planning involves many unknowns, and that often
    models have to be experimentally built from scratch. 4. The woodss system woodss
    is a system based on scientific workflows whose goal is to support spatial decision
    processes. woodss supports all characteristics of these workflows as defined in
    Section 3. Scientific workflows are used by woodss in three roles: (i) as a means
    for documenting a decision process; (ii) as high-level specifications of an environmental
    simulation model; and (iii) as executable parametrized specifications of decision
    procedures, which can be re-used and adapted for similar situations. Workflows
    stored in woodss can be queried to give a global vision of the work developed
    to solve a problem or to guide the resolution of similar problems. Furthermore,
    they can be launched to automatically re-execute analogous activities with different
    parameters. 4.1. woodss from a dss perspective A traditional dss architecture
    considers the interaction of three components: Interface, Database and Modelbase
    [11]. The interface interacts with a database management system (DBMS), which
    manipulates data, and a modelbase management system (MBMS), which manipulates
    models to be applied on these data. Fig. 1, adapted from Ref. [22], illustrates
    the architecture of woodss in this context.5 Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. woodss from a dss perspective. The GIS is responsible for handling georeferenced
    data and providing functions to execute the spatial analysis models. 4.1.1. Database
    A dss must manipulate internal (application) and external (for example, national
    and international policies) data, and user''s estimatives. Data may be queried
    by users or provided as the input to models. The DBMS must allow the combination
    and visualization of heterogeneous data and the manipulation of subjective data.
    In woodss, the Database encapsulates two kinds of data: georeferenced data used
    in the planning process, and which is manipulated by the GIS; and a WorkflowBase,
    which stores scientific workflow specifications and which use the other data to
    describe the map generation process in GIS. Both bases are stored in a relational
    database system. 4.1.2. Modelbase Models provide analysis capabilities to the
    dss. There are different kinds of models, depending of their purpose, the use
    of random parameters, their generality and their structure. The Modelbase of woodss
    consists of spatial analysis models (specified in terms of combination of GIS
    functions) and decision techniques employed by the users. The decision process
    for environmental planning often combines four types of models [18]: transport
    model (migration of substances in air, water or ground), process model (simulation
    of interactions of economical and natural agents), resource utilization model,
    and ecosystem model. The heterogeneity of issues encountered is exemplified by
    the variety of analytical and probabilistic models proposed (e.g., see Ref. [16]),
    whereas Ref. [35]presents over 100 methodologies for implementing models in environmental
    planning. Each model, in environmental decision making, can be specified in terms
    of its inputs (data files and parameter values), outputs (materialized in maps)
    and states [39]. Inputs, states and outputs can assume different values during
    a given simulation/experiment. The workflows of woodss document the execution
    of models, for specific parameters and inputs. They can, however, be re-executed
    with distinct parameters and inputs, thus, constituting a high-level specification
    of a set of simulation models. The Modelbase of woodss is geared towards process
    models, resource utilization models and some types of ecosystem models (for medium
    and small geographic scales). Transport models and ecosystem models for large
    scales would require the use of a more versatile DBMS, with active and object-oriented
    capabilities. 4.1.3. Interface The interface allows users to interact with models
    and data. This component requires a great part of the effort of system development.
    In woodss, the interface is coupled to a monitoring layer which intercepts user
    interactions, translating them into workflows stored in the WorkflowBase. 4.2.
    Architecture The architecture of woodss — illustrated in Fig. 2 — consists of
    five modules: Interface, Monitor, Update, Query and Workflow Manager. The Monitor
    module captures users'' interactions with the GIS, informing them to the Workflow
    Manager. The latter is responsible for managing the WorkflowBase. The Interface
    module allows users to graphically visualize and create planning processes and
    models in terms of workflows. It mediates user requests for browsing (Query module)
    and update (Update module) the WorkflowBase. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. woodss architecture. Coupling to the GIS is achieved by means of the Monitor
    module, which ensures adaptability of woodss to several GIS. Workflows, models
    and data are encapsulated in a database, managed by a relational DBMS. Spatial
    models are specified as workflows and executed within the GIS. This architecture
    isolates users from internal data storage details — scientific workflows can be
    stored in a standard database, and thus take advantage of standard DBMS functions
    such as query optimization and indexing. Furthermore, the architecture can be
    coupled to several GIS, since the Monitor is the only module that interacts with
    the GIS. Thus, coupling woodss to a GIS requires only customizing the Monitor.
    4.2.1. WorkflowBase The WorkflowBase is a relational database. It consists of
    set of scientific workflows and related metadata, stored in database relations
    (i.e., tables). Each workflow is specified in terms of activities, data, dependencies
    and agents, translated into a set of relation tuples (i.e., table rows). Metadata
    have a very important role in supporting browsing and data transfer in environmental
    information systems, serving as additional online documentation for automated
    tools and human users [8]. In woodss, metadata are used to document facts related
    to a workflow and to the associated decision making process. Each workflow is
    linked to a metadata record. This record contains information about the objectives
    of a decision process and the geographic area considered, both being necessary
    to identify the nature of the environmental planning problem being handled [37].
    The metadata record may include, furthermore, information about the author of
    the workflow and other additional data considered relevant (e.g., quality of data
    used). 4.2.2. Interface The Interface is the only module visible to the user,
    and transforms user query and update requests into appropriate sequences of commands
    to the other modules. It allows two types of interaction modes: • Textual — The
    user fills in parameters in predefined query and update forms. • Direct Manipulation
    — The user uses the mouse to manipulate workflow elements or click on some interface
    button. The first type of interaction is employed to browse the WorkflowBase —
    retrieving all workflows that satisfy a given set of conditions (e.g., concern
    a specific region). The second type of interaction typically occurs when the user
    has already retrieved the workflows of interest and either wants to examine or
    update them, or to select sub-workflows for execution or re-use. Both interaction
    modes hide from the user the fact that the storage and data management system
    is a relational DBMS. The interface just forwards user requests to the Update
    and Query modules, which interact with the Workflow Manager to transform these
    requests into SQL commands (to the database) or GIS macro programs (to the GIS).
    All the user ever sees are workflows (e.g., Fig. 3) or query/update forms (e.g.,
    Fig. 4). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. woodss main interface. Download

    4.2.3. Query module The Query module handles querying and navigation in the WorkflowBase.
    Users can request access to a specific workflow (by name) or sets of workflows
    (by keywords). Other typical queries are as follows. ⋅ Area-based queries. Users
    search for decision processes and/or models executed involving a specific geographic
    area. This allows finding out, for instance, all studies conducted in a given
    region. One example would be to find out if there is a crop yield forecast model
    for the area in question. ⋅ Problem-based queries. Users look for decision processes
    developed to solve problems with similar objectives, to take advantage of experience
    gotten in the resolution of the same problem over other geographic areas. For
    instance, a given erosion modeling procedure in one region may be adopted for
    other areas with similar characteristics. ⋅ Process-based queries. Users request
    to see the sequence of activities that originated a given map set. This could
    help determining the quality or precision of the set and, indirectly, of the decisions
    taken based on the data. 4.2.4. Update module The Update module mediates creation,
    removal or modification of workflows. A workflow can be updated in two ways. ⋅
    Component modification — The user requests insertion/deletion/modification of
    any workflow component (individual activities, data files, dependencies and agents).
    Metadata records can only be created by invocation of the Update module (equivalent
    to writing annotations on sets of activities). ⋅ Workflow creation — The user
    requests combination of existing workflows (e.g., by concatenating them). Commonly,
    experts approach a decision problem by solving sub-problems and combining the
    solutions. This type of update contemplates this approach to decision taking.
    Workflow creation is also performed by the Monitor module. 4.2.5. Workflow Manager
    The Workflow Manager is responsible for managing the WorkflowBase, handling the
    communication between the other modules and the DBMS, by translating the stored
    relations into workflows and vice-versa. Basically, it manages workflows according
    to two main functionalities: ⋅ Query/browse — retrieves workflows from the WorkflowBase.
    A user''s request via the Interface is transformed by the Query module into a
    set of SQL commands to the underlying database. The tuples retrieved are graphically
    presented to the user as workflows. These queries act both on metadata and on
    the workflows themselves. ⋅ Update — creates, deletes and modifies workflows by
    requesting updates on the corresponding relations stored in the WorkflowBase.
    Updates may be requested either by the Update module (user-originated) or the
    Monitor (during workflow generation). 4.3. Interaction User–GIS–woodss woodss
    caters to three kinds of user interaction modes (see Fig. 2). These modes support
    the aspects of scientific workflows defined in Section 3. (1) User–GIS. Users
    ignore woodss and interact with the GIS, to generate maps according to some model,
    which is translated into executing sequences of GIS functions. woodss monitors
    this interaction in real time and generates the corresponding scientific workflow
    specification (specifying workflows from the case). (2) User–woodss. Users interact
    only with woodss, querying and updating the WorkflowBase. Typically, this occurs
    when decision makers want to find out about previous solutions to a similar problem.
    woodss stores both successful and unsuccessful workflows, which allows not only
    re-use of past experiences (partial re-use), but also learning from past mistakes
    (tracing invalid processes), a very important factor in decision making. (3) User–GIS–woodss.
    This mode of interaction combines the previous ones. Users alternate between woodss
    and the GIS, using the information in the WorkflowBase to continue their decision
    process. This allows creating alternative scenarios and designing new decision
    strategies. In practice, this corresponds to querying the WorkflowBase to find
    the workflows of interest, selecting and combining parts of these workflows to
    create a new workflow, and having the GIS execute this new workflow (ad hocness
    and dynamic modification). 5. Implementation woodss was implemented on a PC platform,
    and the target GIS was idrisi for Windows version 2.0. The implementation was
    developed with the object oriented language Java™. The WorkflowBase is implemented
    as relations in a relational database, which is connected to Java through the
    JDBC interface. This section gives a brief description of the implementation.
    For more details, the reader is referred to Ref. [42]. 5.1. idrisi and woodss
    idrisi is a GIS developed to be used in microcomputers. It is widely used in environmental
    monitoring and natural resources management. idrisi records user interactions
    in a sequential log file, which was used as input to the Monitor module of woodss.
    User interactions (activities) with idrisi to generate maps are of three kinds:
    clicking at maps and invoking functions from a set of menus; typing commands;
    and running programs (macro files). Lines in the log file correspond to the execution
    of an idrisi function, or to an error or warning message. In the first case, the
    line contains the name of the function and its parameters, which vary according
    to the function and, possibly, a option in it. For instance, the log record “c:
    idrisiw Overlay w421 1 image1 image2 image21” indicates that function overlay
    was executed with option 1, using as input images stored in files image1 and image2,
    and producing as output image stored in image21. An image overlay corresponds
    roughly to adding the contents of the images to obtain a third image — e.g., an
    overlay of a soil and a vegetation maps will result in a composite map. This operation
    may be weighted — e.g., attributing weights to different values of soil and vegetation
    may result in a map indicating areas where conditions are good for planting a
    given type of crop. The Monitor module was implemented to read the log of idrisi
    in real time while it is being updated with user operations. It performs a syntactic
    analysis of the log file, identifying activities actually executed (which did
    not generate errors), disregarding messages and identifying activities that were
    not executed because of errors. The log analysis also allows detecting data dependencies
    among activities. Other types of dependencies cannot be derived from the log and
    must be provided by the user directly via the Update module. 5.2. WorkflowBase
    woodss WorkflowBase is implemented in the relational DBMS Visual FoxPro™, version
    5.0. Each workflow corresponds to a set of tuples stored in five relations: Activities,
    Data, Workflow, Metadata and Dependencies. The Metadata relation contains information
    about authors, objectives, geographic area and relevant comments. The Workflow
    relation maintains a record of the workflows in the WorkflowBase. Each activity
    corresponds to a tuple in the relation Activities. It contains an internal woodss
    identifier, a name descriptor, an indication if it is a manual activity or if
    it was executed in idrisi, pointers (i.e., in relational database terminology,
    foreign keys) to its input and output files, and activity-dependent parameters.
    Input and output files are used by the Workflow Manager to derive data dependencies
    between activities. The Data relation records all data files used and produced
    in a given decision process. Each file corresponds to a relation tuple, containing
    a woodss internal identifier and other parameters (e.g., file name). The Dependencies
    relation maintains data dependencies, as well as a restricted set of temporal
    and execution dependencies. Each tuple in this relation associates an activity
    (precedent) to another activity (subsequent) through pairs of internal identifiers
    (foreign keys). Furthermore, each tuple contains additional information which
    depends on the type of dependency being stored. For data dependencies, the tuple
    stores the file identifiers of files which are produced by one activity and used
    as input by another. Execution dependencies are represented in a similar way,
    signalling when the beginning of an activity depends on the successful termination
    of other(s). Temporal dependencies allow synchronizing activities. In woodss,
    they are specified only for documentation purposes, since their enforcement would
    require modification of the transaction mechanism of the underlying DBMS (e.g.,
    Ref. [41]). 5.3. Workflow Manager The Workflow Manager does not use a commercial
    WFMS. Rather, it is implemented within woodss to manage scientific workflows.
    Each log entry corresponding to an activity executed in idrisi is transformed
    in a tuple in the relation Activities. The Workflow Manager inserts a tuple in
    the Data relation each time a new file is referenced. It inserts a tuple in the
    relation Dependencies each time it determines that an activity uses a file generated
    by a previous activity in the workflow. This requires that the Monitor keeps track
    of all files mentioned in a log until the end of a given decision process (either
    successfully or unsuccessfully). Manual activities (e.g., command editing) and
    temporal and execution dependencies must be directly provided by the user through
    the Update module. 5.4. Query and Update modules Query and Update modules are
    responsible for the access to the WorkflowBase. Once a workflow is selected, users
    can query and update information about activities, data, dependencies and metadata.
    Query and update requests are forwarded by the Interface to the Workflow Manager,
    which translates them into SQL query and update (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE commands)
    to the five relations within the WorkflowBase. The result of these operations
    is returned to the Workflow Manager, and shown graphically to the user by the
    Interface module. 5.5. Interface The interface is responsible for the communication
    of users with the Query and Update modules. Fig. 3 illustrates the main interface
    of woodss. It depicts a partial workflow which is part of the case study discussed
    in Section 5.7. It consists of a set of buttons for user interaction and a workflow
    display window. Each rectangle represents an activity, and each arrow a dependency,
    which is labeled by file names (data dependency) or conditions (temporal or execution
    dependencies). Each activity is labeled with its name and, if executed in idrisi,
    the idrisi function is used. For instance, in the figure, activity Slope Calculation
    is linked to UserDefined Classification via the Slopes file, which is produced
    as output by the former and used as input by the latter. This means that there
    is a data dependency from Slope Calculation to UserDefined Classification. Slope
    Calculation is an activity performed by invoking idrisi function surface. Users
    can access the current workflow by clicking on the Current Workflow button (the
    third interaction mode), and navigate through the WorkflowBase clicking the WorkflowBase
    button. Once a workflow is shown in the workflow display window, users can query
    or modify its metadata record through the Metadata button, insert manual activities
    or dependencies through New Activity and New Dependency, respectively, or update
    workflow components. Finally, Begin Selection and End Selection buttons let users
    select a partial workflow. Activities and dependencies can be queried by clicking
    on the corresponding workflow graphical elements. Parameters displayed on the
    window are activity-dependent. Fig. 4 shows the result of querying the contents
    of the Slope Calculation activity. The Modify button, in the figure, is the one
    that allows update of activity details. 5.6. Re-execution and definition of new
    decision processes woodss provides the facility of re-executing sequences of activities
    performed in idrisi and that were documented through workflows. This way, users
    need not repeat their manual interaction with idrisi, which is time consuming
    and error-prone. If a workflow is updated for re-execution, it is considered to
    be a new workflow — akin to defining a new/alternative decision process for a
    given problem. Ideally, workflow launching would invoke a GIS directly. Unfortunately,
    because idrisi is a proprietary software, this is not possible. So, woodss automatically
    creates a macro file from the workflow. This file is made available to users,
    who can execute it on idrisi. This is a powerful feature of woodss, since it is
    equivalent to programming applications directly in a GIS using a workflow notation.
    It is a means of ensuring reproducibility of a sequence of steps in a decision
    process. Re-execution has two roles in a decision support process: (a) independent
    observers can analyze past procedures, to audit or validate them; (b) at the same
    time, similar problems can be approached in an analogous way. Users can select
    activities to be updated or re-executed. Fig. 5 illustrates the re-execution window
    after selection of four activities from the workflow in Fig. 3. The possibility
    of updating existing workflows is another plus offered by woodss. When the updates
    performed are just the change of input files or of parameters, without changing
    activities, this is tantamount to parameter tuning in dss. The most complex update
    is building new workflows from partial workflows. It corresponds to constructing
    the solution of a problem by combining solutions of its parts. Download : Download

    of workflow of Fig. 3. 5.7. Example of environmental planning using woodss We
    now give an example of an environmental decision making process using woodss.
    The workflow of Fig. 3 represents part of the solution for a siting problem described
    in Ref. [14], and which was adapted to Brazilian agri-environmental data. Given
    a certain region in the state of São Paulo, planners must identify areas which
    are appropriate for planting sugar cane. The main constraints are that these areas
    are characterized by (a) little or no declivity (to allow mechanical harvesting
    procedures), (b) close to waterways (for irrigation purposes), while at the same
    time keeping a certain minimum distance from (c) natural reserves and (d) forest
    areas, to avoid environmental degradation. Finally, they must be (e) close to
    highways, to ensure appropriate transportation of the cane to the mills, and (f)
    respect urban distance constraints (to avoid increasing urban air pollution).
    5.7.1. Beginning a planning session The user initially activates woodss and browses
    the WorkflowBase to check if there have been similar planning activities already
    performed for the same area (combination of area-based query and problem-based
    query). Browsing is initiated by clicking on the WorkflowBase button (see Fig.
    3). The user is next presented with a query form, with the options of indicating
    a specific workflow (by name) or filling in one or more fields. Suppose the user
    enters data in form fields Area — entering region coordinates — and Keywords —
    typing “sugar cane”. Query form parameters are checked by woodss against the Metadata
    relation, to retrieve all workflows that obey the conditions. 5.7.2. Situation
    1 — a previous solution for the solution for the problem exists Assume first that
    woodss finds a workflow that answers the request. It is then presented to the
    user, who can either re-execute it on idrisi, or update it and execute the new
    updated version. Updating includes, among others, changing input files (e.g.,
    running the workflow for the new region), changing parameters (e.g., tuning),
    modifying workflow dependencies and attributes or creating new dependencies and
    activities (by clicking on New Activity and New Dependency interface buttons).
    Workflow (re)execution corresponds to asking woodss to translate the workflow
    into idrisi executable code. Fig. 6, for instance, corresponds to the idrisi code
    generated by woodss for the partial workflow of Fig. 3. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. idrisi code generated by execution of workflow of Fig. 3. 5.7.3.
    Situation 2 — no previous solution exists Suppose, on the other hand, that woodss
    does not find any workflow to satisfy the request. In this situation, the user
    must start a new decision procedure by interacting directly with idrisi. As soon
    as the user switches to idrisi, woodss initializes a new (empty) workflow called
    Current Workflow, and the Monitor module will start capturing into it user interactions
    in real time. According to the user''s decision strategy, the first constraints
    to be checked will be those concerning declivity (a) and forest/reserve (c, d)
    constraints. The actual interaction with idrisi is as follows. First, the user
    invokes the idrisi Surface operation on relief data, to obtain a declivity map,
    and then classifies the areas in this map according to the gradient (e.g., feeble,
    medium, high) using a Reclass operation. Next, the user finds out which areas
    are under environmental protection (by identifying reserves and forests in a land
    use map), and pinpoints regions according to distance from the reserves (Distance
    operation), again reclassifying the result into distance zones. The user then
    combines all these maps into an intermediate map by applying successive Overlay
    operations. The result is an intermediate map that indicates areas where sugar
    cane can be planted as far as (a) declivity, (c) forest and (d) reserves constraints
    are concerned. There still remains to further restrict these areas according to
    (b) irrigation, (e) transportation and (f) urban constraints. Suppose however
    the user wants to interrupt this decision procedure, to check the steps taken
    so far. In order to do this, the user can switch to woodss main interface window
    and click on the Current Workflow button. Immediately, the user will see the current
    execution state displayed on Fig. 3. Internally, this is handled as an SQL query
    (Query module) to the WorkflowBase, asking for the Current Workflow. Once the
    user examines the current workflow, there are three options to choose to continue
    the spatial decision process: (i) to go back to idrisi, in which case the current
    workflow will continue being constructed in real time by woodss (the user is happy
    with what has been done so far); (ii) to select just part of this workflow, optionally
    editing it by adding activities and dependencies, and having it executed as the
    beginning of a new decision procedure (just some of the steps taken were appropriate)
    — see Fig. 5; or (iii) to abandon the current execution and start a new one. In
    the last two cases, the user can indicate whether the abandoned current workflow
    should be stored in the WorkflowBase as an incomplete/erroneous solution. Also,
    at any time, the user can enter metadata and update and query information on the
    WorkflowBase. After several such interactions, the user comes up with the final
    map which indicates the regions suitable for sugar cane plantation. This map must
    be examined in a context which involves other related information, which does
    not concern this paper. Fig. 7 shows a partial screen copy of this map, in the
    area of the county of Campinas. The corresponding full workflow will not be shown
    here, for readability reasons. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Regions
    suitable for planting sugar cane. 5.7.4. Situation 3 — participatory planning
    Even though the example describes the work of a single user, it can also concern
    several users cooperating to develop a solution using the workflows as a communication
    means. For instance, one user can develop the first part (Fig. 3), and some other
    user can develop another part, and the final result is obtained by combining the
    workflows and executing this composite workflow. Or groups of users can develop
    partial or alternative solutions at different times, and keep track of what everyone
    is doing by looking at the respective workflows. 6. Related work The work presented
    in this paper is related to two research fields: use of scientific workflows for
    experimental activities in a laboratory, and use of GIS in spatial decision support,
    within an EMIS. This paper reports the first attempt to link both contexts and
    implement them into a single tool. Scientific workflows are a relatively new concept
    in the area of workflow management, and their use is still a matter of research.
    They have been reported as a means of documenting and keeping track of activities
    in a scientific environment. Research in the area is related to their use in specific
    domains, varying from their capacity to support collaborative scientific task
    execution (e.g., Ref. [2]), long transaction capability [43]and, more specifically,
    their suitableness for documenting geoprocessing tasks 4, 50. The emphasis, however,
    is on task execution and documentation, and not their role in decision support.
    Furthermore, unlike woodss, there is no implementation which allows direct linking
    to a GIS. On the other hand, there are many proposals for extending GIS to provide
    spatial decision support. These proposals can be roughly classified into (a) case
    study presentation, (b) model implementation and (c) architecture and system design.
    Approaches vary between considering a GIS as the spatial dss itself, to building
    or proposing a dss which will take advantage of data stored within a GIS. Case
    study presentations are centered on showing how the use of a GIS'' functions and
    cartographic display improves decision making in specific problems. The examples
    in Ref. [23]show how environmental problems often fall into a multi-criteria multi-objective
    situation, complicating the decision process. Other examples of case studies solved
    by extending GIS are found in Refs. [13](evaluation of health risk awareness and
    assessment in the Philippines), [7](use in environmental study support), or [49](role
    in strategic policy analysis concerning the environment). Model implementation
    studies concern the building of tools that help spatial analysis studies within
    or in parallel to a GIS. This approach consists in “hardwiring” a set of models
    into a GIS for a given problem domain. As remarked by Ref. [28], the GIS will
    provide the database and interface component of the dss and the added module will
    contain the models. Examples are Refs. [46](tools which apply probabilistic Bayesian
    networks to combine geographic information), [15](application of expert systems
    to environmental planning), 24, 30(application of multi-criteria techniques to
    GIS tools for decision support), [12](facility location in an urban environment),
    [36](transportation planning) and [47](industrial siting). The three last studies
    are also examples of the growing work which integrates GIS and operations research
    for decision support. Even though helpful in understanding the variety of issues
    involved in spatial decision processes, these studies do not help the more general
    problem, namely, how to construct SDSS. woodss can be placed within this category.
    Examples of this type of research are the work of Refs. 1, 5(both of which propose
    a general architecture for environmental decision support), [27](which provides
    an analysis of the multiple roles of GIS in spatial decision support), [25](environment
    for group work) and [26](for collaborative environmental planning on the www).
    Except for this last work, which actually implemented a documentation and mediation
    system on the Web, the others present architectures without implementation. This
    is not to say that implementations do not exist. However, they are of limited
    scope, and usually do not take advantage of combining GIS facilities to decision
    support capabilities. The emphasis in Ref. [26], as opposed to woodss, is in the
    collaborative (discussion) issues involved in environmental planning, rather than
    on the modeling itself. From a functionality point of view, woodss approaches
    the work in Ref. [17]. The latter is based on the fact that modeling is one of
    the key activities necessary to solve a complex problem, and that therefore a
    system which supports modeling will enhance decision making activities. Their
    system is based on allowing users to define and simulate several types of models,
    and storing these models in a model base. The system is geared towards users who
    are able to understand equations, motivated by environmental modeling. A similar
    system is described in Ref. [44], in the context of environmental process modeling.
    The paper describes a computational environment for characterizing scientific
    modeling methods, in order to support representation, manipulation and evaluation
    of scientific concepts. Models are constructed in terms of R-structures (representation
    structures), which are abstract representations of a concept (similar to the concept
    of abstract data types). The dynamics of real world processes are modeled through
    sequences of R-structure instance transformations. These ideas were applied to
    building a computational modeling environment — Amazonia — which supports large
    scale hydrologic research. Finally, the work in Ref. [39]concentrates on building
    an object-oriented modelbase for environmental systems. This allows flexible model
    construction and enhances the possibility of smooth modelbase expansion. woodss,
    though based on the same premises as Refs. 17, 39, 44(i.e., considering model
    definition and documentation as central to a spatial dss), generalizes them by
    the following. ⋅ It is not restricted to users who understand mathematical models
    (or a specific GIS programming language), but also directed towards managers,
    planners and environmental scientists. ⋅ Its use of scientific workflows unifies
    activities of model specification and execution. Indeed, due to their nature,
    workflows act both as a documentation media (similar to the R-structures in Ref.
    [44]) and as executable entities (as in the models in Ref. [39]). ⋅ Rather than
    demanding that users always specify a model, it allows the construction of the
    model by capturing user interactionswith a GIS. Thus, it can both be used in a
    spatial dss sense (when pre-existing models are selected for execution) as well
    as a model construction tool (as in Ref. [39]). ⋅ Unlike all other approaches,
    it is integrated within a GIS context. Therefore, users can simulate their models
    directly on the GIS. Furthermore, woodss is loosely coupled to the GIS via the
    Monitor module. Thus, it can be used in other GIS environments, contingent on
    coding the interface between the GIS and the Monitor module. 7. Concluding remarks
    This paper presented woodss — an SDSS for an EMIS, whose goal is to help experts
    in the environmental area to solve their decision problems. woodss is centered
    on dynamically monitoring user activities in a GIS and documenting them using
    scientific workflows. Besides documenting decision processes on the fly, these
    workflows also constitute a means of progressively enriching the modelbase. They
    can be used to guide experts in solving analogous problems, or as partial solutions
    to a bigger problem, allowing a global view of the current state of a decision
    process, and helping to justify decisions. This is especially important in environmental
    planning, which involves a large volume of activities and data, and where decision
    making is primordially multi-participant. woodss was tested with real environmental
    data and applications for agri-environmental planning, for the state of São Paulo,
    Brazil. More specifically, it was used in constructing alternatives for implementing
    a soil erosion model, in a study of land suitability for sugar cane plantations
    (superficially described in Section 5) and in delimitation of conservation areas
    for sustainable agriculture. Some of the users involved in these applications
    did not know how to use the GIS, but adapted easily to the workflow representation.
    Among the basic characteristics that DSS should satisfy, and which are contemplated
    by woodss, we can cite: • To help users who have different kinds of knowledge
    and expertise. • To adapt to changes in computational environment and decision
    styles. • To offer an interactive user-friendly interface. • To support non linear
    executions, allowing users to give up or re-consider solution scenarios. • To
    facilitate the dynamic addition of new knowledge obtained from previous expertise.
    • To document decision and decision processes to justify decisions or re-use them
    in other processes. Ongoing work involves extensions to the implementation and
    extensions to the architecture of woodss. From an implementation point of view,
    extensions being explored involve building a Monitor module for another GIS and
    generalizing the WorkflowBase to accommodate dynamic constraints. The WorkflowBase
    must also be ported to a more sophisticated DBMS, in order to handle large data
    sets. From a theoretical point of view, the notion of metadata must be extended
    to accommodate geographic metadata standards (e.g., Ref. [19]) and enhance metadata
    indexing. Another important issue will be analyzing the use of woodss in other
    spatial decision support contexts (e.g., utility management or transportation).
    A possible extension would be to add an intelligent learning module to the monitor,
    to help detect work patterns and identifying, from user interactions with the
    GIS, already stored workflows. This will be approached using case-based reasoning.

    https://doi.org/10.1006/jema.2000.0372 Get rights and content Abstract Water catchments
    are functional geographical areas that integrate a variety of environmental processes
    and human impacts on landscapes. Integrated assessments recognize this interdependence
    of resources and components making up water catchments and are vital for viable
    long-term natural resource management. This paper couples eco-hydrological modelling
    with remote sensing, landscape ecological analyses and GIS to develop a series
    of indicators of water catchment health as part of a geographical audit of environmental
    health and change at regional scales. Indicators are simple measures that represent
    key components of the system and have meaning beyond the attributes that are directly
    measured. A suite of indicators, many capable of measurement from remote sensing
    data sources, are described that represent state (condition) and trend (changes
    across space and time) and focus on the physical, biological and chemical properties
    of water catchments, as well as their ecological function (stability, resilience,
    and sensitivity). Models implemented in GIS allow indicators to be combined within
    water catchments by setting them within a specific geographic context and integrating
    the descriptions of environmental variability across the geographic area. This
    spatial integration is necessary to place individual, site-specific indicators
    within a broader geographic context; the models allow this context to reflect
    the ecological and hydrological functioning of the water catchment. Scale and
    other geographic effects associated with integration are managed using an approach
    that partitions the landscape into a hierarchical series of nested functional
    units. Methods from image analysis, landscape ecological analysis, spatial interpolation,
    and numerical process modelling are integrated within a GIS (ArcView) to provide
    a single environment within which to conduct the study. Results are described
    from the catchment of the upper Yellowstone River in the Rocky Mountains, USA,
    an area of about 14 000 km2. The river source is in Yellowstone National Park.
    The catchment is subject to a number of land-use issues notably those associated
    with changing patterns and types of land use including forestry, irrigated agriculture,
    range management, wildfire, mining, summer and winter recreation, and residential
    development, which are associated with a number of land-use conflicts and impacts.

    many of the Big Data challenges in this domain. MERRA Analytic Services (MERRA/AS)
    is an example of cloud-enabled CAaaS built on this principle. MERRA/AS enables
    MapReduce analytics over NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research
    and Applications (MERRA) data collection. The MERRA reanalysis integrates observational
    data with numerical models to produce a global temporally and spatially consistent
    synthesis of 26 key climate variables. It represents a type of data product that
    is of growing importance to scientists doing climate change research and a wide
    range of decision support applications. MERRA/AS brings together the following
    generative elements in a full, end-to-end demonstration of CAaaS capabilities:
    (1) high-performance, data proximal analytics, (2) scalable data management, (3)
    software appliance virtualization, (4) adaptive analytics, and (5) a domain-harmonized
    API. The effectiveness of MERRA/AS has been demonstrated in several applications.
    In our experience, Cloud Computing lowers the barriers and risk to organizational
    change, fosters innovation and experimentation, facilitates technology transfer,
    and provides the agility required to meet our customers’ increasing and changing
    needs. Cloud Computing is providing a new tier in the data services stack that
    helps connect earthbound, enterprise-level data and computational resources to
    new customers and new mobility-driven applications and modes of work. For climate
    science, Cloud Computing’s capacity to engage communities in the construction
    of new capabilities is perhaps the most important link between Cloud Computing
    and Big Data. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords MapReduceHadoopData

    The term “Big Data” is used to describe data sets that are too large and complex
    to be worked with using commonly-available tools (Snijders, Matzat, & Reips, 2012).
    Climate science represents a Big Data domain that is experiencing unprecedented
    growth (Edwards, 2010). NASA’s climate change repositories alone are projected
    to grow to 350 petabytes by 2013 (Skytland, 2012). Some of the major Big Data
    challenges facing climate science are easy to understand: large repositories mean
    that the data sets themselves cannot be moved: instead, analytical operations
    need to migrate to where the data reside; complex analyses over large repositories
    requires high-performance computing; large amounts of information increases the
    importance of metadata, provenance management, and discovery; migrating codes
    and analytic products within a growing network of storage and computational resources
    creates a need for fast networks, intermediation, and resource balancing; and,
    importantly, the ability to respond quickly to customer demands for new and often
    unanticipated uses for climate data requires greater agility in building and deploying
    applications. It is useful to situate the Big Data challenges of the climate domain
    in this larger context, because doing so helps us understand where innovation
    can yield improvements. Cloud Computing is one of several technologies often invoked
    as a solution to Big Data challenges. However, the technical definition of “Cloud
    Computing” is so variously interpreted that the term has become jargonized (Mell
    & Grace, 2011). That Cloud Computing is both ubiquitous and ambiguous points to
    the need to examine carefully how Cloud Computing enables. 1.1. Climate Analytics-as-a-Service
    (CAaaS) In our efforts to address the Big Data challenges of climate science,
    we are moving toward a notion of Climate Analytics-as-a-Service (CAaaS). We focus
    on analytics, because it is the knowledge gained from our interactions with Big
    Data that ultimately produce societal benefits. We focus on CAaaS because we believe
    it provides a useful way of thinking about the problem: a specialization of the
    concept of business process-as-a-service, which is an evolving extension of IaaS,
    PaaS, and SaaS enabled by Cloud Computing. Within this framework, Cloud Computing
    plays an important role; however, we see it as only one element in a constellation
    of capabilities that are essential to delivering climate analytics as a service.
    These elements are essential because in the aggregate they lead to generativity
    – a capacity for self-assembly that we feel is the key to solving many of the
    Big Data challenges in this domain. 1.2. Generative technologies Generativity
    refers to a system’s capacity to produce unanticipated change through unfiltered
    contributions from broad and varied audiences (Zittrain, 2008). The concept highlights
    aspects of an innovation or process that enable an autocatalytic feeding-forward
    that can help make growth, further innovation, and success possible. Generativity
    connects inputs from diverse people and groups, who may or may not be working
    in concert, with emergent and unanticipated outputs. How much the system facilitates
    participant contribution is a function of both technological design and social
    behavior (Baker & Bowker, 2007). A system’s generativity describes not only its
    objective characteristics, but also the ways the system relates to its users and
    the ways users relate to one another. In turn, these relationships reflect how
    much the users identify as contributors or participants, rather than as mere consumers.
    The Internet itself, modern operating systems, Apple’s iTunes, Twitter, Facebook,
    and the emerging infrastructure for mobile application development are examples
    of generative systems. In both cases, the design elements contributing to their
    generative potential are easy to see. The Internet’s framers made simplicity a
    core value, defining in the process the classic end-to-end argument that most
    features in a network should be implemented at its computer endpoints rather than
    by the network itself, which appropriately implements only those functions that
    are universally useful (Saltzer, Reed, & Clark, 1984). To do otherwise might have
    tilted the generic network toward specific uses and limited its potential for
    growth. (Consider, for example, the proprietary, non-generative, and now defunct
    CompuServe network.). Zittrain (2008) identifies five properties of generative
    systems: (1) How extensively a system or technology leverages a set of possible
    tasks: Leverage makes a difficult job easier, and, in general, the more a system
    can do, the more capable it is of producing change. (2) How well it can be adapted
    to a range of tasks: Adaptability enables new, unintended, and innovative uses
    of a technology. It broadens the technology’s use. (3) How easily new contributors
    can master it: Ease of Mastery reflects how easy it is for broad audiences to
    understand how to adopt and adapt it. The more useful a technology is both to
    the neophyte and the expert, the more generative it is. (4) How accessible it
    is to those ready and able to build on it: Accessibility makes it easier to obtain
    the technology and the information necessary to achieve mastery. The more accessible,
    the more generative. (5) How transferable any changes are to others, including
    non-experts: Transferability reflects how easily changes in the technology can
    be conveyed to others. A major deficiency in any one factor greatly reduces overall
    generativity. Conversely, the more these five qualities are maximized, the easier
    it is for a system to welcome contributions from outsiders as well as insiders.
    In general, generative tools are more basic and less specialized for accomplishing
    a particular purpose. In the remainder of this paper, we illustrate how we are
    translating these concepts into reality: we describe the context in which we are
    working; the technology foundations important to us, including our definition
    and rationale for the generative elements we feel are crucial; a specific project,
    MERRA Analytic Services, and applications that demonstrate these capabilities
    in action; ways that Cloud Computing are contributing to the effort; and, finally,
    our plans for the future. 2. Background – The NASA Center for Climate Simulation
    and climate science as a Big Data domain Our understanding of the Earth’s processes
    is based on a combination of observational data records and mathematical models.
    The size of NASA’s space-based observational data sets is growing dramatically
    as new missions come online. However, a potentially bigger data challenge is posed
    by the work of climate scientists, whose models are regularly producing data sets
    of hundreds of terabytes or more (Edwards, 2010, Webster, 2013). The NASA Center
    for Climate Simulation (NCCS) provides state-of-the-art supercomputing and data
    services specifically designed for weather and climate research (NCCS, 2013).
    The NCCS maintains advanced data capabilities and facilities that allow researchers
    within and beyond NASA to create and access the enormous volume of data generated
    by weather and climate models. Tackling the problems of data intensive science
    is an inherent part of the NCCS mission. There are two major challenges posed
    by the data intensive nature of climate science. There is the need to provide
    complete lifecycle management of large-scale scientific repositories. This capability
    is the foundation upon which a variety of data services can be provided, from
    supporting active research to large-scale data federation, data publication and
    distribution, and archival storage (Berman, 2008). We think of this aspect of
    our mission as climate data services. The other data intensive challenge has to
    do with how these large datasets are used: data analytics – the capacity to perform
    useful scientific analyses over enormous quantities of data in reasonable amounts
    of time. In many respects this is the biggest challenge; without effective means
    for transforming large scientific data collections into meaningful scientific
    knowledge, our mission fails. It is against this backdrop that the NCCS began
    looking at CAaaS as a potential element in our technological and organizational
    response to changing demands. 3. Technology foundations – Toward a generative
    ecology for Climate Analytics-as-a-Service We believe there are five essential
    technology elements that contribute to building a generative context for Climate
    Analytics-as-a-Service: high-performance, data-proximal analytics; integrative
    data management; software appliance virtualization; adaptive analytics; and domain-harmonized
    APIs. In this section, we describe what we mean by these terms and demonstrate
    how we are implementing the concept. 3.1. High-performance, data-proximal analytics
    (MapReduce) Clearly, at its core, CAaaS must bring together data storage and high-performance
    computing in order to perform analyses over data where the data reside. MapReduce
    is of particular interest to us, because it provides an approach to high-performance
    analytics that is proving to be useful to many data intensive problems in climate
    research (Dean and Ghemawat, 2008, Duffy et al., 2011, Duffy et al., 2012, Tamkin,
    2013). As typically implemented, MapReduce enables distributed computing on large
    data sets using high-end computers. It is an analysis paradigm that combines distributed
    storage and retrieval with distributed, parallel computation, allocating to the
    data repository analytical operations that yield reduced outputs to applications
    and interfaces that may reside elsewhere. Since MapReduce implements repositories
    as storage clusters, data set size and system scalability are limited only by
    the number of nodes in the clusters. While MapReduce has proven effective for
    large repositories of textual data, its use in data intensive science applications
    has been limited (Buck et al., 2011), because many scientific data sets are inherently
    complex, have high dimensionality, and use binary formats. MapReduce distributes
    computations across large data sets using a large number of computers (nodes).
    In a “map” operation a head node takes the input, partitions it into smaller sub-problems,
    and distributes them to data nodes. A data node may do this again in turn, leading
    to a multi-level tree structure. The data node processes the smaller problem,
    and passes the answer back to a reducer node to perform the reduction operation.
    In a “reduce” step, the reducer node then collects the answers to all the sub-problems
    and combines them in some way to form the output – the answer to the problem it
    was originally trying to solve. Borrowing from the LISP family of functional programming
    languages, the map and reduce functions of MapReduce are both defined as data
    structured in <key, value> pairs (HDFS, 2013). 3.2. Scalable data management (iRODS)
    The core data management infrastructure for CAaaS must enable collections scalability,
    rich metadata management, and federated discovery and access (Agrawal, Das, &
    Abbadi, 2011). For us, iRODS plays a central role. The Integrated Rule-Oriented
    Data Systems, or iRODS, is an open source data grid software system being developed
    by the Data Intensive Cyber Environments (DICE) group and the Renaissance Computing
    Institute (RENCI) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (iRODS, 2013).
    It is described by its creators as peer-to-peer data grid middleware that provides
    a facility for collection-building, managing, querying, accessing, and preserving
    data in a distributed data grid framework. A key feature of iRODS is its capacity
    to apply policy-based control when performing these functions. iRODS appeals to
    us for several reasons. It targets large repositories, large data objects, digital
    preservation, and integrated complex processing, making it one of the more promising
    technologies for grid-centric data services for scientific applications. We also
    like the fact that its development culture has historic roots in digital libraries,
    persistent archives, and real-time data systems research, having received support
    from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Archives and Records Administration
    (NARA). The iRODS data grid system consists of several components. It has a metadata
    catalog server, called the iCAT, which provides metadata and abstraction services.
    There can be multiple resource servers that provide access to storage resources.
    A resource server (iRES) can provide access to more than one storage resource,
    and the system can support any number of clients at a time. A client can connect
    to any server on the grid and request access to digital objects from the system.
    The request is parsed using the contextual and system information stored in the
    iCAT catalog, and a physical object is identified and transferred to the client.
    The request can be in terms of logical object names, or a conditional query based
    on descriptive and system metadata attributes. iRODS is a peer-to-peer server
    system; hence, requests can be made to any server, which in turn acts on behalf
    of the client for transferring the file. The final file transfer takes the shortest
    network path in terms of number of hops. An important aspect of iRODS is its built-in
    rule framework. As part of each resource server, a distributed rule engine is
    implemented that provides extensibility and customizability by encoding server-side
    operations (including the main access APIs) into sequences of microservices. The
    sequence of microservices is controlled by user- or administrator-definedEvent:Condition:
    Action-set:Recovery-set rules similar to those found in active databases. The
    rules can be viewed as defining pipelines or workflows. An ingestion or access
    process can be encoded as a rule to provide customized functionality. Rules also
    can be defined by users and executed interactively. Hence, changes to a particular
    process or policy can easily be constructed by the user, then tested and deployed
    without the aid of system administrators or application developers. The user also
    can define conditions when a rule gets triggered thus controlling the application
    of different rules (or processing pipelines) based on current events and operating
    conditions. The building blocks for the iRODS rules are microservices – small,
    well-defined procedures or functions that perform a certain task. For example,
    one can use a rule that stipulates that when accessing a data object from a particular
    collection, additional authorization checks need to be made. These authorization
    checks can be encoded as a set of microservices with different triggers that can
    fire based on current operating conditions. In this way, one can control access
    to sensitive data based on rules and can escalate or reduce authorization levels
    dynamically as the situation warrants. Apart from iRES servers and an iCAT server,
    iRODS also has two other servers: iSEC for scheduling and executing queued rules,
    and iXMS for providing a message-passing framework between microservices. 3.3.
    Software appliance virtualization (vCDS) Virtualization is central to Cloud Computing
    and important to us in the way it enables agile development and deployment. We
    have attempted to make virtualization even more convenient by taking a software
    appliance approach to building a core element of our technology cluster, the Virtual
    Climate Data Server (vCDS). A vCDS is an iRODS-based data server specialized to
    the needs of a particular climate data-centric application. The basic configuration
    of an iRODS data server consists of a specific version of iRODS installed on a
    particular operating system running on particular hardware. Moving toward the
    vCDS virtual appliance model has been a two-step process in which we (1) encapsulate
    the operating system and iRODS as a virtual machine image, then (2) specialize
    that image with functionality required for managing climate data. Our approach
    to specialization has been to build general-purpose scientific “kits,” such as
    those that can externalize into the vCDS iCAT the internal metadata stored in
    NetCDF, HDF, and GeoTIF files. These kits sit in the vertical stack above iRODS
    and below application-specific kits, such as those that might be needed to handle
    the special data management requirements of a particular collection (Fig. 1).

    Fig. 1. Specialization of an iRODS server through appliance virtualization and
    the addition of domain- and application-specific “kits.” Our initial focus has
    been building a vCDS to manage NetCDF data. Additional details about these components
    are provided below and in Schnase et al., 2011a, Schnase et al., 2011b, Schnase
    et al., 2011c, Schnase et al., 2012, but in summary, the core elements include
    the following: Application-specific microservices – Basic archive operations,
    particularly the mechanisms required to ingest Open Archive Information System
    (OAIS)-compliant Submission Information Package (SIP) metadata for IPCC NetCDF
    objects (more about IPCC and OAIS below). Application-specific metadata – OAIS-compliant
    constitutive (application-independent) Representation Information (RI) and Preservation
    Description Information (PDI) metadata for NetCDF objects. Application-specific
    rules – NetCDF triggers and workflows. A specific release of iRODS – In the current
    version we are using iRODS 2.5 that has been augmented with what we refer to as
    Administrative Extensions (AE) that log object-level actions within the server.
    A specific operating system – In our case, SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)
    11 SP1. Collectively, we refer to the functionality associated with vCDS as a
    the vCDS V1.0 “product suite.” Taken together, these elements enable an approach
    to scientific collections management in which virtualization is a driving concept.
    It supports access to a tiered array of cloud services that are flexible, adaptable,
    scalable, and stageable to “bricks and mortar” facilities as needed. We can provision
    capabilities into any resource class, migrate images from one resource class to
    another, and use the iRODS federation mechanism to assemble virtual collections
    that cross resource classes. This approach provides an agile entry point for new
    customers with data-centric requirements and enables virtualization-as-a-service
    (VaaS), software-as-a-service (SaaS), and platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and, as
    shown below, lays the foundation for higher-order offerings, such as CAaaS (Fig
    2). Download : Download high-res image (418KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. vCDS cloud provisioning and migration paths. 3.4. Adaptive analytics (Canonical
    Ops) Data intensive analysis workflows bridge between a largely unstructured mass
    of archived scientific data and the highly structured, tailored, reduced, and
    refined analytic products that are used by individual scientists and form the
    basis of intellectual work in the domain. In general, the initial steps of an
    analysis, those operations that first interact with a data repository, tend to
    be the most general, while data manipulations closer to the client tend to be
    the most specialized to the individual, to the domain, or to the science question
    under study. The amount of data being operated on also tends to be larger on the
    repository-side of the workflow, smaller toward the client-side end products.
    This stratification can be exploited in order to optimize efficiencies along the
    workflow chain. MapReduce, for example, seeks to improve efficiencies of the near-archive
    operations that initiate workflows. In our work so far, we have focused on building
    a small set of canonical near-archive, early-stage analytical operations that
    represent a common starting point in many analysis workflows in many domains.
    For example, average, variance, max, min, sum, and count operations of the general
    form: that return, in this example, the average value of a variable when given
    its name, a temporal extent, and a spatial extent. Because of their widespread
    use, we refer to these simple operations as “canonical ops” with which more complex
    analytic expressions can be built. They provide a template for users as they begin
    their exploration of MapReduce analytics and are useful in their own right as
    steps in larger analyses. We tend to think of them as a type of assembly language
    instruction for climate data analysis. The goal is to deploy the canonical ops
    within a framework that is able to capture their patterns of use and enable more
    complex analyses to be assembled and incorporated back into the system. The notion
    of engaging the broader community to deal with Big Data challenges has been used
    successfully in other settings, perhaps most notably with GalazyZoo, where a large
    user community is helping search the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for patterns and
    observations of potential scientific value (Christian et al., 2012, Szalay et
    al., 2000, Young, 2010). We believe that this type of social networking can play
    an important role in the future of climate analytics. The approach we are taking
    sets the stage for the community construction of new capabilities that are adapted
    to the socially expressed requirements of those who use the system. 3.5. Domain-harmonized
    APIs (CDS API) In order to knit these capabilities together and deliver them into
    practical use, we are building the Climate Data Services (CDS) application programming
    interface (API). APIs specify how software components interact with each other;
    they can take many forms, but the goal for all APIs is to make it easier to implement
    the abstract capabilities of a system. In building the CDS API, we are trying
    to provide for climate science a uniform semantic treatment of the combined functionalities
    of large-scale data management and data-proximal analytics. In doing so, we are
    combining concepts from the Open Archive Information Systems (OAIS) reference
    model, object-oriented programming APIs, and Web 2.0 resource-oriented APIs. The
    Open Archive Information System (OAIS) reference model, defined by the Consultative
    Committee on Space Data Systems, addresses a full range of archival information
    preservation functions including ingest, archival storage, data management, access,
    and dissemination – full information lifecycle management. It also addresses the
    migration of digital information to new media and forms, the data models used
    to represent the information, the role of software in information preservation,
    and the exchange of digital information among archives. OAIS provides examples
    and some “best practice” recommendations and defines a minimal set of responsibilities
    for an archive to be called an OAIS (OAIS, 2013). OAIS identifies both internal
    and external interfaces to the archive functions, and it identifies a number of
    high-level services at these interfaces (Fig. 3). These high-level services provide
    a vocabulary that we have adopted for the Climate Data Services Reference Model
    and associated Library and API. Download : Download high-res image (267KB) Download

    of the Climate Data Services Reference Model, Library, and API. The CDS Reference
    Model is a logical specification that presents a single abstract data and analytic
    services model to calling applications. As shown below, the CDS Reference Model
    can be implemented using various technologies; in all cases, however, actions
    are based on the following six primitives: Ingest – Submit/register a Submission
    Information Package. Query – Retrieve data from a pre-determined service request
    (synchronous). Order – Request data from a pre-determined service request (asynchronous).
    Download – Retrieve a Dissemination Information Package. Status – Track progress
    of service activity. Execute – Initiate a service-definable extension. Within
    this OAIS-inspired framework, we are creating a Python-based CDS Library that
    contains methods that support the basic primitives (ingest, query, order, etc.)
    as well as extended utilities that combine these primitives into automated multi-step
    canonical ops (avg, max, min, etc.). The Library sits atop a RESTful Web Services
    Client that encapsulates inbound and outbound interactions with various climate
    data services. These provide the foundation upon which we have built a CDS Command
    Line Interpreter (CLI) that supports interactive sessions. In addition, Python
    scripts and full Python applications also can use methods imported from the API.
    The resulting client stack can be distributed as a software package or used to
    build a cloud service (SaaS) or distributable cloud image (PaaS) (Fig. 4). Download

    Climate Data Services client stack built on the capabilities enabled by the CDS
    Reference Model, Web ServicesClient, Library, and API. This approach to API design
    focuses on the specific analytic requirements of climate science and marries the
    language and abstractions of collections management with those of high-performance
    analytics. Doing so reflects at the application level the confluence of storage
    and computation that is driving Big Data architectures of the future. It is too
    early to tell, but we hope that this “harmonization” will make CAaaS more accessible
    to our users. 4. MERRA Analytic Services – A case study in cloud-enabled Climate
    Analytics-as-a-Service MERRA Analytic Services (MERRA/AS) pull these elements
    together in an end-to-end demonstration of CAaaS capabilities. MERRA/AS enables
    MapReduce analytics over NASA’s Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research
    and Applications (MERRA) data. As we describe below, the MERRA collection is a
    reanalysis dataset that is of particular interest to a broad community of users.
    In simple terms, our vision for MERRA/AS is that it allows MERRA data to be stored
    in a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) on a MERRA/AS cluster. Functionality
    is exposed through the CDS API. The API exposures enable a basic set of operations
    that can be used to build arbitrarily complex workflows and assembled into more
    complex operations (which can be folded back into the API and MERRA/AS service
    as further extensions). The complexities of the underlying (Java) mapper and reducer
    codes for the basic operations are encapsulated and abstracted away from the user,
    making these common ops easier to use. An important adjunct to the MERRA/AS service
    is a persistence service, also exposed through the CDS API, that allows users
    to store, download, annotate, and otherwise manage Java codes or CDS scripts that
    implement the map and reduce functions of their analyses. The persistence service
    has the capacity to execute these codes on the MERRA cluster, capture the resulting
    output, and manage the output as the user wishes under control of the persistence
    service. The code sets essentially become realizable objects – their logical representations
    are used in server-side processes that cause their analytical results to be realized
    upon request. In this section we describe these components in greater detail,
    demonstrate the use of MERRA/AS in example applications, and show the role that
    Cloud Computing is playing in these efforts. We begin with background information
    about the MERRA collection. 4.1. Reanalyses and the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis
    for Research and Applications (MERRA) The MERRA reanalysis integrates observational
    data with numerical models to produce a global temporally and spatially consistent
    synthesis of 26 key climate variables (Rienecker et al., 2011). Spatial resolution
    is 1/2° latitude × 2/3° longitude × 72 vertical levels extending through the stratosphere.
    Temporal resolution is 6-h for three-dimensional, full spatial resolution, extending
    from 1979 to present, nearly the entire satellite era. MERRA data are typically
    made available to the general public through the NASA Earth Observing System Distributed
    Information System (EOSDIS, 2013). A subset of the data is made available to the
    climate research community through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF), the
    research community’s data publication infrastructure (ESGF, 2013). We are focusing
    on the MERRA collection because there is an increasing demand for reanalysis data
    products by an expanding community of consumers, including local governments,
    federal agencies, and private-sector customers. Reanalysis data are used in models
    and decision support systems relating to disasters, ecological forecasting, health
    and air quality, water resources, agriculture, climate energy, oceans, and weather.
    Currently, MERRA data are generally moved to client applications for analysis
    and use. Convenient access to storage-side analytics could significantly improve
    the usefulness of this important collection. 4.2. The MERRA/AS HDFS repository
    The Apache Hadoop software library is the classic framework for MapReduce distributed
    analytics (HDFS, 2013). We are using Cloudera, the 100% open source, enterprise-ready
    distribution of Apache Hadoop. Cloudera is integrated with configuration and administration
    tools and related open source packages, such as Hue, Oozi, Zookeeper, and Impala
    (Cloudera, 2013). There are many ways to configure a Hadoop cluster, but its basic
    architecture consists of an HDFS file system and a MapReduce engine, which is
    responsible for executing mapper and reducer codes in parallel over the nodes
    that compose the HDFS. MERRA data files are created from the Goddard Earth Observing
    System version 5 (GEOS-5) model and are stored in HDF-EOS and NetCDF formats (MERRA,
    2013). Each file contains a single grid with multiple 2D and 3D variables. All
    data are stored on a longitude–latitude grid with a vertical dimension applicable
    for all 3D variables. The GEOS-5 MERRA products are divided into 25 collections:
    18 standard products, 7 chemistry products. The collections comprise monthly means
    files and daily files at 6-h intervals running from 1979 to 2012. MERRA data are
    typically packaged as multi-dimensional binary data within a self-describing NetCDF
    file format. Hierarchical metadata in the NetCDF header contain the representation
    information that allows NetCDF software to work with the data. It also contains
    arbitrary preservation description and policy information that can be used to
    bring the data into use-specific compliance. Total size of the native, compressed
    NetCDF MERRA collection in a standard filesystem is approximately 80 TB. Native
    MERRA files are sequenced and ingested into the Hadoop cluster in triplicated
    640 MB blocks. Total size of the MERRA/AS HDFS repository is approximately 480
    TB. The MERRA/AS HDFS is running on a 36-node Dell cluster that has 576 Intel
    2.6 GHz SandyBridge cores, 1300 TB of raw storage, 1250 GB of RAM, and a 11.7
    TF theoretical peak compute capacity. Nodes communicate through a Fourteen Data
    Rate (FDR) Infiniband network having peak TCP/IP speeds in excess of 20 Gbps.
    4.3. The MERRA/AS server The functional requirements of the MERRA/AS server derive
    from the basic organization of a Hadoop MapReduce system. As introduced above,
    a MapReduce Program has two components: one that implements a mapper, and another
    that implements a reducer. The mapper transforms each element of an input list
    to an output element; the reducer aggregates these output elements into a single
    result, which has the effect of turning a large volume of data into a smaller
    summary of itself. A third component, called the Driver, initializes the Program
    on the Job Tracker node, instructs the Hadoop engine to execute the mapping and
    reducing codes on a set of input files, and controls where the output files are
    placed. In MapReduce, every value has a key associated with it. Keys identify
    related values. The mapping and reducing functions receive not just values, but
    <key, value> pairs. The output of each of these functions is the same: both a
    key and a value must be emitted to the next list in the data flow. These filtering
    and combining functions, executed in parallel over distributed data, collectively
    accomplish analytical operations of varying complexity within the MapReduce paradigm.
    Most of the work of building the MERRA/AS server involves creating utilities to
    move MERRA data into and out of the HDFS and writing the MapReduce programs that
    implement MERRA/AS’s canonical ops. Each file of native NetCDF binary data is
    converted into separate sequence files – flat files consisting of binary <key,
    value> pairs that can be operated on by mapper and reducer functions. These sequence
    files are block-compressed in HDFS and provide direct serialization of several
    arbitrary binary data types. During sequencing, the data is partitioned by time,
    so that each record in the sequence file contains the timestamp and name of the
    parameter (e.g. temperature) as the composite key and the value of the parameter
    (which could have 1–3 spatial dimensions). In operation, map processes filter
    each sequence file to capture <key, value> pairs that match the variable and time
    span of interest; reduce processes perform calculations based on input parameters
    (time, extents, etc.) and create new subset sequence files. The resulting sequence
    files are then transformed to NetCDF format in the de-sequencing process (Fig.
    5). Download : Download high-res image (108KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 5. Sequencing/de-sequencing operations performed by MERRA/AS utilities for
    the MERRA HDFS repository. The canonical operations that implement MERRA/AS’s
    average, variance, max, min, sum, and count calculations are Java MapReduce programs
    that are ultimately exposed as simple references to CDS Library methods or as
    web services endpoints. There is a substantial code ecosystem behind these apparently
    simple operations, nearly 6000 lines of Java code being offloaded from the user
    to the MERRA/AS service. 4.4. MERRA/AS in use – RESTful web services Our initial
    exposure for client applications that wish to consume MERRA/AS results is the
    MERRA/AS Web Service. We are using a Representational State Transfer (REST)-style
    architecture, which is the predominant web API design model. REST provides scalability
    of component interactions, accommodates intermediaries like firewalls and proxies
    without the need to change interfaces, and allows independent deployment of components
    where implementations can change without the need to change interfaces. A concrete
    implement of a REST Web Service uses HTTP methods explicitly, is stateless, exposes
    directly structure-like URIs, and transfers XML, JavScript Object Notation (JSON),
    or both. Our REST service has been built using the CDS API and makes calls to
    the CDS Library; its endpoint semantics adhere to the conventions we have established
    in the CDS API. A specific call to the MERRA/AS service to find the average temperature
    over a given period of time, geospatial extent, and span of altitudes looks something
    like this: http://skyportal.gsfc.nasa.gov/cds/mas/order.php?GetAverageByVariable_TimeRange_SpatialExtent_VerticalExtent&variable_list=T&operation=avg&start_date=201101&end_date=201112&avg_period=12&min_lon=125&min_lat=24&max_lon=-66&max_lat=50&start_level=1&end_level=42.

    are exposed through RESTful web services and a simple forms interface. 4.5. MERRA/AS
    in use – The RECOVER wildland fire decision support system A more interesting
    machine-to-machine use of MERRA/AS Web Services is demonstrated in the RECOVER
    project. In RECOVER, which stands for Rehabilitation Capability Convergence for
    Ecosystem Recovery, NASA is working with the Department of Interior’s Bureau of
    Land Management (BLM) and the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) to addresses
    two critical requirements in post-fire decision-making for savanna ecosystems:
    identification and prioritization of target areas for reseeding and long-term
    ecosystem recovery monitoring. RECOVER is a new decision support system (DSS)
    that will be incorporated into a long-standing post-fire decision process, the
    National Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) program. After a major wildfire,
    law requires that the federal land management agencies certify a comprehensive
    plan for public safety, burned area stabilization, resource protection, and site
    recovery. These BAER plans are a crucial part of our national response to wildfire
    disasters. The plans are due within 14 days of containment of a major wildfire
    and become the guiding document for managing the activities and budgets for all
    subsequent remediation efforts. There are few instances in the federal government
    where plans of such wide-ranging scope are assembled on such short notice and
    translated into action more quickly (BAER, 2013). BAER plans are largely developed
    on-site by multi-agency teams of specialists that include natural resource managers
    and scientists with expertise in the salient disciplines. The nature and setting
    of their work create a need for decision support tools that allow sound decision-making
    and land management planning to take place quickly for a specific region of interest.
    Remote sensing imagery is often used to complement field-based assessments and
    to provide landscape or regional scale monitoring. Several indicators derived
    from satellite imagery can be used to characterize both fire severity and intensity
    as well as vegetation recovery following fire. For several analyses, historical
    ecosystem conditions of the type captured in MERRA’s variables are of importance.
    Critical site-specific information that could otherwise improve outcomes does
    not become part of the decision-making process unless it is immediately available
    to the BAER teams. RECOVER is a context-aware, site-specific DSS that brings together
    in a single application the information necessary for BAER team post-fire rehabilitation
    decision-making. In a typical scenario-of-use, a RECOVER instance is created automatically
    in response to a fire detection event. Using the rapid resource allocation capabilities
    of Cloud Computing, Earth observational data, MERRA data, and derived decision
    products are automatically collected and refreshed throughout the burn so that
    when the fire is declared under control, BAER teams have at hand a complete and
    ready-to-use RECOVER dataset that is customized for the target wildfire. The system
    itself comprises a RECOVER Server and RECOVER Clients. The RECOVER Server is a
    tailored vCDS deployed in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). When provided
    a wildfire name and geospatial extent, the RECOVER Server aggregates data from
    a suite of web services, does the necessary transformations and reprojections
    required for the data to be used by RECOVER Clients, and, in turn, exposes the
    tailored collection through a Web Map Service running in the Server. RECOVER calls
    on MERRA/AS’s Web Service, thereby providing an easy integration of this heretofore
    seldom used resource into the BAER process (Fig. 7). Download : Download high-res

    Client (b) interfaces. RECOVER’s feasibility has been demonstrated in Idaho during
    the 2013 wildfire season. Over the next 3 years, RECOVER will be deployed into
    operational use in the Great Basin states of Idaho, Utah, and Nevada where EC2’s
    auto-scaling and elastic load balancing capabilities will be particularly beneficial.
    4.6. MERRA/AS in use – Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) publication NASA scientists
    contribute climate data, including MERRA products, to the Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change, which represents a team of nearly 1000 experts working throughout
    the world on issues of climate change (IPCC, 2013). This research community uses
    the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) as the primary mechanism for publishing
    IPCC data as well as the ancillary observational and reanalysis products used
    in model/model and observation/model data inter-comparison, an important aspect
    of climate change research (Edwards, 2010). ESGF functions like a peer-to-peer
    content distribution network in which geographically distributed collections can
    be accessed by the climate research community through a certificate authority
    mechanism (CA). Published ESGF data, regardless of source, conforms to the community-defined
    Climate Model Inter-comparison Program (CMIP5) Data Reference Syntax and Controlled
    Vocabularies standard (Taylor et al., 2012). The trust relationship set up by
    the CA mechanism essentially creates a virtual organization of producers and consumers
    of ESGF products. Institutions, such as the NCCS, that host ESGF servers have
    responsibility for correctly formatting and registering their data contributions.
    Preparing MERRA data for ESGF publication requires reformatting in order to make
    it comply with the CMIP5 standard. This ontological alignment – moving from the
    semantic frame of reference defined by the producers of the MERRA data to that
    used by ESGF – is often a mixed process of automatic and manual conversion and
    contributes significantly to the data preparation overhead of supporting the IPCC
    project. To facilitate this process, we have deployed vCDS in the Amazon cloud
    and have used the system to deliver a subset of NASA’s MERRA products to the ESGF
    server, also running in the Amazon cloud. vCDS-managed objects are exposed to
    ESGF through FUSE (Filesystem in User Space), which presents a POSIX-compliant
    filesystem abstraction to applications such as the ESGF server that require such
    an interface (Fig. 8). vCDS will ultimately provide a persistence service that
    hosts the MapReduce codes that extract ESGF products from MERRA/AS. vCDS will
    also provide a place in the stack for other utilities, such as those required
    for ontology alignment and metadata management. Download : Download high-res image

    stack. 4.7. MERRA/AS in use – The Wei method for programmed data assembly and
    capability enhancement Wei, Dirmeyer, Wisser, Bosilovich, and Mocko (2013), in
    a hydrological study that focuses on the contribution of irrigation to precipitation,
    provides an excellent example of the way MERRA data are used in investigations
    of this type. We are using the Wei experiment, and others like it, to develop
    the MERRA/AS API, Command Interpreter, scripting, and programming capabilities.
    The goal at this early stage is to demonstrate and evaluate the ability of CAaaS
    and the CDS Client Stack to simplify the work of data assembly and the community
    construction of enhanced CAaaS functionality. Simply put, the Wei team used MERRA
    data to study four intensively irrigated regions – northern India/Pakistan, the
    North China Plain, the California Central Valley, and the Nile Valley. The study
    used a quasi-isentropic back-trajectory (QIBT) method to track water vapor for
    precipitation events backward in time assuming precipitated water is drawn from
    the atmospheric column along a distribution that follows the vertical profile
    of atmospheric specific humidity. Seasonal rates of evapotranspiration with and
    without irrigation over the studied areas were then compared to assess the impact
    of irrigation. The data required for these calculations include precipitation,
    evapotranspiration, temperature, humidity, and wind at different tropospheric
    levels at six-hourly time steps from 1979 to 2002. This early-stage data reduction
    – average values for environmental variables over specific spatiotemporal extents
    – is the type of data assembly that historically has been performed on the scientist’s
    workstation after wholesale transfers from public archives of large blocks of
    data. The experiment provides a useful example of how MERRA/AS pushes these first
    analytic steps onto the storage server. The Python script shown in Fig. 9 demonstrates
    the ease with which this work can be done through CAaaS as implemented by the
    CDS API and MERRA/AS. As a further refinement, as QIBT analysis is perfected for
    this experiment, one can imagine developing the analysis into an extended utility
    for subsequent inclusion in the CDS Library for use by others. Download : Download

    Results and discussion This CEUS special issue focuses on how Cloud Computing
    enables Big Data processing. It also explores how Big Data challenges, in turn,
    can foster the advancement of Cloud Computing. From our perspective, Cloud Computing’s
    most import effects on Big Data are a direct and indirect result of its contributions
    to generativity and what that means for our ability to engage the community in
    solving some of the Big Data challenges of climate science. Cloud Computing also
    is influencing the way we connect earthbound data centers to an expanding array
    of customers and applications. We discuss this in greater detail in this section,
    beginning with Cloud Computing’s most immediate influence, which is on the way
    software is developed and deployed. 5.1. Agile development and deployment We use
    Cloud Computing extensively in our software engineering activities, working with
    a large collection of specialized images. Doing so conveys the classic advantages
    almost universally recognized as benefits of the technology (Ernst & Young, 2011).
    It gives us the ability to manage risk by “trialing” hardware and software solutions,
    its elasticity allows IT infrastructure to be increased at will, and it advances
    the green agenda by allowing fuller use of shared resources and lowering our carbon
    footprint. Perhaps most important, however, Cloud Computing lowers the barriers
    and risks to organizational change. Small groups can experiment with sophisticated
    applications that they ordinarily could not afford. This enables “skunkworks”
    experimentation, encourages innovation, and, important to our work, provides the
    flexibility we need to respond to an ever-increasing demand to support new customers
    and new applications. The economic appeal of Cloud Computing is often described
    as converting capital expenses (CapEx) to operating expenses (OpEx), this pay-as-you-go
    stance more directly capturing the cost benefit to the buyer and enabling an agility
    beyond what is possible through capital expansion. In the work we do, this consideration
    has an interesting twist. As illustrated in the RECOVER project described above,
    much of the work that NASA does is in partnership with operational agencies that
    ultimately take ownership of jointly developed new capabilities. Cloud-centered
    development greatly simplifies these types of interagency transfers: capabilities
    developed in the Amazon cloud, for example, can be conveyed through accounting
    actions, avoiding altogether the complexities of traditional hardware procurement
    in either agency. This is proving to be a substantial benefit. Finally, Cloud
    Computing enables higher order services that heretofore have been impossible.
    Almost any slice of the software stack, including IaaS, PaaS, SaaS – and importantly,
    new compositions of services – can be bought or built as a service. New services
    can ride atop multiple cloud services and engage an organization’s internal staff,
    leading to the evolution of higher value business processes, innovative offerings,
    and, ultimately, the ability to offer specialized business processes-as-a-service.
    That is what we are striving for with Climate Analytics-as-a-Service: connecting
    our specialized science processes and knowledge to cloud-enabled Big Data offerings
    for customers who need the knowledge generated by research in climate science.
    5.2. Scalable, tailorable intermediation The U.S. Federal Government spends nearly
    $80 billion each year on information technology (VanRoekel, 2013). The Brookings
    Institution estimates that government agencies can save 25–50% by moving to the
    cloud (West, 2010). It is not surprising, then, that Cloud Computing is receiving
    enormous attention at all levels of government (Kundra, 2011). And, as one might
    expect, the nature of those discussions depends on the type of work done by the
    various agencies. The diversity of NASA’s engineering and scientific work potentially
    enabled by Cloud Computing is quite broad (Little & Petraska, 2013). The focus
    of our interest and this paper is climate modeling, which is a world dominated
    by high-performance computing and the petabyte-scale storage of climate model
    outputs. The extent to which aspects of high-performance climate modeling can
    effectively be moved to the cloud is an open question. With regard to large-scale
    storage, transfer rates and costs are an issue. In time, these issues are likely
    to be sorted out. At this point, however, it is safe to say that much of the core
    work we do remains earthbound – and one of the major advantages of Cloud Computing
    is its flexible capacity to connect enterprise capabilities with diversifying
    customer needs. In the examples we have shown here, Cloud Computing is providing
    for us a new tier in the data services stack – a cloud-based layer where agile
    customization occurs and enterprise-level products are transformed to meet the
    specialized requirements of applications and consumers. It helps us close the
    gap between the world of traditional, high-performance computing, which, at least
    for now, resides in a finely-tuned climate modeling environment at the enterprise
    level and our new customers, whose expectations and manner of work are increasingly
    influenced by the smart mobility megatrend. That is not easy to do if the gap
    must be bridged by accommodations at the enterprise level. At a foundational level,
    this strategy of cloud-enabled intermediation resonates with contemporary trends.
    Smartphones are said to be spreading faster than any technology in human history
    (DeGusta, 2012). Most modern smartphones, tablets, etc. actually consist of just
    the display and user interface components of sophisticated applications that run
    in cloud data centers. This is a mode of work that CAaaS is intended to accommodate,
    and Cloud Computing is crucial to our ability to participate in that world. 5.3.
    Cloud Computing’s contributions to generativity We began this paper by introducing
    the idea that generativity – the capacity for autocatalytic feeding forward of
    capability – is ultimately the key to dealing with the Big Data challenges of
    climate science. It represents our attempt to articulate what we believe is Cloud
    Computing’s most important influence. For us, the transformational link between
    Big Data and Cloud Computing is that Cloud Computing is a critical potentiator
    in a constellation of technologies that satisfy Zittrain’s (2008) necessary requirements
    for generativity. Table 1 summarizes what we believe are the major effects of
    the core technologies behind Climate Analytics-as-a-Service. MapReduce and iRODS
    fundamentally make analytics and data aggregation easier; the approach to software
    appliance virtualization in vCDS makes it easier to transfer capabilities to new
    users and simplifies their ability to build new applications; the social construction
    of extended capabilities facilitated by the notion of canonical operations enable
    adaptability; and the CDS API enables ease of mastery. Table 1. Contributions
    of core Climate Analytics-as-a-Service (CAaaS) technologies to generativity. Elements
    marked by an asterisk are influenced directly or indirectly by Cloud Computing.

    * √ iRODS √ vCDS* √ √ Canonical Ops √ CDS API* √ √ √ What is important to note
    about this is Cloud Computing is co-evolving with and driving the development
    of three key elements in this generative assemblage: virtualization, Web APIs,
    and cloud-based analytics, including a burgeoning array of MapReduce offerings.
    Granted, satisfying the requirements for generativity does not guarantee a generative
    outcome. But we are hopeful that we are beginning to develop the right framework
    for that. 5.4. Cloud Computing detractions We have not been immune to the classic
    inhibitors of Cloud Computing adoption. Organizational culture shock has been
    an issue: it has at times been difficult for a traditional high-performance computing
    center, skilled and comfortable with technical implementation, to focus on differentiating
    Cloud Computing’s value-add for the organization. There have been control issues
    and issues relating to data locality – it is still comforting for many scientists
    to know the physical location of their data. Issues of security, privacy, regulatory
    compliance, etc. have been a significant early concern in all matters relating
    to Cloud Computing. What is interesting to note is that we, like other organizations
    transitioning to the cloud, are beginning to see many of these inhibitors being
    transformed into accelerants (Ernst & Young, 2011). Clearly, a tipping point has
    been reached, where the potential adverse impact of inhibitory factors on the
    market potential of the cloud industry is prompting a response. Cloud service
    providers are investing far more to develop their security infrastructure and
    bring their services into regulatory compliance than any typical enterprise is
    able to do. As a result, consumers of cloud services are beginning to turn to
    Cloud Computing as a means of simplifying their lives and thus accelerating the
    adoption of the technology. The shift in attitude about Cloud Computing in our
    organization over the past 2 years has been dramatic. 5.5. Research directions
    We still have much to learn about how to use Cloud Computing, and the Big Data
    challenges of climate science are far from being solved. In the near term, we
    intend to focus on hardening the CDS API and its underlying data services architecture,
    since these are the critical elements of our CAaaS approach. Administration of
    the cloud intermediation tier is another crucial area requiring attention: we
    need to identify and develop the tools, policies, protocols, and experience required
    to operationalize the cloud-enabled enterprise/customer bridge described above.
    Finally, perhaps most interesting and valuable of all, we need to deploy Climate
    Analytics-as-a-Service at sufficient scale and in such a way that we can definitely
    evaluate its potential for generativity and capacity to address the Big Data challenges
    of climate science. Acknowledgements We thank Scott Sinno, Ben Bledsoe, Ed Luczak,

    rise in the population has immensely increased the pressure on the agriculture
    sector. With the advent of technology, this decade is witnessing a shift from
    conventional approaches to the most advanced ones. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    has transformed both the quality and quantity of the agriculture sector. Hybridization
    of species along with the real-time monitoring of the farms paved a way for resource
    optimization. Scientists, research institutions, academicians, and most nations
    across the globe are moving towards the practice and execution of collaborative
    projects to explore the horizon of this field for serving mankind. The tech industry
    is racing to provide more optimal solutions. Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud
    computing, big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can provide sufficient
    scope to predict, process, and analyze the situations and improve the activities
    in the real-time scenario. The concept of heterogeneity and interoperability of
    the devices by providing flexible, scalable, and durable methods, models are also
    opening new domains in this field. Therefore, this paper contributes towards the
    recent IoT technologies in the agriculture sector, along with the development
    of hardware and software systems. The public and private sector projects and startup''s
    started all over the globe to provide smart and sustainable solutions in precision
    agriculture are also discussed. The current scenario, applications, research potential,
    limitations, and future aspects are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of
    IoT a precision farming framework is also proposed in this article. A graphical

    Abstract Soil protection requires the improvement of agricultural land use, its
    planning and its management, in order to achieve a sustainable development. Land
    evaluation analysis is considered an interface between land resources survey and
    land use planning and management. The application of information and communication
    technology has exerted an impact on sustainable land use decision support. Since
    the early 1990s and following this trend, MicroLEIS (Mediterranean Land Evaluation
    Information System) has evolved towards an agro-ecological decision support system.
    The original project corresponds to a set of qualitative land evaluation methods
    converted to PC computer programs to automate their application. Today, MicroLEIS
    DSS is a set of useful tools for decision-making which in a wide range of agro-ecological
    schemes. The design philosophy follows a toolkit approach, integrating many software
    tools: databases, statistics, expert systems, neural networks, Web and GIS applications,
    and other information technologies. The MicroLEIS DSS system, in English and Spanish
    simultaneously, is available ready-for-use from the following website address:
    www.microleis.com. The new, re-designed MicroLEIS DSS will provide considerable
    opportunities for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the
    application of knowledge to solve problems of soil protection. Previous article

    tool 1. Introduction Soils can be used for almost all agricultural purposes if
    sufficient inputs are supplied. The application of inputs can be such that they
    dominate the conditions in which crops are grown, as can be the case in greenhouse
    cultivation. However, each soil unit has its own potentialities and limitations,
    and each soil use its own biophysical requirements. External inputs or improvements
    are expressed in terms of capital, energy, or environmental costs. A main aim
    of soil protection is to minimize these socio-economic and environmental costs
    by predicting the inherent capacity of a soil unit to support a specific soil
    use and management for a long period of time without deterioration. Soil protection
    requires the improvement of agricultural soil use, its planning, and its management.
    Sustainable soil use and management must sustain biophysical soil potentiality
    and, at the same time, diversify the agricultural soil system, considering all
    the possible options to increase crop production: (i) expansion of the agricultural
    land surface; (ii) introduction of improved crop varieties; (iii) use of irrigation
    techniques; (iv) application of fertilizers and pesticides; and (v) rationalization
    of soil tillage practices (Robert et al., 1993). In brief, in the design of sustainable
    agro-ecosystems for soil protection, the challenge for the near future will be
    to increase the crop production on less land, and with less labor, water, and
    pesticides. Agro-ecological land evaluation analysis, such as the assessment of
    land performance (land suitability and land vulnerability) when used for specified
    purposes, provides a rational basis for sustainable soil use and management (Dent
    and Young, 1981). According to the new concept of soil quality (Karlen et al.,
    1997), land evaluation is not the same as soil quality assessment, basically because
    the biological parameters of the soil are not considered in land evaluation. However,
    biological attributes or indicators (e.g. microbial biomass and/or respiration,
    mycorrhizal association, nematode communities, enzymes, and detailed characterization
    of organic matter) are very dynamic and exceptionally sensitive to changes in
    soil conditions. They appear to be very responsive to different agricultural soil
    conservation and management practices, such as non-tillage, organic amendments,
    and crop rotation. For soil quality assessment, the development of relationships
    between all the soil quality indicators and the soil functions may be a monumental
    task. Therefore, land evaluation analysis may serve as a first step towards developing
    a soil physical/chemical quality assessment procedure. A short-term evaluation
    or monitoring procedure can then be considered mainly for the soil biological
    quality. Emerging technology in data and knowledge engineering provides excellent
    possibilities in land evaluation development and application processes. The application
    phase of land evaluation systems is a process of scaling-up from the representative
    areas of the development phase to implementation in unknown scenarios. The application
    phase—previously accomplished manually—can now be executed with computer-assisted
    procedures. This involves the development and linkage of integrated databases,
    computer programs, and spatialization tools, constituting decision support systems
    (De la Rosa and Van Diepen, 2002). Decision support systems are computerized technology
    that can be used to support complex decision-making and problem-solving (Shim
    et al., 2002). Opinions are wide-ranging as to what constitutes a decision support
    system. A database management system could arguably be used as a decision support
    system for certain applications. Many people consider geographic information systems
    very useful decision support systems (Booty et al., 2001). Classic decision support
    system design comprise components for (i) sophisticated database management capabilities
    with access to internal and external data, information, and knowledge, (ii) powerful
    modeling functions accessed by a model management system, and (iii) simple user
    interface designs that enable interactive queries, reporting, and graphing functions
    (Shim et al., 2002). The evolution of the MicroLEIS (Mediterranean Land Evaluation
    Information System) follows the three eras of growth in the computer industry:
    (i) the data processing era, (ii) the microcomputer era, and (iii) the network
    era. During the first era, some qualitative and statistical land evaluation models
    were developed. The first microcomputer-based results were in the DOS environment
    in the early 1990s (De la Rosa et al., 1992), and then moved to WINDOWS in the
    late 1990s. Since 1998, the MicroLEIS system has also been considered well-suited
    to take advantage of the opportunities that the Internet presents, especially
    the rapid dissemination of information and knowledge, making the system more efficient
    and more widely used. All the main components of this Web-based decision support
    system—software (for PC platforms, Web development and GIS spatialization), documentation
    (about 1000 pages, in HTML and PDF formats), and information (Andalusia region
    data/photos); along with other Internet facilities, such as search engine, register
    module, and directory of users—are available free of charge from the URL www.microles.com.
    All the Internet features of MicroLEIS are in both English and Spanish. In this
    paper, the approaches used and experience gained in the development of the MicroLEIS
    DSS project are discussed. Emphasis is given to the achievements made in passing
    from a land evaluation system to a land resources information system, and in the
    beginnings of a land evaluation decision support system. It has to be pointed
    out, however, that MicroLEIS DSS is an open project under continuous development.
    2. Basic data warehousing The MicroLEIS DSS system was developed to assist specific
    types of decision-makers faced with specific agro-ecological problems. It has
    been designed as a knowledge-based approach which incorporates a set of information
    tools, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Each of these tools is directly linked to another,
    and custom applications can be carried out on a wide range of problems related
    to land productivity and land degradation. They are grouped into the following
    main modules: i) basic data warehousing, ii) land evaluation modeling, and iii)
    model application software. The architecture is open in design. Download : Download

    status of MicroLEIS DSS land evaluation decision support system. Data warehousing
    can be greatly facilitated if the nearly infinite list of basic data are systematically
    arranged and stored in an ordered format for ready sorting and retrieval. Database
    management systems are responsible for these tasks and consist of attribute tables
    manipulated by relational database management systems, and a geometric component
    handled by geographical information systems (GIS). The land attributes used in
    MicroLEIS DSS correspond to the following three main factors: soil/site, climate,
    and crop/management. Soil surveys are the building blocks of the comprehensive
    dataset needed to drive land evaluation. Land evaluation is normally based on
    morphological, physical, and chemical data derived from the soil survey, such
    as soil depth, texture, water capacity, drainage class, soil reaction, and organic
    matter content. Other biophysical factors, mainly referred to monthly climate
    parameters, are also considered land characteristics. Because climatic conditions
    vary from year to year, reliable long-term data are used to reflect the historical
    reality and to predict future events with some degree of confidence. Traditionally,
    agricultural management aspects have been considered a prerequisite only in land
    evaluation. Today, management factors are being incorporated as input variables
    in response to a growing need for integrating farming information. In this sense,
    crop and management data derived from field observation, monitoring, or experimentation,
    such as growing season length, rooting depth, tillage operations, and treatment
    of residues, are also considered land characteristics. For each of these main
    factors, a relational database has been constructed: SDBm Plus, CDBm, and MDBm,
    with inter-connectivity between the three databases. This development of a relational
    database management system to facilitate the integrated use of land attributes
    has been critical in decision support. As an example of the basic data used to
    develop the MicroLEIS DSS system, detailed descriptions of soil profile, meteorological
    stations, and farming systems of a collection of 64 representative sites in the
    Andalusian region of Spain are available from the option “Data/Photos” at the
    website. 2.1. Soil database The multilingual soil database SDBm Plus (De la Rosa
    et al., 2002) is a geo-referenced soil attribute database for storage of an exceptionally
    large number of morphological, physical, and chemical soil profile data (Table
    1). This database is the “engine” of the MicroLEIS DSS system. It is user-friendly
    software designed to store and retrieve efficiently and systematically the geo-referenced
    soil attribute data collected in soil surveys and laboratories. The database has
    the following main characteristics: (i) running on WINDOWS platforms; (ii) ‘help
    menus’ facilitating data entry; (iii) automatic translation from English to Spanish,
    French, and German; (iv) metadata feature to describe the methods used in laboratory
    analysis; (v) temporal mode to collect over time the analytical, physical, and
    hydraulic soil properties; (vi) structured query procedure to allow detailed searches;
    (vii) simple graphical analyses and report generation; and (viii) a input file
    generator for the automatic transfer of the stored soil attribute data to GIS
    and computerized land evaluation models. Table 1. Original geo-referenced soil

    different horizons per soil profile, these 327 variables can generate more than
    1500 data per soil profile. The SDBm Plus database is considered an essential
    part of any support system for the exploration in decision-making for sustainable
    agriculture development. However, this sophisticated database can be useful for
    independent storage of primary soils information assembled at regional or national
    level, or for temporary storage of data accumulated during a particular soil survey
    or monitoring exercise at local level. 2.2. Climate database The climate database
    CDBm developed for MicroLEIS DSS is a computer-based tool for the organization,
    storage, and manipulation of agro-climatic data for land evaluation. These geo-referenced
    climate observations, at a particular meteorological station, correspond to the
    mean values of such records for a determinate period. It is precisely by a period
    of time that meteorology is distinguished from climate. The basic data of CDBm
    are the mean values of the daily dataset for a particular month. The stored mean
    monthly values correspond to a set of temperature and precipitation variables
    (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, accumulative precipitation, maximum
    precipitation per day, and days of precipitation). The CDBm database includes
    the following main features: (i) a menu-based interactive user interface; (ii)
    extensive, powerful search facilities; (iii) options for import/export of basic
    data; (iv) a set of subroutines for calculating climate variables for use in land
    evaluation (various types of potential evapotranspiration, humidity index, aridity
    index, growing season length, precipitation concentration index, erosivity index,
    and leaching degree); (v) a generator of daily temperature data from the monthly
    data; and (vi) an option to make a climate summary for each meteorological station
    for a period of years or a particular year, with graphic representation. The last
    option allows CDBm to be used as a source of climatic data for land evaluation
    models, this link being the most useful option of the MicroLEIS decision support
    tool. 2.3. Farming database The farming database MDBm is knowledge-based software
    to capture, store, process, and transfer agricultural crop and management information
    obtained through interviews with farmers. Each MDBm dataset consists of geo-referenced
    agricultural information on a particular land use system. This structured collection
    of information is stored as a database file. A menu system guides the user through
    a sequence of options to capture the management practices followed on a site-specific
    farm. Input parameters are farm and plot descriptions, crop characteristics, sequence
    of operations, and behavioral observations. These parameters represent a total
    of 59 default variables according to good management practices on Mediterranean
    farms. The variables can be modified or extended as appropriate. All the default
    generalization levels of the input variables are translated to work in the English,
    Spanish, French, and German languages. The MDBm database includes the following
    features: (i) a menu-based interactive user interface; (ii) extensive, powerful
    search facilities; (iii) a glossary-coding system to maintain the classification
    and codes of the input variables; (iv) options for import/export of basic data;
    (v) an input file generator to link with the evaluation models; and (vi) an option
    to make an agricultural management summary for each farm. Application possibilities
    of MDBm include standard description of farming practices, automatic translation
    and comparison between different languages, and the fitting of agricultural management
    to site-specific conditions. 3. Land evaluation modeling In the MicroLEIS DSS
    system, land evaluation analysis focuses on agricultural land use, planning, and
    management for soil protection purposes. Other land evaluation studies focus on
    land productivity through the crop system modeling (e.g. Jones et al., 2003).
    Table 2 shows a list of the MicroLEIS DSS models in two sets corresponding to
    (i) a land suitability approach, and (ii) a land vulnerability approach. According
    to Rossiter (1996), all these models are non-spatial single-area models—they consider
    a single small, and homogeneous area whose suitability or vulnerability is to
    be determined, without any influence from surrounding areas, and without explicit
    reference to its actual geographic location. This modeling or classification phase
    is accomplished with basic information from representative areas, while the application
    or generalization phase is carried out in unknown scenarios (Fig. 1). The traditional
    scheme in land evaluation analysis (FAO, 1976) is followed, along with the terminology
    (e.g. land suitability, land characteristics, land quality, land utilization type,
    land use requirements, severity level, etc.) synthesized by Rossiter (1996). Table

    is the level of Bouma (1999) land evaluation model classification. The modeling
    phase involves the following main stages: – selection of land attributes: land
    characteristics and associated land qualities; – definition of relevant land use
    requirements or limitations: land use response or degradation level; – matching
    of land attributes with land use requirements: identifying cause–effect relationships
    through narrative statements, matching tables, decision trees, response curves,
    rating indexes, weighting factors, or comprehensive models; and – validation of
    the developed algorithms in other representative areas. The selection of land
    attributes (site/soil, climate, and crop/management factors) as input variables
    or diagnostic indicators for the predictive models is an essential part of the
    land evaluation analysis. Table 3 shows a list of the main input land characteristics
    used in the evaluation modeling phase. This broad set of site/soil, climate, and
    crop/management factor indicators is grouped according to the developed land suitability
    and land vulnerability approaches. In Table 2, soil evaluation models are named
    only when soil parameters are used as input variables, land evaluation models
    when soil and climate variables are used, and field evaluation models when soil,
    climate, and management characteristics correspond to the input variables. Table

    pressure In order to facilitate the matching of the land characteristics with
    land use requirements or limitations, the land qualities are used. Table 4 presents
    the main land qualities or functions considered in the MicroLEIS DSS models. In
    the land vulnerability models, derived environmental impacts, such as sedimentation
    of streams, rivers, lakes and ditches, appearance of pesticides, and increased
    N and P concentrations in the water resources, loss of wildlife habitat, and effects
    on crop productivity, are also considered. Table 4. Main land qualities considered

    or matching stage forms the basis for assessing the suitability of the land for
    a particular use. This interpretation process is often difficult and subjective
    because of a lack of knowledge on the land performance. Current progress in information
    technology is making possible the application of many different modeling techniques
    to the most complex systems. The more complicated methods allow the quantitative
    trend of land evaluation analysis. Models are considered a simplified representation
    of the real world which can be expressed in a wide variety of forms, such as conceptual
    diagrams, classification systems, and statistical or deterministic mathematical
    models. In land evaluation, empirical-based modeling has moved on from simple
    qualitative approaches to others which are more sophisticated and based on artificial
    intelligence techniques. Additionally, process-based modeling—which is deterministic
    and based on an understanding of the actual mechanisms—has been incorporated into
    land evaluation (Van Lanen, 1991). The classification of land evaluation models
    proposed by Bouma (1999) and adapted by Rossiter (2003) considers the degree of
    computation, ranging from qualitative to quantitative, and the descriptive complexity,
    ranging from empirical to mechanistic. Depending on the two dimensions, several
    levels of models are distinguished: K1 (empirical and qualitative expressions
    of land users experience), K2 (qualitative expressions of expert knowledge), K3
    (empirical and quantitative expressions), K4 and K5 (mechanistic expressions).
    Following this model classification, the land evaluation methodology developed
    in MicroLEIS DSS is considered as follows, from least to most sophisticated (Table
    2). 3.1. Qualitative approaches The matching of the land characteristics with
    land use requirements or limitations may be as simple as narrative statements
    of land suitability for particular uses, or it may group lands subjectively into
    a small number of classes or grades of suitability. In many qualitative approaches,
    a formal quantification is achieved by the application of the rule that the most-limiting
    land quality determines the degree of land suitability or vulnerability. This
    assumes a knowledge of optimum land conditions and of the consequences of deviations
    from this optimum (Verheye, 1988). These relatively simple systems of land evaluation
    depend largely on experience and intuitive judgement: they are real empirical
    models. No quantitative expressions of either inputs or outputs are normally given.
    The ‘USDA (1961) Land Capability System’ and its diverse adaptations, such as
    typical qualitative land evaluation approaches, have been widely used around the
    world. In the initial development of MicroLEIS DSS, the qualitative methods of
    the land user’s experience were widely used to predict the general capability
    for most of the major crops and the specific suitability for a particular crop
    or selected forest species (i.e. Cervatana, Almagra, and Sierra models, respectively;
    De la Rosa et al., 1992). In the Almagra approach, simple matching tables are
    used to express qualitatively soil suitability classes for 12 traditional crops
    (wheat, corn, melon, potato, soybean, cotton, sunflower, sugar beet, alfalfa,
    peach, citrus, and olive) according to the principle of maximum limitation factor.
    The Marisma model also uses a qualitative methodology to establish the limitations
    of a given soil according to selected soil indicators of natural fertility. 3.2.
    Expert systems Expert systems, such as artificial intelligence-based techniques,
    are computer programs that simulate the problem-solving skills of one or more
    human experts in a given field and provide solutions to a problem. These systems
    express inferential knowledge by using decision trees. In land evaluation, decision
    trees give a clear expression of the matching process, comparing land use requirements
    and land characteristics. The expert decision trees are based on scientific background
    (theoretical description) and results of experiences of and discussions with human
    experts (practical experience), and thereby reflect available expert knowledge.
    Decision trees are hierarchical multi-way keys in which the leaves are choices
    (classes/ranges), such as land characteristic generalization levels, and the interior
    nodes of the tree are decision criteria, such as land quality severity levels
    or land suitability classes. Decision trees give a clearer picture of the sequence
    of decisions being made than do traditional matching tables. Where suitable practical
    experience data are available, statistical decision tree analysis can be used
    to generate land evaluation models with good prediction rates when the assumptions
    for other statistical models are not met. These classification and regression
    trees are designed to deal with a low ratio of number of observation to number
    of variables, typical of soil and land resource surveys. This analysis is an iterative
    process of identifying attributes that are critical in the description of the
    response variable. Usually, both expert system procedures—theoretical decision
    trees and statistical decision trees—are used in order to optimize the results.
    The automated land evaluation system (ALES; Rossiter, 1990) is a computer program
    that allows land evaluators to build expert systems for evaluating land units
    according to the method presented in the FAO land evaluation framework (FAO, 1976).
    Evaluators can build their own expert system with ALES, taking into account local
    conditions and objectives. ALES is not an expert system by itself, and does not
    include any knowledge about land and land use. It is a shell within which evaluators
    can express their own local knowledge. The selection of land characteristics and
    associated land qualities for a given land utilization type, which is a crucial
    activity in land evaluation, is not facilitated by this shell. By using the ALES
    shell, the Arenal, Pantanal, and Raizal models of MicroLEIS DSS incorporate techniques
    from expert system to provide a smattering of support to the decision-makers.
    ALES was used only to develop the algorithms of the models. These expert knowledge
    models which consider a reductionist structure predict the land vulnerability
    risks to general and specific diffuse contamination, and to water erosion, respectively
    (De la Rosa et al., 1993). 3.3. Parametric systems Between qualitative and quantitative
    methods lie semi-quantitative land evaluations, derived from the numerically inferred
    effects of various land characteristics on the potential behavior of a land use
    system. Parametric methods can be considered a transitional phase between qualitative
    methods, based entirely on expert judgment, and mathematical models. They account
    for interactions between the most-significant factors by simple multiplication
    or addition of single-factor indexes (Riquier, 1974). Multiplicative systems assign
    separate ratings to each of several land characteristics or factors, then take
    the product of all factor ratings as the final rating index. These systems have
    the advantage that any important factor controls the rating. The first and most
    widely known effort to spell out specific, multiplicative criteria for rating
    land productivity inductively was developed by Storie (1933). The USLE-type land
    degradation systems, basically the universal soil loss equation (USLE; Wischmeier
    and Smith, 1965) and its adaptations, have a very similar form to that of the
    Storie index, and are also operated by multiplying the factor values. In the additive
    systems, various land characteristics are assigned numerical values according
    to their inferred impact on land use. These numbers are either summed, or subtracted
    from a maximum rating of 100, to derive a final rating index. Additive systems
    have the advantage of being able to incorporate information from more land characteristics
    than multiplicative systems. Parametric models can also provide quantitative information,
    specially on the soil water regime and how it affects crop performance. The agro-climatic
    zoning project (AEZ; FAO, 1978) was a milestone in the history of land evaluation,
    introducing a new approach to land suitability assessment and sparking the development
    of quantified methods of land use systems analysis (Driessen and Konijn, 1992).
    In the MicroLEIS DSS system, as a continuation of the Almagra model and prior
    to the Albero model developments, several approaches were developed following
    multiplicative and additive methodologies, with particular reference to soil suitability
    for the olive crop (De la Rosa et al., 1992). The Terraza model uses a single
    procedure to simulate the influence of bioclimatic deficiency on a traditional
    crop, through an adaptation of the AEZ bioclimatic scheme. 3.4. Statistical methods
    In land evaluation, statistical systems are powerful empirical methods for predicting
    land suitability on the basis of selected land characteristics. Correlation and
    multiple regression analyses have been used to investigate the relative contributions
    of selected land characteristics on land suitability and land vulnerability. Where
    suitable basic and response data are available, statistical models can provide
    the basis for objective ratings of land attributes (Graaff, 1988). The land suitability/vulnerability
    or response variable Y is analyzed as a function of the type where Xn corresponds
    to the selected land characteristics or independent variables (e.g. soil depth,
    clay content, organic matter, caption exchange capacity, pH, sodium saturation,
    etc.), and ε measures the residual. Although the mathematical form of φ is not
    known, this function can often be approximated satisfactorily, within the experimental
    context, by a polynomial equation. The calibration of this polynomial model can
    be treated statistically as a particular case of multiple regression. The regression
    coefficient (R2) fitted by this analysis represents an inductive validation index
    of the model corresponding to that accounted for by the percentage of the observed
    variation. This methodology has been especially used to predict soil productivity
    for major crops (Olson and Olson, 1986). Statisticians, agronomists, and soil
    scientists must work together to develop polynomial regressions to benefit from
    such statistical analysis. Statistical relationships are also often used to estimate
    certain engineering or geotechnical properties of soils (e.g. plasticity, workability,
    and compaction) from pedological characteristics (e.g. clay content, organic matter,
    and bulk density; De la Rosa, 1979). The Albero model of MicroLEIS DSS uses polynomial
    equations to predict yields of wheat, maize, and cotton from soil properties.
    The Alcor and Aljarafe models are good examples of soil evaluation methods using
    multiple regression analysis for predicting soil engineering properties (soil
    compaction, and soil plasticity and workability, respectively; De la Rosa et al.,
    1992, Horn et al., 2002). 3.5. Neural networks These artificial-intelligence-based
    technologies, which have grown rapidly over the last few years, show good capability
    to deal with non-linear multivariate systems. Moreover, they can process input
    patterns never presented before, in much the same way as the human brain does.
    Recently, connections have emerged between neural network techniques and its applications
    in engineering, agricultural, and environmental sciences. An artificial neural
    network is a computational mechanism that is able to acquire, represent, and compute
    a weighting or mapping from one multivariate space of information to another,
    given a set of data representing that mapping. It can identify subtle patterns
    in input training data which may be missed by conventional statistical analysis.
    In contrast to regression models, neural networks do not require a knowledge of
    the functional relationships between the input and the output variables. Moreover,
    these techniques are non-linear, and therefore may handle very complex data patterns
    which make simulation modeling unattainable. As well as the ability to model a
    multi-output phenomena, another advantage of neural networks is that all kinds
    of data—continuous, near-continuous, and categorical or binary—can be input without
    violating model assumptions. Once the training and testing phases of the neural
    network analysis are found to be successful, the generated algorithm can be easily
    put to use in practical applications (Baughman and Liu, 1995). Within the MicroLEIS
    DSS framework, the ImpelERO model uses a neural network type—a variation of the
    back-propagation network approach—to predict soil loss by water erosion and its
    impact on crop productivity, and to optimize the agricultural management. In this
    network model, data from the input layer are fed into one or more hidden layers,
    and a set of connection weights are continually adjusted under the supervised
    training mode (De la Rosa et al., 1999). 3.6. Hybrid systems The combination of
    dynamic simulation models and empirically based land evaluation techniques are
    currently producing a cross-fertilization of excellent scientific and practical
    results, improving the accuracy and applicability of the models. For example,
    the simulation modeling especially referring to soil/plant-grown/contamination
    systems is relatively well advanced at the local scale (e.g. process measurement
    sites, experimental stations, small catchments; Jones et al., 2003), but extrapolation
    to a regional scale is still a major priority. This extrapolation can be made
    (i) by scaling-up techniques, developing a linkage between the input variables
    included in the models and information contained in soil survey databases through
    the development of pedo-transfer functions, or (ii) by empirically based land
    evaluation techniques, combining the results of representative applications of
    the simulation models and soil survey database information, through the development
    of meta-models (Simota and Mayr, 1996). The hybrid approach of Bouma et al. (1993)
    demonstrates that dynamic simulation modeling results can fit well into expert
    systems for assessing crop production. This mixed model was obtained in a decision
    tree of branches based on qualitative data combined with branches using quantitative
    data obtained by dynamic simulation. Simulation of the soil water regime provided
    quantitative data for several of the land qualities being distinguished. This
    dynamic simulation/expert system approach should be preferred to simple qualitative
    estimates, although not all land qualities can necessarily be characterized by
    simulation modeling. In the MicroLEIS DSS system, the ImpelERO hybrid model was
    developed using expert decision trees and artificial neural networks for assessing
    soil erosion risk. This approach offers excellent performance in model the complex
    soil erosion problem, and very good quantification and generalization capability
    for prediction (De la Rosa et al., 1999, De la Rosa et al., 2000). 3.7. Optimization
    tools Land evaluation decision support systems for policy-makers and land users
    must focus on choosing optimal use and management decisions. In this sense, optimization
    tools based on land evaluation models are very important in formulating decision
    alternatives—for example, agricultural management practices to minimize threats
    to the sustainability of farming systems. Agricultural management operations depending
    on spatially varying land characteristics have the added difficulty of trying
    to satisfy multiple, and often opposing, aims: the best soil conditions for plant
    growth may not be the best with regard to erosion or pollution. The optimization
    tools are used in conjunction with running various MicroLEIS DSS models. On the
    basis of the quadratic version of the Albero model, a mathematical procedure was
    followed to find a combination of input variables to maximize predicted yields.
    This procedure involved taking the first mathematical derivate with respect to
    each independent variable, setting it to zero, and solving the system of simultaneous
    equations (De la Rosa et al., 1992). On the basis of the expert-system/neural-network
    structure of the ImpelERO model, a computerized procedure was followed to find
    an appropriate combination of management practices to minimize soil loss for a
    particular site (specified climate and soil characteristics). This formulation
    of specific crop management for soil protection of each particular site is one
    of the most interesting features of the ImpelERO model (De la Rosa et al., 2000).
    4. Model application software The possibilities for exploitation of land evaluation
    models in decision-making by developing the model application software or generalization
    phase are enormous. This phase will make possible the practical use of the information
    and knowledge gained during the prior phase of building evaluation models (Antoine,
    1994). Since the beginning of the MicroLEIS project, the emphasis has been on
    developing the model application software. Three versions were developed for each
    of the MicroLEIS DSS models: PC-, Web-, and GIS-based applications (Fig. 1). According
    to the Rossiter (1996) classification of land evaluation models, the PC and Web
    versions of MicroLEIS DSS correspond to the category of “non-spatial models of
    single-area: static resource base, static land suitability”, and the GIS version
    to that of “spatial models of single-area: no inter-cell effects”. 4.1. PC version
    When the land evaluation models are expressed in notations that can be understood
    by a calculating device, the algorithms become computer programs. In order to
    put the models to use in practical applications, i.e. to automate the application
    of land evaluation models, a library of PC-based software was developed. A graphical
    interface was also designed which allows the models to be easily applied. This
    user interface is considered a very important component because, to the user,
    it is the system. Within the MicroLEIS DSS framework, the PC-based software has
    been written using various programming languages, particularly Basic and C++.
    It has the following main characteristics (Fig. 2): (i) input data through the
    keyboard and connection with the attribute databases; (ii) ‘pop up’ screens showing
    codes, types, and classes of input variables; (iii) models running in individual
    and batch processing modes; (iv) output evaluation results in window, printout
    and file formats; and (v) links of output files with GIS databases. These computer
    programs are largely self-explanatory. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    2. Original software of MicroLEIS DSS system to be installed on PC platforms.
    4.2. Web development The model computer programs can also be implemented on the
    Internet through a WWW server, so that users can apply the models directly via
    a Web browser. It is not necessary to download and install the PC software on
    their own servers—they can apply it on a per-use basis. These open-access WWW
    applications offer several advantages, such as their use by many people, allowing
    their usability to be checked in order to improve the systems. Upgrades are immediately
    made available on the WWW server. The website is the center of activity in developing
    operative decision support systems. All the MicroLEIS DSS models have been translated
    into PHP for their direct application on the Web (Fig. 3). However, this version
    of the model allows only the individual, point-by-point application of the soil-,
    land- or field-unit being evaluated. Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    4.3. GIS spatialization Spatialization or regionalization analysis includes the
    use of spatial techniques to expand land evaluation results from point to geographic
    areas, using soil survey and other related maps. The use of geographical information
    system (GIS) technology leads to the rapid generation of thematic maps and area
    estimates, and enables many of the analytical and visualization operations to
    be carried out in a spatial format, by combining different sets of information
    in various ways to produce overlays and interpreted maps. Furthermore, digital
    satellite images can be incorporated directly into many GIS packages. This technology
    is already a prerequisite for managing the massive datasets required for spatial
    land evaluation application—a simple map subsystem (e.g. ArcView; ESRI, 1996)
    being all that is required to show basic data and model results on a map, or to
    extract information from maps to be used in the land evaluation models. The core
    objects can be used for retrieving features from the attribute databases (e.g.
    SDBm Plus, CDBm or MDBm), projecting layers and displaying maps, creation/editing/deletion
    of spatial objects, querying operations, converting from one coordinate system
    to another, mapping the projected layers, etc. At this regional scale, the assessments
    are made from a very broad and generalized perspective. However, this level of
    assessment is where policy decisions are usually made (Davidson et al., 1994).
    The option “Spatialization” of MicroLEIS DSS has recently been developed as a
    deeper stage of the scaling-up process of evaluation models application. GIS technology
    was used to extract information from maps to be used in the predictive models,
    and to show model results on a map. Fig. 4 shows the general scheme of the ArcView
    procedure developed in this spatialization analysis, where the evaluation results
    are estimated by grid cell and aggregated to regional level. In the first stage
    of this general scheme, the soil survey maps, which in geographical format are
    usually polygon multi-factor maps (e.g. Soil Geographical Database of Europe;
    ESB, 2000), are the main source of basic information. Additional basic information
    can be extracted from other soil-survey-related maps, such as land use maps (e.g.
    Corine Land Cover of Europe; EEA, 1995). At regional scale, part of the basic
    information for applying MicroLEIS DSS land evaluation methods can be facilitated
    by single-factor grid maps, such as digital terrain models, along with satellite
    images. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. General scheme of the cell-to-cell
    spatialization process followed to integrate MicroLEIS DSS system with ArcView.
    Secondly, to extract information from original maps to be used in each application,
    a set of derived grid covers are prepared. In this homogenization stage, the spatial
    resolution or grid cell size is determined by the user depending on the smaller
    scale of the original covers. The models can then be run directly within the ArcView
    environment by converting the source codes of the evaluation models to Avenue
    programming language. This spatial application is made cell-to-cell for the different
    covers, obtaining a result value for each cell. As the final stage, the output
    evaluation results are visualized on a grid cover with the spatial resolution
    previously fixed. A polygonal evaluation map can also be elaborated by automatic
    aggregation of the cells with the same result value. The ArcView project, with
    all the required scripts, a dialog box to select the derived covers in each case,
    and several examples of derived covers, is available from the option “Software”
    of the website. A detailed description and user manual, including many screen
    shots of this process, are also available from the “Spatialization” option. 5.
    User applications The MicroLEIS DSS system focuses on soil protection by improving
    agricultural soil use, its planning, and its management. Soil use planning is
    derived mainly from the application results of the land suitability-related models,
    and soil use management from the land vulnerability-related results. The first
    group can include identification of areas with specific bioclimatic deficiencies,
    and soil and terrain limitations for agricultural use (Terraza and Cervatana models);
    selection of forest species in marginal lands (Sierra model); estimates of areas
    with natural fertility problems (Marisma model); and selection and crop yield
    quantification of the main traditional crops (Almagra and Albero models). From
    the second group of results, the MicroLEIS DSS models allow identification of
    areas with soil erosion and contamination problems (Raizal, Arenal, and Pantanal
    models); impact of soil loss on crop productivity, and selection of management
    practices to minimize soil erosion (ImpelERO model); recommendations for site-adjusted
    farming techniques depending on the soil compaction sensitivity (Alcor model);
    and crop management date according to the soil workability conditions (Aljarafe
    model). The MicroLEIS DSS system has been widely used over the last 14 years for
    many different purposes, as listed in the option “Directory” at the website. Table
    5 shows a list of registered users organized by activity type and continent. Of
    the total of 1963 users, the highest number is for Europe—mainly Spain and other
    Mediterranean countries. The South America countries also have many users. According
    to type of activity, teaching and the private sector are the main user activities.
    Within the first group, the university population is the majority. In the private
    sector, the evaluation models are particularly used by consultants. Farmers have
    shown very little interest in this system. Various reasons, such as low level
    of technical training, and lack of agricultural competence and environmental care,
    have been put forward to explain this ignoring of information technology by farmers
    (Ascough et al., 1999). However, the development of a future “network society”
    is foreseen as implying significant changes in the use of information technology
    in agriculture. It is envisioned that farmers will want to apply information technology
    to support the different operational aspects of farming, i.e. real-time decision
    support systems (Thysen, 2000). Fig. 5 presents the distribution of registered
    users from the years 1990 to 2003, pointing out the clear and continued increase
    since the Internet development of MicroLEIS DSS. Table 5. Registered users of

    users of MicroLEIS DSS by year. According to the published results, the different
    components of MicroLEIS DSS have been applied by agro-environmental researchers
    of diverse disciplines. For example, practical applications of the SDBm Plus database
    include ongoing environmental renewal projects in Eastern Europe supported by
    the World Bank. It has been used to record the condition of contaminated or depleted
    soils before and after land restoration projects, and to guide the assessment
    of project investments and follow-up actions. This software is also being used
    by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) to facilitate
    technical research and development planning decisions on an international scale
    (FAO and UNEP, 1999). Recently, the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and
    Natural Resources has adopted the terminology and components of the SDBm Plus
    for its FAO soil database version (Eckelman, 1999). The evaluation models have
    also been widely applied in studying suitability and vulnerability risk for different
    agricultural systems and many geographical areas. Researchers from Mediterranean
    regions have made use of MicroLEIS DSS models to produce land evaluation maps
    for major crops, and erosion and contamination risk (Davidson et al., 1994, Navas
    and Machin, 1997). Many of these applications have followed up with validation
    analysis, good agreement being obtained between the predictive results and those
    measured or estimated by other methods. In one application described by Farroni
    et al. (2002), a modified version of the Raizal model was developed and validated
    in Central Italy to quantify sediment transport by relying on qualitative classes
    of soil erosion risk. In many past studies, researchers accepted the evaluation
    models in MicroLEIS DSS as they were, others showed that adaptations and improvements
    were needed. In some cases, researchers modified the programming code to create
    their own versions of models in order to apply them in particular geographical
    conditions (Bojorquez, 1999). In addition to research applications, the MicroLEIS
    DSS system has been used in teaching in formal university courses at graduate
    and undergraduate levels, such as in the land evaluation courses of the Department
    of Soil Science and Geology of Wageningen Agricultural University (Van Mensvoort
    and Booltink, 2001). 6. Concluding comments With a modular framework such as that
    used in the MicroLEIS decision support system, the components can be easily used
    as required for a particular application. For each application, the selection
    of the most appropriate model, along with the collection of all key information
    on the sources, may constitute most of the effort. Due to the wide range of data
    types required for most of the models, the use of the databases—particularly SDBm
    Plus for soil data—is normally the initial step of any application project. Overall,
    the knowledge-based decision support system approach used in MicroLEIS DSS appears
    to be a very useful method for responding to the need to bring agriculture and
    land resources sciences together for decision-makers. Although many of the models
    have been calibrated with Mediterranean region information, other major components
    allow universal application. At the beginning of the 21st century, the Web is
    becoming the center of activity in developing decision support systems. Using
    the Web-based facility of MicroLEIS DSS, decision support information or decision
    support tools can be provided to any registered user via the Internet at any time,
    thereby disseminating “sustainable soil use and management” analysis. At present,
    most MicroLEIS DSS users belong to the academic sector. Farmers have shown very
    little interest in this system. The future generation of technologically advanced
    users, including senior executives at ease with information technology, will also
    expect more functionality in decision support technology. Senior managers and
    executives will get more directly involved in problem-solving, decision-making,
    and planning. Therefore, decision support tools will play a more central role
    in this rapidly changing environment. Acknowledgements The MicroLEIS decision
    support system has been developed, during the past 14 years, mainly by the authors

    • SLR is conducted using PRISMA approach and148 articles are selected and critically
    analyzed. • The results show the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture.
    • The potential benefits of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their
    implementation in agriculture sector are identified and discussed. • The study
    will positively impact the research around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture
    is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in
    ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world''s population, agri-food
    demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural
    methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully
    benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand
    and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore,
    aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the
    emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this
    purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting
    Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific
    literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying
    the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies
    adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology
    readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies
    such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are
    significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research
    studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most
    use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to
    the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful
    information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along
    with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in issue Next article

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    Year-wise distribution of selected research studies from 2011 to 2021. The breakdown
    of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section
    1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res
    image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution
    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined
    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image

    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies
    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The
    study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center
    in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and
    32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical
    humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively,
    and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid
    (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018,
    the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight
    rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk
    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification

    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components
    description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared
    Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading
    of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV).
    For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or
    surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of
    with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical

    sensors, GPS receiver and server in the center pivot. The wireless GPS node in
    the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12
    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used
    to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined
    using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface
    pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral
    to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to
    the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal
    distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance
    from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path
    length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical
    IRT projection to the soil and , is de IRT Field of Vision (FOV), μ and τ are
    half of the major and minor axis of the ellipse and is the height of the IRT sensor
    with respect to the soil. Download : Download high-res image (373KB) Download

    equation (10). (10) where is the IRT inclination, is FOV/2 and is the half of
    the ellipse-major axis from Fig. 3b. (11) (12) (13) (14) Using the ellipse equation

    (16) is obtained. (15) (16) where is the half of the minor axis of the ellipse.
    Consequently, from equation (11) is obtained equation (17). (17) Finally, the
    ellipse area calculation is determined using equation (18). (18) Using equation
    (18), for example, an IRT looking slightly forward of the drop hoses at an oblique
    angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal
    plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately
    of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface. Fig. 4 specifies the

    and GPS location on the center pivot. A Geo7X GPS (Trimble®, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
    allowed the definition of , (Span1 distance) and (Span2 distance) coordinates,
    with an accuracy of 1–100 cm using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in
    the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three
    variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator
    (UTM) coordinates: , and Distances (from to ) and (from to ) were defined using
    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance
    between IRT sensors ( ), is divided by the number of sensors plus one. In this
    experiment, there were 12 sensors on the pivot, then . A list of sensor locations
    on the pivot , is generated by with . This list contains 12 values, equation (21).
    (21) Each Dynamax IRT sensor sends a frame with a time tick, sensor serial number,
    battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor
    body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of
    canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes
    of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation
    (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The
    keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT
    sensors. The dictionary uses the notation tuples of Key (String): Values (List
    of float numbers), equation (23). S (23). The GPS distance concerning the pivot
    lateral is a constant defined by equation (24). (24) The angle between the pivot
    lateral and the GPS location is a constant defined by equation (25). (25) The
    algorithm to define the location of each sensor on the field in real-time uses
    the following steps: • Acquire data from and convert it to . • Define in Fig.
    3 using the equation (26). (26) • Adding with to define the pivot lateral angle
    . For determining the geographical position of each sensor, the algorithm uses
    a new dynamic center point . This location changes during the pivot movement,
    adding −90 degrees to the center pivot angle according to Fig. 4. 3. Results and
    discussion Fig. 5a shows the GPS node located at the center pivot final tower.

    cell panel connected to a voltage regulator from 12 V to 5 V. The Raspberry Pi3

    Mapping Tool supports the system configuration (sensors, GPS node data acquisition
    and other parameters), data processing and map visualization. The design principles
    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most
    accurate and site-specific information we could offer the irrigation manager with
    the selected technology. In addition, the Infrared Mapping Tool requires minimum
    user input, is very easy to manage and provides ready-to-use data output to irrigation
    prescriptions in real-time. The Infrared Mapping Tool can operate with Raspbian
    or Windows operative systems. This tool records data in plain text format (.txt)
    inside its memory block and in an external pen drive and generates a shape file
    with the information in real-time from the sensors and their locations. The system
    uses a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection for monitoring remotely using
    WIFI communication protocols, and data is sent to a server for processing after
    the acquisition if there is an internet connection. The central station uses a
    Raspberry Pi with a 3.2 in. touch screen. After the initial setup, the user interacts
    with the Main Screen (Fig. 7). If the system configuration does not need modifications,

    significant because they are stored and used to locate the IRT sensors on the
    center pivot and to ensure the dynamic location precision of each sensor when
    it is in movement. The Center Pivot Span Configuration tab allows the user to

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

    In the face of escalating global food demand and the imperative need for sustainable
    agricultural practices, the fusion of technology with farming methodologies has
    emerged as a pivotal solution. With the advent of wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    and their seamless integration into various industries, agriculture has witnessed
    a paradigm shift towards precision farming. In this context, the deployment of
    wireless sensor nodes presents a promising avenue for proactive fault detection
    and real-time monitoring within agricultural landscapes. The conventional agricultural
    practices, while effective, often lack the precision and responsiveness demanded
    by the dynamic environmental conditions and evolving crop health challenges. Addressing
    this gap, the use of wireless sensor nodes offers an innovative approach by facilitating
    continuous and granular data collection across vast agricultural expanses. These
    sensor nodes, strategically placed throughout fields, enable the monitoring of
    crucial parameters such as soil moisture levels, temperature fluctuations, humidity
    variations, and vital plant health indicators. Harnessing the capabilities of
    these sensors coupled with advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms,
    agricultural practitioners gain unprecedented insights into the intricacies of
    their farming ecosystems [1, 2]. This research endeavors to explore, analyze,
    and validate the efficiency of employing wireless sensor nodes as a cornerstone
    for smart fault detection in agricultural systems. By elucidating the technological
    framework, data acquisition methods, and the application of intelligent algorithms,
    this study aims to demonstrate the potential transformative impact of this technology
    on modern farming practices. Moreover, it seeks to address the challenges encountered
    in implementing wireless sensor networks in agriculture while highlighting their
    role in bolstering irrigation and fertilizer efficiency, predictive harvesting,
    minimizing crop losses, and fostering sustainable farming methods [3]. As the
    global population burgeons and the pressure on agricultural productivity intensifies,
    the need for innovative and proactive measures in farming becomes increasingly
    paramount. The integration of wireless sensor nodes stands poised to revolutionize
    the agricultural landscape, heralding a new era of precision, sustainability,
    and resilience in crop production. This paper endeavors to contribute to this
    unfolding narrative by providing empirical insights into the promising frontier
    of wireless sensor networks use for smart fault detection in agriculture, thereby
    reshaping the future of farming practices worldwide. In this research endeavor,
    the subsequent sections delve into various aspects of fault detection in the agricultural
    domain. Following the introduction, the second section meticulously examines the
    mechanisms and techniques employed for detecting defects, establishing a comparative
    analysis of their reliability and effectiveness. Emphasis is placed on the significance
    of using the WSN (wireless sensor nodes) technique while addressing the challenges
    it entails and offering potential solutions. Section three is dedicated to elucidating
    the motivation behind the robustness of WSN in contrast to contemporary and existing
    techniques for defect analysis and determination. The proposed methodology is
    thoroughly outlined in the fourth section. The fifth section is designated for
    an empirical investigation into the adopted strategy, underscoring the attained
    results. Subsequently, in the sixth section, a detailed interpretation of these
    findings is presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method in
    comparison to alternative models. Notably, limitations inherent in the approach
    are explicitly addressed, encompassing potential challenges, drawbacks, and constraints
    specifically related to the use of WSNs within this context. Additionally, the
    discussion encompasses prospective avenues for future research and enhancements,
    unveiling opportunities for further advancement. Finally, the conclusion section
    encapsulates the research outcomes and insights gained. 2 Literal Review 2.1 Position
    of WSN Over Models Agriculture is undergoing a significant transformation owing
    to technological advancements, with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) emerging as
    a critical tool for precision farming. This review aims to comprehensively analyze
    the role, challenges, and potential of WSNs in smart fault detection within agricultural
    systems. WSNs have revolutionized agriculture by enabling real-time monitoring
    of crucial environmental parameters. These sensor nodes, strategically positioned
    across fields, collect data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and plant
    health indicators. Their integration with IoT technologies facilitates seamless
    data transmission and analysis, empowering farmers with actionable insights for
    informed decision-making [4, 5]. Despite their potential, the deployment of WSNs
    in agriculture presents several challenges. Power management, data accuracy, network
    scalability, and interoperability among heterogeneous sensor nodes remain primary
    concerns. Moreover, environmental factors such as signal interference, harsh weather
    conditions, and geographical obstacles pose hurdles in maintaining reliable connectivity.
    As technological framework, advancements in sensor technology, data analytics,
    and machine learning algorithms have propelled the capabilities of WSNs in fault
    detection. Innovations in sensor miniaturization, energy-efficient designs, and
    data processing techniques have enhanced their reliability and accuracy in identifying
    anomalies, diseases, and irrigation issues in crops. Further more, as application
    and benefits, WSNs offer multifaceted benefits in agriculture. They optimize resource
    use by providing precise and localized information, thereby reducing water and
    fertilizer wastage. Early fault detection facilitates timely intervention, mitigating
    crop losses and improving overall yield. Additionally, these systems promote sustainable
    farming practices by minimizing environmental impact through targeted and optimized
    agricultural interventions. Thus, WSN play a pivotal role in agricultural fault
    detection and can be positioned in relation to various strategies commonly used
    in this domain. In Rule-Based Systems, WSN takes a complementary position. It
    can gather real-time data from agricultural fields or equipment, providing continuous
    input for rule-based systems. The WSN feeds data to these systems, enabling the
    application of predefined rules for fault detection based on the collected sensor
    information [6, 7]. In Statistical Analysis, WSN takes an integral component position.
    It provides the necessary data for statistical analysis by continuously collecting
    and transmitting sensor data. The sensor nodes contribute real-time data streams
    that form the basis for establishing statistical models to identify anomalies
    or deviations from normal patterns [8]. In Machine Learning Algorithms, WSN takes
    a fundamental component position. It serves as the primary data collection infrastructure
    for machine learning algorithms. The continuous data streams from sensor nodes
    are used to train and update machine learning models for fault detection, providing
    the necessary input for adaptive learning and pattern recognition. In Fusion of
    Multiple Techniques, WSN has an enabling component position. It acts as the backbone
    for collecting multi-source data necessary for integrating multiple fault detection
    techniques. It provides diverse sensor data, facilitating the fusion and integration
    of rule-based, statistical, and machine learning strategies for comprehensive
    fault detection. In IoT-Enabled Smart Sensors, WSN has an integral component position.
    It consists of smart sensors equipped with communication capabilities, forming
    the basis for real-time monitoring and data transmission essential for fault detection
    in agriculture [9, 10]. In Blockchain-Enabled Systems, WSN has a data source position.
    It contributes to blockchain-enabled systems by providing the data that needs
    to be securely stored and authenticated. It generates the sensor data, which can
    be securely stored on the blockchain to ensure data integrity and traceability.
    In Long-Range Wireless Technologies (LoRa), WSN takes an infrastructure position.
    It leverages long-range wireless technologies for communication between sensor
    nodes and gateways. These technologies serve as the communication infrastructure
    within WSNs, facilitating long-range data transmission from remote agricultural
    areas [11, 12]. Comparing the WSN approach with existing fault detection techniques
    in agriculture involves highlighting the advantages of WSNs over traditional methods
    or other contemporary technologies. Below, an analysis showcasing how WSN approach
    excels in comparison to existing techniques: For Real-Time Monitoring and Timely
    Detection: WSNs enable continuous, real-time monitoring of agricultural parameters.
    They offer immediate fault detection upon deviation from predefined thresholds
    or abnormal patterns, reducing response time and potential losses. Whereas, traditional
    methods, such as manual inspections, periodic checks, or testing equipment, often
    lack real-time monitoring capabilities. They might result in delayed fault detection,
    leading to increased downtime and losses [13]. For Data-Driven Precision and Accuracy:
    WSNs collect and analyze a vast amount of data from multiple sensors, facilitating
    precise fault detection through machine learning algorithms and data fusion techniques.
    This leads to accurate fault identification and reduces false positives or negatives.
    However, some existing techniques rely on simple rules or manual inspections,
    which might lack the depth of analysis or the ability to adapt to complex fault
    patterns, potentially resulting in less accurate detections. Concerning Cost Efficiency
    and Resource Optimization: while initial setup costs for WSNs might be higher,
    they offer long-term cost efficiency by minimizing losses through early fault
    detection, optimizing resource utilization (water, fertilizers, predictive harvesting),
    and reducing manual labor requirements over time. While, traditional methods might
    incur higher labor costs due to manual inspections or require periodic testing
    equipment maintenance, potentially leading to higher operational expenses in the
    long run. About the Scalability and Flexibility: WSNs are scalable and adaptable.
    Additional sensors can be integrated easily into the network, offering flexibility
    in expanding coverage or integrating new sensors for evolving fault detection
    needs. Unlike, some traditional methods might face limitations in scalability,
    especially when relying on manual labor or fixed testing equipment, making it
    challenging to adapt to changing agricultural requirements or expanding operations.
    For Comprehensive Fault Detection and Decision Support: the integration of diverse
    fault detection techniques within WSNs, such as machine learning, statistical
    analysis, and real-time data fusion, offers a comprehensive approach. This enables
    informed decision-making and actionable insights for farmers or stakeholders.
    But, other methods from existing techniques might lack the comprehensive nature
    of WSNs, focusing on specific fault types or lacking the ability to provide holistic
    insights based on real-time, multi-parameter data [14, 15]. Some stations highlighting
    the development and application of WSN in remote fault detection are mentioned
    below. From early 2000s: the concept of WSNs begins to emerge with the development
    of early sensor nodes like Telos, Mica, and Tmote Sky. The Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) as Machine Learning Models gain traction for classification tasks due to
    their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data. From mid-2000s: creation
    of IEEE 802.15.4 Standard. The standardization of low-rate wireless personal area
    networks (LR-WPANs) lays the foundation for the development of WSNs for various
    applications, including agriculture. Decision tree-based models and ensemble methods
    like Random Forests gain popularity for their ability to handle classification
    tasks and interpretability [16]. From late 2000s to early 2010s: WSNs start being
    adopted in precision agriculture, focusing on soil monitoring, weather forecasting,
    and crop health assessment. Deep learning approaches, particularly neural networks,
    see a resurgence due to advancements in computational power and data availability.
    From mid-2010s: the integration of WSNs with the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem
    becomes prevalent, enabling seamless data collection, processing, and analysis
    from agricultural sensors. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and its variants (e.g.
    XGBoost, LightGBM) gain attention for their superior performance in classification
    and regression tasks [16, 17]. From late 2010s to early 2020s: increased adoption
    of cloud-based platforms for data storage, processing, and scalability in handling
    large volumes of sensor data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially long
    short-term memory (LSTM) networks, gain prominence for time-series analysis and
    prediction in agriculture, considering temporal dependencies in sensor data. Actually,
    recent developments focus on developing machine learning models that offer interpretability
    and explainability, such as Explainable AI (XAI), in detecting faults to aid decision-making
    in farming practices. Federated Learning explores federated learning techniques
    to train models collaboratively across different agricultural sites while preserving
    data privacy and security [18]. From another horizon, integrating blockchain technology
    into the realm of agricultural equipment and irrigation systems, especially concerning
    fault detection and data management, offers several potential benefits. Blockchain
    provides a tamper-proof and immutable ledger, ensuring the integrity of data collected
    by sensors in agricultural equipment. This feature prevents unauthorized alterations
    or manipulations, ensuring the authenticity of fault detection records.Through
    blockchain, every change or transaction recorded within the system can be traced
    back to its origin. This traceability can be valuable for tracking the history
    of faults detected in equipment or changes in irrigation systems over time. Blockchain''s
    decentralized nature enables secure data storage across multiple nodes, reducing
    the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing data security. Blockchain
    can facilitate controlled and permissioned access to sensor data. Authorized stakeholders,
    including farmers, agronomists, and maintenance personnel, can securely access
    specific data relevant to their roles. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts
    with predefined conditions, can automate tasks triggered by fault detections.
    For instance, when a fault is identified in an irrigation system, a smart contract
    could automatically trigger a maintenance request or adjust irrigation settings
    based on predefined parameters. Blockchain''s transparency can aid in tracking
    agricultural equipment and components throughout their lifecycle. This transparency
    ensures authenticity and reliability in the supply chain, allowing farmers to
    verify the origin and authenticity of equipment [19]. Implementing tokenization
    through blockchain could incentivize stakeholders for efficient equipment maintenance
    or early fault reporting. This system can reward participants with tokens or digital
    assets for contributing valuable data or maintaining equipment in optimal conditions.
    Blockchain can facilitate interoperability between different agricultural systems
    and platforms, allowing seamless integration of data from various sources. Standardization
    of data formats can enhance compatibility and collaboration among different stakeholders
    and systems. Blockchain-enabled systems can track environmental impact data associated
    with agricultural practices, including water usage, energy consumption, and carbon
    emissions. This transparency can help in adopting more sustainable and environmentally
    friendly practices [20]. Integrating blockchain technology into fault detection
    in agricultural equipment and irrigation systems requires careful consideration
    of implementation challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and regulatory
    compliance. However, leveraging blockchain''s inherent features can significantly
    enhance the security, transparency, and efficiency of fault detection processes
    in agriculture. According to the above descriptions, we have chosen to design
    an agricultural fault detection system based on a Delta-hybridization between
    WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain and a Deep learning classifier ERSOM model
    that stands for Evolutionary Recurrent Self Organizing Map. 2.2 Node Principle
    A Node represents an autonomous real time computational system. It receives the
    signals through its integrated sensors and processes them using a Digital Signal
    Processor DSP. A sensor is a fundamental part of Smart technologies that functions
    as a transducer using various effects like capacitive or inductive (magnetic).
    A set of sensors, forming a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), collaborate autonomously
    to monitor and communicate information regarding potential issues. These autonomous
    microsystems communicate wirelessly in a designated space, known as a collector
    field. Nodes, equipped with high-end sensors, organize themselves into a self-structured
    topology, transmitting collected data to an information system or processing center,
    potentially via specialized nodes called “sinks.” Energy constraints, typically
    from small batteries, underscore the importance of managing energy as a critical
    resource in sensor nodes, making WSN technology pervasive and adaptable across
    diverse domains. In general, wireless sensors typically consist of various components
    including capture, processing, communication, and energy units. Depending on the
    application, additional elements like Global Positioning System GPS for environmental
    tracking or solar-powered mobility systems can be integrated. The resilience of
    WSN heavily relies on sensor material quality and precision. Despite their small
    size, nodes feature an efficient architecture incorporating multiple circuits
    on a single board, comprising detection units, microcontrollers, RF-antennas,
    and power units [21]. Further details on the internal structure of a node are
    depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Architecture of wireless sensor node Full size image
    The detection unit comprises a set of sensors to assess information reliability
    from the environment; in case of sensor failure, it ensures data integrity. Sensor
    outputs link to the processing unit via anti-aliasing filters and an ADC for compatibility.
    This unit functions as the node''s core, managing internal operations, fault detection,
    energy, and coordination among WSN nodes'' processors. ROM and RAM storage support
    processing instructions, communication programs, and collected data. An RF antenna
    circuit enables communication between nodes, while the power unit''s lifespan
    relies on limited resources. External flash memory expands applications limited
    by chip memory, and internal I/O buses ease component communication within the
    node. An RF antenna is integrated at the node''s extremity. 3 Adopted Approach
    Our idea is to design a remote agricultural fault detection model offering better
    reliability and efficiency than those established by existing methods. This approach
    is based on the Delta-Hybridization between WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain
    and a Deep learning classifier ERSOM model that stands for Evolutionary Recurrent
    Self Organizing Map. This last model represents the pivot of the analysis of the
    signals received by sensors. It revolves around a recurrent evolutionary algorithm
    of a self-organizing neural map with unsupervised learning, giving the possibility
    of processing a large volume of data. Recurrence is applied to this neural map
    in order to integrate the dynamic temporal aspect by adapting it to the ability
    to process and evaluate dynamic and not static data information. The fault detection
    and recognition algorithm carried out by this recurrent neural map will subsequently
    be considered a nucleus or an individual of population of iterations supported
    by an evolutionary genetic algorithm ensuring the extension of the search space.
    This insight allows to optimize results and avoid being trapped in an optimal
    static state. This algorithm will be managed by the DSP Mounted on the Sensor
    Node card. This algorithm will be managed by the DSP Mounted on the Sensor Node
    card. The processing result will be carried out based on a comparison between
    the primitives and singularities of the signal received from the system to be
    controlled and the data characterizing all types of faults from an archived database
    and updated at each event at the level of the Block-chain to which it is linked.
    This result will be broadcast in real time through the WSN to a master node linked
    by an HMI interface. The Blockchain and WSN models are detailed previously. The
    following Fig. 2 offers a view on the adopted strategy. Fig. 2 Typical used wireless
    sensor network Full size image RTU stands for remote terminal unit; terminal Node
    mounted on the system to be controlled. MTU stands for master terminal unit; terminal
    Node linked to human–machine interface HMI. The proposed terminal wireless sensor
    node RTU comprises capture, processing, communication, and energy units. The Sensing
    unit includes a physical capture device for local environment data and an Analog
    to Digital Converter (ADC) transforming analog signals into digital ones interpreted
    by the microcontroller. Memories store information from the capture unit. The
    communication unit, known as the Transceiver unit, handles wireless data transmission
    and reception. It can be optical, as in Smart Dust Nodes, or radiofrequency-based,
    with optical communication being robust against electrical interference but requiring
    a direct line of sight. Radio frequency units include modulation, demodulation,
    filtering, and multiplexing circuits. Sensor nodes equipped with various sensors,
    e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture, pH sensors, relevant to agricultural
    monitoring. These sensor nodes are distributed across the agricultural area, collecting
    real-time data continuously from the environment such as soil moisture levels,
    temperature variations, humidity, and other relevant parameters related to crop
    health and equipment status. Sensor nodes communicate wirelessly with each other
    and with a central base station or gateway, called sink, using communication protocols
    such as Long Range transmission LoRa. Wireless communication allows the collected
    data to be transmitted over extended distances to a centralized location for further
    processing and analysis. Data collected from various sensor nodes is aggregated
    and transmitted to a centralized system or cloud-based platform. In this centralized
    system, the received data undergoes processing, analysis, and storage for fault
    detection and decision-making. Advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms
    are applied to the collected data to identify patterns, anomalies, or deviations
    from normal conditions. These algorithms analyze sensor data to detect potential
    faults in agricultural equipment, irrigation systems, or anomalies in environmental
    parameters that could affect crop health. Once anomalies or faults are detected
    through data analysis, the system generates alerts or notifications to relevant
    stakeholders, farmers, agronomists, maintenance personnel, for timely intervention.
    Early warning systems or automated alerts enable proactive maintenance, minimizing
    the impact of faults on agricultural operations. It is important to highlight
    that the ERSOM neural model''s learning phase on an agricultural systems fault
    database might take several hours and can reach one day. The duration depends
    on factors such as the database size, model topology, neuron count, learning iterations,
    and stopping criteria. Once the model has learned and becomes proficient in identifying
    these faults, its real-time testing phase will be instantaneous during system
    control. The signal processing steps for the controlled part proceed as follows:
    Firstly, filtering, windowing, and segmenting the signal to extract primitives
    defining the contained information. Various methods define these primitives, such
    as the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) matrix. However, our approach
    opts for determining the primitives as Bi-spectrum matrices, as they are well-suited
    for characterizing highly transient stochastic signals. Thus, the Bi-spectrum
    designates an autocorrelation of order 2, called moment of order 2. Namely that
    the cross correlation is the measure of the analogy between two signals according
    to a time shift applied to one of them. One of the signals will be the signal
    measured by the sensors and the other signal is that of the database as a reference.
    The autocorrelation goes deeper to determine the coefficients of similarities
    between the measured signal and the reference one which resembles it better among
    the samples of signals in the database as a reference. The Bi-spectrum, as an
    autocorrelation of order 2, goes even deeper to be like a more selective filter
    in the determination of the similarity coefficients to a very precise default
    sample. Each matrix of bispectrum coefficients will be concatinated vertically
    in order to reduce it into a line vector, without loss of characteristics, which
    represents the input to our ERSOM model. It will be processed quickly to visualize
    the type of defects on one of the neurons, if any. The computation of the bi-spectral
    coefficients will be performed in the following manner: We examine a discrete
    signal x(n) obtained from the motor-pump machine, with a mean of zero and considered
    a locally stationary random process. The signal''s length, denoted as N, ranges
    from 0 to. N − 1. The expression for its autocorrelation function is as follows:
    $$ R_{xx} (m) = E\\left\\{ {x(n)x(n + m)} \\right\\} $$ (1) The calculated \\({\\text{E}}\\left\\{
    \\cdot \\right\\}\\), known as the mathematical expectation, represents the average
    within a set, serving as a statistical function with a discrete time-delay denoted
    as m. It is also referred to as the second-order moment. If the two signals are
    not correlated, we have the autocorrelation R = 0. In case of resemblance we obtain
    simularity coefficients. The Power Spectrum PS is determined by applying the Fourier
    transform (FT) to the preceding formula [22]. $$ P_{xx} (f) = \\sum\\limits_{m
    = - \\infty }^{ + \\infty } {R_{xx} (m)} \\,e^{ - j2\\pi fm} $$ (2) An alternalive
    formula can be used. $$ P_{xx} (f) = E\\left\\{ {X(f)X^{ * } (f)} \\right\\} =
    E\\left\\{ {\\left| {X(f)^{2} } \\right|} \\right\\} $$ (3) X* represents the
    conjugate of X(f), which computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of our
    primary current signal to be controlled, x(n). $$ X(f) = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^{N
    - 1} {x(n)} \\,e^{{ - j\\frac{2\\pi fn}{N}}} $$ (4) Additionally, we derive the
    bispectrum, referred to as bispectral density B(f1, f2), by applying a transform
    function (TF) to the third-order moment depicted in the equation below. $$ M_{3}^{x}
    (k,l) = E\\left\\{ {x^{ * } (n)x(n + k)x(n + l)} \\right\\}. $$ (5) The parameters
    k and l represent time delay points. Essentially, we need to estimate the expected
    bispectrum values from limited data using the following formula. $$ \\begin{aligned}
    \\hat{B}(f_{1} ,f_{2} ) & = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{M} {X_{k} (f_{1}
    )X_{k} (f_{2} )X_{k}^{ * } (f_{1} + f_{2} )} \\\\ & \\approx E\\left\\{ {X(f_{1}
    )X(f_{2} )X^{ * } (f_{1} + f_{2} )} \\right\\} \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (6) The
    sensor detects the fault signal x(n), which is subsequently processed by the processor
    within the suitable WSN node. This calculation involves setting f1 and f2 to an
    identical value, denoted as f, and is expressed as: $$ \\hat{B}(f_{1} ,f_{2} )\\left|
    {_{{f_{1} = f_{2} = f}} } \\right. = \\hat{D}(f) \\approx E\\left\\{ {X^{2} (f)X^{
    * } (2f)} \\right\\}. $$ (7) As exemple, considering a fracture defect in the
    bars of a motor-pump rotor estimated from research to constitute 10% of potential
    defects. The features of BRB related to this specific failure type include frequency
    components defined by the following Eq. (8) [22, 23]. $$ f_{BRB} = \\left[ {\\left(
    \\frac{k}{p} \\right)\\left( {1 - s} \\right) \\pm s} \\right]f_{s} $$ (8) Observing
    that the supply frequency is denoted by fs, the number of pole pairs by p, k represents
    a constant proportionality, and s signifies the rotor magnetic slip. Given the
    effects of speed ripple, it''s plausible that supplementary frequency components
    might appear in the stator current spectrum. Hence, an additional Eq. (9) could
    identify these components. $$ f_{BRBs} = (1 \\pm 2ks)f_{s} $$ (9) To identify
    rotor faults through its connected WSN node, analysis of the side-band frequency
    components at (1 ± 2 s)fs has been conducted. We establish that the lower sideband
    represents the primary fault frequency, while the upper sideband signifies the
    harmonic frequency of certain resultant velocity fluctuations. Consequently, we
    can use these two distinct values as effective control factors. To create a singular
    factor, we calculate their average, as shown below. $$ I_{dB} = \\left[ {20\\log_{10}
    \\left( {\\frac{{I_{l} }}{I}} \\right) + 20\\log_{10} \\left( {\\frac{{I_{r} }}{I}}
    \\right)} \\right]/2 $$ (10) Namely, I1 represents the fault module, Ir signifies
    the rotor current module, which is depicted by the upper sideband, and I represents
    the stator current module as the fundamental. Additionally, the stator current
    related to a mechanical BRB fault can be mathematically depicted. This model characterizes
    the stator current concerning electrical asymmetries in the rotor, generating
    what are known as sideband frequencies, expressed by the equation. $$ \\begin{aligned}
    i_{a} (t) & = i_{f} \\cos (\\omega t - \\varphi ) + \\sum\\limits_{k} {i_{l,k}
    } \\cos ((\\omega - \\omega_{f,k} )t - \\varphi_{l,k} ) \\\\ & \\quad + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{r,k} } \\cos ((\\omega + \\omega_{f,k} )t - \\varphi_{r,k} ) \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (11) where fs is the fundamental frequency of the electrical power. As \\(\\omega_{f,k}
    = 2ks\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f_{s}\\), the above expression will be:
    $$ \\begin{aligned} i_{a} (t) & = i_{f} \\cos (2\\pi f_{s} t - \\varphi ) + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{l,k} } \\cos (2\\pi f_{l,k} t - \\varphi_{l,k} ) \\\\ & \\quad + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{r,k} } \\cos (2\\pi f_{r,k} t - \\varphi_{r,k} ) \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (12)
    The separated formula of the controlled current signal will undergo processing
    by the node''s microcontroller. It will then be compared to a healthy signal used
    as a reference to detect faults in machines.This procedure involves applying a
    transform function to the aforementioned equation to obtain the subsequent spectral
    relationship. $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{a} (f) & = \\frac{{i_{f} }}{2}\\delta (f
    - f_{s} )e^{j\\varphi } + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum\\limits_{k}^{{}} {i_{l,k} \\delta

    {i_{r,k} \\delta (f - f_{r,k} )e^{{j\\varphi_{r,k} }} } . \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (13) This mathematical model allows for further breakdown into basic elements,
    which are easily comprehensible for the WSN Node''s processor to handle [24].
    $$ \\begin{aligned} B(f_{1} ,f_{2} ) & = I_{a} (f_{1} )I_{a} (f_{2} )I_{a}^{ *

    \\end{aligned} $$ (14) Next, a numerical example simulation will be conducted
    to generate the bi-spectrum. The description of the experimental stator current
    is outlined as follows: $$ i_{a} (t) = i_{f} \\cos (2\\pi f_{s} t - \\varphi )
    + i_{l,1} \\cos (2\\pi f_{l,1} t - \\varphi_{l,1} ) + i_{r,1} \\cos (2\\pi f_{r,1}
    t - \\varphi_{r,1} ) $$ (15) Upon carefully selecting various parameter values
    from the preceding equation, the processor within the WSN Node of the respective
    machine, following the requested information routing at the collection node level,
    enables us to visualize curves labeled accordingly for power spectrum and bispectrum,
    depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Power spectrum PS and bi-spectrum of a node received
    signal [24] Full size image While this proposed approach offers significant advantages
    in agricultural fault detection, it is not without limitations. Overcoming these
    limitations and planning for future enhancements are pivotal to optimize WSN efficacy
    in agriculture. The constraints include issues such as limited battery life and
    energy consumption, data security and privacy concerns, scalability challenges,
    data management complexities, sensor accuracy reliability, implementation costs,
    and the need for interdisciplinary knowledge integration. To address these, advancements
    in low-power sensor technologies, robust encryption, improved scalability, efficient
    data processing, enhanced sensor reliability, cost-effective solutions, and interdisciplinary
    collaborations are essential. By focusing on technological advancements, refined
    protocols, and collaborative endeavors, WSNs can become more efficient, reliable,
    cost-effective, and user-friendly, ensuring widespread adoption and seamless integration
    into agricultural practices. A techno-economic study shows that implementing Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSNs) in agriculture offers multifaceted advantages, but a comprehensive
    cost–benefit analysis compared to traditional fault detection methods is essential
    to ascertain their overall value. Examining the cost–benefit analysis reveals
    numerous benefits of WSNs in agriculture, such as enhanced precision and efficiency
    in monitoring parameters, real-time data collection enabling timely interventions,
    reduced labor and operational costs, optimized resource utilization, and early
    fault detection capabilities. However, implementing WSNs involves costs related
    to hardware, installation, maintenance, and data management. When compared to
    traditional methods, WSNs showcase superior accuracy, cost efficiency in the long
    run, scalability, comprehensive coverage, and adaptability to changing agricultural
    needs. Despite the higher initial investment, WSNs prove to be more efficient,
    minimizing losses, optimizing resources, and offering real-time, accurate data
    for improved productivity and sustainability in agriculture. In a simplified qualitative
    perspective, WSNs exhibit higher accuracy, real-time capabilities, scalability,
    and potential for cost reduction over time, leading to a moderately high to high
    techno-economic score, whereas traditional methods may offer lower initial costs
    but could result in increased long-term operational expenses and potential losses,
    resulting in a moderate to low techno-economic score. 4 Experiment Results The
    experimental setup consists of the following components: A three-phase induction
    machine under the control of an ‘OMRON’ inverter. The rotor shaft is linked to
    a DC generator, connected to a rheostat for load control. Characteristics of the
    induction machine include: Nominal power: 4 kW Nominal speed: 1480 rpm Moment
    of inertia: J = 0.013 kg m2 Number of stove pairs: P = 2 SKF 6208 ball bearing
    with mechanical rotational frequencies: outer ring (fbext = 89.4 Hz), inner ring
    (fbint = 136 Hz), ball cage (fc = 9.94 Hz), and ball frequency (fbille = 58.4
    Hz). Using a Micro-log portable terminal for acquiring and storing sensor measurements.
    The sensor used is a piezoelectric accelerometer. The entire test bench is defined
    by Fig. 4 below. Fig. 4 Experimental bench Full size image Our ERSOM fault classification
    model was trained using an energetically balanced, locally developed database.
    This database comprises 100 signal samples obtained from the test bench, representing
    diverse failures such as mechanical, electrical, vibration, thermal, and physical
    issues, accompanying the normal signal. The neuron map consists of 100 neurons,
    and the ERSOM model was trained with a stopping criterion after 1000 iterations.
    Subsequently, during the control and testing phase, the ERSOM model analyzed the
    stator signal received from the machine, specifically depicting a mechanical fault
    in the ball bearing. The resulting output of the ERSOM model visualized the topology
    showcased in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Visualization of the inner ring failure over ERSOM
    model Full size image The topology depicted by ERSOM revealed the presence of
    a ball bearing fault indicated by the frequency Fbi. This fault is accurately
    defined within the inner ring and is constrained by the cutoff harmonics Fn1 and
    Fn2, situated close to the Best Matching Unit (BMU) neuron linked to the fault.
    Additionally, further examination reveals the presence of the reasoning frequency
    Fre generated by the primary fault. Tthe character ‘h’ indicates a healthy signal.
    We plot the spectral amplitude of the processed signal and observe the curve in
    Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Spectrum of the inner ring failure Full size image The main fault
    occupies a frequency of 680 Hz and the two harmonics are present with a difference
    on either side of 25 Hz. This implies that Fn1 has a frequency of 655 Hz and Fn2
    is at a frequency of 705 Hz. In the same way we can see the curve which defines
    the bi-spectrum of the same machine when it is requested by the same frequencies
    of a failure, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 The bi-spectrum of the inner ring failure
    Full size image Furthermore, using Bi-Spectrum analysis will aid in discerning
    the severity of faults. Referring to Fig. 7, it becomes apparent that the encountered
    peaks are extremely abrupt and lack any frequency breadth. In the same way, the
    rules determining the performance criteria of the fault classifier models which
    qualify the operation of the WSN Nodes are established as follows: a. Accuracy:
    measures the overall correctness of the model''s predictions. Its formula is expressed
    as follows [25, 26]: $$ {\\mathbf{Ac}} = \\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{TN}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{TN}} + {\\text{FP}} + {\\text{FN}}} \\right)
    $$ (16) where TP = True Positives, TN = True Negatives, FP = False Positives,
    FN = False Negatives. Accuracy gives the ratio of correctly predicted instances
    to the total instances in the dataset. b. Precision: indicates the ratio of correctly
    predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
    It has the following formula: $$ \\Pr = {\\text{TP}}/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{FP}}}
    \\right) $$ (17) Precision focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions and
    indicates the model''s ability to avoid false positives. c. Recall (Sensitivity
    or True Positive Rate): Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations
    to all actual positives. It is defined by the following formula: $$ {\\mathbf{Recall}}
    = {\\text{TP}}/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{FN}}} \\right) $$ (18) Recall measures
    the model''s ability to identify all relevant instances, showing its sensitivity
    to true positives. d. F1-score: F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and
    recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall. It is calculated using
    the following formula: $$ {\\text{F1-score}} = 2*\\left( {{\\text{Precision}}*{\\text{Recall}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {{\\text{Precision}} + {\\text{Recall}}} \\right) $$ (19) F1-score
    considers both false positives and false negatives and is useful when the class
    distribution is imbalanced. The obtained indicators are presented in Table 1.
    Table 1 Evaluation of classifier models Full size table These findings are highlighted
    by the Fig. 8 represented in below. Wherein, It is remarkable that the proposed
    ERSOM model is clearly advantageous compared to other models. Fig. 8 Performance
    of different classifier models Full size image Based on the Fig. 8 curve, it''s
    evident that neural models, particularly the dynamic model RSOM and the evolutionary
    model ERSOM, hold superior positions in performance compared to others. Nonetheless,
    it''s worth noting that SVM has the potential to surpass both the Kmeans moving
    center algorithm and the static SOM model in terms of performance. 5 Results Discussion
    The ERSOM deep learning model’s topology, Fig. 5, reveals that among the 100 neurons,
    merely 2 neurons remain unoccupied. This signifies an impressive defect identification
    rate of 98% using this model. Thus, it offers a precise objective evaluation with
    a well-defined visualization. The ERSOM map identifies the anomaly on the inner
    ring, delineated by the frequency fbi signified by the winning neuron. Adjacent
    neurons signal frequencies fn1 and fn2, representing fbi + fc and fbi–fc, respectively.
    The indicator fre denotes the resonance frequency of the induction machine''s
    structure. The curve depicted in Fig. 6 represents the spectral amplitude of the
    signal under examination, which help us in mechanical inner ring defect identification.
    However, this assessment remains subjective and lacks defined scores for evaluation.
    The spectrum illustrated in the same Fig. 6, depicting the vibration signal from
    the sensor, discloses the following insights: The amplitude evolution of harmonic
    components follows a pattern such as (555 + k25) Hz, where k = 0, 1, 2, 3, …,
    representing frequencies resulting from the ball''s passage on the indentation.
    A substantial increase in amplitudes, approximately 100 dB around 780 Hz, signifies
    the resonance of the structure, possibly attributed to the 31st harmonic resonance
    of rotation (780.2/25 = 31.2). The identification of the 5th order harmonic (680.2/136 = 5)
    reveals the presence of a mechanical anomaly in the inner ring when observed in
    the spectrum''s zoomed mode. The Bi-spectrum plotted in Fig. 7 distinctly illustrates
    a resemblance to the outcomes presented in the ERSOM topology depicted in Fig.
    5. This similarity indicates that the ERSOM model, trained and tested using Bi-spectrum
    coefficients, aligns closely with the observed results. Consequently, this correlation
    strongly substantiates the accuracy and validity of the ERSOM deep learning model
    employed to steer the WSN Node. As depicted in Fig. 8, it''s evident that the
    ERSOM deep learning evolutionary model stands out significantly due to its efficiency
    compared to other models. This superiority is attributed to its integration of
    three essential criteria: evolutionaryism for broadening the search space, dynamism
    facilitated by a loop of recurrence that incorporates temporal aspects, and a
    neuronal aspect that mimics human thought processes. However, it''s important
    to note that this proposed model demands considerably more time during its unsupervised
    learning phase. Moreover, diverse outcomes arise from various fault detection
    strategies in agriculture: Rule-Based Systems: Swift fault identification using
    predefined rules, as seen in detecting irrigation system faults. Statistical Analysis:
    Identification of anomalies or outliers in soil moisture data, suggesting potential
    system issues. Machine Learning Algorithms: Improved accuracy in spotting subtle
    changes in crop health, aiding in early disease detection. Fusion of Multiple
    Techniques: Enhanced precision by combining strategies like rule-based systems
    and machine learning for fault detection. IoT-Enabled Smart Sensors: Real-time
    monitoring and rapid identification of temperature fluctuations, indicating potential
    crop damage. Blockchain-Enabled Systems: Ensuring secure and traceable records
    of fault detection through blockchain technology. Note that, Zigbee finds common
    usage in home automation, industrial control systems, and healthcare due to its
    cost-effectiveness and low power consumption. Meanwhile, Bluetooth enjoys widespread
    adoption in consumer electronics such as smartphones, audio devices, and wearables
    owing to its user-friendly nature and compatibility. The Internet serves various
    sectors, encompassing communication, commerce, cloud services, and IoT applications.
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) excel in environmental monitoring, agriculture,
    and healthcare, offering real-time data collection from distant areas. Notably,
    WSN tends to have lower data rates but can cover extensive distances, while the
    Internet exhibits high return on investment ROI potential, particularly in business,
    communication, and data services. Comparably, Wireless Sensor Networks WSN technology
    can have a strong ROI in industries like environmental monitoring, healthcare,
    and agriculture due to their ability to gather data from remote or hazardous locations.
    However, using WSN for fault detection in agriculture encounters key challenges
    such as: Limited access to power sources in remote areas affects device lifespan
    and functionality. Varied landscapes impede signal transmission, affecting accuracy.
    Environmental factors impact sensor accuracy, requiring regular calibration. Efficiently
    handling large data volumes poses computational challenges. High deployment costs
    in vast agricultural areas need a balance for effectiveness. Security and protecting
    sensitive data during transmission is critical. Adapting WSN with existing systems
    is complex, requiring compatibility measures. As avenues for future research and
    improvements to reveal opportunities for further progress, we point out that advancements
    in sensor technology, energy efficiency, and tailored algorithms are crucial to
    overcome these challenges, realizing WSN''s full potential in precise agriculture
    fault detection. 6 Conclusion The WSNs are actually widely applicable in major
    emerging technology. We expressed, in this topic, the ability of the proposed
    Wireless Sensor Node strategy, which becomes a smart powerful tool in remote monitoring
    condition. Our approach is enriched by using the higher order spectrum called
    Bi-spectrum in primitive extraction and analysis of controled signal over an evolutionary
    recurrent self organizing deep learning model ERSOM. This model is implemented
    on the DSP of a Wireless Node Card. Our adopted approach is based on the Delta-Hybridization
    between WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain and a Deep learning classifier
    ERSOM model to overcome some limitations and challenges experienced by traditional
    techniques. The practical application of this method for detecting agricultural
    defects demonstrates its resilience in analyzing these issues and making real-time
    decisions, showcasing promising results in comparison to current techniques. However,
    there are additional paths for further advancement in the future. Data Availability

  description: The practice of agriculture is heavily reliant on the implementation
    of irrigation systems. Technology improvements have made it unnecessary to rely
    on someone else to perform irrigation when we are out and whenever crops need
    to be watered. Many researchers have attempted to autonomously irrigate crops,
    but difficulties with accuracy, timing, and cost are rarely addressed and given
    top priority. The proposed approach employs a real-time sensor, wireless sensor
    network, the adaptive bacterial foraging optimization (ABFO) algorithm, and a
    fuzzy irrigation system control to achieve autonomous watering, thereby enabling
    smart irrigation. This method reduces waste while preserving the container's water
    supply. Automated irrigation determines whether crops need to be watered by considering
    the type of crop, the weather, and the soil moisture and not soil moisture alone.
    The need for water is calculated using the three aforementioned criteria and fuzzy
    control drives the automation. Using an arduino-based IoT circuitry, the bioinspired
    model with algorithm adaptive bacterial foraging optimization, generates the optimized
    values for three parameters, which are then used by fuzzy logic control to predict
    the watering requirements of the plants. In terms of accuracy, timeliness, and
    cost, the suggested approach is advantageous. With this model, it is now possible
    to completely automate the irrigation system.

    The demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel increase rapidly due to the fast expansion
    of the global population, income growth, technological advancement, and transport
    and logistics improvements (van Dijk et al., 2021). Precision agriculture (PA),
    which seeks to apply the right amount of inputs (fertilizers, irrigation water,
    pesticides, and other chemicals) in the right location at the right time, is essential
    to meet the requirements of future global food production, as well as environmental
    sustainability and climate resilience. PA is predicated on accurate sensor measurements,
    timely and sound decision-making, and automated actuators. The backbone of PA
    is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that automates data collection, data
    analytics, data presentation, control, and efficient data communication (Chamara
    et al., 2022). Imaging sensors or digital cameras are essential for PA as they
    can capture more information than traditional scalar or vector sensors. Images
    can capture crop phenology for precise decision-making (Taylor and Browning, 2022,
    Tian et al., 2020). Cyclic events such as vegetative growth, flowering, leaf count
    and color change, maturation, and senescence are studied in crop phenology, which
    is essential to PA as it determines the management inputs required by crops. Moreover,
    images have rich information on the scene that allows for pest pressure evaluation.
    At present, a limited number of sensors are available for pest identification
    and pest pressure estimation. Among them, imaging sensors provide the most promising
    solution. Conventional (handcrafted feature extraction) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI)-based image processing are the two branches of image processing. Traditional
    approaches extract image features defined by shape, texture, and color (Anubha
    et al., 2019, Yuan et al., 2019). The AI-based methods use Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNN) to extract features from images (Luis et al., 2020). CNN models
    with multiple hidden layers for feature extraction and learning are considered
    Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) (LeCun et al., 1998). Conventional imaging
    platforms in PA store images locally using onboard storage memories. Post processing
    refers to the processing of images stored at the central data storage in batches
    at a later time to extract useful information (Aasen et al., 2020). Imaging platforms
    that can access the internet through a stable connection with high bandwidth can
    automatically upload images to Cloud data storage. The vast majority of farmlands
    worldwide are in rural and remote areas with poor access to electric power and
    internet connectivity. This represents a big challenge for camera systems deployed
    in rural farmlands for high-speed image processing, data transmission, and low-latency
    decision-making (Richardson, 2019). Post-processing of crop images has been used
    for the estimation of leaf area index (Aasen et al., 2020), growth rate (Sakamoto
    et al., 2012), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen content (Wang et al., 2014), fruit
    counts (Wang et al., 2014), and plant height (Sritarapipat et al., 2014). Further
    post-image processing allows for the assessment of biotic stress, such as pest
    density (Barbedo, 2014; Park et al., 2007) and weed pressure (Wang et al., 2019),
    as well as abiotic stress, such as nutrient deficiency (Ghorai et al., 2021).
    Richardson (2019) suggested that deep learning-based methods have the potential
    to facilitate the extraction of more sophisticated phenological data from both
    new and previously archived camera imagery compared to conventional image processing.
    Semantic segmentation-based canopy coverage (CC) estimation (Chamara et al., 2021;
    Liang et al., 2023), image classification-based crop identification (Anubha et
    al., 2019), disease identification (Sharma et al., 2020), growth stage prediction
    (Yasrab et al., 2021) and object detection-based plant feature identification
    (A. Wang et al., 2019) are examples of DCNN applications in agriculture. Conventional
    image processing requires less computational power and less energy, but they are
    limited in adaption to new scenarios, while deep learning requires high computational
    power and consumes more energy. DCNN models require large memory due to the large
    number of parameters these models hold. Therefore, it is not easy to implement
    these models practically in embedded systems that have less memory and computation
    power. These models also require a large amount of data to train to predict with
    high accuracy. Therefore, it is resource intensive. Edge image processing is the
    image processing done on image-capturing devices. The main advantage of edge image
    computing is that it lowers the high throughput data transmission requirement
    over a wireless IoT-enabled imaging network (Cao et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2022a)
    demonstrated the capability of identifying potted flowers with precision above
    89 % in real-time in a Jetson TX 2 computing module based on a DCNN algorithm.
    These authors suggested that a cloud-edge collaborative framework could achieve
    real-time and automatic learning for the DCNN model they have developed. Wang
    et al. (2022b) proposed a real-time weed detection model run on Jetson AGX Xavier
    for field robots. The authors proved it was possible to do real-time weed detection
    with a precision above 90 % yet required expensive hardware. Wang et al. (2022a)
    reviewed Raspberry Pi single-board computer-based real-time image processing applications.
    They concluded that Raspberry Pi (Datasheet Raspberry Pi Model B, 2019) is a cost-effective
    edge computing unit that could potentially be used as an edge image processing
    unit, and the capability of integrating it with IoT was also discussed. Zualkernan
    et al. (2022) demonstrated an edge image processing platform for the classification
    of animals and transmitting the identified animal and time of identification via
    LoRa for a camera trap. Past literature on IoT and image processing applications
    in agriculture has highlighted a research gap in edge image processing with IoT-enabled
    crop monitoring cameras. In-field crop cameras are expected to make real-time
    crop management decisions based on real-time image processing; however, poor internet
    connectivity in agricultural fields severely limits their capability. To address
    this gap, we have developed a novel imaging platform named AICropCAM that extracts
    plant and crop canopy level parameters through DCNN and uploads them to the Cloud
    via low-power, low-throughput communication protocols. We also demonstrated AICropCAM
    on an IoT-enable wireless sensor network in corn and soybean fields. A technology
    that addresses image processing at the lowest level (edge) and transmits only
    useful information can revolutionize real-time decision-making in PA. Therefore,
    the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate AICropCAM to perform edge image
    processing and low-throughput, low-power, and long-range data transmission through
    IoT technology. In this novel AICropCAM platform, multiple DCNN image processing
    algorithms run in series to extract plant-level and canopy-level features in an
    embedded system. Image classification, object detection with classification, and
    image segmentation are the three major applications of DCNN image processing,
    and all three are included in AICropCAM to demonstrate the capabilities of DCNN
    for image processing in PA. AICropCAM has trained models for canopy segmentation,
    crop classification, plant growth stage identification, plant counting, weed counting,
    and plant type identification. All the protocols that transmit data from AICropCAM
    to the Cloud were custom designed. AICropCAM sends the generated data to a cloud
    platform for logging, visualization, and analysis. Furthermore, this paper explains
    the DCNN model training process, model performance, and test results. We reported
    the model training comprehensively because it was essential for AICropCAM development.
    2. Materials and methods Essential activities in this research were data/image
    collection and preprocessing, hardware design for AICropCAM, software design for
    data transmission between the edge and the Cloud, deep learning model design,
    and model training and optimization (Fig. 1). AICropCAM was implemented in a corn
    and soybean field at the field phenotyping facility in Mead, Nebraska, USA (Bai
    et al., 2019). We demonstrated the training of the following DCNNs: CropClassiNet
    for classifying images based on image quality and crop type, CanopySegNet for
    segmenting crop canopy from the background, PlantCountNet for classifying and
    counting soybean and weed plants, and InsectNet for identifying insects and counting
    them. Download : Download high-res image (412KB) Download : Download full-size

    Image collection for DCNN model training occurred in four growing seasons using
    three different types of cameras: (i) commercially available Meidas SL122 trail
    cameras in 2019 (Meidas Trail Cameras, 2022), (ii) OV5642 imaging sensors with
    ArduCAM camera shields in 2020, and (iii) Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 with Raspberry
    Pi Zero in 2021 and 2022 (Chamara, 2021). All the cameras were mounted on the
    bars horizontally extended and fixed on stationary poles erected vertically in
    the fields, as shown in Fig. 2A. The distance between the crop canopy and the
    cameras was maintained between 0.5 and 1.5 m throughout the growing seasons. Images
    used for training the InsectNet were also captured with smartphones as we could
    not collect enough images with insects from the three types of cameras mentioned
    above. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download full-size

    panel and data logger were also shown. Right: A close-up view of AICropCAM and

    learning model training were utilized: (1) folder labeling for the image classification
    models, (2) pixel-level annotation for the semantic segmentation model, and (3)
    bounding boxes for object detection models. Images belonging to the same class
    were grouped into a single folder, and five distinct classes (or folders) were
    created: rejected, corn, soybean, grass, and night. Separating the crop canopy
    from the soil was done with pixel-level annotation and semantic segmentation.
    Bounding boxes, the smallest rectangle around an object, were drawn for corn plants,
    soybean plants, weed plants, and insects. Table 1 explains each type of annotation
    used in the model training. Table 1. Annotation criteria used to generate labels
    from the images to train and test the four deep convolutional neural network models
    in AICropCAM. Labeling Type Class Description Image classification (CropClassiNet)
    Rejected Images were labeled as rejected due to multiple reasons: blurred images
    caused by water droplets on the lens; the cameras turned away from the targeted
    crop; crops growing up to the camera blocking the view or capturing only a few
    leaves; people present in the images; lens covered with different stuff; and the
    camera was not installed in the field. Corn Images entirely covered by corn plants
    at different growth stages. Soybean Images entirely covered by soybean plants
    at different growth stages. Grass/Weed Images only comprise grass/weed plants
    at different growth stages. Night Images captured under low lighting conditions.
    Most of the cameras were not programmed to stop collecting images under low light.
    Crop canopy and background (CanopySegNet) Canopy Pixel labeling was done on the
    crop canopy. We used assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB
    image labeler. Background Pixel labeling was done on the crop canopy. We used
    assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB image labeler.
    Plant-type (PlantCountNet) Weed Weed present in the image was labeled using bounding
    boxes. It was challenging to locate the weed after the corn or soybean canopy
    was closed. Soybean Soybean plants present in the image were labeled using bounding
    boxes. Insects (InsectNet) Insects During the labeling process, without distinguishing
    insects based on their type, all the insects present in the images were labeled
    using bounding boxes. Image preprocessing is necessary for DCNN model training
    and real-time edge image processing. Differences in the input layer size in different
    DCNN models demand that images be resized before passing through the model for
    training or prediction purposes. High-resolution images improve accuracy but require
    more computational power. For specific applications, labeled datasets were only
    limitedly available. Therefore, image augmentation techniques were used to increase
    the number of image data sets, including scaling, flipping, cropping, rotation,
    color transformation, PCA color augmentation, and noise rejection (Paymode and
    Malode, 2022). Multiple augmentation techniques were used for each model, as detailed
    in Table 2. Additionally, Table 2 provides the numbers of images in training,
    validation, and testing for the four DCNN models. Table 2. DCNN model image allocation

    for the DCNN models but to demonstrate the concept of implementing edge image
    processing and transmitting the results to the Cloud for decision-making. Therefore,
    we selected a limited number of images for CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet, and InsectNet,
    which were sufficient to train models with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 2.2.
    DCNN model architecture selection, training, evaluation, and deployment on the
    edge device The steps to select model architecture/model backbone weights and
    image input sizes to train the best model for CropClassiNet, CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet,
    and InsectNet are summarized in Fig. 3. Unlike many DCNN applications that prioritize
    higher accuracy, our application focused on finding the balance between accuracy
    and model deployability on the edge device. Download : Download high-res image

    during the training and testing by attempting different model architectures, model
    backdone weights, and input image sizes. For example, in the development of CropSegNet
    (Segmentation), we selected DeepLabv3+ (Firdaus-Nawi et al., 2018) with weights
    initialized from pre-trained networks of ResNet18 (He et al., 2016), ResNet50,
    Xception, InceptionresnetV2, and MobileNetV2. The input image sizes tested were
    512 × 512 × 3 and 256 × 256 × 3, and training options were kept constant to find
    the best-performing networks, which should also be deployable to Raspberry Pi
    4B. This process identified DeepLabv3 + with ResNet50 as the most suitable model
    for CropSegNet, with an input image size of 512 × 512 × 3. Table 3 summarizes

    used for the classification models CropClassiNet and CropSegNet, whereas IoU and
    mAP (Mean Average Precision) were used for PlantCountNet and InsectNet. Jaccard
    index gives the proportion of correctly predicted labels to the total number of
    labels. Model training was performed on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Mobile processor,
    a dedicated mid-range graphics card with 4 GB GDDR6 memory on a Dell XPS 15 9500
    Laptop. The laptop had an Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen processor,16 GB DDR4 RAM,
    and 1 TB SSD hard disk. 2.3. Hardware and software of AICropCAM The IoT data transmission
    and edge image processing hardware comprised the following major components: a
    Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer, an Arduino MKR1310 development board, an
    Arduino MKR Relay Proto Shield, and a Dragino OLG02 outdoor dual channels LoRa
    Gateway (Fig. 4). The 12 V 8Ah battery powered the Raspberry Pi 4B, controlled
    through the relay shield managed by the Arduino MKR1310. A 3.7 V lithium polymer
    battery powered the Arduino MKR1310 board. There are two advantages of having
    a separate Arduino board. First, the Arduino board consumes less power than the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module. It can be switched on and off according to user requirements.
    Second, it allows uninterrupted communication between the edge node and the Cloud
    with low power. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Hardware overview of AICropCAM and data flow. AICropCAM
    required programming on two hardware platforms. Arduino was programmed using C++
    in Arduino’s Integrated Development Environment. Raspberry Pi imaging and image
    processing program was developed in MATLAB and deployed onto the Raspberry Pi
    4B using the MATLAB Coder and MATLAB Compiler. A python program was designed to
    read the saved data in the Raspberry Pi 4B and serially communicate to the Arduino
    MKR1310. The primary functions of the MRK1310 program were to (1) turn on the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module based on the user-defined time intervals, (2) get the processed
    data, including the results of DCNN model predictions, through serial communication
    from the Raspberry Pi 4B, and (3) transmit the data to the ThingSpeak Cloud channel
    through the LoRa gateway. All the DCNN models were trained using the MATLAB deep
    learning toolbox. In the edge deployment, a MATLAB program runs multiple models
    logically depending on the prediction result of the previous model estimation,
    as shown in Fig. 5. MATLAB coder generated the C and C++ code derived from the
    program we developed to run on the Raspberry Pi. MATLAB Compiler generated the
    standalone application on the Raspberry Pi (The MathWorks, 2022). Download : Download

    image processing and data generation flow chart. Table 4 lists the parameters
    generated by the models in AICropCAM. The abbreviations in Table 4 are fields
    holding data in the program to reduce the complexity of system development and
    maintain a common standard among different platforms. Fig. 6 shows the data generation
    from images. According to Fig. 6, the size of the images were around 2 MB before
    being fed into the image processing pipeline. The output message contains the
    crop type (CT), plant count (PC), weed count (WC), canopy coverage (CC), and pest
    count (PstC). The resulting message is typically less than 100 bytes. This represents
    a substantial reduction of memory size with the output being 0.00005 times the
    size of the original image. Consequently, this message can be transmitted in a
    single message via LoRa as the maximum LoRa packet size is around 256 bytes. Table

    full-size image Fig. 6. Examples of message generation and data size reduction
    for LoRa transmission. 2.4. Data transmission, visualization, and storage The
    data generated after image processing were saved on the Raspberry Pi 4B SD card,
    allowing access to the data remotely or through manual retrieval during field
    visits. Two options for transmitting the collected data to the ThingSpeak IoT
    platform are available. Firstly, the data can be uploaded directly from the Raspberry
    Pi 4B if internet connectivity is available for growers with Wi-Fi access. Secondly,
    the Raspberry Pi 4B transmits the recently acquired data to the Arduino MKR1310.
    The Arduino MKR1310 decodes the data received from the Raspberry Pi 4B and forwards
    it to the ThingSpeak. The second method is for low-rate, long-range communication
    beyond the limit of Wi-Fi. A single message receivable to the ThingSpeak server
    includes data for eight fields. In our demonstration, a single message was enough
    to transmit the data generated. Fields 1 and 2 are reserved for geographic coordinates
    (namely, latitude and longitude) to represent the device''s location. The third
    field was for camera orientation. Image quality/crop type, plant count, weed count,
    insect count, and crop canopy coverage were allocated from fields four to eight.
    ThingSpeak supports eight channels per gateway. If additional data is generated
    in the future, we have to create new channels to accommodate them. However, only
    data in a single channel can be passed through a single message. The Arduino-LoRa
    library was used to prepare the LoRa messages forwarded to the gateway (Mistry,
    2016). The message generated from the Arduino MKR1310 includes the device identification
    number and the data with the field number. Once the gateway receives this message,
    it adds the target client ID (generated by ThingSpeak when defining a device),
    host address (mqtt://mqtt3.thingspeak.com), server port number, username and password,
    channel ID, and the data in each field according to the Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) protocol. Username and password ensure that only authorized devices
    can transmit data to the ThingSpeak platform. ThingSpeak provides two ways to
    interact with its platform, REST (Representative State Transfer) and MQTT protocols.
    The advantages of using MQTT over REST protocol are that it supports ThingSpeak
    data publishing, including immediate and minimum power consumption and data transmission
    over limited bandwidth, which encouraged us to select the MQTT protocol in our
    demonstration. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. DCNN model performance CropClassiNet
    had a test accuracy of 91.26 %, a Jaccard Index of 0.77, and an F1-score of 0.91;
    the confusion matrix is given in Fig. 7. The highest precision is for the “grass”
    class (100 %), and the lowest is for “soybean” (92.0 %). The highest recall is
    for the “corn” class (99.9 %), and the lowest is for “grass” (67.1 %). The primary
    goal of CropClassiNet is to determine the quality of new images and direct them
    for subsequent processing (Fig. 5). This step has never been executed in an image-based
    crop monitoring platform before. Further, CropClassiNet can eliminate erroneous
    images when humans are present in the camera’s field of view or when the camera
    is misaligned due to external factors. AICropCAM can send maintenance requests
    through IoT analytics if rejected images are continuously generated. Download

    achieved a global accuracy of 0.93, a weighted IoU of 0.87, and a mean BF score
    of 0.73. Fig. 8 shows an example of an original soybean image and the corresponding
    segmentation result by CanopySegNet, which estimated CC to be 18.72 %. Season-long,
    time-series images can be fed into CanopySegNet to generate diurnal and seasonal

    and seasonal variations of canopy coverage as computed by CropSegNet. According
    to Fig. 9, canopy coverage percentage variation is low during the daytime and
    reaches zero at night. This verifies the need to eliminate low-light images before
    segmenting. As shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to eliminate the generation of
    false values when the camera captures images under low light conditions by halting
    the process of running CanopySegNet. There are three diurnal variation series
    on 6/8/2021, 6/26/2021, and 7/12/2021 in Fig. 9. The CC increased from 8 % to
    95 % between 6/8/2021 to 7/12/2021. The seasonal trend showed that the CC reached
    a maximum around 7/8/2021. These results suggest that the proposed stacked models
    can track the daily and seasonal CC variation and eliminate the effect of lighting
    conditions on false value generation. Table 5. Performance of PlantCountNet and
    InsectNet on the test image set (Root mean square error (RMSE)/Final validation

    of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet is given in Table 5. Fig. 10(A) and 10(B) show
    the result obtained by PlantCountNet for a soybean image at an early vegetative
    stage (V3). Meanwhile Fig. 10(C) and 10(D) shows the result at a reproductive
    stage (R1). It can be seen that, at V3 stage, the model outputs matched the labels
    of soybean and weed plants well, indicating a level of high accuracy. Download

    result of PlantCountNet for soybean and weed counting: Manually annotated vs.
    model-predicted bounding boxes at V3 growth stage (A and B); manually annotated
    vs. model-predicted bounding boxes at R1 growth stage (C and D). The size of insects
    is very small compared to the size of images (Fig. 11), which is the main reason
    for the low mAP for InsectNet (Table 5). Increasing input image resolution beyond
    480 × 480 × 3 is impractical as it exceeds the memory limitation to load models
    into Raspberry Pi 4B. A potential solution could be to increase the resolution
    of the region of interest by splitting the original image while keeping the resolution
    the same. Also, we suggest using the approach recommended by Tetila et al., 2020a,
    Tetila et al., 2020b in the future on Raspberry Pi model 4B. As technology advances,
    we expect the memory capacities will increase for edge computing units. At the
    same time, the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms will improve the accuracy
    for small object detection. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    labels. 3.2. Power consumption for Raspberry Pi 4B Since edge cameras in farmlands
    have limited access to electric power, information on their power consumption
    is essential for designing IoT devices and systems. AICropCAM is designed to be
    energized by solar power. It runs on a rechargeable battery when there is no solar
    power. We monitored the maximum energy consumption of each task performed by AICropCAM,
    and the result is presented in Table 6. Four main strategies are available for
    the power management of IoT edge devices: Selecting power-efficient hardware,
    maintaining low power modes, dynamic power management, and cloud-based management.
    Raspberry Pi 4B is an affordable power-efficient single-board computer suitable
    for our application, but it does not naturally support low-power modes. Therefore,
    we introduced the Arduino MKR1310 LoRa module for the Raspberry Pi 4B dynamic
    power management. Furthermore, this Arduino module allows us to perform cloud-based
    central management independently. Table 6. Electrical power consumption of the
    Raspberry Pi 4B and the Arduino MKR1310 during edge image processing. Device Activity

    <0.01A LoRa transmission <0.01A For our measurements, we used a Raspberry Pi 4B
    with 8 GB of RAM, connected to an HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard, and a USB mouse,
    and ran a MathWorks® Raspbian image (file used to boot the Raspberry Pi 4B). The
    Raspberry Pi 4B was operated at room temperature and connected to a wireless LAN
    access point and a laptop via an Ethernet cable. The electric current consumption
    for running each DCNN model was recorded during the test. CropClassiNet had the
    highest current consumption, while the PlantCountNet and InsectNet models had
    the lowest. As for LoRa transmission, we could not measure its current consumption
    because the lowest value our instrument could measure was 0.01A. Based on the
    manufacturer''s specifications, the Arduino MKR1310 consumes 104 uA at 5 V. The
    average time to run the DCNN models is essential to estimate the energy consumed
    for each prediction. These parameters listed in Table 7 provide essential guidelines
    for designing IoT sensor nodes with suitable batteries and power sources. We also
    noticed that typically the first prediction of a model took the longest time,
    but the rest take a considerably shorter time to predict. Table 7. Time duration

    320 × 320 × 3 0.20 3.68 Semantic segmentation was the most power-demanding activity,
    while insect detection was the least. Changing the order of the image processing
    models and adding new models or dropping existing models is possible during regular
    operation. It enables dynamic power management within the Raspberry Pi module.
    The main advantage of AICropCAM is that it implements a stack of four DCNN-based
    image processing models with multiple objectives. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first time such a system has been developed for a field crop monitoring
    camera. AICropCAM has applications such as setting up smart in-field or greenhouse
    IoT camera networks with edge computing capability, monitoring crops by attaching
    them to sprinkler irrigation systems (pivots and linear moves), or collecting
    crop information through ground or aerial mobile robots. The relatively short
    time to run each DCNN model makes the system suitable for real-time applications,
    including variable rate irrigation, fertilization, and spraying. For example,
    a pivot irrigated multi-cropping system with AICropCAM can automate irrigation
    or fertigation transition between different crops or crops at different growth
    stages by automatically providing the crop type or growth stage information to
    the irrigation controller. Additionally, existing herbicide or pesticide sprayers
    can get the feedback of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet in the AICropCAM for precision
    spraying. 4. Conclusion and future perspectives This paper outlines the essential
    components of constructing a functional edge image processing framework for real-time
    crop monitoring. From a software standpoint, CropClassiNet can categorize captured
    images according to image quality and detect the presence of specific crop types
    for further processing. CanopySegNet can further quantify the degree of canopy
    coverage; PlantCountNet can count the number of plants and weeds in the image;
    and finally, InsectNet can count the number of insects in the image. These four
    DCNN models, when implemented on edge devices, can extract an array of important
    crop and canopy parameters from field images and enable real-time, low-latency
    decision making and applications. Deep learning-based image processing on the
    edge has excellent potential in PA. Applications of AICropCAM are not limited
    to image classification, segmentation, plant counting, or weed counting. Potential
    future applications include insect classification and crop damage estimation,
    weed classification and pressure estimation, fruit identification and yield estimation,
    decision on replanting (Whigham et al., 2000), and disease identification and
    disease damage estimation in real time using actual field images collected by
    AICropCAM. AICropCAM shows excellent potential in enhancing crop management through
    crop monitoring. However, the current demonstration requires significant improvements
    on both hardware and software fronts. Customized circuitry and modular design
    are required to put AICropCAM in commercial farm applications. The full potential
    of the AICropCAM can be achieved by putting this camera on a moving platform like
    a center pivot with a GPS receiver to generate spatiotemporal data. Crop classification
    must include more crop types, and segmentation models need training data from
    other crop types. The DCNN models for weed and insect identification require the
    capability to identify different weed types, their growth stage, different insect
    types, and their growth stages to generate effective pest control decisions. Additionally,
    improving the models’ accuracy in image classification, segmentation, and object
    detection is crucial. It can be achieved by increasing the number of training
    image data sets. We also planned to expand the research for multiple edge architecture
    evaluation. Architectures such as a high-performance edge computer that accepts
    images from multiple edge devices through short-range, high-speed communication
    (e.g., Wi-Fi) and can run more accurate deep learning models with higher numbers
    of parameters, might be a better solution for the primary objectives addressed
    in this paper. We aim to expand the AICropCAM applications to other crops beyond
    corn and soybean. By making these improvements, AICropCAM will become a more effective
    tool for crop management, potentially revolutionizing how we grow and manage crops.

    Food needs have expanded due to the planet''s rapidly increasing population of
    humans. Given the planet''s finite resources, it is challenging to meet the world''s
    food needs (Vootla et al., 2018). Technological innovations are applied in agriculture
    to boost productivity and overcome this problem. Precision agriculture (PA) uses
    IoT devices and near- and remote-sensing methods to keep track of crop conditions
    at various growing phases. PA entails collecting and processing a sizable volume
    of agricultural health data. Many factors, including water content and temperature,
    influence crops'' health. With the help of PA, a farmer may accurately determine
    the conditions for a healthy crop and when, where, and in what quantity these
    conditions must exist. This necessitates gathering a considerable amount of data
    from various sources and areas of the farm, including soil nutrients, the existence
    of weeds and pests, plants'' chlorophyll levels, and several environmental factors.
    To generate agronomic advice, all gathered data must be analyzed. For example,
    plants'' chlorophyll content (amount of greenness) indicates the nutrients required
    depending on their development phase. These data are integrated with information
    about the soil characteristics where the crop will be grown, including climate
    prediction. The amount of a specific fertilizer that should be administered to
    that crop the following day is calculated using all the data that has been gathered.
    Farmers must receive agronomic advice properly and follow its suggestions to increase
    yields. WSN (wireless sensor network) consists of several nodes coupled to track
    and record the physical state of the environment, which is the primary driver
    of the PA. Figure 1 shows the various application of WSN-based IoT in agriculture
    monitoring. Figure 1. Application of IoT-based WSN in agriculture monitoring Every
    wireless node comprises a microcontroller, sensors, a radio transceiver, and additional
    circuitry that allows it to connect to a gateway and transmit data that the sensor
    has acquired (Kumar et al., 2022). Sensors gather data by measuring the physical
    parameters and sending it to the controller, who then sends it to a portable device
    or the cloud. The agriculture industry has a variety of needs, including those
    related to soil characteristics, crop varieties, climate, fertilizer classes,
    and water necessities. The requirements of crops vary based on the crops grown
    in the same area and the same plant grown on other lands with various climatic
    conditions. Sensors keep track of how these crop factors change over time. The
    size and expenditure of sensors have decreased due to the rapid development of
    WSN technologies, making it possible to use them in various fields, including
    agriculture. Sensors keep track of how these crop factors change over time. The

    Irrigation is a fundamental aspect of crop production. Summer 2022, already considered
    to be one of the driest and warmest seasons ever recorded in Europe and the Mediterranean
    basin [1], has shown how crucial it can be [2], and what is more, the Mediterranean
    region is considered as a climate change hotspot. The Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change [3] foresees the intensification of extreme hydrological events,
    notably more frequent and longer episodes of water deficit. Agricultural activities,
    largely dependent on water availability, are particularly impacted and threatened.
    Irrigation is a response to agricultural vulnerability to drought. As a result,
    irrigated land has increased in recent decades, and the increase will most probably
    continue in the future. However, pressure on water resources is already critical
    in the Mediterranean region, due not only to the high spatio-temporal variability
    of its distribution but also to increased urban and rural demand. In particular,
    agricultural water demand tends to grow with increasing potential evapotranspiration.
    These tensions have already led to water use restriction policies, user conflicts
    and water shortages [4]. In this context, it is indispensable to improve agricultural
    water management and encourage water-saving practices. Precision agriculture has
    flourished in recent decades and a wide range of monitoring tools including model-based
    control strategies, automation systems, remote sensing or in field sensing [5,6]
    have been developed to improve the performance of irrigated systems. At farm level,
    irrigation management can be supported by using soil moisture probes to improve
    irrigation scheduling and reduce the volumes applied throughout the growing season
    [7,8]. Tensiometers and capacitance sensors that provide information on soil water
    status are already available [9] but are rarely used in farming systems, particularly
    at the farm scale, and even more rarely in the Global South. The different barriers
    to the adoption of precision farming technologies are linked to the user''s socio-technical
    environment, but mostly to (i) economic rationales or (ii) the complexity of using
    these technologies, including the calibration procedures [10,11]. Recent technological
    developments such as onboard electronics and Internet of Things (IoT) offer new
    opportunities to provide alternative monitoring tools for agro-systems and resource
    management [12] that are easier for farmers to use than previous systems. For
    irrigated agriculture in particular, these technologies allow real-time monitoring
    of water flows through water sensor networks (WSN) that can be installed at the
    required spatial and temporal scale. Several studies have demonstrated the technical
    feasibility of monitoring irrigation using these types of systems with different
    telecommunication networks and sensors to monitor weather, soil and plant variables
    [[13], [14], [15]]. Some studies mentioned gains in irrigation performance in
    different agronomic contexts thanks to the use of such tools [[16], [17], [18]].
    Recently, some advances were made in the characterisation and calibration of low
    cost capacitance sensors for IoT networks [19,20]. However, to our knowledge,
    no study has yet gone beyond laboratory prototypes or experiments in controlled
    conditions, and have adapted these innovations to local agrarian contexts. The
    objective of this study was thus to fill this gap by developing a soil moisture
    sensor that is easily adoptable by water users and to share all the steps, from
    design to calibration, operation and maintenance, based on a field reality. To
    this end, we designed an open source, low-tech and low-cost tool with a single
    parameter and physically-based calibration method, tested it in real farmers’
    conditions, and assessed the potential advantages and limits of this technology.
    2. Material and methods 2.1. Shaping innovation: Our overall approach We argue
    that for technological innovations to be useful for end users, the innovations
    need to be co-developed with the stakeholders thus making it possible to adapt
    the technology to the local context. A co-innovation process between researchers
    and stakeholders was established to (i) chose the variable to monitor; (ii) build
    the sensor and (iii)evaluate its use. This was done through a loop back procedure
    described in Vandôme et al. [21]. After diagnosing the agrarian context, local
    water management issues and stakeholder needs, a sensor prototype was submitted
    to water users through a demonstration workshop. The feedback provided by the
    workshop participants enabled the production of a second version of the prototype
    that was better suited to local needs and constraints. The creation of an area
    for the design, maintenance and sharing between the actors of the co-innovation
    process – hereafter called Fab Lab – allowed the innovation to continually evolve
    based on the users’ feedback throughout the process. 2.2. Study site and water
    user requirements The Echraf public irrigation scheme is located in the Haouaria
    agricultural plain, at the northern tip of the Cap Bon peninsula in Tunisia (36°59′33.529″N,
    11°2′28.309″E). Drip irrigation of market gardening crops grown on sandy and draining
    soils has resulted in several problems. The reduced soil water holding capacity
    (around 4%) makes irrigation management complex: on the one hand the permanent
    wilting point (PWP) is quickly reached due to rapid drying of the soil; while
    on the other hand, the root profile is quickly saturated during an irrigation
    event, leading to percolation losses. In these conditions, optimal irrigation
    would theoretically involve regular application of low water volumes. In practice,
    this strategy is difficult to achieve for the farmers, due to (i) lack of information
    concerning the water resource (volumes applied, discharge rates, soil moisture,
    surface area irrigated), (ii) the variable flow rates of water supplied by the
    collective network, (iii) poor uniformity of application due to ageing or low
    quality irrigation equipment, and (iv) the recent emergence of drip irrigation
    technology in the region, which has not been combined with any training for water
    users. In the first stages of the co-innovation process, the stakeholders and
    the researchers agreed that, to solve these problems, a soil moisture sensor –
    hereafter termed Pilowtech – should be used in the field to assess crop water
    availability. To further develop this idea, a Fab Lab was set up in the Water
    Users Association (WUA) building where exchanges with farmers led to a set of
    specifications (Table 1) that were then used to design prototype soil moisture
    sensors. The Fab Lab was also used for the production and repair of the sensors.
    In parallel, three pilot farmers volunteered to host tests of the sensors in real
    conditions in three irrigated potato plots throughout the whole crop cycle. Table

    method 2.3. Water sensor network: General framework In response to the end-users’
    stated needs, we built a network of wireless, low-cost, low-tech, low-power and
    open-source soil moisture sensors. The overall architecture of the network of
    sensors is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (283KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flowchart of the water sensor network. 2.3.1.
    Hardware components The Pilowtech sensor is composed of a soil moisture probe,
    a data acquisition module and a power supply. The capacitance soil moisture sensor
    – model EK1940 v1.2 – was chosen for its resistance to corrosion, its low cost
    and availability. In addition, it operates over a voltage range of 3.3 V to 5
    V, making it compatible with low-power microcontrollers. The data acquisition
    module includes a microcontroller, a communication microchip and small electronics
    (wires, resistors, breadboard). The microcontroller chosen was the Arduino Pro-Mini,
    with a 3.3 V voltage and a frequency of 8 MHz. In addition to the advantages of
    Arduino systems (widely used, easy to use and open-source), thanks to its small
    size, the Pro-Mini is easy to embed and is one of the cheapest controllers on
    the market. It is also compatible with the LoRaWAN (Long-Range Wide-Area Network)
    communication protocol. The LoRa SX1276 communication module makes it possible
    to send and receive data via the LoRA radio network. The whole device is powered
    by a rechargeable Li-ion 18,650 battery (3.7 V and 3500 mAh). To allow onsite
    and instantaneous data reading, a reader was further developed based on an Arduino
    Uno board and a liquid crystal display (LCD) shield. The system is powered by
    a rechargeable Li-ion power bank with a 3.7 V output. To avoid damage caused by
    humidity, the probes were assembled at the end of PVC pipes (Ø40). Silicone was
    used to guarantee a tight sealing at the junction of the probe/pipe and the heat-shrink
    tubing at the wire junctions. The case of the acquisition module was printed using
    a 3D printer. The 3D printing file is available in the research data section at
    the end of this article. 2.3.2. Wireless communication network IoT technologies
    allow wireless communication of data generated by devices via different types
    of networks. The LoRaWAN communication protocol allows data transmission at low
    data rates (0.3–50 kb/s) and over long ranges (≤ 30 km). Compared to other available
    networks, the LoRa network stands out for its low energy consumption [22]. The
    LoRaWAN protocol thus met both our objectives and technological development conditions
    (sparse plots, no need for heavy data packets) and had also been tested in previous
    studies [23]. A private LoRa network was set up in the irrigation scheme. Likely
    due to the topography, two gateways were needed to cover the area that included
    the three experimental plots. The Things Network gateway, which, according to
    the manufacturer, has a range of about 10 km, was installed near the Fab Lab.
    The Things Indoor gateway, which has a shorter range but costs less, was installed
    between two pilot plots in the eastern part of the irrigation scheme. 4G+ airboxes
    were used to provide the Wi-Fi required for the gateways internet connection.
    2.3.3. Software and data workflow The microcontroller was programmed in C/C++
    language using the open source Arduino software (IDE) 1.8.19. The program was
    uploaded from the computer to the Arduino Pro-mini using a FTDI wire. To minimize
    energy consumption, the program code was written to maintain the sensor in sleeping
    mode (low µA consumption). The system woke up at 5-minute intervals to collect
    the analog signal produced by the probe, to convert it into digital data and send
    it through the LoRa network. Theoretically, this optimization enables the sensor
    to be energy autonomous throughout the irrigation season. The Arduino program
    is also available in the research data section. The data produced transited locally
    through the gateway via the LoRa network and was then routed online to the free
    server “The Things Network Cloud (Europe 1)” [24]. Within this server, the gateway
    was declared on the cloud and an application gathering sensor (device) IDs was
    generated. This server allowed real time data reading online but not storage or
    data processing. The free and open-source flow-based programming tool Node-RED
    [25], was thus used to gather the data from this online server and store it on
    a local server via an InfluxDB database [26]. The Node-RED flow is also available
    in the research data section. 2.3.4. User access to data Three different types
    of user access to data were provided through multiple channels to serve end-users
    with different technology literacy levels: (i) an online platform with access
    to data time series; (ii) a mobile phone messaging alert system; and (iii) an
    onsite data reader (Fig. 1). The online data reading is done using Grafana software
    [27], a free open-source data visualization and processing platform. A dashboard
    was produced to visualize data from each pilot farm. The dashboard comprised time
    series graphics for each soil moisture sensor (specified by its location and depth)
    and a map showing the location of the sensors. Data could be combined for visualization
    at different levels (plot, farm, irrigation scheme – the highest level being defined
    by the network). In parallel, Grafana enabled the development of a messaging alert
    system using the Telegram smartphone application and Telegram bots. The alert
    system was set to send a message to the end-user each time the soil water content
    (i) dropped below a threshold value (permanent wilting point), corresponding to
    a certain level of crop water-induced stress; or (ii) reached field capacity,
    in order to stop irrigation. The onsite data reader was designed for instantaneous
    visualization. The farmer has to physically plug the onsite reader into the sensor
    to get an instant display on the LCD screen. The reader can be programmed to display
    the volumetric soil moisture content, or the% refill level of total available
    soil moisture. Both Arduino programs are available in the research data section.
    In all cases, it is necessary to provide the user with data that can be easily
    used and guide their decision-making. The data emitted by the sensors and stored
    on the server are raw data, proportional to the output voltage of the capacitance
    probe. It is therefore necessary to define the relationship between soil moisture
    and raw values, before processing the data using visualization tools. 2.4. Calibration
    of the capacitance probe The capacitance probe operates according to the following
    principle: electric current flows through a coplanar concentric capacitor, which
    is the part inserted into the soil. The capacity is proportional to the relative
    dielectric permittivity of the medium, which itself depends on the soil moisture
    content. The output voltage (0–5 V) is converted into a digital value (10 bits)
    by the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of the microcontroller. Two calibration
    protocols based on the gravimetric method are proposed to determine the relationship
    between the output voltage and soil moisture. 2.4.1. Calibration in the laboratory
    Laboratory experiments allowed us to determine the relationship between the output
    values of the sensor (ϵ) and the volumetric soil moisture (θv,% volume). The gravimetric
    method was used. Three soil samples (S1, S2, S3) were collected from the 0–30
    cm horizon in three separate plots in the irrigation scheme. In parallel, bulk
    density was measured in each plot using the cylinder method. Samples were first
    dried in a heating chamber at 105 °C for 24 h and then left to cool at room temperature
    (20 °C). The dry soil samples were then used to fill a beaker of known volume
    (150 mL) while making sure the field bulk density was maintained by weighting
    the beaker. The volumetric humidity (θv) could therefore be defined by Eq. (1):
    (1) where θv is the volumetric soil moisture content (%), Vw the water volume,
    Vs the dry soil volume. To determine the relationship, the probe was inserted
    along the entire length of the capacitance device (approximately 6 cm), guaranteeing
    good contact between the soil and the probe. A small volume of water (1.5 mL corresponding
    to an increment of 1% of soil volumetric moisture) was repeatedly added to the
    sample. At each addition, the soil was mixed to guarantee isotropy, left to rest
    for 15 min and then restored to bulk density. The operation was repeated until
    the digital value reached a plateau, corresponding to soil water saturation. The
    digital value of the sensor, ϵ, acquired with the onsite reader, was recorded
    for each known sample volumetric humidity value, θv, in order to establish their
    correspondence. 2.4.2. Field calibration The purpose of field calibration was
    to provide a simple method to locally parametrize the soil moisture sensor without
    the need for sophisticated equipment. A soil sample was collected from each of
    the three pilot plots (samples P1, P2 and P3). The protocol was the same as that
    used in the laboratory with the following adaptations. First, the samples were
    dried in the sun on the roof for two days, followed by 3 h in an oven at 100 °C.
    To check the soil was dry, the sample was weighed on a kitchen scale (precision
    ±1 g), then put back in the oven and weighed again. If the mass of soil was unchanged,
    the soil was considered to be dry. Second, to limit the uncertainty caused by
    the use of a simple kitchen scale, a large mass of soil was used and the sample
    was only weighed at initialization. Bulk density could not be measured in field
    conditions. Consequently, a standard sandy bulk density was defined for the soil
    samples (1.5 kg of dry soil for 1 L in a graduated bucket), for which the θv-ϵ
    relationship was established. Water was progressively added using a 10 mL measuring
    glass (i.e. an increment of 1% θv). Readings were made with the sensor in the
    same conditions as those used for the laboratory calibration. Three replicates
    were made for each soil sample using three different probes in order to study
    the potential variability linked to the capacitance probe and its impact on the
    calibration. 2.4.3. Properties of the soil samples Soil samples from the pilot
    plots were analyzed in the laboratory. Table 2 lists the main soil properties.
    Despite slight local heterogeneities, the soils had most properties in common.
    They are sandy soils (≥ 90%) with low organic matter content (≤ 1%). Water storage
    capacity is low, with permanent wilting points ranging from θv 5% to 7% and field
    capacity ranging from 9% to 11%. Bulk density is about 1.6 g/cm3. Table 2. Soil

    Soil moisture measurements make it possible to understand different physical processes
    such as filling of the total available soil moisture, deep percolation, or surface
    evaporation. The choice of the location and depth of the sensor depends on the
    properties of the type of soil and the processes to be monitored, as well as the
    characteristics of the cropping system. In our study site with a drip-irrigated
    potato crop, the objectives were twofold: to ensure crop water comfort and to
    limit deep percolation. To this end, soil moisture was measured at two depths:
    (i) at a depth of 30 cm, at a distance of 15 cm from the drip line, and (ii) at
    a depth of 60 cm, directly under the drip line. These measurements provided information
    on the structure of the water bulb. On the one hand, we considered that “correct”
    soil moisture at the two locations satisfies crop water comfort and on the other
    hand, that high soil moisture content at a depth of 60 cm – the maximum effective
    rooting depth – leads to deep percolation. Field monitoring lasted from March
    5 to June 15, 2022. Three plots were instrumented with two to three Pilowtech
    sensors each, corresponding to approximately one sensor/0.1 ha. To evaluate the
    quality of the sensors by comparing the data, plots P1 and P2 were equipped with,
    respectively, a commercial capacitance-based sensor (Drill and Drop manufactured
    by Sentek Technologies, “SAND” factory default setting) and a tensiometer (Watermark
    manufactured by Irrometer). Measurement depths and positions with respect to the
    drip line were the same as with the Pilowtech sensors. Time series produced by
    the commercial capacitance sensor were post-calibrated with respect to the average
    of the series produced by the Pilowtech (coefficient of 0.621) in order to adapt
    the measurement of the commercial probe to the local soil type and to allow comparison
    of the data. Installation of the Pilowtech in the field required the use of a
    graduated auger and a fence post to attach the acquisition module. The capacitance
    probe was inserted vertically into the soil after moistening the substrate to
    guarantee a good contact between the soil and the probe. 3. Results 3.1. Design
    of the Pilowtech, a decision-support tool for irrigation management 3.1.1. Hardware
    The hardware design of the soil moisture sensor is easy and quick to make (about
    30min.). The electrical assembly was simplified in order to be as reproducible
    as possible (Fig. 2). The sensor was configured with two analog inputs for two
    capacitance probes, thus allowing soil moisture to be measured at two depths at
    each location. Access to the plug for on-site reading was by means of a screw
    cap at the above-ground extremity of the PVC tube. Download : Download high-res

    the Pilowtech sensor. The numbers refer to Table 4. 3.1.2. Results of calibration
    The results of the laboratory calibration are presented in Fig. 3. The digital
    values returned by the sensor in air and in water were ϵa = 437 and ϵw = 202,
    respectively. The sensor displayed a digital value of ϵs = 434 in the presence
    of dry soil (θv = 0%). The curve decreased, reflecting the inverse relationship
    between moisture content and output voltage: the wetter the soil, the lower the
    output voltage, and therefore the lower the digital value returned. The distribution
    of the data shows a linear trend at low soil moisture content and then an increase
    in the slope above a threshold (around 6% moisture content) suggesting the existence
    of a vertical asymptote. This type of behavior can be described by an exponential
    relationship between ϵ and θ. From these results, we constructed the following
    empirical equation: (2) where k is a parameter depending on soil properties, ϵs,
    ϵw and ϵa are respectively, the sensor output variable, the sensor constant value
    in water and the sensor constant value in the air. Therefore, the expression of
    volumetric soil moisture can be modeled as a function of the output voltage variable
    and three parameters depending on the soil type (k) and the probe used (ϵw, ϵa).
    This model appears well fitted (R2 = 0.972) with respect to the data obtained
    from the laboratory calibration (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (265KB)

    the field calibration performed on the soils of the pilot plots are shown in Fig.
    4. For each of the three soil samples (P1, P2, P3), the calibration is made using
    three different sensors (A, B, C). The results were used to parametrize Eq. (2),
    and the corresponding curves (models) were compared with the experimental data.
    The soil parameter k was determined by searching for an optimal match between
    the gravimetric and simulated soil moisture and minimisation of the error. Table
    3 summarizes the parameters obtained. The results showed that the model based
    on Eq. (2) satisfactorily fitted the data obtained using the gravimetric method
    for all three soils (0.875 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.983). The parameters related to the capacitance
    probe ranged between 182 and 198 for ϵw and between 430 and 479 for ϵa. The soil
    parameters obtained with the same soil sample varied little with respect to their
    mean (3% ≤ cv ≤ 4%). However, parameter k varied more between the different soil
    samples (6% ≤ cv ≤ 10%), parameter k is thus more sensitive to soil characteristics.

    farmer connected to the WSN has access to a personal space on the online platform.
    The data produced by the sensors are gathered for each farm and can be displayed
    according to the desired location, date and depth. The calibration results allow
    the raw data to be displayed in the form of volumetric soil moisture (Fig. 5).
    Time series are available for consultation (historical and real time) and can
    be downloaded in different formats. In the field, the data can be accessed manually
    using the onsite reader. When visiting the plots, by unscrewing the top of the
    protective PVC tube at the desired location and depth, the farmer can simply plug
    in (Fig. 6a). After several trials, the farmers indicated the most practical visualization
    is the one that displays the filling percentage of the total available soil moisture
    (FP = ). This percentage is visualized by means of a progress bar (Fig. 6b). Download

    3.2. On field data evaluation: comparison with commercial water sensors The data
    series produced by the Pilowtech sensors were compared with series produced by
    commercial sensors at two locations. 3.2.1. Ability for monitoring relative soil
    water status The data obtained for plot P2 were compared with the tension measurement
    produced by a commercial tensiometer probe (Watermark) at the same location and
    depths (30 and 60 cm) as the Pilowtech (Fig. 7). Monitoring continued from March
    8 to June 13, 2022, i.e. shortly after planting until the potatoes were harvested.
    The tensiometers were installed on March 25, before the start of the irrigation
    season. Irrigation was regular (frequency of around 3 days) during the development
    stage (April). Irrigation events were less frequent from the midseason until harvest
    (from May to June). The time step for data generation is 4 h for the tensiometer
    and around 5 min for the Pilowtech. Irrigation events are clearly identifiable
    from the peak moisture contents measured by the Pilowtech, and from the drops
    in tension measured by the tensiometer. At a depth of 30 cm, tension varied between
    0 and 50 kPa. The volumetric soil moisture measured globally varied between the
    permanent wilting point (  = 5.83% at pF = 4.2) and field capacity (  = 9.41%
    at pF = 2.5). At a depth of 60 cm, the range of soil moisture was slightly higher
    (between 8% and 13%) and the range of tension was lower (between 2 and 15 kPa).
    At both depths, the data produced by the commercial tensiometer and the Pilowtech
    sensor were highly correlated. In the shallow soil layer, the probes are more
    sensitive to water inputs. Their variations make it possible to monitor the entire
    irrigation schedule, and to distinguish between the hydration and drying phases
    of the soil. Close to the maximum rooting depth, the response of both probes was
    less sensitive to drip irrigation inputs. Minor non-percolating irrigation events
    were less or not detected. However, analysis of moisture peaks showed that both
    probes reacted to irrigation events on the same dates. The sensor thus has the
    ability to monitor relative changes in soil moisture. Download : Download high-res

    status in plot “P2”: comparison between the Pilowtech (red curves) and a commercial
    tensiometer sensor (gray curves). The Pilowtech data gap from May 20 to May 23
    was due to a power failure, independently from our system. 3.2.2. Ability for
    absolute soil moisture monitoring In plot P1, the measurements made with a commercial
    capacitance sensor and the Pilowtech (30 and 60 cm) from April 4 to May 3 were
    compared (Fig. 8). The data generation time step of the commercial sensor is 1
    h, and around 5 min for the Pilowtech. Comparison of the soil moisture content
    characteristics measured in the plot “P1” (  = 7.00% at pF = 4.2 and  = 10.71%
    at pF = 2.5) showed that the range of moisture content measured by the commercial
    probe and by Pilowtech was globally bounded by the permanent wilting point and
    field capacity. We also compared the potential of detection of irrigation peaks,
    corresponding to local maximum soil water moisture content. Results revealed an
    excellent temporal match, confirming that irrigation events were accurately detected
    by both sensors. The ability of the Pilowtech to measure the intensity of irrigation
    events was further analyzed by comparing the magnitude of changes in soil moisture
    recorded by both probes during the first month of monitoring (Fig. 9). Download

    soil moisture content in plot “P1”: comparison of the magnitude of changes in
    soil moisture recorded by the Pilowtech and a commercial capacitance sensor. The
    magnitude of an event was calculated as the difference between the maximum peak
    moisture measured following an irrigation event and the minimum moisture value
    preceding the same irrigation event. The results showed a good correlation between
    the magnitudes recorded by the two probes for low and medium intensity events
    (∆ < 4%). On the other hand, the gap between measurements by the two probes was
    larger in the case of more intense, higher magnitude events (∆ > 4%). Under these
    conditions, the Pilowtech sensor gave higher amplitudes than those measured by
    the commercial probe. This difference could be explained by the different sampling
    intervals used in sandy soils with high hydraulic conductivity. These behavioral
    variations could also be the result of drift trends the experimental data did
    not allow us to characterise. 3.3. Provisioning and maintenance 3.3.1. A low tech
    sensor with reasonable maintenance requirements The system was designed to be
    low power and to enable several months’ autonomy with a 3.7 V battery. The main
    maintenance tasks during the season were: (i) battery management; (ii) network
    troubleshooting; (iii) hardware maintenance. At the end of the 102-day monitoring
    period, one sensor out of the eight installed needed its battery recharging. The
    first assumption made in the event of a gap in the data time series is that the
    battery is empty. After checking the voltage, the second hypothesis is a network
    failure. A few occasional network interruptions required maintenance tasks over
    the course of the season, the origins of which were identified as follows: power
    supply failure at the gateway or an interruption in Wi-Fi coverage at the gateway
    location. Finally, once the network and the power supply have been checked, a
    gap or an anomaly in the data time series may be due to hardware failure. The
    connectors in the acquisition module and at the junction with the probes should
    then be checked. Direct reading in the field may be necessary to check the quality
    of the data provided by the probe. Out of the 16 probes installed (2 per sensor),
    25% of the probes showed occasional anomalies that required a technical intervention.
    In these situations, the probes produced unstable and inconsistent data in the
    data series that were easy to identify. As these events occurred following irrigation
    events, we assume they were due to faulty seals resulting in leakage into the
    probe''s electronic circuits. In this case, technical maintenance consists in
    removing the damaged probe, and drying or replacing it, and making sure it is
    watertight. The resulting anomalies in soil moisture data time series can also
    be easily cleaned. 3.4. A low-cost sensor with adjustable costs Table 4 summarizes
    the costs required to design a low tech soil moisture sensor. The cost of production
    is adjustable depending on requirements. The components needed for the sensor
    itself cost less than 10€ with an onsite reading system only, less than 15€ for
    a wireless sensor, and a total of slightly more than 20€ for the sensor with a
    double data reading mode. For the wireless solution, setting up a LoRa network
    requires a gateway (costing between 50€ and 300€) and an Internet connection.
    However, this investment is sufficient to network an unlimited number of sensors,
    which allows the costs to be amortized or shared between users. The low cost hardware
    and free software of the Pilowtech thus make the sensor highly affordable. Table

    probes become accessible to any water user? We developed a soil moisture sensor
    based on the specifications and feedback provided by the water users of an irrigation
    scheme. The sensor we developed is (i) low tech, meaning easy to make, maintain
    and reproduce; (ii) low cost, so small farming systems can afford it; (iii) low
    power, and consequently relatively self-sufficient and sustainable over time;
    (iv) meeting farmers’ expectations for monitoring water status in the root zone.
    The data can be accessed in two ways: remotely via an online interface, or in
    the field through direct reading. Calibration is feasible both in the laboratory
    and in the field. The sensor rating curve (Eq. (2)) is given by only one parameter,
    k, characteristic of the soil. This rating equation provides a reliable prediction
    of volumetric soil moisture once it has been parameterized. The sensor allows
    soil moisture to be monitored at two depths and can be used as a decision support
    tool for irrigation scheduling. Comparison with commercial probes highlighted
    the good performance of the Pilowtech sensor for irrigation scheduling and for
    monitoring relative soil moisture. The low recording frequency of the commercial
    tensiometer, capillary hysteresis processes and the low water holding capacities
    of the soils prevented accurate plotting of sandy soil retention curves [28].
    To go further, a laboratory experiment conditions would allow comparison of the
    Pilowtech sensor results with the predictions of the Van Genuchten function for
    a sandy soil [29]. The measurement of absolute soil moisture was satisfactory
    compared with that of the commercial capacitance probe, but the measurement may
    be subject to slight deviation over time. A metrological study, specific to the
    monitoring of the deviation by multiplying the controls and measuring battery
    discharge rates, should enable conclusions to be drawn concerning these effects.
    At the level of the farm or of the irrigation scheme, the number of sensors could
    be multiplied to create a wireless sensor network based on the LoRaWAN protocol.
    The data produced in real-time can be used by different types of stakeholders:
    (i) by farmers as a decision-support tool at the field and farm levels; (ii) by
    irrigation scheme managers and agricultural advisors to assess water requirements
    and advise water users; (iii) by researchers, for whom the production of these
    data will help assess performance gaps, compare practices and feed model scenarios.
    Recent advances in on-board electronics and IoT therefore appear promising for
    the agricultural sector and particularly for water management, to the extent that
    they led to the development of both economically and technically accessible measurement
    tools. The plasticity of these systems is particularly interesting because it
    makes the tool adaptable to the agrarian context: for instance, we were able to
    adapt the data reading system to the users. Moreover, the open source nature of
    the system transforms the traditionally “black box” sensor into a tool that can
    be fully programmed by the user. Thus the user can calibrate the Pilowtech according
    to the characteristics of his/her field, which makes it better suited and therefore
    more reliable than a default pre-calibrated probe. On the other hand, it is important
    to stress that these advantages are not necessarily considered as such by every
    farmer. Indeed, the “do it yourself” approach may be seen as a limitation as it
    requires time to get used to it, more regular maintenance, and a certain level
    of agronomic expertise. These limitations can be overcome by supporting users,
    notably through training or by providing technical support. The scale of the irrigation
    scheme, and user collectives such as water users associations, appear to be a
    suitable environment to host a Fab lab, making it possible to pool maintenance
    interventions and the expenses involved in running wireless sensor networks. The
    Fab Lab also appears as a valuable environment for user training, notably regarding
    the calibration process, which although not requiring any special equipment, may
    nevertheless demand some ability. Another alternative could be for further studies
    to produce tables associating parameter values with major soil types. Currently,
    the use of these technologies is facilitated by the growing importance of the
    community involved in this domain, the multiplication of suppliers worldwide,
    and the trend towards simplification of components and reduction of their costs.
    However, component costs still depend on the market, and are consequently sensitive
    to fluctuations (the Covid-19 pandemic, for example, led to a worldwide shortage
    of electronic chips). Hence, the equipment used in the present study will inevitably
    evolve with technical advances and market changes, which is not a problem as long
    as the equipment remains highly affordable and available from local suppliers.
    In any case, the Pilowtech sensor was designed as an evolving tool, necessarily
    subject to change through re-design and ”bricolage”, as signs of its re-appropriation
    by users [30]. Future studies should focus on the multi-criteria (agronomic, environmental,
    hydraulic, socioeconomic) impacts of the adoption of such tools for irrigated
    agriculture, including paying attention to potential side effects [31,32]. Some
    work remains to be done before massive use of this type of technology is achieved,
    and particular attention will have to be paid to the mechanisms of adoption and
    the means to promote the dissemination of the innovation among farmers and water
    users. After all, there is nothing to prevent the adjustment of this sensor to
    a variety of contexts, for irrigation management of diverse cropping systems or
    for environmental monitoring, at the same time bearing in mind that “not everything
    that can be counted actually counts”. 5. Conclusion The use of new technologies
    for agriculture does not necessarily need to be expensive, complex and energy
    intensive. We designed a low-cost, open source, low-tech and low-energy soil moisture
    sensor for monitoring crop irrigation. The calibration method implemented is simple,
    based on only one parameter, and allows real time monitoring of the fulfillment
    of the water requirements of an irrigated crop, in the present case, potato. The
    irrigation schedule can therefore be adjusted accordingly. Comparison of our low-cost
    sensor with commercial probes in field conditions over a whole irrigation season
    underlined the good performance of the Pilowtech sensor. The sensor can be used
    as a decision-support tool for real-time water management. At the scale of an
    irrigation scheme, the skills and costs of the equipment required to build a wireless
    sensor network could be shared between users. Soil moisture probes are known as
    a driver to achieve water savings, and this study provides a way to make them
    accessible, although they require more regular maintenance than existing commercial
    ready-to-use solutions. We believe that this study contributes to the democratization
    of the use of new technologies in agriculture and provides keys to facilitating
    their adoption, in both the North and the global South. Future work should focus
    on assessing the impacts of the adoption of such innovation, and its adaptation
    to different contexts. Research data All the software required for the design

    Location: GHAZIABAD, India SECTION I. Introduction The necessity of preserving
    and managing water habitats has been highlighted in recent years by the problem
    of worldwide water pollution. To ensure the survival of cultured species, the
    traditional aquaculture sector needs a lot of human effort to monitor and maintain
    the water quality in fish ponds. The automated water quality monitoring systems
    currently being used in larger fish farms, however, have drawbacks such a constrained
    communication range between sensors and a lack of essential equipment for low-power,
    remote water quality monitoring [1] [2]. A LoRa and NB-IoT-based water quality
    monitoring system has been presented as a solution to these problems. This method
    intends to address the shortcomings of the mechanism in place for keeping track
    of freshwater ecological ranching, including its short transmission distance and
    limited coverage [3]. Moreover, it has been recommended to use LoRa and IoT technology
    to monitor a lake''s water environment [4], which aims to lower labor costs, decrease
    detection times, and enhance information accessibility. It is now possible to
    implement environment monitoring across large areas at low energy and low cost
    because to the development of Long Range (LoRa) network technology This is crucial
    for water quality monitoring systems intended to preserve and maintain drinking
    water supplies, stop pollution, and stop disease outbreaks, especially during
    the COVID-19 pandemic [5]. Overall, IoT can be widely used for remote monitoring
    of water quality indicators. LoRa, a relatively new addition to the Internet of
    Things, has extremely low power consumption and the capacity to cover enormous
    areas with its wireless network [6]. SECTION II. Review of Literature Aquaculture
    has seen a rise in the use of intelligent monitoring systems for environmental
    sensing in recent years. A LoRaWAn-based water quality monitoring system has been
    created to keep track of the water quality in aquaculture ponds [7]. The idea
    of IoT has facilitated the development of IoT-based systems, which are composed
    of interconnected networks of sensors that are intelligent and programmable [8].
    Users can utilize the Cayenne LPP cloud to determine the position of the device
    with the aid of IoT-based water quality monitoring devices that use geolocation
    and LoRaWAN with solar power [9]. Such systems use pH and temperature sensors
    to monitor water pollution, and wireless LoRa communication is used to relay the
    data to a host PC. The device has a PV panel and lithium-ion battery storage,
    and the data received is stored in the cloud with a GUI [10]. While on-site measurements
    are still used in traditional methods of gathering data on water quality, using
    LPWAN-LoRaWAN technology for data transfer can increase the system''s lifespan.
    To accomplish this, a solar panel has been modified to recharge the battery [11]
    [12]. Low-cost and low-power water pollution monitoring systems using microcontrollers
    and long-range wireless systems like LoRa have been proposed [13] [14] in order
    to overcome the drawbacks of conventional water quality monitoring systems, such
    as cable laying, inconvenient maintenance, and lack of intelligent management
    and control behavior. Last but not least, a sensor development and LoRa Network-based
    water and air monitoring system has been suggested. The system uses a custom PCB
    board to combine LoRa, Renesas RX64M MCU, and terminal sensors. Sixteen monitoring
    point stations were utilized to measure water and air parameters, including pH,
    temperature, humidity, CO2, DO concentration, and PM2.5 [15]. SECTION III. Block
    Diagram The LoRa-based Water Monitoring Mote is intended to gather information
    on water quality indicators like pH, TDS, and temperature, as shown in figure
    1. The main controller of the mote, an Lora32 IC board, is in charge of gathering
    data from the sensors and transmitting it to the gateway mote. Long-distance communication
    between the Water Monitoring Mote and the gateway mote is made possible by the
    LoRa RF module. The PH sensor and TDS sensor produce an analog output by measuring
    the pH and total dissolved solids in the water. The water temperature is measured
    via the waterproof DS18B20 temperature sensor. The mote receives power from a
    power supply module, which also guarantees reliable performance. Fig. 1. Block
    Diagram of the LoRa-based Water Monitoring Mote Show All Fig. 2. Block Diagram
    of the Lora Receiver Node Show All The LoRa Gateway Mote, which can be seen in
    Figure 2, acts as the gateway for the Water Monitoring Mote. It is in charge of
    gathering data from the Water Monitoring Mote and transmitting it to a cloud-based
    server. The main controller of the gateway mote, an Lora32 IC board, is in charge
    of gathering data from the Water Monitoring Mote and transmitting it to the cloud-based
    server. Long-distance communication between the Water Monitoring Mote and the
    gateway mote is made possible by the LoRa RF module. A cloud-based server can
    be accessed by the gateway mote over Wi-Fi thanks to the Nuttyfi ESP8266 Wi-Fi
    module. The mote receives power from a power supply module, which also guarantees
    reliable performance. The gateway mote uses the Nuttyfi ESP8266 Wi-Fi module to
    relay data to the cloud-based server after receiving it from the Water Monitoring
    Mote through the LoRa RF module. Users can access the data stored on the cloud-based
    server for monitoring and analysis. SECTION IV. Hardware Development The following
    are the hardware connections for the LoRa-based Water Monitoring Mote (Fig. 3):
    The 5V and GND pins of the +5V DC power supply is connected to the Vcc and GND
    pins of the PH sensor, respectively. Additionally, the Lora32 microcontroller''s
    A0 pin is connected to the PH out data pin. The 5V and GND pins of the power supply
    are linked to the Vcc and GND pins of the TDS sensor. Additionally, the Lora32
    microcontroller''s Al pin is connected to the output data pin. The 5V and GND
    pins of the power supply are linked to the Vcc and GND pins of the DS18B20 waterproof
    temperature sensor, respectively. The temperature sensor''s data pin is attached
    to the Lora32 microcontroller''s A4 pin. A 10Kohm resistor additionally connected
    between the Vcc and Data pins of the DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor. The
    Lora32 microcontroller''s Software SPI pins are linked to the Lora RF module''s
    pins. The Voltage and Ground pins on the Lora RF are linked to the appropriate
    Vcc and GND pins. The RST pin, NSS, MOSI, MISO, SCK, RST, and DIO0 pins of the
    Lora RF board are connected to the Lora32 microcontroller''s 4, 5, 6, 11, 12,
    and 13 no pins. The Lora Gateway Mote''s hardware connections are as follows (Fig.
    4): The Lora RF board''s RST pin, NSS, MOSI, MISO, SCK, RST, and DIO0 pins are
    connected to the Lora32 microcontroller''s 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, and 13 no pins using
    the software SPI approach. The power supply''s Vcc and GND are linked to the Lora
    RF module''s Vcc and GND pins. The 5V and GND pins of the power supply are linked
    to the Vcc and GND pins of the NuttyFi ESP8266 wifi Module. The Lora32 Microcontroller''s
    23 and 24 no pins have been connected to the Rx and Tx pins of the NuttyFi ESP8266
    WiFi Module. The software serial approach is used to link the two modules to one
    another. Fig. 3. Connection diagram of LoRa-based Water Monitoring Mote Show All
    Fig. 4. Connection Diagram of Lora Gateway Mote Show All SECTION V. Implementation
    of the System A. For the Lora-Based Water Monitoring Mote The initialization of
    the sensors is the first step of the LoRa-based Water Monitoring Mote algorithm
    before data collection (fig 5). The mote starts gathering data from the pH sensor,
    TDS sensor, and DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor once the sensors have been
    initialized. After processing, the sensor data is ready to be transmitted to the
    gateway mote. Using the LoRa RF module, the mote sends the data to the gateway
    mote and waits for an acknowledgement to make sure the transmission was successful.
    The mote enters a low-power sleep mode following a successful transmission in
    order to save energy until the following interval of data collecting. In order
    to provide a continuous monitoring solution for water quality metrics, the process
    is repeated at regular intervals. The water quality parameters are continuously
    monitored by this algorithm, and data is sent to the gateway router for storage
    and analysis. Fig. 5. LoRa-based Water Monitoring Mote Show All B. For the β Lora
    Gateway Mote As seen in figure 6, Initializing the LoRa and Wi-Fi modules to get
    them ready for data transmission is the first step in the LoRa Gateway Mote methodology.
    The mote starts to receive data from the water monitoring mote via the LoRa RF
    module once the modules have been initialized. After that, the data is processed
    and made ready for transmission to the server in the cloud. Using the Nuttyfi
    ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, the mote sends the processed data to the cloud-based server
    while waiting for acknowledgement to assure successful transfer. The mote enters
    a low-power sleep mode following a successful transmission in order to save energy
    until the following data transmission interval. In order to provide a continuous
    monitoring solution for water quality metrics, the process is repeated at regular
    intervals. This method makes sure that the cloud-based server receives and continuously
    transmits data from the Water Monitoring Mote for archival and analysis. Fig.

    devices, machinery, sensors, and objects communicate seamlessly without requiring
    human intervention. Within this framework, WSNs are crucial, extending their influence
    across many real-time agricultural applications. These IoT and WSNs are structured
    with multiple layers in the SA application, illuminated comprehensively in the
    subsequent subsections. The overview of IoT and WSN architectures is shown in
    Figure 2 and 3. FIGURE 2. Architecture of IoT for SA application systems. Show

    The emergence of IoT is an essential feature in contemporary agriculture systems,
    driven by the rapid progression of agricultural technology [39], [40]. IoT encompasses
    several critical segments, including sensors and devices, connectivity, action
    and automation, and user interface and interaction [1], [41]. These elements gather
    data from agricultural yields, allowing farmers to make informed decisions. Additionally,
    these elements are connected within various layers of IoT architectures for SA
    applications. However, determining an architecture for -based SA poses challenges
    due to the extensive potential scale and specific requirements, such as soil conditions,
    weather dynamics, and geographical variations [13], [42], [43]. Moreover, integrating
    IoT devices and systems into agricultural practices necessitates diligent efforts
    [44]. These efforts encompass acquiring IoT devices and utilizing various protocols
    and standards to ensure seamless compatibility and integration. In agricultural
    IoT configurations, sensors and devices generate substantial data, heightening
    the complexity of real-time data management, processing, and analysis. The designated
    framework for this purpose should efficiently facilitate structured data storage,
    efficient processing, and robust analytical capabilities [45]. The agricultural
    sector emphasizes precise and timely data, highlighting the necessity of ensuring
    the selected architectural structure is trustworthy and robust. It must have the
    capacity to maintain continuous collection and processing of data, even under
    adverse environmental circumstances or in the presence of challenges with network
    connectivity [46], [47]. On the other hand, ensuring a balanced integration of
    envisioned architectural features, functionalities, and the designated budget
    is essential. This is especially critical for small-scale farmers or financially
    constrained organizations. At the beginning of rapid advancements in IoT technologies,
    it is significant to underscore the importance of selecting an adaptable architectural
    framework [48], [49]. This architecture should incorporate emerging technologies
    and standards, ensuring the enduring relevance and effectiveness of the IoT-based
    SA system without interruption. Emphasizing the need for this strategic preference
    ensures the system’s sustained applicability and efficiency. The architecture
    of IoT technologies is employed based on various methodologies, varying from application
    to application [50], [51], [52]. This results in diverse design and deployment
    patterns. Instead, it must be customized based on specific needs. Typically, architecture
    is structured in a framework comprising three, four, and five layers for SA applications
    [26], [49], [50], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56]. Originating from a hierarchical
    framework of three to five layers, the IoT architecture is conventionally described,
    featuring primary and most common layers, including the perception layer, connectivity
    layer, and application layer for the SA application [20], [33], [50], [57]. These
    layers are also mentioned as the lower layer in the IoT architecture [21]. Furthermore,
    the other layers are the middleware and processing layer [44], [58], [59]. In
    the below subsection, we described the primary and main layer of IoT architecture
    for the SA system. 1) Perception Layer The perception layer, also known as the
    physical layer, is a crucial component in the IoT framework [13], [60]. It operates
    as a robust interface, enabling appropriate interaction between the physical and
    digital domains [33]. This layer is essential for immediately collecting diverse
    data from sensors and devices [44]. It encompasses critical environmental parameters
    such as weather conditions, wind flow, humidity, etc. For example, Zeng et al
    deployed an ultrasonic water level gauge for measuring the water level of a smart
    irrigation system [57]. The perception layer within the SA application presents
    typical challenges due to complex requirements during crop and environmental monitoring,
    especially in unfavorable conditions [60]. Enhancing the energy and communication
    infrastructure in agricultural fields is crucial, and using wired power and communication
    channels to connect IoT nodes is not practical or cost-effective. Data collection
    processes have progressed, integrating various tools. For example, sensors and
    cameras use Bluetooth, wireless networks, and short-distance wireless and wired
    transmission methods to transmit data to the central gateway [1], [61]. The sensing
    layer employs relevant devices to convert biological data into web-accessible
    information, constituting a foundational step in network control. 2) Connectivity
    Layer The communication layer, recognized as the network and transport layer,
    facilitates uninterrupted communication and data transfer across diverse devices,
    constituting the fundamental framework of IoT architectures [62], [63], [64],
    [65]. A profound understanding of the sophistication of the communication layer
    is critical to optimizing IoT networks, fostering scalability, resilience, and
    secure data exchange, thus propelling the potential and applications of IoT technologies
    across various domains. As the key element of the entire system, this layer delivers
    data transmission from the perception layer to the application layers [66]. The
    data transmission channels, encompassing wired or wireless, short or long-distance
    mechanisms, serve as foundational components. These channels effectively utilize
    both network infrastructure and wireless sensors. Attaining consistent and reliable
    performance in data transmission is paramount, especially in light of the substantial
    interference prevalent in the complex agricultural production environment and
    frequent climate changes that continually challenge this technology [67], [68].
    3) Application Layer IoT has revolutionized the SA system, fundamentally transforming
    agriculture and agribusiness approaches. The IoT application layer, central to
    this transformation, drives the functionality and intelligence of IoT applications,
    particularly in intelligent agriculture [69], [70]. This layer integrates data
    from diverse sensors and devices in agricultural settings, enabling insightful
    analysis and informed actions [48], [66]. Advanced technologies within this layer,
    such as ML algorithms and predictive analytics, drive precision farming, optimizing
    resource allocation crop management, and fostering sustainable agricultural practices
    [71]. The application layer processes information and makes critical decisions
    [72]. It closely integrates IoT technology with agricultural production, utilizing
    data analysis from the connectivity layer [73]. It also possesses related equipment
    to achieve SA management [9]. Given the complexity of crop data and climate change,
    technology proves pivotal in identifying agricultural production process issues
    aligning with user needs. B. WSN Architectures WSNs are essential in IoT technology
    because they collect and transmit data from various physical phenomena and environments.
    They operate as the information-gathering infrastructure of IoT by capturing real-time
    data through diverse sensors placed across different locations [74]. This collected
    data is relayed to centralized systems for analysis, interpretation, and informed
    decision-making. Especially within the SA system, WSNs manifest as a connected
    network of sensor nodes utilizing wireless connections. These nodes possess diverse
    functionalities, encompassing processing, transmission, and sensing capabilities,
    empowering them for self-organization, self-configuration, and self-diagnosis
    [75]. The categorization of WSNs is contingent upon their deployment contexts,
    with notable classifications being terrestrial WSNs (TWSNs), wireless underground
    sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater WSNs (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks
    (WMSNs), and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [76], [77], [78]. TWSNs and
    UWSNs are commonly utilized in SA applications [23], [79]. In contrast, WUSNs
    are positioned underground, requiring a higher node density due to the restricted
    communication range caused by soil attenuation of higher frequencies [77], [80].
    Scholarly literature extensively explores the various applications of WSNs in
    agriculture, encompassing activities such as managing irrigation, assessing water
    quality, and monitoring the environment. Exploring these applications underscores
    the pivotal role of WSNs in propelling advancements in agricultural practices.
    A WSN typically comprises five foundational layers within its architecture: the
    physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers [81], [82]. The
    details of these layers are given below. 1) Physical Layer The physical layer
    is the foundation of a WSN, encompassing crucial hardware components and communication
    interfaces. In the SA domain, this layer holds various sensors meticulously designed
    to measure essential environmental parameters such as temperature, soil moisture,
    and sunlight exposure [64], [83]. These sensors play a pivotal role by converting
    these physical parameters into electrical signals, forming the bedrock for comprehensive
    data collection within the agricultural environment. For WSNs, the most relevant
    and widely recognized set of standards is the IEEE 802.15 family [84]. Specifically,
    the IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines the physical and Medium access control layer
    (MAC) specifications for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) extensively
    utilized in WSNs [85], [86]. This standard is crafted to deliver low-cost, low-power,
    and low-data rate communication, catering to diverse applications, including WSNs.
    On the other hand, in the data flow, sensor nodes actively collect data and transmit
    it to a centralized node, ensuring processing aligns with user requirements. The
    physical layer is entrusted with transmitting bitstreams, carefully selecting
    frequencies, generating carrier frequencies, modulating data, encrypting data,
    and detecting signals [87]. This layer encompasses the definition of transmission
    medium specifications and intricately involves establishing the network topology,
    incorporating the crucial functions of encoding and decoding signals. 2) Data
    Link Layer The layer above the physical layer is the data link layer, which establishes
    reliable and secure connections between adjacent nodes in the network [81]. In
    the context of SA, this layer ensures error-free communication among sensors,
    the central base station, and sensor nodes, allowing for precise monitoring of
    field conditions and crop health [88], [89]. It handles multiple functions, including
    multiplexing data streams, frame detection, MAC, and error control implementation
    [90]. Additionally, the data link layer ensures the dependability of both point-to-point
    and multi-point channel access strategies through efficient scheduling and proficient
    buffer management [91]. 3) Network Layer The network layer is positioned higher
    within the WSN architecture and is crucial in overseeing routing and data packet
    progression among diverse sensor nodes [92]. It optimizes data flow significantly
    from sensors scattered across extensive farmlands to the central server or gateway,
    making efficient routing a vital aspect for well-informed decisions in SA, particularly
    in irrigation, pest control, and resource management. The network layer’s primary
    function lies in routing, establishing a pathway through intermediary nodes from
    the source to the destination node [93]. Research in this layer primarily focuses
    on developing highly efficient routing protocols that meet various constraints,
    encompassing energy efficiency, quality of service (QoS), and robustness. Moreover,
    the network layer integrates the communication network protocol selected from
    the existing network protocols for WSN, encompassing features relevant to precision
    agriculture applications. 4) Transport Layer The transport layer assumes a critical
    role, ensuring reliability and effectively managing congestion to prevent or mitigate
    it. Specific protocols are in place within this layer to serve these essential
    functions, employing either upstream or downstream techniques [94]. These protocols
    can be categorized as packet-driven and event-driven [95]. The collaborative capabilities
    demonstrated by sensor nodes are the fundamental basis for the operations of this
    vital layer. In addition, the transport layer is crucial in maintaining end-to-end
    communication and data integrity [96]. In the context of advanced agricultural
    applications, this layer can ensure the consistent and reliable transmission of
    data packets from sensors to the application layer. It efficiently manages data
    flow, meticulously maintains packet sequencing, and applies necessary error correction
    measures to ensure that crucial agricultural data reaches the applications with
    the highest accuracy and precision. 5) Application Layer In the domain of SA,
    the application layer holds great significance. It supports various applications
    crucial for optimizing agricultural practices, enhancing yields, and promoting
    sustainable farming methods [97]. Farmers and analysts can easily visualize field
    data on their mobile devices and computers through this layer, aiding in informed
    decision-making. This layer also plays a pivotal role in analyzing field data,
    providing valuable insights [83]. Moreover, the application layer controls essential
    management functionalities within the WSN. It efficiently manages traffic, offers
    software for diverse applications, and converts data into understandable formats.
    These functions encompass network management, query processing, communication,
    time synchronization, and localization [98]. SECTION IV. Wireless Communication
    Protocols for IoT-WSNs in SA WSN developed various wireless sensing devices placed
    over a broad location. These appliances include distributed communication network
    protocols that gather data from the agricultural yield and centralize adequately
    to commission the collected data. The state-of-the-art WSN comprises several affordable
    sensing devices utilizing low-power communications network protocols, such as
    ZigBee, SigFox, WiFi, and LoRaWAN. WSNs are distinguished functionally from the
    usual sensing device collection by their network capabilities, which allow performance
    between sensing assets. The network protocol is also classified into long-range
    and short-range protocols depending on their area coverage and properties. For
    this purpose, long-range network protocols can convey data over a long distance;
    in contrast, short ranges can transmit within a short distance [33], [99]. The
    essential features and attributes of these four protocols are shown in Table 1.
    The short-range and long-range protocols are given below. A. Short-Range Protocols
    1) ZigBee The Alliance has introduced ZigBee technology based on the IEEE 802.15.4
    standard, employing a wireless communication approach that conserves power and
    integrates a high-speed, energy-efficient standard protocol [84], [100]. ZigBee
    operates within multiple radio frequency bands, including 2.4 GHz, 915 MHz, and
    868 MHz, achieving an impressive transmission speed of 250 kbps. Notably, ZigBee
    can function in a low-power sleep mode using batteries for extended periods [23].
    It supports various network techniques, encompassing star, tree, and mesh topology,
    resulting in three primary Zigbee network types: star, tree, and wireless mesh
    network topology [101]. Zigbee wireless networks facilitate autonomous wireless
    data transmission in the agricultural IoT-WSNs domain. It ensures convenient and
    stable remote data transmission through successive integration with wired data
    transmission. Continuous advancements in IoT-WSNs microprocessor research and
    development are evident, especially in integrating wireless sensing, control,
    communication, and data processing functions within the microprocessor [27]. Concerning
    real-time monitoring in agricultural production, utilize intelligence systems
    for precise functional and monitoring tasks in field cultivation, irrigation and
    fertilizer, and well-established production processes. Agricultural IoT supports
    enriched planting experiences and precise crop management. Remarkable strides
    have been taken in the development of high-precision information monitoring and
    diagnostic equipment, significantly advancing the application of IoT in agriculture.
    Currently, equipment for acquiring crop and plant information, monitoring environmental
    information, and tracking animal behavior plays a pivotal role in the SA system.
    The vital data required for crop monitoring is gathered using various Zigbee sensors
    in battery self-powered mode, forming a wireless sensor network [102], [103],
    [104]. Given the substantial number of Zigbee nodes required in production, establishing
    a robust network topology is essential to facilitate fast communication between
    network nodes [105]. 2) WiFi Wireless Fidelity (WiFi), officially introduced by
    the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA) in the late 1990s [106], [107],
    represented a significant advancement in wireless technology. Functioning as a
    wireless local area network (WLAN) technology, it effectively replaced Ethernet,
    granting devices the ability to connect to the internet without being tethered
    by wires or cables. Operating in compliance with the IEEE 802 communication standard,
    devices equipped with WiFi communicate via radio signals across the airwaves with
    an access point (AP), an essential piece of networking hardware connected to a
    wired or cellular network [108]. This technology covers a range of radio frequencies,
    spanning from 2.4 to 60 GHz, and precisely defines the structure of data packets
    [23], [33]. WiFi is widely adopted across a spectrum of devices, primarily due
    to its coverage range, typically 3–7 km, with a large transmitting antenna and
    its potential to achieve information transfer speeds of up to 700 Mbps [109],
    [110]. In the IoT applied in SA, integrating computing and WiFi-based long-distance
    networks facilitates connectivity within agricultural and farming processes, particularly
    in rural areas. It is used to transmit information within the system due to its
    high throughput and ease of integration with web-based services. WiFi integration
    is essential while measuring critical field parameters such as water quantity,
    soil humidity, and temperature [111]. It is ideal for establishing communication
    between the sink nodes and gateways or connecting to the cloud via the internet.
    WiFi finds specific applications in agricultural IoT, encompassing crop disease
    detection, precision greenhouse farming, and remote diagnosis [112], [113]. B.
    Long-Range Protocols 1) SigFox SigFox is a Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN)
    technology designed to transmit minimal data volumes, typically ranging from a
    few bytes to hundreds of kilobytes [114]. The core modulation technique employed
    is Differential Binary Phase-Shift Keying (D-BPSK), operating within a fixed bandwidth
    of 100Hz and achieving efficient spectrum utilization [25], [33]. The transmission
    speed varies, offering rates of 100bps in Europe and a higher 600bps in the U.S.A.
    region. Operating within the unlicensed frequency spectrum below 1GHz, SigFox
    utilizes 868MHz in Europe and 915MHz in the U.S. [115]. This Ultra-Narrow Band
    modulation, known for its minimal power consumption, is ideal for establishing
    robust connections between nodes and the base station, especially when combined
    with the Chirp Spreading Spectrum. The D-BPSK modulation is relatively straightforward
    to implement [116], [117]. Moreover, SigFox handles small data packets, typically
    composed of 12 bytes, and operates within a bandwidth of 100 Hz [118]. A key strength
    of SigFox lies in its outstanding power efficiency, capable of sustaining operations
    for up to an impressive 15 years on a single battery charge [119]. This network
    technology operates in a frequency band between 860 and 920 MHz [120]. The coverage
    range spans 10 to 40 km, and the information transfer speed can reach 600 bits
    per second [121]. Owing to Sigfox’s advanced network protocol features, it finds
    extensive applications within -WSN-based SA systems [7]. It is notably used to
    implement cloud-based WSNs for irrigation systems, real-time agricultural data
    collection, and energy harvesting [118]. Moreover, SigFox has been utilized to
    develop solar-powered autonomous sensor nodes, effectively collecting meteorological
    parameters and demonstrating successful assessment, particularly in vineyard environments
    [118]. 2) LoRaWAN LoRaWAN is a low-power, wide-area networking protocol developed
    to enable communication among low-energy devices in various IoT applications [101].
    It operates over unlicensed radio frequencies, allowing for long-distance communication
    with minimal power consumption [122]. The technology uses chirp spread spectrum
    modulation, making it ideal for connecting devices over several kilometers in
    urban or rural environments [123]. This wireless communication technology consumes
    energy infrequently and operates in an unlicensed band [124]. Its coverage range
    is about 20 km, and the information transfer speed can reach 100 kbps [125], [126].
    Additionally, LoRaWAN utilizes various spreading factors (SF) from SF7 to SF12,
    strategically managing the trade-off between transmission range and data rate
    [127]. Among them, SF12 achieves an extensive communication range at the cost
    of a lower data rate [128]. LoRa is the fundamental physical technique integrated
    with the LoRaWAN MAC layer, serving as a foundation for various applications [129].
    The architectural design of LoRaWAN nodes is structured into three distinct classes:
    A, B, and C [130]. Class A nodes exhibit minimal power consumption, efficiently
    transmitting a limited number of data packets to the gateway and spending most
    of their time idle [131]. In contrast, Class B nodes, in addition to the reception
    windows resembling Class A, open specific reception windows during scheduled time
    slots [130]. Meanwhile, Class C nodes maintain a perpetually open window for reception,
    except during data transmission, resulting in higher energy consumption than their
    counterparts in the other two classes [132]. SECTION V. IoT-WSNs in SA Application
    Agriculture is essential for any nation and a pillar of the economy. SA is a significant
    aspect and rising contemporary topic for all nations. The world’s inhabitants
    are rapidly increasing, and the demand for food boosts as the population extends.
    The production of food and recovering the individual’s fundamental needs can only
    be possible by concentrating on the agriculture sectors. Thus, automation should
    be incorporated into agriculture and reformed from traditional to SA. For this
    purpose, IoT-WSN is frequently utilized in SA applications. Several agricultural
    applications are discussed In the following subsections. WSN-integrated IoT-based
    SA applications utilizing wireless network protocols are summarised in Table 3.
    TABLE 2 Overview and Characteristics of ZigBee, WiFi, SigFox, and LoRaWAN TABLE
    3 IoT-WSNs-Based Applications With Wireless Network Protocols TABLE 4 A Summary
    of Issues and Challenges of IoT-WSNs Based SA Domain TABLE 5 A Summary of Future
    Perspective and Recommendation for IoT-WSNs-Based SA System A. Irrigation System
    The smart irrigation system (SIS) is a scientific domain that uses data-intensive
    approaches to improve agricultural productivity while decreasing environmental
    impact. Advanced agricultural processes generate data from different sensors,
    leading to a better understanding of the operational circumstances and process
    activities. It allows extra accurate and efficient decision-making. The SIS improves
    performance and is an emerging approach that automates irrigation systems and
    conserves water usage. This process modifies irrigation based on actual soil and
    weather conditions, allowing farmers to fulfill their needs with a recently adopted
    method that preserves the water for the irrigation process. Hence, WSN and wireless
    network protocols are utilized in the irrigation system to achieve this facility
    [133]. Routis et al. have presented an innovative IoT-based prototype system for
    precise crop irrigation. This system utilizes microprocessors and a Single-Board
    Computer (SBC) to collect sensor data, monitoring essential soil parameters, including
    soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and ultraviolet (UV) light. A significant
    feature is Raspberry devices, which incorporate powerful 4-core CPUs operating
    at 1.5GHz, underscoring their computational efficiency compared to the Arduino
    UNO’s operation at 16MHz. The system integrates various sensors, including Capacitive
    Soil Moisture sensors, the DHT22 sensor for measuring air humidity and temperature,
    and the VEML6070 UV sensor, which is essential for monitoring UV radiation and
    its influence on crop growth. This study substantially contributes to agricultural
    technology and IoT applications for crop management [201]. Vandome et al. proposed
    low energy consumption and cost-effectiveness wireless soil moisture sensors,
    making them accessible both from a technical and economic perspective. This innovative
    sensor employs a precise calibration method based on a single parameter, enabling
    real-time monitoring of irrigation water requirements. Importantly, it was intentionally
    designed to meet the specific needs of water users and was successfully implemented
    within a Tunisian irrigation scheme, effectively addressing significant water
    use efficiency challenges. They evaluated the sensor by testing the WSN on pilot
    plots throughout a growing season and comparing its performance to commercial
    sensors. Notably, Wi-Fi technology was skillfully employed for communication within
    the network. Furthermore, the authors provided valuable insights by advocating
    for using these cost-effective sensors for real-time irrigation monitoring and
    as a pivotal tool for improving water resource management [283]. Fernández et
    al. proposed an economical cloud-based irrigation system that relies on WSN-based
    micro-controller ESP32-Lora and internet connectivity via the SigFox network.
    The results obtained validate the system’s stability and robustness. This system
    had various sensors to measure different irrigation parameters, encompassing hydraulic
    network and environmental variables, including air temperature, humidity, irradiance,
    wind speed, precipitation, and soil variables such as humidity, temperature, pH,
    and matric potential. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of an IoT-based
    solution for irrigation control and management, offering scalability suitable
    for diverse agricultural contexts. The deployment of cost-effective SigFox technology
    addresses the connectivity and energy availability challenges of SA systems in
    rural areas [291]. Mathew et al. developed an IoT-based system to enable farmers
    to estimate irrigation water requirements. This innovative system employs sensors
    to detect soil moisture and temperature, with the collected data transmitted to
    the LoRaWAAN system for comprehensive analysis, including evapotranspiration calculation.
    The determination of global evapotranspiration is facilitated through Cropwat
    software, while the sensor data undergoes examination, enabling precise estimations
    tailored to microclimate conditions. The chosen Rx-MCU is the ESP32 MCU, equipped
    with integrated Wi-Fi connectivity to ensure uninterrupted internet gateway connection,
    facilitating seamless data streaming into application layer services. This approach
    is firmly grounded in WSNs, significantly enhancing the efficiency of both data
    collection and transmission [284]. B. Soil Moisture Monitoring System Soil moisture
    plays an important role in an agricultural field that massively contributes to
    crop growth [493], [494]. It is recognized as one of the major drivers for plant
    ecosystems and a significant state variable for the irrigation system of the agriculture
    field [495]. Soil moisture is strongly variable and depends on various soil properties
    and terrain attributes [496]. Therefore, a modern, sustainable, automatic, low-cost,
    and power-efficient soil moisture monitoring process is required. Soil moisture
    monitoring systems can be performed with various procedures. In these terms, WSN
    is one of the most utilized approaches to monitoring soil condition and moisture
    [84], [497]. Based on this, several works have been done to monitor the soil nutrient,
    PH, and moisture monitoring by using WSN. Mohammed et al. introduced a real-time,
    fully automated WSN prototype for irrigation systems. This innovative system relies
    on automated WSN technology to respond to soil conditions, particularly soil moisture,
    for informed irrigation decisions. It utilizes the ZigBee protocol integrated
    into the XBee module and incorporates a cost-effective capacitive soil moisture
    sensor to measure soil moisture levels at each ZigBee node. Integrated with the
    low-cost soil moisture sensor, this system demonstrated promise in enhancing agricultural
    practices and conserving water resources [203]. Patrizi et al. submitted WSN architecture
    that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technology to develop a virtual soil
    moisture sensor. This virtual sensor utilizes data collected by other transducers
    on the same node. They utilized the ESP32 system-on-a-chip microcontroller to
    efficiently process and transmit data to a centralized gateway through the WiFi
    protocol. The WSN consists of ten independent sensor nodes, each equipped with
    an array of environmental sensors for air temperature, humidity, soil temperature,
    soil moisture, and radiation. An essential challenge addressed in this work was
    measuring soil humidity. In response, the study introduced a sophisticated soft
    sensing algorithm based on the DL algorithm, resulting in a virtual soil moisture
    sensor capable of overcoming the limitations of physical sensors and enhancing
    precision in soil moisture measurements [379]. Wu et al. presented a soil quality
    monitoring system to enhance agricultural practices. This system designated users
    to conduct real-time monitoring of their farmland via a mobile application, providing
    a convenient means to establish and customize soil parameter thresholds. Their
    research offered a novel approach to integrating IoT technology into agricultural
    soil measurements, incorporating multiple sensors for temperature and moisture,
    a microprocessor, a microcomputer, a cloud platform, and a dedicated mobile application.
    The wireless sensors efficiently collect and transmit real-time soil information,
    with the mobile app serving as a central monitoring hub through the cloud platform.
    Data transmission facilitated by the LoRa module ensures precise measurements
    that closely align with those obtained through calibration equipment. Field experiments
    have showcased the system’s ability to predict soil moisture and temperature with
    enhanced accuracy, drawing upon data from various soil layers. This system equipped
    users with the necessary tools to promptly assess soil conditions, enabling routine
    checks for changes in soil quality [406]. C. Fertiliser Optimization and Control
    The world faces a food supply crisis, with less food production than population
    growth [498]. Besides, there needs to be more integration and utilization of state-of-the-art
    technology in agricultural applications [499]. The annual food production is also
    damaged due to a lack of soil fertility, moisture, and fundamental nutrients of
    NPK [500]. On the other hand, conventional methods are even applied to measure
    the soil nutrients and apply a fertilizer that is also harmful to crops and soil.
    The excessive volume of fertilizer can damage the standard scale of PH and the
    soil nutrition of agricultural land [501]. To address this challenge, it becomes
    essential to form a precision agriculture exercise through IoT with the involvement
    of IoT and WSN. Soil nutrient and fertilizer investigation using WSN allows different
    applications, including remote soil fertility monitoring. Contreras et al. introduced
    SAgric-IoT, an SA system integrating IoT and DL technologies. This sophisticated
    system aims to monitor environmental conditions, swiftly detect diseases, and
    automate irrigation and fertilization processes within greenhouses. It comprises
    four key components: WSN for environmental monitoring, cameras for visual data,
    a gateway for centralized control, and a processing and storage unit. The gateway
    operates using three distinct communication protocols–ZigBee for sensor connectivity,
    Wi-Fi for cameras, and a cellular interface for transmitting data to the central
    unit. Notably, SAgric-IoT demonstrates remarkable efficiency in minimizing packet
    loss, thereby significantly conserving energy [105]. Senapaty et al. introduced
    the IoTSNA-CR model, utilizing IoT technology to analyze soil nutrients and suggest
    optimal crops, aiming to enhance productivity while reducing fertilizer usage.
    The model begins with IoT sensors collecting data in cultivation areas, followed
    by real-time storage in cloud services, accessible via an Android app, and undergoing
    subsequent data processing and analysis. A cost-effective WSN sensory system integrated
    various sensors to monitor soil attributes—temperature, moisture, pH, GPS, and
    color—efficiently gathering diverse data, including NPK values, timestamps, and
    geolocation specifics. Research advised using Agrinex NPK soil testing tablets
    and an LDR color sensor for soil sample analysis, with results stored in Firebase
    cloud storage. Interconnected through the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and Arduino microcontroller,
    sensor nodes formed a low-power, efficient wireless network. The pivotal FC28
    soil moisture sensor significantly enhanced the IoTSNA-CR model’s effectiveness
    by evaluating soil water content [112]. Doan et al. proposed a WSN framework employing
    LoRa technology for remote monitoring within agricultural settings. This network
    consisted of three strategically placed LoRa sensor nodes within separate rice
    fields, tailored to different crops and utilizing various tillage and fertilization
    methods. These nodes gathered essential environmental indicators for effective
    monitoring, encompassing temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, water pH, CH4,
    and NH3 levels. Research findings underscored the system’s effectiveness in monitoring
    the rice cultivation environment, ensuring robust and comprehensive data transmission,
    network security, and impressive long-range signal transmission of up to 3.5 km
    at a reasonable cost. The framework demonstrated proficiency in long-distance
    data transmission, maintaining secure data transfer from source nodes to the central
    gateway, ensuring high reliability, and facilitating seamless deployment for extensive
    agricultural monitoring [347]. D. Early Stage Control of Pest and Crop Diseases
    Damaging crop production due to various factors, pests, and crop diseases is one
    significant issue, as a large quantity of crop is wasted every production cycle
    by affecting pests and diseases [84], [502]. Thus, an early-stage sustainable
    decision support system is mandatory to enable the farmer to carry out proper
    actions in profitable harvesting [503]. A smart monitoring system should employ
    state-of-the-art sensor technology to solve plant diseases and pest-related concerns.
    WSN systems can collect data and store them in a cloud platform with the help
    of network protocols and process them, which helps to make early decisions to
    prevent pest and crop diseases [36], [47]. Additionally, Crop disease detection
    is a massive challenge in precision agriculture applications since crop diseases
    cannot be accurately predicted by analyzing individual disease causes. Azfar et
    al. introduced an IoT sensor system explicitly designed for pest detection and
    control, real-time detection of Cotton Flying Moths. This system experienced rigorous
    testing in controlled and uncontrolled environments to evaluate its accuracy and
    efficiency. The innovative prototype integrated a series of precise infrared sensors,
    a communication module based on Zigbee technology, an Arduino 2560 Mega board,
    a lithium polymer battery to power the sensor, a gateway device, and a UAV configured
    to act as a pesticide sprayer upon detecting pests. The pest detection algorithm,
    embedded within the system, monitors changes in reflected light to identify the
    presence of flying insects. Upon detection, the system sends an alert to the gateway
    device, which transmits the detection coordinates to the drone/UAV. Subsequently,
    the drone responds by spraying pesticide in the identified pest-infested area
    [440]. Strawberry cultivation is a significant agricultural venture, offering
    considerable advantages over various vegetable crops [504], [505]. Despite its
    prominence, the sensitivity of strawberries renders them highly susceptible to
    diverse pests and diseases. Resorting to chemicals and pesticides for protection
    significantly hampers production efficiency due to this sensitivity. To address
    this challenge, integrating deep computer vision architectures has been pivotal.
    Cruz and colleagues introduced a novel approach, employing the Yolo V5 computer
    vision architecture within an IoT system designed for strawberry disease detection.
    This innovative system utilizes LoRaWAN and WiFi protocols for internal data transmission
    and employs the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol for data uploading
    to the internet [403]. Hnatiuc et al. developed an innovative IoT sensor network
    paired with a LoRaWAN-based system designed precisely for intelligently detecting
    grapevine diseases and collecting essential environmental and plant-related data.
    This technology was deployed within the experimental plots of the Research Station
    for Viticulture and Enology (SDV) to offer early insights into grapevine health.
    Data transmission across the Wi-Fi network was facilitated through the LoRaWAN-EU868
    protocol. The study is balanced to extend its investigation to analyze results
    from IoT sensors trialed across vineyards in diverse regions [446]. E. Energy
    Saving and Power Consumption Advanced agriculture uses new processes, such as
    precision agriculture, to optimize the workflow under environmental aspects. For
    this purpose, WSN is incorporated with IoT, and network protocols combined with
    systems are used. Various required WSN nodes and actuators are also equipped.
    Such equipment requires a continuous power supply to achieve non-stop services
    [506]. In the PA-based WSN, energy consumption may differ due to additional parameters,
    i.e., active computational overload or sensor density deviations [507]. The existing
    conventional energy harvesting strategy cannot serve under such a requirement
    while harvesting and thus may reduce the overall lifespan of the network and entire
    system. To meet the energy requirements, a significant energy harvesting design
    is required [508]. Recent advancements and development of technology with low-power
    consumption, IoT, and WSN have been tremendously utilized and deployed for various
    SA applications. WSN has improved agricultural productivity and efficiency in
    agriculture yield. However, the energy and power shortage of WSNs is a major issue
    as instantly charging batteries is usually demanded [509], [510], [511], [512].
    Sadowski et al. proposed an agricultural monitoring system with energy harvesting
    regarding these factors. The study presented a comparison arrangement between
    ZigBee, WiFi, and LoRaWAN wireless network protocols. It has been demonstrated
    that LoRaWAN demanded less power than other protocols within agricultural monitoring
    systems where power consumption and legibility of the network are considered.
    The experimental results recommended selecting wireless technology for future
    agricultural monitoring applications [464]. Similarly, Arshad et al. introduced
    a study based on a smart sensor module with an advanced irrigation system and
    supervised fertilizer architectures. The system has incorporated WSN, cloud-utilizing
    decision support layers, and networking-based DSS to recommend cautiousness for
    optimum sustainable agricultural field and production. For this purpose, A WSN
    node is equipped with an MCU LoRaWAN wireless module. The sensor node with LoRaWAN
    is connected to solar panels for stored energy since LoRaWAN can achieve enormous
    distances with low energy [267], [403]. SECTION VI. Issues and Challenges of IoT-WSNs-Based

    soil cultivation, essential in transforming traditional farming practices [617].
    D. UAVs UAVs, commonly referred to as drones, are equipped with a suite of cameras
    and sensors, establishing them as essential tools for data collection and monitoring
    within the agricultural sector. When integrated with IoT-WSNs, UAVs facilitate
    aerial data collection, providing a real-time and in-depth understanding of the
    agricultural landscape [431], [620]. This integration significantly contributes
    to the precise assessment of crops and efficient agricultural management. Considerable
    research studies have investigated the potential of UAVs in data collection for
    agriculture, underscoring the efficacy of UAV-WSN systems in SA. For instance,
    researchers have explored a UAV-enabled agricultural system, wherein the UAV acts
    as a decode-and-forward relay, enhancing communication between controllers and
    multiple robots. Additionally, UAVs have been utilized to design optimal flight
    paths, generating UAV trajectories for efficient data collection from sensor nodes
    with non-uniform distributions, thus enhancing the overall effectiveness of data
    gathering [621], [622], [623]. E. Big Data Analytics (BDA) Big data analytics
    in IoT-based agriculture leverages advanced data analysis methodologies to extract
    valuable insights from the extensive data generated by IoT devices within agricultural
    settings [14], [74], [624]. These IoT devices, furnished with various sensors,

    ahead, 6G technology, still in its developmental phase, holds the potential to
    revolutionize data collection and analysis, potentially achieving speeds in the
    range of terabits per second, thereby ensuring exceptionally timely and precise
    insights for farmers [628], [631]. Incorporating 5G and the envisioned capabilities
    of 6G within IoT-WSNs for agriculture holds immense promise. This combination
    facilitates real-time monitoring of critical factors such as soil conditions,
    crop health, weather patterns, and equipment performance, empowering optimized
    decision-making. The present generation of intelligent agricultural applications,
    relying on a relatively restrained number of wireless sensors, necessitates improved
    accuracy and effectiveness. However, the ongoing development of 6G- communication
    technologies sets the groundwork for the future of intelligent and sustainable
    agriculture [629]. 6G- technology pledges to enable the interconnection of various
    extensive sensors, granting farmers the capacity to gather intricate, plant-specific
    information. This transformative potential fueled by 6G- technology is poised
    to revolutionize SA, ensuring precise data collection, advanced robotics, and
    precision agriculture in remote locations, rendering agriculture significantly
    more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective. G. Block Chain Systems Blockchain
    technology, a decentralized and highly secure digital ledger, plays a crucial
    role in documenting transactions across a network. When integrated with IoT-WSNs,
    it ensures secure and transparent record-keeping within the domain of SA, particularly
    benefiting supply chains, traceability, and transactions. This integration significantly
    strengthens trust and operational efficiency throughout the agricultural ecosystem
    by assuring data integrity and fortifying defense against potential threats. One
    notable application involves countering data manipulation attacks, where crucial
    information about crops with minimal pesticide usage is securely stored within
    the blockchain’s immutable ledger [627], [634], [635]. This advancement ensures
    the integrity and reliability of essential agricultural data, ultimately contributing
    to enhanced decision-making processes. H. Renewable Energy Integration Incorporating

    is crucial, aiming to establish sustainable and environmentally friendly energy
    solutions for powering devices and systems in remote agricultural regions [63].
    Integrating renewable energy contributes to energy efficiency and environmental
    sustainability within the agricultural landscape. By incorporating energy from
    renewable sources into the IoT-based SA observation systems, sustainability and
    cost-effectiveness are markedly enhanced [637]. Using solar or wind power to energize
    the system diminishes reliance on conventional power sources, consequently reducing
    energy expenses and decreasing carbon emissions. Additionally, the scalability
    of this integrated system makes it viable for adoption by small-scale farmers
    who may lack access to conventional power sources. I. IoT-WSNs and Their Protocols
    in Future SA Applications Areas In recent years, the integration of the IoT has
    led to significant advancements in agriculture, as shown in Table 3. Notably,
    there has been a 2.4% increase in IoT’s growth, currently rising by 1.5%, as shown
    in Figure 4, which has captured substantial attention within the agricultural
    community. Farmers have extensively adopted IoT frameworks throughout the agricultural
    process, particularly in irrigation systems. They are renowned for their precision,
    efficiency, remote monitoring, and data-driven decision-making, as shown in Figure
    5. FIGURE 4. Progression of IoT-WSNs and network protocols in SA systems. Show
    All FIGURE 5. Yearly evolution of research contributions in IoT-WSN within SA
    applications. Show All IoT has notably enhanced agricultural efficiency by linking
    devices, instruments, and stakeholders, reducing labor costs and increasing overall
    productivity. Farmers seek reliable, cost-effective, and power-efficient IoT devices
    seamlessly integrating with WSNs. The landscape of wireless network protocols
    is evolving, witnessing a significant shift towards low-power alternatives such
    as LoRaWAN, outperforming Wi-Fi due to its efficiency, network coverage, and minimal
    power requirements in SA, as shown in Figure 6. FIGURE 6. Research contribution
    distribution in IoT-WSN with their network protocols in SA applications. Show
    All Moreover, SigFox, operating on narrowband technology and offering extensive
    coverage with fewer base stations, remains an area of interest for IoT research
    in agricultural systems. Although its usage has maintained a 1% rate since 2019,
    as shown in Figure 6, SigFox and LoRaWAN, both with low power consumption, differ
    in flexibility. LoRaWAN, due to its greater flexibility, is better suited for
    specific agricultural setups requiring increased control or distinct coverage
    patterns. A detailed analysis of research contributions emphasizes a significant
    focus on irrigation systems, soil monitoring, and energy optimization. Soil monitoring
    saw a slight decrease post-2021, while by the end of 2022, as shown in Figure
    7, there was an increase in fertilizer optimization through IoT, along with applications
    for energy savings and plant pest and disease control in SA. Regarding network
    protocols, the rise of LoRaWAN significantly impacted the dominance of ZigBee
    and Wi-Fi from 2020 to 2022, securing a 35% share over the past five years, as
    shown in Figure 8. This positions LoRaWAN as a promising protocol for efficient
    resource utilization in SA. Simultaneously, Wi-Fi retains its popularity due to
    widespread availability and short-range capabilities. FIGURE 7. Annual research
    contribution rates in SA application areas. Show All FIGURE 8. Annual wireless
    network protocol rates in IoT-WSN research within SA Applications. Show All SECTION
    VIII. Conclusion Integrating IoT with WSNs in SA aims to maximize yield and optimize
    agricultural processes. This comprehensive IoT with WSNs architecture facilitates
    effective monitoring and control of agricultural fields, enabling valuable data
    collection to address current challenges. Wireless communication protocols are
    essential in efficiently transmitting the collected data to the system. Integrating
    WSNs with IoT and wireless network protocols has proven cost-effective and efficient
    in SA applications, minimizing agricultural expenses. Notably, these integrated
    systems exhibit low cost, low power consumption, and enhanced efficiency. This
    survey presents a detailed review of the state-of-the-art IoT technology and the
    deployment of WSNs with wireless network protocols for SA applications since 2019.
    The study extensively explores the architecture of IoT-WSN integration with network
    protocols in the SA domain, shedding light on prominent network protocols such
    as ZigBee, WiFi, SigFox, and LoRaWAN. These protocols have found significant utility
    in IoT-WSNs SA applications, including irrigation systems, soil moisture monitoring,
    fertilizer optimization and control, early-stage pest and crop disease management,
    and energy-saving measures. The study deliberates on current challenges and issues
    in this domain, aiming to provide insights and potential solutions for further

  description: The trend towards smart greenhouses stems from various factors, including
    a lack of agricultural land area owing to population concentration and housing
    construction on agricultural land, as well as water shortages. This study proposes
    building a full farming adaptation model that depends on current sensor readings

    operations in real time. This helps to ensure that crops are getting the right
    amount of fertilizer, water, light, and temperature, which can lead to improved
    yields and a reduced risk of crop failure. Our dataset is based on data collected
    from expert farmers, the photovoltaic construction process, agricultural engineers,
    and research centers. The experimental results showed that the precision, recall,

  description: Climate change affects the rainy and dry seasons, making it challenging
    to store and effectively utilize water resources. This problem will lead to crop
    losses and poor productivity in agriculture. A smart irrigation system in agriculture
    could be a solution by giving the ability to monitor the irrigation of the crops.
    An automated irrigation system might irrigate the crops and efficiently use the
    available water supplies. This study proposes an irrigation system using parallel
    water dripping system that is controlled and monitored using a Wi-Fi network,
    a wireless transceiver module, and a Real Time Clock (RTC) module. With the aid
    of this system, it is easier to control the solenoid water valve by using either
    manually on or off switch operations or a timer-based operation. The proposed
    irrigation system is also capable to be set for 5, 7, and 10 minutes from the
    developed system interface. Besides that, a multiple wireless sensor network were
    also integrated to observe the condition of the soil moisture and display it on
    the developed interface. The result showed that the sensor network detected the
    soil moisture content during the assigned watering time with about 83% accuracy
    based on two watering time conditions on three sensors. The soil moisture condition
    could be used as a parameter to let the irrigation operate based on the soil moisture
    data obtained from the sensors.

  description: This paper aims to implement a wireless sensor network to automate
    greenhouse operations, with the primary objective of achieving optimal plant growth
    conditions. To effectively monitor crucial micro-climatic parameters such as temperature,
    soil moisture, light, pH, and salinity, the system employs slave unit sensor nodes
    equipped with a diverse array of sensors. Additionally, a mobile application is
    utilized to enable farmers to set customized threshold values for each parameter,
    granting them complete control over the greenhouse environment via their mobile
    devices. These threshold values serve as benchmarks to ensure that the growing
    conditions remain within desired ranges. Multiple slave units have been strategically
    deployed throughout the greenhouse to ensure comprehensive and accurate data collection.
    Each slave unit actively collects sensor data and efficiently transmits it wirelessly
    to the central master unit. The master unit plays a vital role in the automation
    process by receiving the data set by the mobile application and meticulously comparing
    it with the real-time data received from the slave units. This meticulous comparison
    allows the system to precisely assess the current conditions against the desired
    threshold values. Based on this comparison, the system takes prompt actions to
    regulate and maintain the most favorable growing conditions for the plants, optimizing
    their growth potential. An essential aspect of this system's design is the integration
    of edge computing, enabling localized processing and decision-making. This approach
    significantly reduces latency and dependence on constant cloud connectivity, ensuring
    that the system remains responsive and reliable, even in areas with limited network
    coverage. The implementation of this automated greenhouse system brings numerous
    benefits to agriculturists, as it alleviates the burden of manual monitoring and
    control. Instead, farmers can concentrate on strategic planning and overall agricultural
    management, optimizing their efforts for improved productivity. Moreover, the
    system's ability to maintain optimal growing conditions results in maximized crop
    yield while promoting resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable farming
    practices.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bengaluru, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Climate change introduces us to many problems and the challenge is intensified
    by agriculture''s extreme vulnerability to climate change. Climate change is already
    having a negative impact, with rising temperatures, increased weather variability,
    shifting ecosystem boundaries, invasive crops and pests, and more frequent extreme
    weather events. The solution for such a problem is a controlled environment such
    as a greenhouse, also called a glasshouse, which is a building designed for the
    protection of tender or out-of-season plants against excessive cold or heat. Maintenance
    and working in the greenhouse are tough as the knowledge of multiple parameters
    such as Electric Conductivity (EC), pH, light intensity, humidity, moisture, and
    temperature is required. This procedure simplified the problem of obtaining the
    reading and the steps required to preserve the plants in a controlled environment.
    Here, drip irrigation is automated to water the plants in a regulated manner on
    a regular basis. Also, it aims to maintain pH and EC using water, by adding fertilizer
    and salt to control pH and EC [1]. Install automated light bulbs and curtains
    to control the light received by the plants in a regulated manner based on the
    plant''s requirements. For example, Gerbera is commercially propagated through
    the division of clumps (suckers). Tissue-cultured plants, on the other hand, can
    be used for commercial flower production. Day temperature of 22- 300C and night
    temperature of 120C to 160C is ideal for growth and flower production. An adequate
    amount of shade net (50%) must be provided to regulate excess light and temperature.
    Humidity should be maintained at 60% Farmers need frequent visits to their farms
    for tasks like watering and fertilizing, which can be costly and time-consuming.
    As agricultural lands grow, remote monitoring and management systems are becoming
    more prevalent. However, weak or inadequate internet connectivity can hinder remote
    farm monitoring and control. The Internet of Things is typically used in agriculture
    through a monitoring network with numerous sensor nodes. Using edge computing,
    which distributes the cloud server burden and reduces wait times, could help address
    this issue. Edge computing applications include pest identification, product safety
    tracking, autonomous equipmentuse, promoting agricultural technology, and intelligent
    management [2]. The paper is divided into 6 sections. Section 1, consists of an
    introduction and motivation. In section 2, a detailed literature review is presented.
    Section 3 consists of the system overview which includes information about the
    slave unit, master unit, methodology, and block diagrams. Section 4 is all about
    hardware and software implementation with all flowcharts. Section 5 explains about
    Results. In Section 6, the conclusion is mentioned. SECTION II. Related Work Greenhouses
    are structures, either with frames or inflated, that are covered with transparent
    materials. They are designed to provide a suitable environment for plant growth,
    allowing for optimal growth and productivity by controlling environmental-mental
    conditions to a partial or full extent. This section includes research done in
    Smart Greenhouse monitoring Systems and EDGE Computing. An automatic irrigation
    system using edge nodes has beenproposed that is unaffected by communication delay
    and disconnection [3]. The Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B were evaluated
    as edge node candidates andthe Jetson Nano was found to perform better at hightemperatures.
    The system can be used to evaluate AImodels and determine water stress for crop
    cultivation. It is currently used for high sugar tomato cultivation in Japan with
    manual parameter management. An Intelligent IoT-based Automated Irrigation system
    has been developed that captures sensor data on soil moisture and temperature.
    The data is communicated to a Raspberry Pi3 control unit where a KNN machine learning
    algorithmis used for analysis and irrigation prediction. The system is developed
    using cheap embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino Uno [4]. A wireless
    sensor network is used to gather data for the prediction of energy and water requirements
    for maintaining a greenhouse''s climate [5]. The input data from sensors is processed
    using fuzzy logic methods to produce output data. The greenhouse is managed and
    monitored through an Android-based user interface. The paper [6] presents a system
    architecture that integrates artificial intelligence at the local network layer
    for smart agriculture and farming applications. Edge and Fog computing, as well
    as LPWAN technology, are used to extend functionality and solve the low-bandwidth
    transmission challenge of LPWAN technologies. The system includes a sensor node,
    an Edge gateway, LoRa repeaters, a Fog gateway, cloud servers, and an end-user
    terminal application. The article in [7], discusses the potential of wireless
    sensors and IoT in agriculture and the challenges of integrating this technology
    with traditional farming practices. It lists the available sensors for soil preparation,
    crop status, irrigation, and insect/pest detection, and how this technology helps
    the growers throughout the crop stages. Applying the fuzzy logic method to the
    input data from sensors (temperature and humidity sensors, such as the DHT11)
    has produced the output data. Through an Android-based user interface, the writers
    manage andkeep an eye on the greenhouse [8]. A greenhouse smartphone monitoring
    system has been suggested that combines Eclipse''s Android programming tools and
    Visual Studio''s C++/MFC. The system offers strong cross-platform and secondary
    development portability, enabling real-time data interchange between client software
    and the core module [9]. The article [10] provides a comprehensive overview of
    important technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence used in agriculture
    to inform consumers about the products they consume. The research also sheds light
    on difficulties encountered with tasks like task assignment, data analysis, service
    stability, and privacy protection. Edge AI, also known as local network layer
    artificial intelligence, enables smart farming and agricultural applications using
    edge and fog computing as well as LPWANtechnology for extensive coverage. Moving
    data analyticsand compression close to end devices solves the low-bandwidth transmission
    issue of LPWAN technologies. The system [11], [12] includes a sensor node, an
    Edgegateway, LoRa repeaters, a Fog gateway, cloud servers, and an end-user terminal
    application. The article discusses the impact of IoT-based technologies on smart
    agriculture and the potential of wireless sensors. It lists sensors for various
    agricultural applications and explains how they aid farmers throughout the production
    process. The article also highlights modern IoT-based agricultural systems and
    platforms. The article [13] highlights the state-of-the-art IoT-based architectures
    and platforms used in agriculture. The system that forecasts how much water and
    energy willbe needed to keep greenhouse climate factors like soil moisture, relative
    humidity, and temperature stable. Using a wireless sensor network, node packs
    arranged in a star topology are used to gather the data needed for predictions.
    The papers [14], [15] discusses the advantages of advanced wireless sensor networks
    for soil sampling processes, the challenge of maintaining power supply, and the
    potential of ambient energy harvesting as a solution, while also noting the current
    limitations of battery less sensor nodes for extensive environmental monitoring.
    The paper presents a Wireless SensorNetwork prototype with MicaZ nodes for monitoring
    temperature, light, pressure, and humidity in greenhouses, sharing measurement
    data through the Internet of Things for remote control by farmers via mobile phones
    or computers. The paper explores the automation of greenhouse monitoring systems
    using edge nodes, automated plant watering, and sensors to track temperature,
    light, humidity, and soil moisture. It highlights the significance of also monitoring
    soil pH and EC, which can be challenging when dealing with multiple plantation
    areas. To address this, a mobile application and a master-slave unit are proposed,
    enabling the owner to manage all parameters remotely and efficiently across different
    greenhouse sections. SECTION III. The System Overview The system consists of both
    hardware and software technologies. The following sections describe the methodology
    and the block diagram of the system. The goal of this Paper is to fully automate
    a greenhouse shown in Fig. 1. There are three parts in the system, 1. Mobile Application.
    2. Slave unit. and 3. Master Unit. The Mobile application is used to set the parameters
    with respect to the plantation area. The Slave units are implemented in the plantation
    area of the greenhouse and used to sense the temperature, light, moisture, pH,
    and salinity using multiple sensors. The sensed data are sent to the master unit
    wirelessly. The data received from the Slave unit is to the master unit. The master
    unit will take appropriate action to control parameters in the greenhouse with
    respect to the data set by the owner through the mobile application. To regulate
    the pH, EC, temperature, and moisture, a separate solution is prepared and kept
    in a tank. The app helps the user (Farmer)to view the greenhouse condition and
    change, control, and setparameters for the plants as required remotely. The app
    also contains default parameters to set for specific plants. Fig. 1. Block Diagram
    of Greenhouse. Show All A. Mobile Application The owner-specified plant''s threshold
    values for temperature, moisture, light, and soil pH are set using a mobileapplication.
    Users must first sign up and log in using the same email. Users can set data in
    2 modes in the application. The first one is done manually using a slider as shown
    in Fig. 2(a), and if the plant owner is unaware of its specifications, they can
    simply choose the plant type as shown in Fig. 2(b). In accordance with the owner''s
    threshold valve, the master unit will take the appropriate action. Fig. 2. (a)
    Login page of app. (b) Manual setting using slider and Plant type selection. Show
    All B. Slave Unit The Slave unit consists of temperature, luminosity, pH, and
    soil EC sensors along with a microcontroller i.e., ESP32 as shown in Fig. 3. The
    sensor node senses the environmental parameters such as temperature, luminosity,
    soil pH, EC, and Moisture inside the greenhouse with the help of DHT11, light,
    pH, and EC (JXBS-3001-EC-RS-I) sensors respectively. The sensed data is sent to
    the Master unit wirelessly. Multiple slave units are deployed at strategic points
    of the greenhouse. The control signals from these different nodes communicate
    with the master unit. Fig. 3. Slave Unit Show All C. Master Unit As shown in Fig.
    4, the proposed system''s master unit consists of a microcontroller (ESP32), solenoid
    valves, and a diaphragm motor. The control signals from the sensor nodes are received
    by the Master unit from the slave unit. The received data from the slave unit
    is stored locally and also transferred to the cloud using ESP32 module and analyzed
    as an edge node. The control signals indicate the conditions prevalent in the
    greenhouse. The control signals are relayed to the microcontroller which processes
    the data and necessary actions such as bringing the temperature down using the
    humidifiers, improving the lighting conditions maintaining using artificial lighting.
    Soil with a pH level below 6.5 is considered acidic and requires the amendment
    of lime, while soil with a pH level above 8.5 is categorized as acidic soil and
    requires the amendment of gypsum which is added to the soil by mixing it with
    water controlled by the solenoid valves. If the EC level of the soil exceeds the
    established threshold, which indicates the presence of saline soil, and the recommended
    solution is leaching to flush out the excess salts. Fig. 4. Master Unit Show All
    SECTION IV. Implementation A. Hardware The system hardware in the slave unit consists
    of Soil EC sensor, pH sensor, Light sensor, DHT11, Moisture sensor and ESP32 module.
    The primary responsibility of the slave unit is to gather and transmit data to
    the master unit about all sensed data. Fig. 5 explains the complete system design
    of slave circuit. The complete design of the master unit circuit is provided in
    Fig. 6. The primary role of the master unit is to regulate the soil''s acidic
    pH, base pH, temperature, moisture, and electrical conductivity (EC) using solenoid
    valves. These valves are controlled by the ESP32 microcontroller integrated into
    the master unit. The working of solenoid valves depends on the data sent by slave
    unit to master unit. Master unit controls solenoid valves so that the environment
    is suitable for greenhouse plants. Pumping solution out of tanks for drip irrigation
    is done with a diaphragm motor. Fig. 5. Circuit of Slave Unit Show All Fig. 6.
    Circuit of Master Unit. Show All B. Flowchart This Paper employs software technologies
    to build user-facing applications, and it stores all of the data it has gathered
    on the cloud. A mobile application was created to update the preloaded data and
    configure the threshold parameters for the particular plantation. The user (owner)
    must first register and log in for the same account in order to manually set the
    parameters using the slider and establish a set of settings, particularly for
    the plantation area. The mobile application''s flowchart, as shown in Fig. 7.
    Fig. 8 explains how the slave unit operates. Fig. 7. Mobile Application flow graph
    Show All Fig. 8. Slave unit flow graph Show All The slave unit collects data from
    all sensors and transmits it to the master unit as soon as it receives power.
    Themaster unit flow will be managed in accordance with the data sent, as shown
    in Fig. 9. The water solution value will open and the motors will pump to maintain
    the soil''s moisture levelif the moisture value falls below the threshold value.
    Then, if the temperature data exceeds the threshold, sprinklers are utilized to
    maintain the temperature. Fig. 9. Master unit flow graph Show All Acid solution
    is used when the pH value exceeds the threshold. Base solution is used when the
    pH value is below the threshold. A motor will pump solutions to keep the pH of
    the soil stable. Then, with the aid of lights, intensity is adjusted by comparing
    light intensity with the threshold value. SECTION V. Results As a case study,
    the Gerbera plants are chosen for implementing and testing the proposed work in
    real-time. Table I represents the ideal environmental conditions for the growth
    of the Gerbera plant. The outcomes of the work are presented in the subsequent
    sections. Table II shows the greenhouse monitoring system can deviate from ideal
    values for optimal plant growth conditions. However, after deployment and operation,
    these parameters are effectively controlled and regulated, resulting in improved
    plant cultivation conditions. The mobile application login success depicted in
    Fig. 2 signifies thatusers have gained access to the system. The cloud-based infrastructure
    empowers real-time monitoring of greenhouse conditions while offering manual parameter
    customization and plant type selection, enhancing usability and adaptability.
    Table I. Ideal Values of the Parameters for Gerbera Plant Table II. Comparison
    of Parameters Inside Greenhouse Before and After Controlling to That of Ideal
    Values The model implementation displayed in Fig. 12 showcases the master unit
    and slave units, forming an efficient architecture for data processing and control.
    Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 provide avisual representation of all parameters before and
    after monitoring and control, taking into account the user mobile application''s
    threshold value. These figures illustrate the changes in various measured quantities
    and how they compare to the set threshold. The visual representation presents
    a clear overview of the parameter values, allowing users to assess the effectiveness
    of the monitoring process and identify any deviations from the desired threshold.
    The successful uploading of all slave unit data shown in Fig. 13 through the app
    enables real-time monitoring. Finally, Fig. 14 demonstrates the successful testing
    conducted in the greenhouse, validating the system''s effectiveness in maintaining
    optimal growing conditions. From survey, so far pH and EC in real time is not
    implemented but in this paper both pH and EC are controlled. Fig. 10. (a), (b),
    (c) and (d) are Light Intensity before, after monitoring and Temperature of the
    greenhouse before and after monitoring respectively Show All Fig. 11. (a), (b),
    (c) and (d) are pH before, after monitoring and Soil moisture of soil before and
    after monitoring respectively Show All Fig. 12. Greenhouse implementation Show
    All Fig. 13. Control Page with various parameters. Show All Fig. 14. Real-time
    implementation of the system. Show All SECTION V. Conlusion The proposed system''s
    primary contribution is focused on maintaining the soil pH within the desired
    range. Users have the ability to set all relevant parameters using a mobile application.
    Additionally, all processing tasks carried out by the master unit are efficiently
    performed through edge computing. This ensures effective soil pH regulation and
    simplifies the greenhouse management process for users. Smart greenhouse monitoring
    using edge computing was tested in real time at Akshaya nursery near Gulur. As
    part of the proposed work, the master unit and slave unit both underwent successful
    design and testing. The master unit has the ability to control all greenhouse
    parameters, enabling thorough management. The data from the slave unit can be
    successfully updated to the cloud system, guaranteeing precise and real-time monitoring
    of the greenhouse environment. Two slave units are used to get the soil and environment
    conditions such as Soil pH, temperature, moisture, and light intensity. A master
    unit is used to control the different solenoid valves to let the different solutions
    flow into the plantation area to maintain the soil pH, moisture and control the
    artificial lighting according to requirements based on edge computing. A mobile
    application that allows users to manually change parameters based on plant type
    has also been developed. For quick and personalized control of greenhouse conditions,
    this app offers a user-friendly interface, with these developments able to automate
    the greenhouse, which improved plant growth and reduced manual labor. Edge computing
    eliminates processing delays in greenhouse automation systems by completing processes
    faster, typically within 3–4 minutes. This local data processing and decision-making
    reduces latency, enhancing efficiency andresponsiveness, allowing timely actions,
    and minimizing delaysin critical processes. Authors Figures References Keywords

  description: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that can be employed to
    monitor several sectors, mostly precision agriculture, where environmental data
    can be used to better manage resources, reduce costs, and improve the use of natural
    resources. This work proposes the application of cloud-based IoT for monitoring
    irrigation water in rice fields. Southern Brazil was chosen as a case study because
    it suffers from water pollution problems due to urban activities, coal mining,
    and the inflow of saline water into the Araranguá River estuary. All these factors
    can compromise the water quality for irrigation. The presence of salt in irrigation
    water can compromise rice growth, making its monitoring essential for successful
    cultivation. Currently, the rice farmer needs to travel to the riverbank to assess
    the water quality using a manual sensor. This procedure demands time and resources
    and is not always efficient. The technology helps indicate whether the water is
    of quality to irrigate crops, helping the farmers decide whether to use that water
    to irrigate their fields. The solution is based on low-cost wireless sensor network
    devices, with subsequent transmission of data from the gateway using the network
    mobile phone cloud. Data collected were also accessed by the smartphone through
    a mobile application. This system was implemented for testing in the Araranguá
    River estuary, southern Santa Catarina, Brazil. Also, it appears as an option
    for farmers who need to monitor the quality of the water channel of the crop,
    thus avoiding the loss and reduction in crop productivity because the system can
    be continuously monitored and show notifications to the user. The highlights of
    this work were prototyping a complete solution to help the farmer using a smartphone

    Turkiye SECTION I. Introduction The growing global population and the pressing
    need for increased food production present significant challenges for the agricultural
    sector. Conventional agricultural practices often lead to resource overutilization,
    waste generation, and inconsistent productivity. To address these issues, the
    fourth agricultural revolution is emerging, driven by precision farming, information
    and communication technology, and digital innovations such as 5G Networks, Internet
    of Things (IoT), Big Data, Blockchain, Digital Twin, and Artificial Intelligence.
    These advancements enable farmers to make better decisions using real-time data,
    reduce manual farm control, and develop cyber-physical management systems for
    improved efficiency and sustainability [1]. However, the agricultural sector also
    faces the impacts of sociopolitical and environmental factors, such as the Russia-Ukraine
    conflict and the Covid-19 pandemic, and climate change, which further underscore
    the need for transformative digital solutions in agriculture to ensure global
    food security and resilience. Smart Farming, so-called Agri 4.0 [2], is a data-driven
    approach to agriculture that leverages information and communication technologies
    to increase farming efficiency, productivity, and sustainability. It is based
    on collecting and analyzing real-time data from various sources such as weather,
    temperature, humidity, pH level, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight, such
    that farmers can make more informed decisions about planting, fertilizing, and
    harvesting. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) consist of diverse sensors responsible
    for sensing and data forwarding to facilitate the delivery of measurements to
    sink nodes or gateway. The implementation of WSN depends on the nature of the
    farming envitonment and communication requirements. For instace, ZigBee and LoRa
    are frequently employed WSN in outdoor areas due to their lower cost, low energy
    consumption, and good transmission range [3]. Bluetooth communication is widely
    used in indoor farms due to its limited transmission range [4]. RFID and NFC communication
    technologies are used in monitor assets in agricultural supply chain [5]. Apart
    from that, WiFi is not common for WSN due to its high costs and high energy usage;
    thereby does not holds much promise for agricultural uses [3]. Smart farming has
    the potential to revolutionize agriculture, but the lack of low-cost reliable
    and fast connectivity is limiting its potential. A high-speed network, such as
    5G, is essential for precision farming. By offering faster data transmission and
    supporting various applications, including Massive IoT, 5G networks can enhance
    WSN performance [6]. 5G technology can provide the high-speed, low-latency connectivity
    necessary to support smart farming and enable the widespread adoption of precision
    agriculture techniques. Fig. 1 shows 5G Network as a communication infrastructure
    for various process in precision agriculture. For instance, 5G Networks can provide
    connectivity to remote and rural areas, allowing farmers to access the technology
    and services. Moreover, 5G also support the deployment of autonomous vehicles,
    enabling farmers to optimize their operations and reduce costs. This study aims
    to investigate the potential challenges of and potential solutions for harnessing
    5G Networks for smart farming. The 5G mobile network employs a high-band spectrum
    to provide very high speed and minimal latency. Because of its higher bandwidth,
    5G can link billions of devices in addition to high data capacity and speeds faster
    than 10 Gbps. In terms of downloading and uploading speeds, 5G will outperform
    existing 4G and 4G LTE standards by up to 100 times. 5G can connect 1 million
    devices per square kilometre and is also enabled when devices travel at very high
    speeds (around 500 kmph). Another significant advantage of 5G is the ability to
    deliver latency as low as 1 ms, which eliminates the lagging connection issues
    that present in today’s network generation. Microwaves (MWs) cannot cover vast
    areas because they are used as carriers in the 5G network. The smallcell concept
    is introduced to provide seamless connectivity, in which small base stations are
    put approximately 250 m apart throughout coverage areas and can be expanded to
    any extent. To connect the bigger extents, the associated small towers can be
    placed anywhere (lamp posts, trees, roofs, car tops, etc.). Figure 4 shows how
    the 5G network is deployed in rural and urban areas, which may span any range.
    Benefits of using 5G are High capacity, Decreased latency, High connection density,
    High throughput, Improved spectral efficiency, Seamless connectivity, Wide coverage,
    Increased network energy efficiency. According to the ITU, the most recent 5G
    possibilities fall into three categories: enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive
    machine type communications (mMTC), and ultrareliable low latency communications
    (URLLC) [8]. In the case of eMBB, the primary goal is humancentric interaction
    performance metrics such as total user experience, whereas in the case of mMTC,
    the primary goals are high connection density, minimal battery consumption, low
    cost, and complexity. mMTC specialises in building and facility administration,
    logistics, smart/precision agriculture, fleet management, and other areas. Fig.
    1. 5G Network as a communication infrastructure for precision agriculture [7]
    Show All A. 5G in Agriculture Sector The current state of 5G application necessitates
    a description of the agricultural ecosystem, which has yet to see large-scale,
    commercial application due to the number of operational 5G networks that are still
    in construction. The development of communication network technology is primarily
    pushed by major mobile operators and micro-electronics companies in large-scale
    pilots such as IoF2020 [9]. However, they prioritise current technologies (e.g.,
    3G/4G) and particular IoT protocols (e.g., LoRaWAN, SigFox, NB-IoT) because they
    anticipate a return on investment. Small and medium-sized mobile operators are
    also interested in 5G, and they are not constrained by the need for a return on
    investment in existing technologies such as 3G and 4G. This could allow them to
    completely invest in 5G, while established companies will launch new business
    models in densely populated areas. They will first use existing technologies in
    rural areas with reduced population density. Because the proportion of rural regions
    that may have 5G coverage is expected to remain small, the potential market for
    global agricultural manufacturers to engage in costly 5G development is insufficient.
    Another component of the agrifood ecosystem is the general growth of AgTech, which
    is just getting started. According to AgFunder, the world’s agrifood tech start-ups
    raised a total of 26.1billionin2020,upfrom 19.8 billion in 2019 in 1858 deals
    and 2344 distinct investors, up from $2.9 billion in 2012. SECTION II. Challenges
    of using 5G Networks in Precision Agriculture A. Network Connectivity 5G technology
    in agriculture must address the lack of reliable network coverage and high-speed
    internet in many rural locations, which can severely hamper the efficiency and
    dependability of the technology. Poor connectivity can restrict farmers’ access
    to current information, which can have a big impact on crop yields, soil quality,
    and water usage. Additionally, data transfer may be interrupted or delayed, leading
    to erroneous data and inefficient technology use. Weak signals and limited access
    to data and services can also make it challenging to integrate 5G technology.
    B. Cost and Scalability The costs associated with the adoption of smart technologies
    and systems are the main impediment to the agricultural sector’s digitization.
    5G technology adoption in agriculture faces a number of challenges, such as the
    high cost of equipment, hardware installation, subscription to centralised networks
    and software packages, and periodic maintenance. Environmental, ethical, and social
    costs may also be linked with the deployment of smart systems. Most farms are
    located in sparsely populated regions. 5G can address scalability challenges by
    supporting a wide array of use cases and devices. Low-bandwidth wireless connectivity
    is suitable for rural areas, while high-speed connectivity is crucial for vertical
    farming. By leveraging data collected from IoT-enabled remote sensors, 5G-enabled
    precision farming enables farmers to effectively manage pests and diseases, as
    well as address climate change-related challenges. Network Scalability and comprehensive
    coverage require deploying a big number of WSN nodes and 5G base stations. Managing
    the scalability of these networks becomes a significant challenge which involves
    designing a hierarchical or mesh network architecture that allows for seamless
    expansion, scalability, and effective management of network resources. Achieving
    comprehensive coverage also demands synchronization between WSN nodes and 5G base
    stations. Time synchronization for various applications, includes coordinated
    data collection, event detection, and resource allocation. Synchronization protocols
    and techniques are needed to ensure accurate and synchronized operation across
    the network. C. Data Management Despite the potential benefits of 5G technology
    for agriculture, one obstacle to implementation is data management. The increasing
    volume, speed, and variety of data produced by 5G technology present significant
    problems for data management. In order to facilitate quick decision-making, the
    deployment of sensors and IoT devices, for instance, can result in substantial
    data volumes that must be processed and analyzed in real-time. A few examples
    of the types of data produced by 5G technology in agriculture are crop data, weather
    data, soil data, and operational data. One of the primary problems with data management
    in the implementation of 5G in agriculture is data integration. Among the data
    sources used by 5G technology in agriculture are sensors, IoT devices, drones,
    and autonomous vehicles. Data integration and analysis can be difficult due to
    the richness and diversity of the data, and data security and privacy must be
    guaranteed to avoid unauthorized access and data breaches. To enable smooth data
    administration and analysis, standardizing data formats and ensuring compatibility
    between various data sources are crucial. SECTION III. Apotential 5G-enabled Solutions
    for Precision Agriculture A. Use of Drones/UAV in Farming UAVs/drones are becoming
    increasingly popular in the agriculture sector, allowing farms and companies to
    increase crop yields, save time, and make land management decisions. They can
    perform both airborne and ground-based missions, and have different sensors for
    different purposes. Drones with multispectral imaging, thermal infrared imaging,
    hyperspectral, and lidar sensors are used to scan a large area for 3D mapping;
    counting plants; computing vegetation indices such as NDVI, CCCI, NDRE, MCARI,
    and CWSI; and capturing plant health, soil temperature, and water levels. Agricultural
    drones are typically used for low-altitude operations (below 120 m) and use a
    specific radio connection or Wi-Fi; as a result, they have a very restricted range
    of 3-7 km with a big transmitting antenna. With 5G technology, farmers can fly
    a drone over a large distance either manually or through programmed checkpoints,
    and technically, the drone can be controlled from anywhere in the world [10].
    The 5G cellular network enables farmers to receive real-time data from drones,
    such as high-definition video streams, as well as other critical sensory data
    and telemetry, quicker and more seamlessly than previous-generation mobile networks.
    Drones do not need a lot of computing power, and all data can be sent to the cloud
    for faster processing. Multiple drones can communicate with one another to provide
    synchronized autonomous flight over a geographical region and perform multiple
    tasks with minimal data transmission loss and energy consumption, allowing for
    extended airborne sensing time and cost-effective operation beyond the line of
    sight. Table I reviews some of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural
    operations. Most of the systems are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. TABLE I Different UAV based systems for Agriculture [5]
    B. Real time Monitoring Wireless sensors connected to the internet can measure
    environmental conditions such as humidity, temperature, luminosity, and soil moisture,
    allowing automated corrective action to be taken to maintain normal plant growth
    conditions. Agricultural data can be in various formats and requires compatibility
    with the relevant interfaces. Figure 5 shows an illustration of these sensors
    for real-time tracking. To monitor various farming parameters, Software programmes
    such as SmartElement, Pycno, Power BI, and Tableau are used to monitor farming
    parameters, while open-source platforms such as Thingsboard and Openfarm provide
    data gathering, visualization, device management, and other functions. A 5G cellular
    network can connect a massive number of sensors (1 million devices per square
    kilometer) to a single cellular tower, allowing farmers to install more IoT sensors
    to perform more tasks more efficiently. These sensors benefit from the minimal
    power transmission and reliability of 5G technology, allowing them to transmit
    data at reduced energy levels and avoid data re-transmission, increasing their
    lifetime. C. AI driven Robots AI and 5G technology enable live video monitoring,
    remote diagnostics, and on-site prescription, as well as stabilization of drones
    and robots by precisely controlling their parameters. AI in agriculture is expected
    to increase at a 25.5% CAGR between 2020 and 2026. (AI in Agriculture Market by
    Technology, 2020). Farming industries have started adopting robotic techniques
    to make farms autonomous saving labour costs and increasing efficiency of their
    farmlands, these autonomous robots use various navigation tools, image processing
    techniques and real-time control of physical extensions, these demands can be
    catered using 5G and Software defined networking(SDN) based edge computing [11].
    In recent years, agricultural robots have been used to plant various crop varieties
    autonomously across several acres of ground. AI powered robots are used to precisely
    identify and eliminate weeds across a given area without harming crops. The different
    kinds of AI powered robots are displayed in Figure 7. An example of this is an
    autonomous potato weed control project leveraging 5G , which uses cameras on a
    vehicle and a deep learning algorithm on an on-board computer. The detection is
    a time-consuming and data-intensive process that requires expensive hardware.
    Offloading these operations to a nearby infrastructure (cloud computing) lowers
    expenses and energy consumption of electric drive robots, allowing them to operate
    for longer periods of time in the field.. You can see the robot by Agrointelli
    in Figure 6. Fig. 2. General 5G and Iot Architecture [7] Show All An outdoor demonstration
    with pre-5G connectivity worked well. More than 90% of the volunteer potato was
    properly detected and sprayed, while only 5% of the primary crop sugar beet was
    incorrectly sprayed. The results obtained were an uplink bandwidth of 120 Mbps
    and a latency of 25 ms (upload pictures, processing images, and getting plant
    locations) [12]. D. Energy-saving Techniques The scarcity and high cost of energy
    in agricultural and rural sectors necessitate the use of energy-efficient devices,
    such as low-power 5G gadgets. These devices not only reduce energy use but also
    enhance dependability, since they are less prone to power outages. Additionally,
    5G-powered wireless sensor network (WSN) sensors consume minimal energy, enabling
    them to operate for extended periods without recharging. This approach significantly
    minimizes the need for costly repairs in remote locations. Energy-saving techniques
    like Beamforming can further optimize energy use by reducing the number of base
    stations needed in rural areas. This technology bolsters signal strength and diminishes
    interference. Utilizing a generalized version of the Lloyd algorithm, it was demonstrated
    that Beamforming could maintain a quality of service of 50Mbps for 95% of users
    during peak hours [14], thus lessening the requirement for additional base stations.
    This strategic decrease in base stations reduces not only the costs associated
    with their installation but also energy consumption and waste, contributing to
    an environmentally sustainable model by lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Considerations
    must include power usage, the feasibility of energy harvesting techniques, and
    the availability of power sources in the target area. Focusing on battery life
    optimization, the incorporation of renewable energy sources, and effective power
    distribution is crucial to the success of this endeavor. Fig. 3. General 5G and
    Iot Architecture [13] Show All E. Autonomous Farming 5G provides ultra-low latency
    communication which is critical for real time control and autonomous management
    of farms. 5G-connected robots in a farm can perform actions such as harvesting
    or fertilization applications accurately and efficiently. Another advantage of
    5G is the higher bandwidth due to which a large amount of data which is generated
    by various sensors in the field can be collected and transmitted to edge computing
    which is data being locally processed instead of a centralized cloud server. This
    ensures all data is collected and analyzed in real time. 5G also supports network
    slicing which allows different resources to be allocated to different parts of
    the network based on the specific requirements of each application. This can help
    ensure that the autonomous vertical farm’s control systems have the necessary
    resources to operate properly. Overall almost all the basic advantages of 5G like
    low latency, high bandwidth and network slicing helps IoT enabled farms immensely,
    reducing costs and increasing yield. A study from ONFarm found that farms aided
    by IoT enabled devices had almost 1.75% increase in yield and energy saving of
    almost 17-32 dollars per hectors, additionally water used for irrigation also
    was reduced by 8% [15]. This shows a significant amount of reduction in resources
    used and increase in profitability. F. Faster and Reliable Communication 5G networks
    are essential for real-time monitoring and precision management of agricultural
    systems. They can provide extremely low latency communications, allowing farmers
    to collect data on soil moisture, temperature, and other variables and make immediate
    adjustments to irrigation, fertilizer application, and other inputs. Additionally,
    5G networks can provide high bandwidth, allowing for the transfer of large amounts
    of data generated by precision agriculture systems. This data can be analyzed
    in real-time to provide accurate and timely insights into crop health, soil conditions,
    and other factors that affect crop growth and yield. 5G networks also support
    the use of predictive analytics, which can be used to forecast crop yields, identify
    potential crop diseases or pests, and optimize resource allocation based on anticipated
    demand. This can help reduce waste, improve sustainability, and increase profitability
    [16]. Drones and other connected devices can use LEO satellite allowing crucial
    data to be analyzed quickly. Integrating satellites with 5G infrastructure improves
    the Quality of Experience (QoE) of high capacity applications. Drones with NDVI
    sensors may gather information on the health and development of plants, and 5G
    networks can be used to send that information to computers for analysis. By enabling
    edge computing, 5G can also aid NDVI. In order to use edge computing, data must
    be processed locally, near to the point of collection, rather than being sent
    to a central server for analysis. Edge computing enables in-the-moment analysis
    of NDVI data, giving quick insights into the health and development of plants.
    This is especially helpful in precision farming, where quick action may be required
    to increase yields and decrease waste. Precision agriculture typically covers
    vast areas, and thus ensuring reliable network coverage in all parts of the agricultural
    fields is a game-changer. One of the primary determinants for the optimal placement
    of WSN nodes and 5G base stations involves geographical constraints, signal propagation
    characteristics, obstacles, and coverage requirements. Strategic planning should
    involve careful site surveys, predictive modelling, and simulation tools to identify
    suitable locations for deployment. Coexistence between WSN nodes and 5G base stations
    introduces interference issues as both systems operate in the same frequency range.
    Careful planning mitigate interference and ensure reliable communication. Techniques
    like frequency planning, power control, and spatial separation are employed to
    manage interference effectively. SECTION IV. Case Study:Deep learning-base Classification
    of Fruits Early plant disease detection is economically vital. Computer vision
    and machine learning technologies can detect and treat infections early, reducing
    disease spread and increasing cure rates. Over 374 million fruits are harvested
    annually; in 2011, 50–55% of these were grown in Asia [17]. Fruit appearance influences
    customer choices and varies depending on the place of sale. (hawkers, shop, malls,
    etc.). Most fruits are packaged by hand, which reduces quality and increases labour
    costs. Given the enormous increase in fruit production, an accurate classification
    method is vital; manpower demands must be reduced and efficiency increased [4].
    Machine-learning approaches are replacing traditional methods of fruit classification,
    such as gas sensors, infrared imaging, and liquid chromatography, which require
    skilled operators and costly equipment. Fruit classification based on images requires
    only a digital camera and an efficient model. The neural network (NN)-based artificial
    bee colony (ABC) algorithm was used to classify four types of fruits, with an
    accuracy of 76.39% [18]. A hybrid technique using an enhanced fitness-scaled chaotic
    ABC, feedforward NNs, and an optimized genetic algorithm had an accuracy of 87.9%
    [19]. Two-step classification extracted shape, color, and texture data that were
    fed to a fast NN trained by a biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm.
    Principal component analysis (PCA) had a classification accuracy of 89.11% when
    applied to 18 different fruits [19]. Fruit Classification Framework have infrastructure,
    resource engine, and data engine layers. A device sublayer, a \"local edge cache
    unit,\" MEC orchestrators, and RANs are all part of the infrastructure layer.
    MECs and RANs distribute resources to end consumers. The resource engine layer
    optimises network resources for efficient transmission. For optimization, self-organizing
    networks (SONs), network function virtualization (NFV), and software-defined networks
    (SDNs) are used. Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) methods can be used
    to preprocess data, extract features, and categorise objects. The overall structure
    of our model is illustrated in figure 8 Fig. 4. General 5G and Iot Architecture
    [19] Show All Mobile phones with cameras record images or video frames, which
    are saved locally and then transferred via 5G to the local edge cache unit. The
    layer of the resource engine optimizes resources by learning about network factors
    such as communication quality, data flow, and network type. When large amounts
    of data must be transferred but bandwidth is limited, this is crucial for green
    communication. The resource engine layer has an impact on 5G reliability, scalability,
    and adaptability as well. The data engine layer transfers images to data centres
    using 5G technology and has a hybrid DL design for identifying and classifying
    fruits the pretrained VGG19 model and the pyramid histogram of oriented gradient
    (PHOG) feature extraction method are used in the architecture. A flow chart of
    the fruit classification process is shown in figure 9. This hybrid classification
    technique uses 5G and cloud technology to classify fruits by combining a DCNN
    model with PHOG features. This effort to combine DCNN and PHOG features for fruit
    classification using 5G technology and the Internet of Things performed significantly
    better than presently available classifiers. Fig. 5. General 5G and Iot Architecture
    [19] Show All SECTION V. Conclusion Agriculture is one of the most important industries
    that could benefit from 5G networks, but the use of 5G in agriculture is in its
    early stages. To make things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, the
    issues raised in Section 6 must be resolved. Government efforts, grants and endowments,
    public-private partnerships, data openness, and regional research work can help
    in dealing with possible challenges. Advances in AI, analytics, and connected
    sensors technologies can help increase yields, improve efficiency, and build sustainability
    and resilience in precision agriculture [20]. The global precision farming market
    is expected to expand at a significant rate, reaching a value of USD 17,110.46
    million by 2028 [21]. As world’s population is increasing precision agriculture
    can help meet the growing demand for food while preserving resources, while 5G
    can help overcome labour shortages. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Jalandhar, India SECTION 1 Introduction By
    the year 2050, it was estimated that the global population would reach 9.1 billion.
    The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has declared that
    food production needs to be increased by 70% to sustain the growing global population.
    [1]. Cultivation is the primary occupation for around 60% of the world''s population,
    making agriculture one of the important sectors of human society. The largest
    population of India is engaged in agriculture, but they are not advanced and modernized.
    They do not have the skills to use technology in the field. They can get efficient
    control and yield by updating agriculture methods by using the newest technologies.
    As smart agriculture technologies continue to advance, the volume of data generated
    from various sensors is escalating with each passing day. Given the vast quantities
    of data that must be managed, novel techniques are necessary, and PDS is an efficient
    approach to handling such immense volumes of data. The time complexity associated
    with inserting and querying data using Bloom Filter (BF), a type of PDS, makes
    it an ideal choice for handling such data efficiently. The utilization of BF can
    aid farmers in making informed decisions regarding crop yield production, among
    other benefits. PDS holds promise in mitigating a multitude of challenges associated
    with scalability, data variety, redundancy, privacy, accuracy, and more. The plan
    of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides the introduction to smart agriculture.
    In Section 3, there is an introduction to Probabilistic data structure. Types
    of PDS and their applications are also discussed in this section. Section 4 provides
    the need for PDS in smart agriculture. Section 5 discusses some use cases of PDS
    in smart agriculture. Section 6 provides research opportunities and challenges.
    Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper. SECTION 2 Smart Agriculture Technologies
    have tremendous advancements in different sectors in India, but the advancement
    is very less in the field of agriculture. We all know that India has the largest
    cultivation land. Most of the people living in India depend on agriculture, which
    is India''s largest sector. The share of agriculture in GDP is increasing year
    by year The agriculture sector of the country experienced a growth of 3.6% and
    3.9% in Gross Value Added (GVA) during the years 2020–21 and 2021–22, respectively
    [2]. In today''s world, IoT has greatly changed agriculture, using drones, sensors,
    satellite data, and many more. With the advancement in information and communication
    technologies, our farmers can collect great and useful information from fields.
    Besides this advancement, our farmers were still dependent on traditional methods.
    Due to the absence of field monitoring capabilities, farmers are resorting to
    conventional methods for irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application,
    unaware of their fields'' condition. Consequently, these factors are impeding
    crop growth and causing decreased production. Employing scientific approaches
    to enhance farming practices, resulting in increased crop production and improved
    efficiency [3]. Good quality food and farming production rely heavily on the judicious
    application of fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation. The agriculture sector
    has witnessed numerous advancements through the adoption of automated systems,
    where modern technologies oversee all the tasks [4]. 2.1 Technologies Used in
    Smart Agriculture Semi-Automatic Robots Using semi-automated robots, we can reduce
    the cost of pesticides. Detection of weeds and spraying pesticides on plants can
    also reduce the damage. Robotics can be used for lifting and irrigation purposes
    also. We can reduce the cost of automation by using solar-powered semi-automated
    robots [5]. Besides the growth of automation in different sectors, farmers are
    not accepting robots in agriculture, because agriculture robots are immature and
    not grown in this sector. Drones Uncrewed aerial vehicles are named drones, used
    in industries for surveillance purposes. Army, mining, hobbyists, and construction
    are some of the industries where drones are used now. But in today''s world, these
    technologies are widely used in different sectors of agriculture [6]. This technology
    is not accepted in the Indian agriculture sector because of the risk associated
    with drones. Pesticides spraying and field surveillance are some of the tasks
    which can be done by drones, and they set a milestone in the agriculture sector
    by increasing production. Fig. 1. Smart agriculture concept [7]. Show All Smart
    Remote Sensing Analytical tools analyze data gathered by sensors, such as weather
    stations deployed in farms. The crops'' temperature, humidity, size, shape, and
    light fluctuations were monitored with the help of sensors [8]. Utilizing the
    data collected by sensors, including temperature, dew detection, humidity, and
    moisture precipitation, can assist in cultivating appropriate crops. That data
    will help in determining the weather patterns and conditions on farms. Farmers
    can opt for the beneficial type of cultivation and adjust the amount of water
    for irrigation because of the analyzed data on soil quality which helps in getting
    drier areas of farms, acidity, nutrient value, and soil damage capacity. The Conversion
    of the detected physical quantity into an electrical signal is done with the help
    of sensors. Sensors play a crucial role in simplifying the process for controllers
    to comprehend [9]. Wireless Sensor Network Sensors can transmit data to servers
    through wireless sensor networks with the help of IoT devices as various communication
    standards are introduced in the market. Latency, power consumption, range, efficiency,
    and bandwidth are some of the parameters upon which one can select a protocol
    for communication [10]. The contemporary application of wireless sensor networks
    involves the collection and dissemination of data obtained from sensors situated
    on agricultural land. The data collected by sensors will play a vital role in
    monitoring agriculture parameters. Nevertheless, the abundance of information
    can pose challenges to the decision-making process, despite the availability of
    vast amounts of data from multiple sensors. Our analytics capabilities are unable
    to efficiently process the data, making it challenging to arrive at the best possible
    decision [11], [12]. The primary function of WSN is to enable wireless transmission
    of data from remote locations, facilitating task monitoring by receivers through
    the received information. Distribution of data collected from agricultural land
    and informing farmers about the real-time information so that they can increase
    production is done with the help of WSN [13] technology in the agriculture sector.
    SECTION 3 Probabilistic Data Structure Data production is experiencing exponential
    growth in today''s world, owing to the increasing use of IoT and other advanced
    technologies. Handling a massive amount of data is not that much easy. Traditional
    techniques may be producing accurate results after processing, but there are barriers
    to time and space. We are shifting from the traditional data structure to PDS
    for storing and retrieving large and huge amounts of data. After processing data,
    PDS is giving us an approximate solution, that was not a definite answer and may
    be correct or not, but it was in the right way of estimation. PDS is reducing
    the space and time problem, because of some probabilistic components as compared
    with the correct answer-giving data structure. Storing non-structural data, processing
    big data, predicting approximate results and fast retrieval are some of the applications
    where PDS is important. Hash functions are utilized in PDS because they possess
    the unique property of disregarding collisions and maintaining a constant key
    size [14]. Easy parallelization, less memory requirement, and high query processing
    speed are some the of different features of PDS [15]. 3.1 PDS is Used in Different
    Scenarios as Follows Membership Query Approximation The conventional techniques
    for filtering and analyzing a vast volume of data in real-time scenarios are not
    effective. Real-time applications heavily rely on the capability to store, query,
    and update billions of data elements efficiently. Due to the substantial size
    of the data, the processing cost for even a small query can be quite high. As
    a result, when dealing with significant quantities of data, it is essential to
    use large data structures to ensure efficient processing. When we see these many
    problems with large data, we get to know that efficient and applicable searching
    and storage methods are needed to process big data. The usage of Probabilistic
    methods and approximation approaches can help in the query process where efficiency
    has higher priority than accuracy. In application, membership query approximation
    is used where probabilistic results can work and store bulk data in small spaces
    and efficiently answers the membership query [14]. Frequency Count In a real-time
    application where a set of duplicate values is given and counting the frequency
    of each value is required. Absolute frequency and frequent values can be estimated
    accurately, by getting rare values that are unspecific. If there is a need for
    rapid processing and frequency count must be addressed within sub-linear space,
    then an approximate response may be deemed satisfactory. Counter-based and sketches
    are the two ways in which we can do approximate frequent counting. Majority algorithms
    [16], Space saving [17], Lossy counting [18], and Frequent approximation algorithms
    are some of the categories of counter-based solutions, where probabilistic counting
    methods and counters are used. Computational time and memories are some of the
    fixed resources which were used in sub-linear space. Count Sketch [19] and Count-Min
    Sketch [20] are some of the categories of sketches where approximation-based methods
    and hashing are used to map a large amount of data set into small spaces. Cardinality
    Estimation Cardinality (the count of time data has come in a data set) is an important
    factor when there is a large amount of data that is dynamic and unknown data to
    be analyzed. The computational expense of accurately determining the cardinality
    in multi-sets is substantial, as it is directly proportional to the size of the
    extensive dataset. MinCount [21], LogLog [22], Probabilistic counting [23], and
    HyperLogLog [24] are some of the probabilistic cardinality estimators, which are
    used to determine approximate cardinality. By leveraging hash functions to achieve
    randomization, it is possible to achieve significant cost reduction and memory
    utilization as compared to the exact output-giving methods. Bit-pattern observables
    (BPO) and Statistical Probability Methods (SPM) are two basic approaches for probabilistic
    estimators. Several techniques utilize the principles of Bit-pattern observables
    (BPO) to approximate the cardinality of a dataset. These techniques, such as Hyper
    LogLog counter, Probabilistic Counting, and LogLog counter, involve hashing and
    observing certain patterns of bits to arrive at a conclusion based on a single
    pattern. By applying the principles of Statistical Probability Methods, techniques
    like the Approximate Counting Algorithm and MinCount can be utilized to estimate
    the cardinality of a dataset through statistical analysis. Similarity Search To
    determine the similarity between two datasets and group items into specific classes,
    it may be necessary to check all items in a dataset and identify the closest ones.
    Cosine and sine similarity measures, Pearson''s similarity coefficient, hamming
    distance, and Jaccard''s similarity coefficient are some of the mathematical solutions
    for checking similarity search with the help of distance between objects [25].
    Applying brute force and linear search techniques to find similar items in a sizable
    database can lead to an exponential surge in computational complexity. Although
    these techniques may be effective for searching in small datasets, the challenges
    of big data and large dataset storage, representation, and pair-wise comparison
    of billions of items in a multi-dimensional dataset are the main obstacles [26].
    To solve this problem, we will use an approximation algorithm to handle a large
    data set. Data analysts frequently employ hash functions and trees to estimate
    the similarity between items in a dataset by measuring the proximity of the elements.
    3.1 Types of Probabilistic Data Structure Bloom Filter Bloom filter was the name
    of Burton H. Bloom who introduced it in 1970 [27]. Due to its probabilistic model,
    Bloom Filter (BF) is an effective random data structure that is highly efficient
    for membership queries in large datasets. BF is the combination of 0 initialized
    m bit array and k hash functions. By using k hash functions, we can get the position
    of the element in the array and insert that into an array. Once the hash function
    has been applied to an array, the resulting bit is used to index the array and
    store the corresponding element. To check the membership of that element whether
    it was part of a set or not we have processed the query. We will get the approximate
    result after checking the corresponding index of that element. The answer is “maybe”
    or “definitely not”. We get a “maybe” answer when all the bits are set high for
    that element. If at least one of them is not set high, then we will get the answer
    as “definitely not”. We will get false positives as well in BF. As it is not sure
    whether that element was part of the data set or not. BF is space efficient, but
    it comes with the cost of false positives. To decrease the occurrence of false
    positives, increasing the number and randomness of hash functions can be effective.
    By doing so, the probability of collision decreases. The implementation of a hash
    function using bitwise ‘OR’ and ‘AND’ results in a processing time of O(k) for
    an element, where k denotes the number of hash functions [27]–[29]. Count-Min
    Sketch G. Cormode and S. Muthukrishna introduced a probabilistic data structure
    that uses a sublinear space in 2003 [30]. Count-min sketch (CMS) is a streaming
    algorithm that was later improved in 2005 [31]. One application of Count-Min Sketch
    (CMS) is to optimize the counting of the frequency of an element in a large data
    set. Like Bloom Filter (BF), CMS also depends on hashing. However, unlike BF,
    CMS stores elements and their count like a histogram. CMS utilizes 2-dimensional
    arrays to handle a given data set, while BF uses only 1-dimensional arrays. BF
    is used to represent the hashed value while CMS is used to represent the hashed
    value and count of the elements as well. It is based on the ‘sketch’ method because
    of the summarization of a larger data set. When compared to counting Bloom Filters,
    which have lower time and space complexity, Count-Min Sketch (CMS) can provide
    more precise cardinality estimation due to its probabilistic component. CMS consists
    of a 2-D array ( d ∗ w ) where d is the number of hash functions and w is used
    to store counts. We can''t use BF for cardinality estimation because the number
    of collisions will increase, and the false positive rate also get more. CMS supports
    the union operation of cells, and it has O(k) query processing time. Locality-Sensitive
    Hashing In 1998, Indyk and Motwani proposed Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH),
    which utilizes low-dimensional space instead of high-dimensional data. The key
    idea behind LSH is to minimize the probability of collisions between hash functions.
    Therefore, it is crucial to choose hash functions carefully. [32]. In LSH we find
    places for two objects called buckets and there will be a collision when two objects
    fall into the same bucket [33]. LSH works in three phases those are pre-processing,
    hash generation, and similarity searchIn LSH, the data is mapped into a lower
    dimensional space using various techniques during the pre-processing phase. Then,
    hash tables are generated by computing hash functions during the hash generation
    phase. Finally, in the similarity search phase, the hash tables are utilized to
    identify identical items and verify their similarity. LSH is a technique that
    distributes data into n buckets, with the same items falling into the same bucket
    [33]. Depending on the universal data mapping number of variants of LSH were proposed.
    Quotient Filter Michael Bender and his team introduced a Quotient filter (QF)
    in 2011 as a memory-efficient solution for testing element membership [34]. QF
    allows for the testing of elements while using less memory compared to others.
    “Delete”, “Add”, “Is a member”, and “Is, not a member” are four basic operations
    that were performed. QF employs a single hash function with the size of p bits
    to generate fingerprints. These fingerprints are then utilized to test element
    membership in a memory-efficient manner. Quotient and remainder are calculated
    for the insertion of an element in QF. QF provided two distinct responses to the
    membership query for an element in a set: one indicating a high likelihood of
    membership (“probably yes”), and the other indicating a certain non-membership
    (“definitely not”). One may not find an element in a set even if QF gives a positive
    result due to probability. There is a trade-off between false positives and storage
    space; increasing the size of the filter reduces false positives but requires
    more storage space [35]. To increase the speed of answering a query in the storage
    system an Approximate Member Query (AMQ) filter is used in QF. There is a large
    use of proxy data in QF to update, delete and insert. Fig. 2. Types of probabilistic
    data structure [13] Show All SECTION 4 Need for Probabilistic Data Structure in
    Smart Agriculture A large amount of data is collected in smart agriculture from
    different sources such as aerial imagery, weather sensors, GPS-enabled tractors,
    and soil moisture sensors. By analyzing data from various sources such as soil
    conditions, weather patterns, and plant health, farmers can make informed decisions
    about crop management tasks such as deciding the ideal time for fertilization,
    harvesting crops, and watering. It is very important to have an efficient data
    structure to store and handle data. Efficient algorithms are crucial for making
    effective decisions when processing and analyzing data. PDS is a multifaceted
    tool capable of performing tasks such as data summarization, retrieval, and compression,
    among others. Because PDS provides efficient storage and processing of data even
    when data is incomplete or uncertain. PDS can provide estimated data if the weather
    station goes offline or the sensor gives noisy readings. PDS, like Hyper Loglog
    and Bloom filters, can help agriculture by efficiently managing large amounts
    of data with low memory usage and fast query processing. To estimate the frequency
    of that particular crop grown in that area, Count-Min Sketch will be used. PDS
    is crucial for analyzing crop patterns and identifying areas with high production
    potential and vulnerability to specific diseases, helping farmers make informed
    decisions for better agricultural outcomes. In addition, PDS will be useful to
    find relationships and patterns in the data that are helpful to predict future
    conditions. A farmer finds the possibility of drought in upcoming seasons and
    adjusts irrigation plans according to that data with the help of historical weather
    data that comes through PDS. Even in the face of a large amount of data and uncertainty
    farmers can make productive decisions with the help of PDS. PDS is crucial in
    smart agriculture as it provides precise and effective results while handling
    vast amounts of data. For productive and sustainable agriculture PDS is a valuable
    tool that allows improved accuracy, real-time decision-making, and scalability.
    Farmers can make data-driven and estimated decisions by using PDS. With the help
    of PDS, farmers can reduce costs, improve yield and optimize crop production.
    SECTION 5 Use Cases of Probabilistic Data Structures in Agriculture Because of
    their space efficiency, scalability, improved accuracy, and real-time decision-making
    properties, PDS are very useful in smart agriculture for different applications.
    Here we listed some of them: Crop Yield Production Soil moisture, rainfall data,
    and temperature are some of the factors on which farmers can estimate crop yield
    production with the help of PDS, such as count-min sketches and bloom filters.
    Farmers can make informed decisions with the help of the estimated data provided
    by PDS about their yield optimization and crop production. Soil Health Monitoring
    PDS such as Hyper Loglog can be used for monitoring soil health by determining
    the overall health of the soil and counting the number of different soil microbes.
    To decide the best pesticide treatment and fertilizer for the crops the estimated
    or approximated information from PDS will be utilized. Management of Predictive
    Disease and Pest PDS such as Bloom filter can be used in the management of predictive
    pests and diseases. Bloom filter can store the previous data about the pest and
    diseases, the result can be predicted using different hash functions. To migrate
    and prevent the spread of diseases and pests targeted treatment can be developed
    using the approximated information produced by the bloom filter. Management of
    Supply Chain Agricultural supply chain can be monitored and tracked with the use
    of PDS. The supply chain of agricultural products includes the transportation
    of livestock and crops, quality, and origin. SECTION 6 Research Opportunities
    and Challenges in Smart Agriculture Smart agriculture is experiencing swift expansion,
    driven by the adoption of cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, data
    analytics, and IoT devices. This development is geared towards promoting agricultural
    production sustainability and productivity. Effectively analyzing and processing
    massive amounts of data collected from different sources to optimize agricultural
    operations is one of the major challenges in smart agriculture. PDS, including
    Count-Min Sketches, Bloom filters, and Quotient filters, enable accurate and efficient
    data analysis and processing to overcome associated challenges with large data.
    The application of PDS presents various research opportunities and challenges
    in the field of smart agriculture, as outlined below: Data Accuracy and Reliability
    Access to reliable and diverse data is crucial for informed decision-making in
    smart agriculture. Researching the effectiveness of different PDS, such as bloom
    filters and Count-Min Sketch, can bolster the credibility of data. This will ultimately
    improve the overall data quality in agriculture and facilitate more informed decision-making.
    Scalability As the use of sensors, IoT devices, and technologies continues to
    rise in smart agriculture, the generation of large data sets is becoming increasingly
    common. Previous data handling, storage, and retrieval technologies are inefficient,
    increasing computational costs and overhead, and failing to meet expectations.
    Improvement of smart agriculture requires research to address the gap in developing
    efficient algorithms and structures that can handle massive data and assess the
    scalability of PDS. Some more research needs to be done to develop some data sets
    and models that can do the task efficiently in less time and with computational
    overhead. Filtration of Sensor Data Smart agriculture faces various challenges
    related to the collection of massive data by sensors and IoT devices. These challenges
    include concerns over user acceptance, privacy, security, ethics, and data format.
    Additionally, there may be compatibility issues between data and information.
    The presence of noise in the collected data, such as redundant and irrelevant
    information is also an issue. The issue of missing values and noise, which leads
    to corrupted signals and significant performance reduction in sensors, must be
    resolved before analyzing the data further. Effective filtration of sensor data
    in agriculture may require research into the use of PDS such as bloom filters.
    Data Processing Needs to be Energy-Efficient Smart agriculture is being ushered
    in by the growing adoption of IoT devices and sensors. Due to the high energy
    consumption of IoT devices, it is necessary to implement energy resource management.
    Research needs to proceed in this field to create an effective mechanism, which
    can help to reduce the use of energy and help us to create a sustainable environment.
    Volume Data Data sets are very big in size, and it is difficult to handle this
    large amount of data using traditional storage and processing technologies. New
    technologies are being developed to efficiently process and keep count of big
    data using PDS and existing methods like Relational Database Management Systems
    (RDBMS). Further research is required to improve computational efficiency and
    accuracy of results using new data structures at run time. Real-Time Response
    and Data Processing One of the main challenges in smart agriculture is real-time
    response processing and analysis. Response time must be less in the real scenario
    so that farmers can make informed decisions and take timely actions. Efficiency
    is lacking with traditional approaches and technologies in smart agriculture when
    responding to the handling of streaming data or the analysis and processing of
    massive amounts of information. So, some research is needed in technologies and
    data structures that can handle and provide real-time results. PDS can be used
    to perform real-time data analysis and help farmers to make informed decisions.
    Variety of Data In smart agriculture, data is collected from various sources including
    images, text, audio, and videos that may be in different formats. This information
    is gathered using sensors and IoT devices. The presence of various data types
    poses a significant challenge as the information collected from these sources
    may lack structure, have partial structure, or contain ambiguous information.
    There is a need for new technologies that can handle this data and can provide
    efficient results because traditional technologies were not that effective. The
    management of diverse data requires the implementation of innovative data structures
    and algorithms, such as Bloom filters and Quotient filters. Analysis of Data Distribution
    and Collection In smart agriculture, there is a massive amount of data flow. Streaming
    data that combines weather data, soil moisture, and temperature sensor data can
    encounter issues such as access problems and delays in delivery. Power consumption,
    irrigation requirement, and weather prediction are some of the decisions based
    on this type of data. New technologies and mechanisms are needed for effective
    and efficient result delivery because traditional systems have various limitations.
    Integration with Other Technologies By incorporating advanced technologies such
    as artificial intelligence and machine learning, PDS can be integrated to enhance
    efficiency and performance in the domain of smart agriculture. By integrating
    this technology, the data analysis process in the agriculture industry can be
    made more efficient, leading to improved accuracy in predictions and better decision-making
    capabilities. Conducting research in the field of smart agriculture is necessary
    to develop innovative approaches for utilizing probability data structures and
    exploring the potential of integrating these technologies. Privacy and Security
    The importance of privacy and security considerations in smart agriculture has
    been emphasized by the increasing utilization of IoT devices, sensors, and new
    technologies. For ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive agricultural
    data some research can be conducted to develop new algorithms and data structures.
    Research can be conducted to evaluate the privacy and security implications of
    different PDS in the context of smart agriculture. SECTION 7 Conclusion The consensus
    among experts in the field of smart agriculture is that PDS are indispensable
    tools for achieving optimal efficiency and accuracy, as a result of thorough consideration
    and analysis. To enhance production while minimizing costs and avoiding harm,
    farmers can leverage approximate and filtered data to detect weather and soil
    conditions, among other factors. Agricultural land is based on information gathered
    with the help of a sensor because irrigation, fertilization, and cultivation depend
    on experience. Using PDS farmers can plan irrigation, fertilization, and the cultivation
    of crops based on the estimated information given by them after process and analysis.
    To create a sustainable environment, farmers can observe weather trends, adjust
    irrigation practices accordingly, and save on costs. By analyzing weather patterns,
    farmers can plan their farming practices in a more sustainable manner with the
    help of PDS. However, PDS in the domain of smart agriculture also overcome many
    limitations and challenges which include space, energy, time, security, and privacy
    of agriculture data. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

  description: Agriculture depends heavily on irrigation. It is no longer necessary
    to rely on someone to do irrigation while we are away or every time when there
    is a need of watering the crops, due to technology advancement. Many researchers
    have attempted the automated watering of crops but accuracy, timeliness and cost
    issues are rarely handled as well as prioritized. The suggested method uses a
    wireless sensor network, real-time sensors, and irrigation system control to carry
    out autonomous watering which leads to smart irrigation. This technique aids in
    keeping the necessary water in the container and reduces waste. With automated
    irrigation, the soil's moisture, type of crop and weather conditions, these all
    three parameters determine whether the requirement of the water to the crops instead
    of only considering soil moisture. Machine learning method like logistic regression
    can be used to forecast the requirement of water by considering above three parameters.
    The arduino based IoT circuitry is used to pass the information of three mentioned
    parameters based on values of which, the logistic regression model predicts the
    watering requirements of the plants. The approach described is useful from the
    point of view of accuracy, timeliness and cost.

    depends heavily on irrigation. It is no longer necessary to rely on someone to
    do irrigation while we are away or every time when there is a need of watering
    the crops, due to technology advancement. Many researchers have attempted the
    automated watering of crops but accuracy, timeliness and cost issues are rarely
    handled as well as prioritized. The suggested method uses a wireless sensor network,
    real-time sensors, and irrigation system control to carry out autonomous watering
    which leads to smart irrigation. This technique aids in keeping the necessary
    water in the container and reduces waste. With automated irrigation, the soil''s
    moisture, type of crop and weather conditions, these all three parameters determine
    whether the requirement of the water to the crops instead of only considering
    soil moisture. Machine learning method like logistic regression can be used to
    forecast the requirement of water by considering above three parameters. The arduino
    based IoT circuitry is used to pass the information of three mentioned parameters
    based on values of which, the logistic regression model predicts the watering
    requirements of the plants. The approach described is useful from the point of
    view of accuracy, timeliness and cost. Published in: 2023 4th International Conference

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Belgaum, India SECTION I. Introduction Water
    must be planned, produced, protected, managed, and most importantly used responsibly
    because it is a valuable and rare natural resource that is also essential to life.
    Due to rising demands and finite supplies, farms must manage their water resources
    as efficiently as possible. In order to produce crops at their full potential
    and satisfy future food production needs, crop yields must be increased in areas
    with scarce water resources. To effectively irrigate more land with the same amount
    of water from the restricted source [1]. The act of artificially watering plants
    in a regulated manner at regular periods of time is known as irrigation [2]. There
    are many different kinds of automatic irrigation systems, including Global System
    for Mobile Communications (GSM)-based automatic irrigation systems, solar-powered
    automatic irrigation systems, and soil moisture content sensors [3]. Every form
    of irrigation system has unique advantages and disadvantages. As an illustration,
    the Automated Irrigation System on Detecting Soil Moisture Content system tracked
    and managed the irrigation status based on the moisture content of the soil. Users
    cannot access the plant''s online status, however, as the component is not network-connected.
    While a solar-powered auto irrigation system is beneficial for reducing electrical
    energy usage, it may not function well during the rainy season or in the absence
    of sunshine, especially in arctic nations. A global network connecting society
    through information and communication technology is known as the Internet of Things
    (IoT). It makes it possible for services to link real and virtual objects. Via
    the link, real-time data can be sent between the two objects. IoT technologies
    are progressively being applied to almost every aspect of daily life. As an illustration,
    customers can effortlessly turn on and off their home''s fan using their Smartphone,
    wherever they are. The Internet of Things has been used in agriculture as well
    as for home automation. Crop monitoring and irrigation can both be greatly facilitated
    by IoT. If we consider the scenario of urban side, then urban gardening is becoming
    more popular among some people, such as city dwellers, from time to time. For
    a healthy lifestyle, these people are interested in growing their own affordable,
    organic fresh food. The COVID-19 epidemic may possibly have disrupted the food
    supply system in several nations. Consequently, urban gardening may offer simple
    daily access to fresh produce, enhancing food security and promoting enriched
    and balanced meals [4]. Currently, the majority of individuals water their plants
    by hand. However, carrying out hand irrigation has a number of drawbacks. First
    of all, if someone has a busy day or week, they cannot be expected to water their
    plant. For the plant to live and flourish, it needs a steady supply of water.
    The plant''s development and photosynthetic activities will be impacted by a shortage
    of water. The plant will eventually wilt and die [5]. In case of villages, where
    the farmers have their farms full of crops and want to water these crops, have
    to wake up midnights and water the crops due to the electricity issues at villages.
    Also, during COVID-19, it was not possible for them to reach the farms and water
    the plants, because of which we have witnessed the lot of damage in agricultural
    sector leading to food shortages. Hence, manual process of irrigation should have
    been replaced by the smart IoT based automated irrigation systems. As above mentioned
    about existing scenarios have their limitations, hence we are taking the advantage
    of the IoT and data science relation to develop the smart irrigation without the
    need of manual intervention. This research work is proposed to avoid the inconveniences
    of the manual irrigation system as well as to overcome the disadvantages of the
    existing smart irrigation system. The smart irrigation system proposed has two
    parts, in first part the configuration of the system is hardware based where multiple
    sensors are required to capture the certain values related to crop field, the
    attribute names are soil moisture, weather conditions and the type of crop in
    the crop field which have high correlation with the water required to the crops.
    In second part the captured attribute values are used by the machine learning
    technique such as logistic regression which predicts the amount of water required
    by the crop field, if any. Hence, this research work is a combination of IoT and
    machine learning. Main attributes which are focused here are accuracy of the system,
    timeliness and cost of the system. The next subsequent sections of this research
    article is focusing on the literature review of the existing methodologies , proposed
    architecture of the research work related to smart irrigation, the nature of data
    to be used, followed by summary insights of the work. SECTION II. Literature Survey
    The authors have carried out the thorough survey and studied many existing smart
    irrigation systems and concluded as follows for every such system. In [6], Vishal
    Saraswat et al have designed and tested the \"Smart Irrigation system based on
    soil moisture utilizing Arduino.\" It was created by integrating functionality
    from every piece of hardware used. It has been verified that the mechanism works
    mechanically. The wetness (water content) of the various plants is measured by
    the moisture sensors. The moisture sensor transmits a signal to the Arduino board,
    which in turn causes the Water Pump to switch ON and supply water to each individual
    plant, if the dampness level falls below the desired and set level. The system
    shuts down automatically and the water pump is turned off when the desired moisture
    level is reached. As a result, the system''s functioning has been rigorously tested
    and is said to perform as intended. But, here the system works only with the sensor
    and no mechanism which can analyse the data and predict the water requirement.
    Along with that, it also depends on only moister level and other important parameters
    are not considered here. In [7], Aman Bafna et al have method wherehuman contact
    in plant watering is fully eliminated when the weather system predicts and adjusts
    the plant watering cycle according to the weather. With the development of water
    soluble fertilizers, farmers are no longer required to fertilize their crops.
    The water tank could simply be filled with fertilizer, and the irrigation system
    would take care of the rest. Here, the limitations are the system do not consider
    the predictions of water requirement and system only suggests the plants that
    can grow in the available soil type and does not talk about automation of watering.
    In [8], Dr. Geetha S et al have proposed the autonomous irrigation system which
    is intended to continually monitor the soil''s moisture content. When the desired
    level of soil moisture is reached, the system responds accordingly by watering
    the soil with exactly the right amount of water and then turning off the water
    supply. There are two useful elements. These are a motor or pump and a moisture
    sensor. The Arduino IDE software is used to programme Arduino boards. The soil
    moisture content is determined using a soil moisture sensor. Plants receive water
    by a motor or pump. The timer module delivers the water at predetermined intervals
    of time that is defined in Arduino, regardless of moisture level. The overall
    power consumption of the circuit is between 200 and 220 mA. The system''s key
    benefit is that it only activates the water pump when necessary and shuts it down
    immediately when there is enough water. This avoids water waste and guarantees
    that water is used as efficiently as possible. The limitation of the system is
    where the attributes for predicting the water needs is only one and other important
    parameters are not considered which does not guarantee about accuracy of the system,
    specially false positives can be raised and excessive water could been provided
    to plants. In [9], V. Vinoth Kumar et al. have proposed an irrigation system using
    IoT where data is collected at the user end regarding status of the soil moisture,
    if there is any deviation from the reference value, the user can send a command
    through the IoT server to maintain the set point value of the field parameter
    for proper irrigation. The proposed IoT-based irrigation system can measure the
    soil moisture and temperature of the field and transmits real-time data to the
    user through the Wi-Fi and IoT server. The limitation of the system is, it does
    not operate the irrigation system automatically and provide the technical field
    values to the users who may not understand it hence this system cannot be generalized
    for all type of farmers and gardeners. In [10], Ancy Stephen at al have outlined
    the process for performing automated irrigation. The suggested system includes
    a wireless sensor network, real-time sensors, and control of an irrigation system
    to carry out autonomous watering. This technique aids in preserving the necessary
    water in the container and prevents waste. With automated irrigation, the soil''s
    moisture determines whether the pumping motor turns on or off automatically. Machine
    learning methods like the KNN algorithm and Naive Bayes algorithm are used to
    forecast how dry the soil is. The linear algorithm is applied to determine how
    much water is needed and to estimate when the next water cycle will occur. The
    pumping ON/OFF prediction technique is then developed using an artificial neural
    network. The system is proposed with linear algorithm and also the classification
    algorithms do not provide the desired predictions with high accuracy. The system
    does not specify the data requirements, the linear algorithm structure and results.
    This system does not provide water level predictions and requirements for crops
    in the crop field. In [11], P. Mercy Nesa Rani et al. have described an automated
    irrigation system that enables farmers to irrigate crops with the right amount
    of water without hindering their growth. By monitoring the resistivity of the
    electrodes put into the soil, this irrigation system ascertains the soil''s moisture
    content and waters the plant appropriately. The ADC readings of the moisture sensors
    are used to calculate the soil''s moisture content. The water pump is turned on
    to irrigate the crop based on the amount of moisture in the soil. Such moisture
    measuring techniques have the disadvantage of requiring individual calibration
    and failing in saline soil. The authors have sensed the water content of the soil
    over a wider area by extending the electrode''s length. Wireless sensor networks
    are not used and monitoring of huge agricultural fields is not provided by the
    work. In [12], G.Ravi kumar et al. have proposed a modern design method for monitoring
    and managing soil moisture using LabVIEW, providing all the tools necessary to
    construct any measurement or control application in a significantly shorter amount
    of time. The work also contains a rain sensor, which is crucial to prevent needless
    power use. The authors have claimed that, by managing soil moisture more effectively
    throughout critical plant growth stages, farmers are not only able to produce
    crops with less water overall, but they are also able to boost crop yields and
    quality. The use of an embedded system for computerized irrigation in agriculture
    provides a useful option for page-accurate irrigation control that enables farmers
    to increase production while conserving money. The disadvantage of the system
    is only limited parameters are used and complete automation of the irrigation
    system is demonstrated. It also does not elaborate the quality attributes achieved
    through the research work as a part of results. SECTION III. Concepts and Definitions
    Here, in this research work, the two parts are important, in first part we talk
    about the hardware configuration of the system and second part focuses on the
    machine learning technique for prediction of water needs for the crops. A. Arduino
    hardware for desgining IoT System As it has many user-friendly features and a
    large network of supporters, Arduino is an open source hardware and software platform
    that is highly well-liked among designers and manufacturers [13] [14]. Fig. 1.
    Arduino board Show All Fig. 1 shows the hardware diagram for arduino board. Following
    are the key features: Arduino boards have the ability to take analogue or digital
    input data from various sensors and convert them into an output, such as turning
    on or off a motor, an LED, connecting to the cloud, or doing a number of other
    tasks. By sending a set of instructions to the board''s microprocessor via the
    Arduino IDE, you may control how your board behaves (referred to as uploading
    software). Unlike the majority of earlier programmable circuit boards, the Arduino
    does not require a separate hardware component known as a programmer to load new
    code into the board. All you need is a USB cord. Moreover, the Arduino IDE employs
    a condensed form of C++ that makes learning to programme simpler. Last but not
    least, Arduino offers a standard form factor that separates the micro-functionality
    controller''s into a more approachable container [13]. B. Logistic Regression
    The second part of proposed system is prediction of water needs using logistic
    regression. So, here in this section we are elaborating logistic regression. One
    of the most often used Machine Learning algorithms, within the category of Supervised
    Learning, is logistic regression [15]. With a predetermined set of independent
    factors, it is used to predict the categorical dependent variable. With a categorical
    dependent variable, the output is predicted via logistic regression. As a result,
    the result must be a discrete or categorical value [16] [17]. Rather of providing
    the precise values of 0 and 1, it provides the probabilistic values that fall
    between 0 and 1. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or false, etc. Since
    it can classify new data using both continuous and discrete datasets, logistic
    regression is a key machine learning approach. Following eq. (1) is the logistic
    regression formula: log[ y 1−y ]= b 0 + b 1 x 1 + b 2 x 2 + b 3 x 3 +⋯+ b n x
    n (1) View Source Logistic Regression can be classified into three types: Binomial:
    There are only two conceivable forms of dependent variables in binomial logistic
    regression, such as 0 or 1, Pass or Fail, etc. Multinomial: In multinomial logistic
    regression, the dependent variable may be one of three or more potential unordered
    kinds, such as \"cat,\" \"dogs,\" or \"sheep.\" Ordinal: There are three or more
    potential ordered sorts of dependent variables in ordinal logistic regression,
    such as \"low,\" \"Medium,\" or \"High.\" [18]. SECTION IV. Proposed Methodology
    The methodology uses the hardware based design of the system for collecting the
    soil’s moisture, weather data and type of crop. The hardware consists of arduino
    circuit with the required sensors which sense the data related to these attributes.
    The fundamental reason for utilizing IOT and machine learning to build a low-cost
    smart irrigation system was to make it simpler for farmers to comprehend how much
    water is required for healthy, disease-free crops that are rich in nutrients.
    The sensors capture the data from the crop field and send that data to the model.
    The prediction model and automated system is driven with logistic regression which
    predicts the water needs. The data collected from the sensors will be applied
    as input to the logistic regression; the logistic regression determines whether
    the input leads to the water needs or sufficient water availability in the crop
    field. The logistic regression when determines the water level is below the requirement,
    it drives the water pump switch to turn on and hence water is supplied to the
    crop field. If the logistic regression model determines that, the sufficient water
    level is reached or available in the crop field, the water pump switch is automatically
    driven to turn off and hence, wastage of water will be avoided. The Fig. 2 shows
    the proposed method working architecture. Fig. 2. Architecture of Smart Irrigation
    system Show All SECTION V. Data Requirements The Kaggle dataset is obtained. This
    dataset was obtained from a system that uses a wireless sensor network to monitor
    and regulate an irrigation system in real-time. The factors in the dataset used
    in the proposed method are temperature (C), humidity percentage, and soil moisture
    need. The dependent factors are temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, while
    the independent parameter is the amount of water required. When water is unclean,
    some systems take the pH value and filter the water to ensure good crop output.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion Here, the research work carried out for smart irrigation
    system using IoT based circuit and machine learning focuses on the fully automated
    approach for watering the farms and the crop fields. It specifies the approach
    without manual intervention and accuracy based water needs predictions using the
    logistic regression technique. The cost of the system is also very low as only
    arduino board is involved and it can be afforded by every individual having farms.
    This system reduces the efforts of the farmers, as farmers do not have to operate
    the system by reaching actual crop fields or farmers do not have to operate anything
    in the system. Once the model is instantiated in the actual environment, the automation
    in the model will operate the water pump ON and OFF scenarios as per requirement.
    The future scope of the system is, other attributes can be considered and faster
    processing can be targeted with more advanced hardware circuitry. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  description: Two key ideas for wireless sensor network (WSN) optimization in precision
    farming serve as the guidelines for this study. According to its definition, a
    wireless sensor network is a collection of sensor nodes that link to one another
    and/or with a node outside of their coverage area via wireless communication.
    These nodes frequently have one or more sensors for evaluating internal or external
    elements as well as environmental characteristics. A CPU then controls the sensors,
    compiling, storing, processing, and, if requested, transmitting the data. In some
    systems, the sensor nodes' processing power is constrained to make them more energy-efficient.
    In this application, the sensor nodes transfer the collected data to a remote
    node with more powerful processing capabilities and greater storage in specified
    time intervals or condition-based events storage. Because of its ability to monitor
    processes at a small scale, nanotechnology is regarded as a leading technology
    for controlling agriculture. So, it paves the way for crucial advantages such
    as improving food quality and quantity, lowering the input needed for agricultural
    production, fully utilizing soil nutrients, etc. The availability of natural resources,
    detecting the right nutrients from the soil for crop-specific production, and
    crop cultivation are issues in these models. In order to boost crop yield by assessing
    the nutrients in the soil, various nano-sensors are used in this research study.

    Location: Tirunelveli, India SECTION I. Introduction In addition, the sensor nodes
    use one or more wireless communications protocols to broadcast or receive data,
    including but not restricted to IEEE 802. 11, Zigbee, radio frequency (RF), and
    long-range modulation (LoRa). It makes sense that WSN offers a more effective
    data monitoring option for agricultura1 applications than the more labor-intensive
    manual methods of data collection, like using handheld sensors. It is also possible
    to use a bigger sensor deployment area. The sensor nodes serve as monitors of
    vital signs and might show the collected data in real time. In addition, when
    certain requirements are satisfied, such as exceeding threshold values, abrupt
    spikes in the obtained sensor data, time intervals, and other parameters set or
    as required by the user, the sensor nodes may also operate actuators. Any It is
    difficult to design a WSNs network that balances cost, accuracy, and efficacy.
    Implementation/deployment and is its preliminary concern. It has a significant
    impact on transmission accuracy, latency, congestion detection, and power management.
    As a result, recent study has focused on various methodologies and technologies
    [1]. Numerous Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods for optimizing multiple parameters
    have been developed to address various types of wireless sensor network parameter
    optimization for precision farming [2]. Research efforts are made to fill in any
    gaps left by the growth of cloud-based IoT deployment in agriculture, including
    the benefits of the technology to various aspects impacting its operation and
    the difficulties that would arise when it becomes a common farming practice in
    its entirety. Different protocols, architectures, and conventions are taken into
    consideration for smart farming and agriculture, with an emphasis on hardware,
    local and cloud data storage, and sensory parameters in particular. There are
    no studies on the use of IoT messaging protocol (first-layer message protocols)
    given the advent of its sophisticated and developed systems. In this paper, message
    layer protocols are taken into resolve the sensor cluster node selection issue
    and deployment, in addition to those based on artificial intelligence using a
    routing strategy to improve detection capacity difficulties relating to energy
    efficiency and communication delays. The overall delay is then equal to s + kd
    + x/b. 2) The total delay over a packet-switched network consists of two components:
    the transmission time at each hop and the total propagation delay kd. The incidence
    for a certain time period is divided by the illness prevalence for the same time
    period to determine the transmission rate. The majority of data on infectious
    diseases is gathered in the form of incidence and/or prevalence. The goal of this
    topic is to create a hybrid data acquisition model that is essential to WSN optimization,
    particularly in applications for smart farming. Messaging Layer Protocol (MLP)
    and Al-based optimization are both individually operating. However, the suggested
    hybrid data gathering strategy simultaneously optimizes many objectives. SECTION
    II. Sensors Monitoring Systems Wi-Fi Sensor Networks New routing algorithms and
    database integration have been devised as WSNs are employed in more sophisticated
    applications [3]. Table 1 Innovation agriculture The Table 1 offers a thorough
    analysis of smart farming, which raises agricultural output by tackling issues
    that are specifically related to agriculture. The study also goes into detail
    about the impact of smart farming on agricultural research. The review demonstrates
    how advanced technology like moisture and temperature monitors, GPS, aerial satellite
    photos, and sensors that forecast when it will rain make farming not just a profitable
    endeavor but also one that is efficient, safe, and good to the environment. Additionally,
    some solutions have successfully used tools like ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4), an Arduino
    microcontroller, radio transceiver modules, and a Raspberry Pi. IEEE 802.15.4
    ZigBee has been used [4].mostly used in low data-rate applications, such as smart
    lighting and home automation. Internet communication was made possible by the
    Ethernet shield and Arduino microcontroller. Additionally, a Raspberry Pi and
    Arduino system combo worked well for connecting to smartphone to track equipment,
    the weather, and climate conditions. Additionally, this system includes a real-time
    alarm subsystemalerting feature [5] Application protocol and an energy-efficient
    cluster-based routing strategy are two more protocols and systems that may be
    employed in WSNs. Fuzzy clustering approach for sector-based clustered routing
    (SBCR) [6].cloud computing, distributed energy-efficient geographic information
    systems (GIS), or other goals. Considering the graphical user interface as the
    main infrastructure, (GUI),a decision-support system, such as a decision-making
    algorithm A QEMU/SystemC co-simulation and Light Esterel property modeling simulation
    framework can be used to verify the network protocol implementation for the WSN.
    Some property models have been successfully developed, however the simulation
    framework is still under development. In order to replicate various environmental
    conditions, a radio link module can also be included. Additionally, the framework
    is coupled with an observer module that enables frame analysis and violation detection
    [7]. Data synchronization between mobile devices, machines, and cloud services
    may provide difficulties. SECTION III. Smart Agriculture The Fig 1 Internet of
    Things (IoT), a cutting-edge technology, and cloud-based data processing and storage
    have considerably benefited smart farming. IoT makes it possible for users to
    communicate with machines, machines to communicate with one another, and computational
    systems that support the operations of the smart farm. It enhances agricultural,
    resource, and monitoring management. The utilization of air temperature, soil
    pH, soil moisture, humidity, and water volume sensors is one example of an IoT-based
    smart farm. These sensors gather data and transmit it over a Wi-Fi network to
    the managing server [8]. The issues with wired communications have also been resolved
    through the introduction of IoT. Low energy Bluetooth and LPWAN systems are two
    further examples of such systems. For controlling image time, a WSN has been built
    to analyze temperature and soil moisture sensor value ranges. This allows for
    real-time monitoring of energy, water, and crop development. Additionally, this
    approach looks into the profile of food production depending on energy and water
    use [9]. An crucial component of a WSN is automation of power management. Fuzzy
    logic controllers were used to implement this, and the outcomes between data communication
    and environmental data collection were accurate. In terms of the particular technology
    employed, Kaewmard offers a WSN imitating system that is linked to a smartphone
    and has a high success rate of 95.36 percent in data transfer and command response
    control and 97.42% accuracy in environmental data gathering. Artificial neural
    network algorithms (ANN) and genetic algorithms (GA) are intelligent systems that
    could be used to further increase the irrigation system''s overall reactivity
    and efficiency. Protocol for the Message Layering the development of communications
    and the rise of IoT[10]. The communication protocols of a network are the result
    of much research; some depend on individual nodes, while others depend on clusters.
    Additionally, there are schemas for single nodes and traditional groups of nodes.
    Comparing the traditional and industry-standard loT application layer protocols
    and architecture is the responsibility of this section. Additionally, it wraps
    up the key facets of the architectures and protocols. The final section identifies
    drawbacks and problems, particularly in the context of agricultural uses. A study
    on UDP (user-data-protocol)-based protocols has demonstrated that they indirectly
    contribute to optimization goals. The residual energy of the technique increases
    as The system achieves the lowest latency in data transmission in terms of network
    and data packet bandwidth [11]. The greatest illustration of this protocol is
    the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) protocol. The ability of an UDP-based
    protocol is similarly achieved by MMQTT, AMQP, XMPP, and REST HTTP. While the
    approach used by networks to reliably, efficiently, and precisely transport data
    from the source to the intended destination is different. Since defective sensory
    input can lead to erroneous decisions and improper automated procedures, trustworthy
    transmitted information and high QoS throughput are important smart farming factors.
    It is established that a vast range of sensory data leads to a huge variability
    of information collected (example environmental information from environmental
    sensors). The fact that there is such a wide variety of data, from low periodicity
    to real-time multimedia, further complicates the situation. Therefore, it is imperative
    to address the aforementioned issues. Furthermore, the many and frequently unpredictable
    network transmission and propagation conditions, which range from nothing (nearly
    free space) to extreme variation of distortion, fading, and attenuation, are crucial
    for the veracity and correctness of the data. The physical, MAC, and network layers
    of communication technologies have significant computational costs, but there
    are also certain disadvantages, such as greater costs and a smaller operational
    coverage area. In this context, the chosen method of MQTT (which uses TCP rather
    than CoAP UDP) appears to be the best operating algorithm and substantially administers
    advantages among the protocols taken into consideration. Overall, given the protocol''s
    maturity and the above-discussed urgent communication problems and obstacles,
    it is believed that the MMQTT is the most appropriate and secure solution. Data
    interaction between confined devices and server applications takes place using
    MQTT. It accommodates unstable networks, needs little effort from developers to
    deploy, and has extremely low bandwidth requirements, making it perfect for machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communication. A common protocol for Industrial IoT (Internet of Things)
    data is MQTT. It was designed to link distant devices to a main server and is
    small, quick, and secure. SECTION IV. Multi-Objective Optimization Based on Artificial
    Intelligence (ai) Multi-objective optimization was evolved from the particular
    objective optimization. The Fig 1 and 2 specific-objective only functions in a
    single way. There are gaps between each aim, and this form of algorithm does not
    solve all problems. The decision-making system never chooses more than one tradeoff
    option [12]. However, with the development of wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    and their advanced technology, optimization-related issues with their design,
    implementation, and process are strangely constrained to a single technique. Multiple
    desired goals compete with one another, and only the best is chosen while ignoring
    the other problem gaps, which is also a crucial component of a communication link.[13]
    As an example, increasing the data packet rate can conflict with other factors
    like as connection area coverage, remaining power, latency, cost, and others.
    However, several objectives will be covered if multi-objective optimization is
    applied. Fig. 1. Block diagram Show All The most likely cause of some objectives''
    lack of correspondence is that they were created in a dependent manner. A convincing
    example is the maximizing of power or energy, which likewise improves energy efficiency
    but contrasts with the minimization of the system''s cost. An analysis of the
    multi-objective optimization P technique reveals that a range of algorithms used
    in the technique simultaneously tackle P various objectives of optimization problems
    pertaining to the design, development, and deployment of WSNs. When implemented,
    the procedure requires less computing complexity and memory but still produces
    usable results due to the WSNs'' limited resource capacity. However, those approaches
    have some drawbacks. and the process of mathematical optimization cannot fully
    resolve it. Though the selected algorithm Among the protocols taken into account,
    the MQTT method-which employs TCP instead of CoAP UDP-appears to be the best working
    algorithm and greatly administers advantages. Overall, it is felt that the MMQTT
    is the most suitable and secure option given the protocol''s maturity and the
    aforementioned critical communication issues and challenges. The following are
    the primary ways in which the suggested hybrid approach of optimization (DNNRA)
    varies from the others. The Deep Neural Network-based Routing Algorithm (DNNRA)
    addresses the energy gap problem, which is not addressed by existing algorithms,
    as well as the WSN''s fundamental problems of low coverage cost and balanced data
    loading. Finally, it substantially improved the coverage to meet its bare minimum.
    SECTION V. Methodology The design and implementation phases of the study are separated
    into 2 parts. The steps of research, including planning, implementation, and data
    analysis,. First, the wireless sensor network architecture is modelled during
    the design process. SECTION VI. Phase of System Design The network and hardware
    designs are part of the systems design process. The network design outlines the
    topology, characteristics, and needs for the network as well as its architecture.
    The wireless node''s hardware design contains all of the device, module, and wireless
    protocol specifications: A sensing module may be a part of each sensor node. Each
    sensor node has a processing unit that oversees all activities and keeps instructions
    stored in an internal memory. The processing unit is merged with the restricted
    memory capacity of the internal memory. Sending information to the network''s
    central node or other nodes is the responsibility of the communications unit.
    The sensor node could additionally have an attached actuation unit that regulates
    farm settings. A central node consists of a power source, a processor unit, and
    communications units. Through a first communications unit, the central node receives
    sensor data from all sensor nodes situated within its coverage region. A second
    communications unit is then used to transmit the data obtained from the sensor
    to the data acquisition server. Additionally analyzed, recorded, and stored in
    a processing unit is the data collected from the source sensor nodes. The processing
    unit runs calculations to keep the farm parameter values within acceptable ranges.
    SECTION VII. Phase of Implementation The experimental phase of the investigation
    is comprised of the implementation phase. This addresses how the suggested protocol
    and routing method are applied. when the network architecture and design have
    been established. Transmission was facilitated by the processing of Data Acquisition
    within the black box confinement of the data forwarding equipment primarily on
    the preliminary levels. In practice, upper layer protocols are crucially important.
    These procedures are in charge of ensuring that the data being transported is
    accurate and efficient. These protocols are also required for data collection,
    transport, and sharing. The proposed MMQTT method makes use of TCP protocol within
    the constraints of transport layer/level of communication. In light of the nodes''
    capacity to run either subscribers (subs) or publishers (pubs), or even both.
    The broker, in our instance keep alive, acts as the system''s distributor; messages
    are obtained and relayed via the broker. Every sensor node will immediately subscribe
    to a specific subject when a publisher (pubs) posts a specific topic, getting
    all updates, commands, or even messages related to that topic. But, the system
    of Internet of Things (IoT) is reliant to the application layer protocols according
    to the introductory part/section of TCP/IP model. The primary focus of this work
    is on the application layer in conjunction with messaging transmission mechanisms.
    There is a latency between the server and the publisher in a perfect case of Subs/client
    to publish or vice versa. This delay is known as the publish-to-subscribe delay.
    The MQTT-SN client technique does a delay analysis as a solution [14]–[16]. It
    is predicted that introducing the system''s local user restriction will cause
    an end-to-end delay, preventing users from connecting to or subscribing to the
    specific topic created by the broker or publisher right away[17]. The system calculates
    the transmission''s pub-to-sub delay at various levels of QoS[18]. There are a
    total of six events throughout the transmission link from sources up to the consumer/subs
    end in a preliminary. The number of nodes in the system is denoted by N, and each
    sensor node''s initial energy level is denoted by Et. Lt stands for the initial
    positions of each sensor node, LQi stands for the initial communication link quality
    of the system''s various data routes, As the initial node-to-node communication
    interference, I is the basic weight of link quality, It is the priority weight
    of the communication interference, and priority weight ratio of the communication
    interference. Priority weight of communication interference (Wni) in this type
    of system is seen as being bigger than Priority weight of energy to distance ratio
    (Wde) and Initial/fundamental weight of link quality (Wi). The optimization parameters
    are also defmed based on the preliminary concept of network''s lifetime, latency
    (point-to-point or P2P communication delay. The nodes'' locations and connection/communication
    links were determined using IPv6 architecture. The output of the system is denoted
    by the notation Dro (data rates of a single node coincides with the data path),
    which corresponds to the communication channel used by the transmission between
    the source nodes and the intended destination nodes. Performance assessment using
    the suggested approach, (c) Power optimization, (d) optimization of the quality
    of service The residual power of each sensor is one of the main problems with
    WSN installation. Power optimization and management are essential. The approach
    includes a predefined threshold value as a solution. Depending on their leftover
    powers while in active mode, they are grouped. The sensor with the highest remaining
    power is present in each cluster; it collects data from all neighboring nodes
    within its corresponding cluster and sends it to the data acquisition device depicts
    the transmission efficiency depending on energy and performance. Fig. 2. Wireless
    power smart sensor device Show All In order to capture data about objects, heterogeneous
    nodes are deployed in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), and a routing protocol
    is used to send the data to the base station (BS). In the WSN, battery power is
    limited. In order to save energy, the article suggested a multitier clustering
    multi-hop routing system. SECTION VIII. Pproach To Sust Ainable Advance Crop Production
    Management Using Iot Engineering Nanomaterials In spite of the fact that the internet
    of things has quickly gained popularity and is now an important aspect of our
    time, many individuals still have little understanding of its norms and advantages.

    Nanotechnology Fig 3 Through the intelligent delivery of active chemicals, nutrient
    deficiency in fertilization, and improved growth and water management, nanotechnology
    and nanomaterials in agriculture aim to reduce the usage of pesticides, raise
    yields, and reduce nutrient deficiencies. Nanotechnology-based technologies are
    being used to explore the alterations in biotechnological programming. Bionanocomposites
    with improved physical-mechanical properties could be created for bio-industrial
    applications using components that are typically acquired. For instance, soy hulls
    and wheat straw). The following are the most prevalent uses of agricultural nanomaterials:
    x Production of crops: Fertilizers and plant protection products fall under this
    category. The most popular vegetable production products and fertilizers based
    on nanotechnology Fig. 4. Agriculture fertilizser growth plants Show All Fig.
    5. Agricculture plants crop sectors Show All The Fig 4, 5 and 6 most critical
    problem in the agriculture paradigm, climate change, is well addressed in this
    method by the GIoT, which also considerably lowers negative environmental effects.
    The following are the main benefits of applying G-IoT to agriculture: Remote and
    in-person monitoring, increased input utilization (soil, water, fertilizers, insecticides,
    etc.), and animal health monitoring x Lower production costs, more profitability,
    Increased organizational food security over the long run and new financial opportunities
    It is obvious that integrating G-IoT into agriculture increases output, conserves
    energy, and resources while reducing waste and contamination Fig. 6. Hybrid data
    acquisition model for precision agriculture cultivation (tobacco and onion) Show
    All SECTION IX. Conclusion For precision farming, this research developed a hybrid
    data acquisition model integrating IoT messaging protocol and artificial intelligence.
    To increase the energy efficiency of conventional wireless sensor networks, sensor
    cluster node selection and deployment, detecting capability, jitter/delay of energy
    efficiency, and cluster head selection node protocol through MMQTT and multi-objective
    paradigm algorithm of DNNRA have been used. Based on the suggested approach, the
    MAC and PHY layers of the communication network/architecture are executed and
    assessed. The technique is extremely versatile and can be used for a variety of
    IoT, WSN, and monitoring applications. The suggested approach produced reduced
    maintenance costs, optimized energy use, was adaptive to environmental changes,
    and made simple and dependable sensor management. Authors Figures References Keywords

    1 Introduction In agriculture, irrigation plays a vital role. The available water
    resources in India should be used wisely to avoid water scarcity during cultivation.
    The growth of the plant gets affected due to improper irrigation, which affects
    the yield of the forms. In India most of the formers do manual irrigation which
    might lead to wastage of water, i.e., the excess flow of water to the crop, overflow
    of water from the agriculture field. These can be avoided by using an automatic
    irrigation system. In automatic irrigation the water flow can be controlled based
    on soil moisture and temperature. Many research works are already performed with
    automatic irrigation systems using various sensors. Android-based intelligent
    irrigation system which consists of several parameters that can be selected according
    to the stage of the crop, climatic condition, and the amount of moisture content.
    Temperature sensor to find the climatic change that takes place in the atmosphere
    [1]. Automated irrigation model with ANN-based controller [2]. The corn yield
    irrigation systems based on the GA algorithm [3]. The cost-effective smart irrigation
    with Rasp-berry Pi [4]. Designs an Internet of things based real-time monitoring
    system for smart agriculture [5]. Intelligent irrigation monitoring by thermal
    imaging using the Cloud of Things [6]. Arduino-based smart irrigation system using
    wireless Robot [7]. Precision agriculture for an intelligent irrigation scheduling
    system [8]. De-signed an Arduino-based automatic irrigation system [9]. This paper
    focuses on providing farmers with automatic water supply based on the crops. The
    focus is to build a system that includes providing water according to requirements
    and activates the relay motor automatically. Implementing this system provides
    real-time sensing and self-controllable eliminates the requirements for manpower.
    Finally, this paper provides an automatic irrigated system that calculates soil
    moisture and temperature and helps to take necessary action on turning ON/OFF
    the water supply automatically by saving water and environment. To achieve this
    system, the data can be collected from cloud-based IOT model and apply k nearest
    neighbor algorithm and Naive Bayes algorithm to find the dryness of soil and for
    user-friendly access, the android application is also accessible for automation
    from a remote location. 2 Problem Statement This paper helps in monitoring soil
    moisture level and powers ON/OFF motor automatically. It will also help to control
    water wastage. The proposed model can be operated using Web and Android mobile
    application. It is not needed for humans to visit the form directly to carry out
    the irrigation process. The dryness of the soil is determined by using machine
    learning algorithm. Build a system that performs an automated irrigation model
    which performs automatic ON and OFF the pumping motor based on the prediction
    of water requirements or predicted for the next water cycle. 3 Proposed System
    For an Automatic irrigation system, the IOT model is constructed with Arduino
    board and sensors like soil moisture, dht11, Node MCU as shown in Figs. 1 and
    2. Fig. 1 Proposed architecture for smart irrigation Full size image Fig. 2 Circuit
    diagram Full size image The moisture of soil can be measured with the help of
    a moisture sensor. The DHT11 sensor helps to monitor the temperature and humidity
    values. The water vapor is detected by measuring the electrical resistance between
    two electrodes. NodeMCU which is available at free of cost runs on the ESP8266MOD.
    NodeMCU is like other microcontrollers such as Arduino UNO and Nano. It has built-in
    Wi-Fi and Bluetooth with better speed and flash space. The data are collected
    real time using these IOT devices. Machine learning algorithms can be applied
    to find how much soil is dry and check or compare two ML algorithms KNN and Naive
    Bayes. 3.1 KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) Algorithm Step 1: Find the K-most similar
    instance from the given data set when prediction is required. Step 2: The similarity
    between real value data is measured using Euclidean distance and Humming distance
    is used for categorical or binary data. Step 3: Return average predicted attributes
    from the classification. 3.2 Naive Bayes Algorithm The Naive Bayes is one of the
    supervised learning models for making a prediction using the probabilities of
    individual attributes from each class. Step 1: Probability calculation is simplified
    by considering the probability of each attribute from the given class is independent
    of other attributes. Step 2: The product rule is applied on all conditional probabilities
    for each attribute for a given class value. Step 3: Conditional probability for
    each class attribute is derived using Bayes rule and prediction is made by using
    the class value with the highest probabilities. 3.3 Linear Regression Algorithm
    Linear regression algorithm is used to count the water quantity requirement and
    the prediction for the next water cycle. Multiple linear regression is used when
    there are more input variables which affects the output, as shown in Eq. (1).
    $$Y = \\beta 0 + \\beta 1x1 + \\beta 2x2 + \\cdots + \\beta kxk + \\in$$ (1) 3.4
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN) ANN algorithm is implemented for on-off prediction.
    Figure 3 shows the Irrigation System performed with ANN Controller. Fig. 3 ANN-based
    irrigation control system Full size image Input from Sensors: The different parameters
    like temperature and soil moisture are collected in this stage. Then these parameters
    are used as the input for the next stage. Evapotranspiration Model: Both input
    parameters are converted into actual soil moisture. Required Soil Moisture: Provides
    information about the quantity of water required for the proper growth of plants.
    ANN Controller: Decision is made dynamically based on the comparison of required
    with actual soil moisture. 4 Results and Discussion The proposed system consists
    of a watering system for plant farming that includes the formers being satisfied
    by automatic water supply according to their crops. This system provides water
    according to requirement and activates relay motor automatically. 4.1 Dataset

    using Arduino board with humidity and temperature sensors. The connections were
    established between the sensors and Arduino board. The dryness of the soil is

    produced an accuracy of 91.17% and Naive Bayes algorithm produced an accuracy
    of 81.43%. K-means produces high accuracy while comparing with Naive Bayes shown

    algorithm used to find the requirements of water quantity and predict when the
    water is required again. It predicted the water needed after 13.76 days based
    on the values of moisture level in the dataset and then the amount of water needed,
    and irrigation intervals are shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Prediction of water requirement
    and next water cycle Full size image 4.4 Prediction of Pump ON/OFF Figure 7 shows
    the prediction of pump ON/OFF based on the ANN model it contains an input layer,
    four hidden layers, and output layer. It performs Relu operation. It provides

    size image 5 Conclusion and Future Enhancements We proposed an automatic irrigation
    system in three modules. In the first module, we constructed an IOT model. We
    used the sensors like soil moister sensor and dht11 sensor and NodeMCU and collected
    corresponding values. In the second module, we applied machine learning algorithms
    like KNN and Naive Bayes model for identifying the dryness of the soil and linear
    algorithm is applied for identifying the amount of water required. In the third
    module, we used artificial neural network algorithm for pumping ON/OFF. In future
    we have the plan to integrate the system along with rain forecasting, which leads
    to more effective utilization of power and water. References Seenu (2018) Android

    efficiencyData securitySignal strength 1. Introduction The Internet of Things
    (IoT) has mainly exciting improvement in the field of information and communication
    technologies (IoT). Despite the fact that networking technologies have become
    more widely used as time has progressed, they were initially controlled to linking
    conventional ending customer devices for example mainframes, desktop computers,
    and laptop computers, as well as newly developed smart phones &tablets, among
    other equipments. According to industry analysts, almost Nine billion such devices
    at present associated to the system, with the number expected to grow to more
    than 25 billion by 2020, based on their estimates of the current state of the
    network. According to some experts, the IoT is expected to generate $13 trillion
    in revenue by 2025. Because IoT is already being used in every sphere of life,
    it can be found in everything from smart homes to healthiness to traffic control
    to smart farming [1]. Smart farming is a form of modern agricultural management
    that integrates advanced technology for example big data and IoT to allow agricultural
    businesses to keep track of, monitor, and automate their operations. Intelligent
    farming is also referred to as intelligent agriculture. With a projected increase
    in the global population and an anticipated rise in food demand, smart cultivation
    is fetching ever more significant. The issues associated with climate change necessitate
    increased use of natural resources and information & communiqué skills to face
    these challenges [2], [11]. The Internet of Things (IoT) was worldwide system
    which makes farm environment smarter by enabling the supervising & managing of
    ranch during the use of smart devices for data collection, processing, and analysis
    [3]. We live in an age where IoT connects and supports everything. This helps
    with every decision making cycle including choosing the seed, cultivating the
    crop, making a revolution, preparing, watering, yielding, post- yielding, insect
    and infection management. IoT helps farmers reduce crop waste and save resources
    such as water and fertilizer. This results in improved crop yields and decreased
    operating costs [4], [12]. IoT networks for checking of ranch climate ought to
    be of minimal expense, making it reasonable for ranchers and should utilize low
    energy for draw out existence of the organization [5]. Most network monitoring
    systems employ sensors placed throughout the entire installation, a number of
    sink nodes, and a gateway dependent on network topology and farm clustering. Information
    from sensor nodes is transferred to the attendant using the descend. It is common
    in most wireless networks for the sink to be active, and thus it consumes a lot
    of power. Organizing is particularly useful here. It can help alleviate many of
    the issues currently experienced in the IoT space, specifically by means of energy
    utilization, scalability, usability, and so on, due to its connection to IoT [14].
    This is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (392KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 1. Inter-Home clustering. A substantial part of
    IoT-based agriculture depends on sensors that collect data and various algorithms
    that process the information, and the results can be accessed anytime and anywhere
    over the Internet. Clustering is sometimes referred to as the combination of sensing
    devices. Providing support to get data quickly with the smallest amount of contact,
    as well as transferring the information for processing, makes clustering an effective
    means of support for overall network efficiency and enhanced longevity [13]. In
    addition, we investigate the clustering of IoT nodes to increase the efficiency
    of energy use and extend the lifetime of the network to help farmers reduce the
    cost burden of replacing systems or devices. This research described a methodology
    for IoT-based agriculture to collect soil data using sensors that requires less
    energy, is sustainable, and has a longer lifespan [15]. We suggest a smart energy
    manage Agriculture method in which IoT-dependent IoT systems are used to supply
    lower energy requirements while having longer network life spans. All of the paper
    is laid out in the following manner: The architecture of the smart agricultural
    scheme is discussed in Section II. In Section III, the design of the proposed
    work, as well as every calculate, counting the clustering procedure and flowchart,
    were conversed. Section IV & V goes over the simulation results and the ensuing
    discussion. This concluding segment brings research to a close, while also offering
    future directions [16]. 2. The architecture of a smart farming monitoring system:
    Measuring agricultural parameters, determining where to measure, gathering data
    from the field, routing data to the organizing location for result building, and
    acting on & controlling decisions depended on intellect data are all essential
    components of a precision farming system. In our model, the diagram in Fig. 2
    depicts four basic agricultural layers: Download : Download high-res image (570KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Smart farming system architecture.
    Sensor layer, which includes sensors for measuring the growth of different crops
    and intelligent devices for gathering data and monitoring. Other types of sensors
    are installed in the earth, on the harvest, while UAVs can carry sensors [6],
    [17]. Measurements in the soil are referred to as “underground sensors” and include
    waterproof sensors as well as humidity, ph, & soil compound characteristics. “Environmental
    sensors” like moisture, hotness, breeze rate, luminosity, or lunar emission are
    measured by UAV sensors. UAVs typically use the most popular sensors, which are
    thermal elements. Thermal buzz with imaging cameras consists of variety of applications,
    including scanning substances & materials and converting to metaphors and record.
    All of the communication technologies used to connect sensors to the internet
    comprises the entire network layer infrastructure. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
    are used to enable proficient harvest & field managing through the IoT policy
    (WSNs). High-density sampling over large areas is made possible through wide-area
    surveillance in smart farming systems, which offers instant feedback and optimization
    of crop quality [18], [19]. • Using distributed sensor nodes throughout the field
    to continuously monitor a large number of environmental parameters, growers can
    administer & preserve finest situations in order to accomplish greatest efficiency
    while reducing power consumption by a significant amount [Fig. 2]. • The Service
    Layer is responsible of the processing and analysis of the information gathered
    by the application. A large number of accurate farming studies converse the most
    effective information supervision and data mining methods for avoiding low field
    productivity through accurate predictions. Precision agriculture is on the rise.
    The use of Decision Support Systems (DSS) in agriculture is aided by the use of
    agricultural data processing software. Decision Support Systems (DSS) are responsible
    for the general organization of all existing composed data from the grounds with
    a view to maintain harvest growing’s, preserve value, & decreasing resource consumption.
    Even in the agricultural community, farmers experience significant financial losses
    as a result of inaccurate climate forecasting or improper cultivating techniques.
    The Internet of Things is made up of multiple interconnected systems. Of these,
    data analysis is critical to improve efficiency and provide adequate disease and
    pest control. When information from a sensor network is visualized, this is accomplished
    through use of the Application Layer. Using the system''s services and analyzing
    the results of their analysis, farmers are able to take appropriate action as
    a result of their analysis, which is provided to them for free. The application
    software, which is designed to be user-friendly, is capable of handling a wide
    range of ground optimization deliveries, including irrigation, insect killer usage,
    the farming procedure, harvest infection forecast and defense, and many other
    applications. It is important to keep energy utilization inside sensible cutoff
    points to help the productivity and adequacy of a savvy cultivating checking framework.
    Given the restricted battery life and restricted assets accessible to sensor hubs,
    it is important to carry out energy-saving procedures at the sensor and organization
    layers in the most productive way conceivable. It is worried about the dynamic
    and idle functional season of every sensor hub just as the booking of data transmission
    and the steering of information parcels through the organization that energy protection
    innovation is worried about. 3. Proposed IoT-based WSN framework for smart agriculture
    WSN technology has been used by several researchers to sense environmental data
    in a variety of domains, including agriculture. WSN too played an important function
    in crop inspection and organization, climate observation and management, water
    usage management, and other aspects of agricultural land management. Despite the
    fact that agricultural land is becoming more energy efficient, there are still
    some issues to contend with, such as data routing and security, which are caused
    by the inadequate series authority of sensors & the open communication standard
    used by the sensors themselves. The primary goal of the proposed solution is the
    development of energy competent and protected IoT dependent WSN structure for
    the observation & manufacture of farming ground that is based on the IoT. The
    projected solution is based on the Internet of Things and is intended to be implemented
    in the field. When a suitable cluster head has been identified using the optimal
    decision functions, it is then selected using the optimal decision function, which
    has been determined by the optimal decision function. When determining how to
    calculate the potential of wireless indicator and how to improve the success rate
    of sensor container, the SNR factor is taken into account as well. For the development
    of huge scale agricultural lands, which are currently unavailable, our projected
    method provides consistent & energy proficient techniques that are currently unavailable.
    Furthermore, by utilizing the linear congruential generator, the planned method
    builds up information safety from farming sensors to group leader and from group
    leader to BS [7], [8]. Which necessitates the use of minimal memory and processing
    time, as well as the use of minimum usage & dispensation occasion? Our projected
    structure, which is described in greater detail below, ensures that the substitution
    between energy utilization and consistent & safe routing for the farming field
    is achieved. This section provides an explanation of the detailed plan for the
    projected structure. It is proposed that the framework be composed of two major
    components. The agricultural sensors are dispersed throughout the first component
    in order to gather information. In terms of lasting power, the sensor nodes are
    heterogeneous [9], such that the energy plane of the diverse elements is greater
    than the energy level of the normal sensor nodes. To boost proficiency, the horticultural
    sensors are scattered into a few far off regions, with every space comprising
    of a solitary group head [10]. This is the job of the group head: to get data
    from the farming area and communicate it to the BS in an issue open minded and
    energy-proficient way. The proposed structure, which depends on a multi-measures
    choice capacity, balances the heap among horticultural sensors and chooses appropriate
    group sets out toward use in the field based on the choice capacity. Likewise,
    a solitary bounce transmission worldview is utilized in our system instead of
    a multi-jump transmission worldview that lessens network bottlenecks and inertness.
    The subsequent part is the symmetric encryption of information between agrarian
    sensors utilized by the proposed. Security component and gives powerful transmission
    in the field by utilizing the age of pseudorandom numbers. Fig. 3 portrays the
    exploration plan for the proposed system for shrewd farming as it is right now
    known. Discussion of the projected power & link proficient routing system will
    take place in this section, which will be divided into two main levels of discussion.
    First, a multi-criteria decision function is used to select the most optimal cluster
    heads, which is the basis for the second level. As a result, the nodes with the
    lowest energy consumption are grouped together and organized into different clusters.
    Creating a stable routing channel for a longer period of time, as described in
    the previous section, is the next stage of the projected energy & link proficient
    routing. This avoids the wireless connection from performing mischievous behavior
    from the cluster leader to the BS. As shown in equation 1, our projected structure
    uses three parameters for the selection of cluster heads: node energy ei, Signal
    to Noise Ratio SNRi, BS, and remoteness to the base station di, BS, as well as
    a multi-criteria decision-making function f(n), which is used to select cluster
    heads. The goal of the proposed framework is to provide a means to accurately
    estimate the signal strength and to raise delivery performance efficiently. When
    compared to background noise, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is
    defined as the signal to noise ratio (SNR). For example, if RSSIi is the received
    signal strength indicator and Bni is the backdrop sound for connection I the price
    of SNRi can be calculated by dividing RSSIi by the background noise for the link
    in question. The link with the lowest value of SNRi is selected as the most appropriate
    for data transmission because it has the lowest SNRi value. (1) Download : Download
    high-res image (246KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Proposed system
    energy and link efficient routing. The charge of f (n) is regularized in series
    [0.0.1] by using the function 1f (n) (n). In the proposed framework, BS is responsible
    for maintaining a universal counter which contains data about farming sensor data.
    The stock up data contains the location of the node, the distance between it and
    the BS, the residual energy, and the SNR factors. BS evaluates f (n) in the context
    of the stored information and produces a standardized score based on the results.
    The sensor knot in the agricultural soil with the highest score is then chosen
    as the original group leader by BS. Accordingly, the accesses are associated with
    nodes that have been designated as cluster heads based on the value of the f-factor
    (n). In this context, normal nodes refer to the remaining nodes that aren’t distincted
    as group leaders. Following that, BS adds each cluster head’s one-hop nodes to
    its membership list and updates the global table as needed to reflect the additions.
    All of the sensors included in the proposed framework were programmed to gather
    all of the information they could, and to forward it to the heads of each cluster.
    Once the data has been transmitted to BS, it is connected to the Internet by means
    of a single-hop mechanism, allowing end-users to obtain information about farming
    soil for supplementary investigation. 4. Secure data transmission from agriculture
    sensors towards BS The framework for system is that data collected from agriculture
    sensors is forwarded securely and reliably through a protected & belief system
    to the group leaders, which in turn delivers it to the BS. In this structure,
    the BS produces encrypted inputs by taking advantage of the recurrence of the
    linear congruential equation, which is given by 1 and can be written as (2). (2)
    Y0 is the seed esteem, which should be more noteworthy than nothing and not exactly
    the modulus m. where Yi are the mysterious arbitrary qualities produced for sensor
    hub ni, m is the modulus boundary, which should be more prominent than nothing,
    is the multiplier boundary, which should be more noteworthy than nothing and not
    exactly the modulus m, is the augmentation boundary, which should be more prominent
    or equivalent to nothing and not exactly the modulus m, and m is the modulus boundary.
    A secret key is assigned to all of the sensor nodes as a result of using equation
    2. It is then encrypted using Equation 1 to protect the data mi sent by the sensor
    node ni to the cluster head CHj (3). (3) where ⊕ refers to the XOR operation performed
    on data coming from the agriculture sensor node and going to the crop health state.
    The BS receives the encrypted data Ej(mi) and uses the XOR algorithm with the
    key Yi to decrypt it (see equation 4). (4) 5. Experimental results and discussion
    This segment focuses into the investigational outcomes comparing the projected
    structure to the available solution. The proposed framework''s routine is compared
    to that of other solutions using network inactivity, energy utilization, and steering
    overheads. 5.1. Analysis of network throughput with discussion Figure 4 shows
    a comparison between the proposed framework and an available solution by means
    of system throughput under a variety of simulation scenarios and simulation round.
    According to the results of the simulation experiments, the projected structure
    outperformed the existing solutions in terms of network throughput by 10 percent
    and 17 percent, respectively, when compared to the existing solutions. Due to
    the strong and link responsive cluster leaders, there has been an improvement
    in the performance of the network throughput. The proposed structure, rather than
    different arrangements that don''t consider the estimation of sign strength between
    sensor hubs, joins the SRN factor in an astute determination choice for picking
    group heads, which expands the proportion of bundle conveyance in rural land because
    of their hearty conduct. The sharing of information encryption secret keys that
    depend on the direct congruential generator, just as the expanded organization
    throughput for the proposed system when contrasted with existing arrangements,
    add to the productive organization throughput and reliable organization availability
    that the proposed arrangement gives. Moreover, the proposed system ascertains
    the SNR proportion among hubs for a particular information transmission connect,
    which essentially affects the transmission of farming information to BS. Download

    The impact of the simulation rounds on network throughput. 6. Conclusion The Internet
    of Things (IoT) is a relatively new technology that is gaining traction in the
    agricultural industry. It is the Internet of Things nodes that sense the physical
    and environmental conditions of soil and crops and send the data to the sink BS,
    which reduces the load placed on the Channels and the nodes themselves. This paper
    proposes a smart farming monitoring system based on modern IoT communication technologies
    and WSN capabilities. The architectural elements of such a system are thoroughly
    discussed. This is accomplished in conjunction with energy-saving protocol schemes.
    Farmers can collect and analyze meaningful data with the help of Internet of Things
    agricultural applications. The small farmers and large landowners alike can benefit
    from the Internet of Things (IoT) market by implementing smart technologies to
    boost their productivity and sustainability. When it comes to data transmission,
    the proposed framework uses a single-hop paradigm, which reduces the likelihood
    of bottlenecks between agriculture sensors and base stations. We propose a framework
    that automatically increases throughput in the agricultural field by making intelligent
    data routing decisions and reducing the ratio of energy consumption to improved
    data delivery performance. CRediT authorship contribution statement Dhruva Anantha

    of modern houses, leading to an increased interest in consumer electronics which
    enable the automation of common household tasks. However, high initial costs,
    complex solutions, and closed systems mean home automation is still out of reach
    for a large number of potential customers. A cheap, open, extensible solution
    is therefore a must if IoT is to become a standard option for modern homes. In
    this article, we present an innovative solution to this problem in the form of
    an IoT framework called qToggle: a system for interconnecting sensors, actuators,
    and other data sources based on open source solutions and easily accessible components.
    To give a practical example of the uses of the new framework, we implemented a
    smart irrigation system, which can simplify garden care, while reducing water
    and energy consumption. The article describes details of the design, instrumentation,
    and software (mobile application) for the real time control of this system. Published

    Publisher: IEEE The world''s population is drawing close to 7.8 billion people.
    One third of this does not have access to sufficient drinking water with climate
    change and increased water demand being the main factors responsible. On the other
    hand, inefficient and primitive usage methods have led to 70% of the total water
    usage worldwide being generated by irrigation.[1] Increasingly, this problem is
    being tackled by the use of automated, smart irrigation systems, powered by the
    Internet of Things (IoT), which have become a key component in precision gardening
    and agriculture. The IoT has given a boost to smart agriculture, in terms of productivity
    and resource optimization. It has increased efficiency and has minimized the cost
    of production.[2] Smart homes, as part of the IoT paradigm, involve a networked
    system composed of various communication technologies and consumer electronics
    automating various tasks, including automated irrigation systems.[3] Each component
    of the smart home solution represents a key player in the overall “smart lifestyle”
    paradigm and needs to fulfill certain conditions for it to be optimal: ease of
    access to the public, open connectivity and ease of coupling with other components,
    online availability, and ease of usage. Automated irrigation systems help people
    control water usage in their gardens or fields and, thus, avoid water waste and
    minimize water bills. Moreover, smart irrigation systems aim to improve the quality
    of plant growth in gardens and fields by irrigating at correct times, with the
    appropriate amount of water, taking into consideration soil moisture levels and
    particular irrigation requirements in a given location. Replacing manual irrigation
    with an automatic valve system also eliminates the human error component. Smart
    irrigation systems also contribute by saving energy, time, and valuable resources.
    An IoT-based irrigation system is based on a smart microcontroller (e.g., an ESP
    chip). Soil moisture sensors are placed in the ground and send real-time data
    to the microcontroller, which automatically switches on the water pump when the
    values of the considered soil parameters are out of a specific reference interval.
    There is an entire discussion regarding the reference interval for these parameters
    (humidity, temperature, PH, etc.), because they are influenced by a series of
    factors: season, month, geography (continent, country, regions of a country: mountains,
    hill, riverside, etc.), type of soil, type of plants (grass, vegetables, cereals,
    etc.), and so on. In this article, we propose a simple but efficient smart irrigation
    system based on the Raspberry Pi. The irrigation system is part of an IoT framework
    called qToggle, a system for interconnecting sensors, actuators, and other data
    sources, with the aim of multiple automations, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1.
    Smart irrigation system as part of the IoT based smart home controlled by qToggle.
    Show All Most smart irrigation controllers currently on the market are overly
    complex, with a wide range of capabilities, making them far too elaborate and
    expensive for small independent gardeners. On the other hand, smart irrigation
    companies usually only offer the irrigation controller and the app, we have proposed
    a complete irrigation solution, hardware, and software. Our goal is to provide
    a “do it yourself” irrigation system for gardens, along with three different scenarios:
    manual, automatic, and sensor-based automation. STATE OF THE ART Irrigation is
    one of the primary needs of agriculture. A lot of research has been done in this
    context and various irrigation systems, based on different technologies and using
    different devices, have been proposed in the literature. Some of them are cheaper
    than others, with different complexity or efficiency. Most of the proposed irrigation
    systems are dedicated to rural agriculture.[4]–[6] These systems are usually complex
    and too expensive for a small, independent garden, or are prohibitive due to the
    financial barrier. Garcia et al.[1] presented a survey aimed at summarizing the
    current state of the art of the research regarding smart irrigation systems. They
    evaluate 128 papers published between 2014 and 2019 and present an overview of
    the most utilized technologies employed to implement IoT based smart irrigation
    systems. Analyzing the papers already published in the literature, some conclusions
    can be drawn. The best node for an IoT irrigation system is chosen considering
    the necessities and the characteristics a user wants for the system. Arduino boards
    are the most used nodes for the implementation of IoT irrigation systems. Koprda
    et al.[7] proposed the automated control and remote management of an irrigation
    system using an Arduino board and the Android operating system as a solution.
    The system is fully controlled by an online interface and requires an active connection
    to the Internet. Arduino boards are used by Karpagam et al.[8]–[11] as well. Arduino
    is highly flexible, open source, not expensive, and easy to program. However,
    Arduino is not designed to handle the large complexity of more complex projects
    due to scaling issues. Garcia et al.[1] claim that 59 papers used an Arduino board.
    The Raspberry family was frequently used as well since they are more potent than
    the Arduino boards, having powerful computing abilities that allow the implementation
    of more demanding software and algorithms, hence the choice of the Raspberry Pi
    board for the proposed system. The selection of the processor (controller) depends
    on the characteristics of the IoT irrigation system considering the type of crop
    and the irrigation needs. The microcontroller used for the proposed irrigation
    system is the ESP8266 chip. The communication technology represents a key point
    to achieve successful operation. In many papers in the literature, the authors
    combine several communication technologies, for example, the authors use either
    a wired or a wireless technology to connect the sensors with the nodes, and a
    wireless technology to send data from nodes to storage centers. The most used
    communication technology in most papers is WiFi, probably due to its accessibility.
    Most low-cost devices for IoT usually support WiFi and small farms are able to
    provide enough wireless coverage with several low-cost devices. GSM and ZigBee
    are widely used wireless technologies as well, for example, Goap et al.[10],[12]
    GSM provides long-range communication at the cost of a mobile plan of the service
    provider that operates in the area. ZigBee provides low energy consumption, but
    it has lower data rates than other technologies and its range imply the deployment
    of many nodes. The communication used in this project is Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Most
    of the papers in the literature use sensors based on the conductivity between
    two electrodes, the most popular being the YL69 sensor, which was used in this
    article as well. Wireless sensor network (WSN) technology has also been used in
    irrigation projects by Astutiningtyas et al.[9],[10],[13]–[15] Most irrigation
    systems do not have access to the power grid or may only receive power during
    a given time period. The use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs, which
    is an advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas. Many surveyed
    papers use solar energy to power their proposed irrigation system. Starting this
    year, the irrigation system proposed will be using solar energy thanks to the
    photovoltaic panels installed. The contributions of this article are both hardware
    and software. The hardware part of project, including the system inside well and
    the piping part described in section “QTOGGLE as an IoT Framework,” has been designed
    and installed by the authors. In addition, the qToggle system, including the qToggle
    app described in section “Irrigation System Architecture,” has been fully developed
    by our team. Another contribution of the proposed system resides in the fact that
    it lowers the barrier of entry to smart homes by reducing upfront costs and preventing
    vendor lock in. This allows a wider consumer pool to access smart home solutions
    both for residential and industrial needs. QTOGGLE AS AN IOT FRAMEWORK The proposed
    irrigation system represents a small part of the qToggle project, which is a complex
    automation project, with many functionalities that could transform a normal house
    into a smart home. The system can be monitored and controlled from any part of
    the world very easily, using a mobile app, entirely developed by our team. qToggle
    proposes a standard way of interconnecting devices. qToggle is built around a
    flexible, but powerful application programming interface (API), allowing devices
    to work together. The idea behind qToggle is to control programmable systems having
    a TCP/IP stack via simple HTTP requests. These systems can be, for example, single-board
    computers or TCP/IP-enabled microcontrollers. Features that make qToggle special
    are the following: a unitary and consistent solution that integrates all required
    features, device provisioning and management, firmware update over the same unique
    API used by all devices, the use of expressions allowing intelligent and complex
    rules to be implemented between various sensors and actuators inside a network,
    hierarchical master–slave topology offering flexibility and scalability, user
    data staying within the premises of the local network, a cloud connection not
    being needed (for security and privacy reasons), and the integrated web app that
    works well on all major platforms (both desktop and mobile). qToggle provides
    a friendly user interface, which comes in the form of a progressive web application
    (PWA). The advantages of a PWA include the fact that updates are immediate (not
    being served by a vendor platform such as the Play Store or App Store) and there
    is one single code base shared among all platforms. qToggle is designed to be
    used in both mobile and desktop environments. qToggle has been thought as a way
    of interconnecting sensors, actuators, and other data sources with the purpose
    of multiple home automations, control, monitoring, and security, a system that
    could be continuously developed and improved. One of the key features of the qToggle
    IoT platform is its ability to run without a cloud connection. More precisely,
    many users are concerned with their data leaving their premises. Therefore, we
    designed the web app that runs on the mobile phone in such a way that it can securely
    connect to the hub directly, using HTTPS, without the need of an intermediate
    server. Simplifying the system in this way has the advantages of reducing the
    number of parties involved (and thus the overall latency as well as operational
    costs), while increasing the security. Probably one of the biggest differences
    between qToggle and its competitors is that our target audience includes users
    without a technical background, who prefer intuitive, off-the-shelf solutions
    with minimal setup requirements and a smooth learning curve. qToggle also caters
    to users who require an IoT solution that is cheap and easy to install, does not
    lock one in to a specific vendor and scales very well, thus reducing the entry
    barrier for home and garden automation, one of the major impediments to the adoption
    of smart home solutions. IRRIGATION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE The basic elements of
    the proposed irrigation system are: the well, the master hub connected to the
    Raspberry Pi, and the sprinklers network (including the links). When sprinkler
    heads are placed in the ground, they must follow a precise “architecture,” called
    “head-to-head” spacing, for the best coverage. This means that each sprinkler
    must overlap part of the area watered by the adjacent sprinkler. Even though this
    overlap might seem like a water waste, it is a real necessity. Without this overlap,
    it would be impossible to obtain uniform water coverage. Water pressure is another
    important parameter when designing an irrigation system. If the water flow is
    limited, the irrigation system is divided into zones to ensure there is always
    enough water flow to operate one zone in the irrigation system. For the case study
    presented in this article, we have divided the space into five zones (A-E). Thus,
    the system inside the well (shown in Figure 2) contains: five electric valves
    (Rain Bird DV/DVF valves), each one corresponding to a zone, one water pump, a
    Raspberry Pi board connected to the house LAN, a pressure switch, and an expansion
    tank. Additionally, for the scenario involving moisture sensors, Figure 2 includes
    the five sensors A-E, corresponding to each of the five zones. Each humidity sensor
    is connected to an ESP8266 chip. Figure 2. Diagram of the irrigation system and
    the system inside the well (the blue rectangle). Show All The Rain Bird DV/DVF
    valves (Diaphragm valves)[16] are premium products, representing the first choice
    of industry leaders worldwide, with more than 20 years of proven performance.
    The type of water pump is a standard 1.1 kW pump, with a maximum water debit of
    70 l/min. In Figure 2, the water circuit is represented with solid lines and the
    electrical circuit with dashed lines. The pressure switch is an electronic device
    that starts and stops the pump motor according to the detected pressure. We used
    the following model: Easy Press II, with a maximum pressure of 10 bar and a flow
    of 12 000 l/hr. The expansion tank has a volume of 24 liters and a maximum pressure
    of 8 bars. The aim of the expansion tank is to reduce the water pumpon–off switching
    rate. This is accomplished by accumulating up to 8 bars of pressure inside it.
    By limiting the on–offswitching rate, the cost is not only reduced, due to power
    consumption, but the life of the water pump is increased as well. The irrigation
    controller will ideally be controlled in turn by a master hub. While both are
    powered by Raspberry Pi boards, the controller is a terminal node in the network
    and is usually placed close to the valves. The master hub is typically installed
    in a central location as it serves as the nexus for managing all other interconnected
    devices. Even though there are various boards and platforms that could be used
    for this purpose,[17] our choice was the Raspberry Pi board. The reason for choosing
    Raspberry Pi boards, other than the low price, was the energy efficiency, the
    programming facility (Raspberry Pi uses Python, a programming language with relatively
    fewer lines of code and less complexity), small hardware footprint (RAM and CPU),
    the fact that it is future proof, the many available GPIOs, and its several roles
    in the IoT system, at the same time. Moreover, most of the software and projects
    done on Raspberry Pi are open source and are maintained by online user communities,
    always excited about new challenges. The humidity sensors chosen in this project,
    for the sensor-based scenario, are the popular YL69 from SparkFun and the microcontroller
    is the ESP8266 chip, a low-price Wi-Fi module perfectly suited for projects in
    the IoT field. The humidity sensors are connected to the irrigation controller
    and continuously send values for the relative humidity of the soil. These values
    are then grouped by zone and used to compute the min/max and average humidities
    for each zone. The automation consists in deciding how much of the total allocated
    watering time will be used for the respective zone. The proposed irrigation system
    can be monitored and controlled very easily, using a mobile app, the qToggle app.
    Using the qToggle app, users will be able to monitor and control the irrigation
    system from any part of the world. An important metric related to an irrigation
    system is the adequate quantity of water used for irrigation. There are various
    factors that influence the calculation of this amount: the geographical area,
    the season/weather, the type of soil, the type of crops, the type of sprinklers
    (each of them having their own range of precipitation rates and flow, depending
    on the choice of nozzle), water pressure, etc. Each type of nozzle has its own
    operating specifications, given by datasheets, for example, pressure (in bar),
    radius (in m) or flow rate (in l/hr). Here we employ nozzles with producer specifications
    as in Li et al.[5] Lawns usually need 15 to 25 mm of water per week, either from
    natural or artificial sources, usually a combination of both. To estimate potential
    water usage, we employ a simple but effective approximation: one liter of water
    will cover one square meter to a depth of one millimeter. Thus, to apply 15 mm
    of irrigation weekly, 15 liters of water are needed for each square meter. The
    necessary watering time can be computed as: t= Q n ∗A F , where Q n =15 liters
    needed for each square meter, A is the area in square meters, corresponding to
    each zone, F is the total flow (measured in cubic meters per hour) calculated
    as a sum of flows corresponding to all sprinklers in a zone. These calculations
    are no longer needed when using moisture sensors. The type of sensors used in
    this project are YL69,[18] a simple, low cost sensor used for measuring moisture
    in different types of materials. The output voltage for this sensor ranges between
    3.3 and 5 V and the output values are related to soil moisture: 0 to 300 for a
    dry soil and 300 to 700 for a humid soil, respectively. Each sensor is connected
    to the analog digital converter (ADC) input of a microcontroller (ESP8266 chip
    in this case). The ADC converts the input voltage into digital data that can be
    processed by the qToggle server running on top of the Raspberry Pi. In the end,
    the qToggle server is provided with five input values representing the soil humidity
    percentages for each of the five zones. A SPECIFIC CASE STUDY A suite of irrigation
    systems is described in the literature or already available on the market. The
    combination of technology and setup difficulty associated with each on them varies,
    as do their pros and cons regarding complexity, costs, performances, and so on.
    Our goal in this article is to present a “do it yourself” system that is simple,
    cheap, and performant. Figure 3 shows real pictures for the irrigation system
    inside the well. Figure 3. Real picture of the system inside the well. Show All
    In what follows, we consider three potential irrigation scenarios. Scenario 1:
    Manual irrigation systems. The manual scenario is based exclusively on human interaction.
    The user starts and stops the irrigation corresponding to the areas of interest
    whenever he wants, and in whichever zone(s) he wants. This scenario is useful
    when, for example, the weather changes suddenly (in case of a storm). Scenario
    2: Schedule based irrigation systems. The second scenario involves irrigation
    schedules. The user can set schedules, by turning on the Daily Schedule function
    on the qToggle app. Adjustments can be made using: Morning factor, Evening factor,
    Morning time, and Evening time. The user can select the time in the morning and
    evening when the irrigation should start and also select the amount of water by
    adjusting the Morning/Evening factor. We have computed (using 1) the minimum necessary
    run time for the sprinkler system, for each zone and we have obtained the following
    results: 10 min/day for zones B and D, 4 min/day for zone A and 6 min/day for
    zone C. These results should be adjusted taking into consideration the position
    of the garden (north/south), if there are shaded areas, if the summer is very
    hot, etc. If the proper quantity of water is not calculated, the tendency is to
    overwater. Figure 4 presents the irrigation setup on the qToggle app, for Scenario
    1 and Scenario 2. Figure 4. qToggle app for irrigations. Show All Scenario 3:
    Sensor-based automatic systems. Humidity sensors are used to determine the appropriate
    schedule for irrigation. The humidity sensors are set to measure the soil humidity
    at the time of the day when the schedules are set. If the soil is dry, the sprinklers
    will start, if not, the irrigation is postponed until the next scheduled time.
    The concept is straightforward: the sensor measures the soil electrical resistance.
    A low resistance value indicates a high moisture content in the soil, while a
    high value is a sign of soil dryness. This signal is given to the microcontroller
    (the ESP chip), which transmits it to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi processes
    the received moisture content data from the ESP chip and makes a decision regarding
    the water needs of the field, that is to say, open the electric valves or keep
    them shut. The valve in turn, acts on the pressure switch which commands the water
    pump. The sensor must be calibrated to reach the highest effectiveness of the
    irrigation system and may vary depending on environmental factors such as soil
    type, temperature, or electric conductivity. Details on sensor calibration are
    given in.[13] The equipment with the microcontroller (ESP chip) and the humidity
    sensor is shown in Figure 5. The ESP chip is powered by solar energy. Figure 5.
    Equipment with the microcontroller and the humidity sensor. Show All When using
    sensors, the climatic parameters make the irrigation routine more efficient. Smart
    irrigation systems bring savings, in terms of lower water waste, but they also
    diminish the need for manual labor. Also, by replacing manually operated watering
    systems with an automatic one, the chances of crops dying due to excessive or
    insufficient watering are minimized. Some results are given in Table 1, for three
    months in 2020, in a specific village in Romania, where the system has been implemented.
    The results correspond to Scenario 3. It should be mentioned that zone B and C
    are south-oriented, Zone A is west oriented, and placed between two buildings,
    so it is mostly shaded, while zone D has trees and is also partially shaded. Without
    sensors, water waste would have occurred in specific days when the soil was still
    wet. Table 1. Results for Three Months, Scenario 3. The results obtained for water
    usage have been calculated taking into account the necessary run time for the
    sprinkler system, for each zone, the water debit of the pump, the number of rainy
    days (first column in Table 1), and the number of days when we have irrigated
    for each month (third and fourth columns in Table 1). The values presented in
    the last column represent the total amount of water, corresponding to all zones.
    Regarding the price, the whole irrigation system costs around 760 USD, including
    the system inside the well, the irrigation controller, nozzles, and piping network,
    while the irrigation controller itself retails for around 70 USD. The qToggle
    app is open source and free for the consumer. In comparison, commercial vendors
    typically offer their own built in system and application packages at higher costs.
    This also implies a lock-in factor for the user, as the applications and control
    systems are not compatible with other off the shelf components. As an example,
    the closest similar solution we could identify on the market is OpenSprinkler,
    which is an open-source, web-based smart sprinkler controller for lawn and plant
    watering. Nevertheless, just the controller costs alone can vary between 80 and
    186 USD in this case. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this article, we have proposed
    a simple, low cost, easily scalable, smart irrigation system that has all the
    above-mentioned characteristic. Our approach can be crucial in reducing water
    usage and waste in the house, prevent unwanted flooding or droughts, and reduce
    the overall time spent in watering and caring for the garden. Further, we have
    shown that by using real-life data from smart sensors, we can incorporate weather
    patterns and soil properties into the irrigation feedback loop. Because we chose
    off the shelf, open components, our system is readily available to anyone at a
    reduced cost, compared to other commercial solutions. Also, by avoiding vendor
    lockdown, our project offers seamless integration with other components and the
    qToggle environment, allowing the smart irrigation system to become an active
    component in the smart home with both offline and online control and reporting
    functionality. Finally, our simple approach to both the hardware setup and software
    application means most users will easily be able to make use of our system with
    little training required. In this context, we believe our smart irrigation system,
    as an integral component of the qToggle framework, can become a key player in
    the smart home market and is in line with current trends in consumer electronics
    and the main topics of interest in the field, specifically, interconnection, automation,
    and data awareness. Sprinkler systems require a certain water flow or pressure
    to operate properly. If there is too little flow or pressure, the irrigation system
    will not work properly. Even with the zone division of the lawn, sometimes, due
    to the undersizing of the water network in some villages. For example, in areas
    with a lot of new houses using the same water network, the irrigation system can
    face problems. Therefore, future versions will rely on artificial intelligence,
    which will monitor water pressure trends and will determine the proper interval
    for watering. Another future idea is the use of sustainable energy and photovoltaic
    panels for the valves and water pump. A prototype for the later is already being
    tested with initial results being promising. Authors Figures References Citations

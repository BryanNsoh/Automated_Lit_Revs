    becoming an increasingly crucial decision-making task whose goal is to achieve
    effective and efficient use of water (Saggi and Jain, 2022). The crop quality
    and yield are significantly dependent on the amount of water and timing. The objective
    of irrigation scheduling is to apply an adequate amount of water at the right
    time to a specific crop. However, according to a survey by the US Department of
    Agriculture, more than 75% of irrigation scheduling methods applied by farmers
    in the US are based on the Checkbook method (Vellidis et al., 2016), and the condition
    of crops such as visual observations, crop calendars and observing what the neighbors
    are doing (USDA, 2017). Inefficient irrigation scheduling methods may result in
    over-irrigation or under-irrigation. Consequently, water scarcity, nutrient leaching,
    and increased soil salinity if groundwater is used for irrigation can be observed
    in over-irrigated regions or yield an economic loss in under-irrigated farms.
    Science- and technology-based irrigation scheduling approaches, as opposed to
    the Checkbook method or the condition of crop method, may boost crop profit while
    reducing environmental consequences by limiting crop water stress (Zhang et al.,
    2021). Model-based crop water demand assessment falls under three categories,
    deterministic methods, process-based models, and machine learning (ML) methods.
    Deterministic methods such as FAO-56 calculate irrigation water demand based on
    crop evapotranspiration approaches (Allen et al., 2005). Process-based models
    such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Aquacrop, Decision Support System
    for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), and the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator
    (APSIM) usually determine crop water requirement by simulating biophysical processes
    leading to plants’ growth in the soil-plant-atmosphere system using mathematical
    formulations of those processes. ML models, on the other hand, are data-driven,
    they estimate irrigation needs by learning the hidden function that relates input
    weather and soil data to crop water demands. All techniques have been applied
    in irrigation scheduling for different crops in various regions across the globe.
    However, process-based models are highly sensitive to uncertainties associated
    with physical processes such as initial and boundary conditions and spatiotemporal
    variability of soil moisture conditions than are deterministic and ML models (Karandish
    and Šimůnek, 2016, Gumiere et al., 2020, Li et al., 2020). Consequently, process-based
    models need extensive and constant calibration as new data are generated to accurately
    compute irrigation needs. Furthermore, process-based models are more suitable
    for irrigation planning than for real-time irrigation decision-making (Gu et al.,
    2020). Process-based models lack a way to explicitly enhance real-time soil moisture
    prediction by incorporating weather forecasts or feedback from soil moisture sensors.
    For instance, SWAT has shown consistent overestimation of the irrigation amount
    when used for irrigation scheduling which compromises the model’s accuracy in
    automated irrigation control (Sun and Ren, 2014, Maier and Dietrich, 2016). Fortunately,
    real-time irrigation prediction and scheduling can be achieved thanks to technological
    developments such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) that enhance data availability
    and the increased computational power enabling the operation of ML models in real-time.
    Examples of such applications include an irrigation system developed by Glória
    et al. (2021) to attain the best water-saving schedule using real-time data, and
    smart irrigation strategies that predict irrigation water use using several ML
    algorithms (see Tace et al., 2022). The application of ML in irrigation scheduling
    promoted agricultural productivity and water use efficiency (Hunsaker et al.,
    2005, Karasekreter et al., 2013, Nachankar et al., 2018, Nawandar and Satpute,
    2019, Jamroen et al., 2020, Jimenez et al., 2020). With novel data collection
    techniques, the quantity of available data at a finer spatial-temporal scale,
    also known as big data, has increased in an unprecedented way (Donratanapat et
    al., 2020, Huang et al., 2019). Big data can be leveraged to find appropriate
    solutions for the problems faced by farmers (García et al., 2020), such as water
    shortage, and crop and cost management (Elijah et al., 2018). ML technologies
    can be leveraged to use big data for irrigation water use simulation. Indeed,
    the integration of ML technologies with big data enables irrigation estimation
    to be undertaken in more intelligent and efficient ways hence ensuring water sustainability
    for the growing world’s population (Sharma et al., 2021). Recent studies have
    investigated how ML can benefit the agricultural sectors by improving irrigation
    systems (Nemali and van Iersel, 2006, Liu et al., 2021). ML has been used to improve
    traditional ways of carrying out agricultural activities such as irrigation control
    and management (Tseng et al., 2018, Dahane et al., 2020, Torres-Sanchez et al.,
    2020). Indeed, ML has been employed to build intelligent data-driven models and
    provide the best solution for irrigation scheduling by learning the hidden relationship
    in datasets. The outcomes of the ML irrigation model can benefit farmers in numerous
    ways. ML algorithms can predict irrigation water requirements based on the study
    of evaporation processes through collected data and determine soil moisture variations
    over time. The soil moisture content can then be used as an indicator of when
    and how much to irrigate. This information can provide early intelligence to farmers
    to enhance their irrigation decisions. Currently, there are several ML methods
    available to predict irrigation water demand that have been applied in different
    farm settings. Liou et al. (2001) were among the first scholars who applied ML
    models, i.e., an error-propagation learning back-propagation neural network, to
    estimate soil moisture from simulated brightness temperature. In a sequence, Dibike
    et al. (2001) demonstrated the potential of support vector machine (SVM) to outperform
    artificial neural network (ANN) in remote sensing image classification and regression
    problems. Gill et al. (2006) used SVM to predict soil moisture in four to seven
    days ahead of time using historical data with forecasts that were quite comparable
    to the actual soil moisture measurements. In another study, Shrestha and Shukla
    (2015) utilized SVM to estimate crop evapotranspiration using lysimeter-based
    measurements for vine and erect crops to train the model. They found that the
    SVM model surpassed ANN and boosted the accuracy of FAO-56 crop evapotranspiration
    estimates by 4%. Soil moisture measurements became possible with the emergence
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the availability of enhanced and more accessible
    soil sensing and field communication technology (Kamienski et al., 2018, García
    et al., 2020). Major drawbacks of ML algorithms, however, are massive data requirement,
    black-boxiness, uncertainty associated with simulation(Tabas and Samadi, 2022),
    automatically deducing the features, and optimally tuning them for the desired
    outcomes (e.g., Windheuser et al., 2023). Overfitting and bias are two other common
    deficiencies in ML algorithms. Overfitting is a major issue in ML and occurs when
    a model cannot generalize well on unseen data during the testing period. Over-fitted
    models tend to capture all the trends in the data, including unavoidable noise
    on the training set, instead of learning the hidden relationship between features.
    The main causes of overfitting are noisy data, insufficient training data, and
    model complexities. In this review paper, we discuss existing opportunities to
    address these issues and provide a path for future ML research in irrigation decision-making.
    This review paper aims to (i) assess how ML has been used as an intelligent simulation
    model to promote water management in the irrigation sector, (ii) discuss the results
    of ML models applied in various agricultural water use simulation research, and
    (iii) highlight the limitations that hinder the effective performance of ML models
    in irrigation prediction and scheduling. By doing so, we discussed the applicability
    of various ML algorithms in irrigation management, articulated their weakness
    and strengths, and identified the knowledge gaps and the next steps to promote
    the application of these intelligent algorithms in irrigation scheduling. The
    remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief introduction
    to ML as well as the most used algorithms in irrigation prediction. Section 3
    presents surveyed studies that used ML approaches in irrigation-related studies.
    Section 4 presents existing limitations in the use of ML models and how they can
    be addressed, Section 5 highlights different ways to add physics into ML models,
    while Section 6 discusses major results from developed irrigation tools. Section
    7 draws major conclusion of the paper. 2. Machine learning modelling concepts
    ML, defined as \"the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically
    through experience and by using data\" (Mitchell, 2007), has been used in agriculture
    due to the increased availability of data and the need to improve traditional
    farming practices. IoT is an emerging technology that uses smart sensors and devices
    interconnected through the internet to collect data and transmit them to a server
    with no or limited human intervention. As such, it allows continuous monitoring
    and management of soil and climate conditions and promotes efficient farm management.
    ML and IoT enable big data collection and modeling, and farm machinery modernization
    that gives rise to precision agriculture, also known as smart farming. Precision
    agriculture is the use of up-to-date information technologies, smart devices,
    and software tools to support decision-making in agriculture (Pierce and Nowak,
    1999). It aims at increasing the farm’s profitability by reducing the cost of
    production while improving environmental sustainability. ML algorithms fall under
    three categories, as illustrated by Fig. 1: supervised learning, unsupervised
    learning, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. In supervised learning,
    the developed model uses information from labeled inputs and outputs to find the
    functional relationships between them. Supervised learning can be used to predict
    categorical output values in which case a classification algorithm is used, on
    the other hand, if the value to be predicted is numerical, a regression algorithm
    can be used. In the unsupervised learning category, the learning algorithm uses
    unlabelled datasets to find the pattern that maps inputs to outputs. RL uses an
    agent to make a decision by interacting with the environment aiming at finding
    proper actions that maximize rewards and minimize penalties through trial and
    error. Deep learning (DL), a subset of ML, is also illustrated in Fig. 1. DL models
    can abstract features from high dimensional time series datasets and use multiple
    layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input data.
    This review paper is mostly focused on broader ML models, even though some review
    examples of DL models for irrigation demand modeling are also provided. Download

    Different types of ML algorithms. Three key steps are followed in building ML
    models to perform prediction tasks (see Fig. 2). Firstly, the input data is pre-processed
    by carrying out data cleaning to remove noise and missing data using data transformation
    methods such as discretization or normalization. The model is then trained and
    calibrated with the training dataset to find the function that relates the inputs
    to the outputs by determining a set of parameters that give the best results (Mahesh,
    2018, Oden Technologies, 2023). After this process, a new dataset (validation
    dataset) is used to evaluate the performance of the model. Once an overall satisfactory
    performance is achieved, the model can be tested on an unseen dataset, the performance
    of the testing period determines ML''s ability to accurately perform a task based
    on the learned experience. Supervised learning and RL are recently used for irrigation
    water use modeling which are discussed in the following sections. Download : Download

    of ML approaches for irrigation water use modelling. 2.1. Machine learning algorithms
    commonly used in irrigation scheduling Most ML algorithms for regression problems
    estimate a mapping function that can predict the output variables (Y) for new
    input data (X). Some popular examples of ML algorithms are Linear Regression,
    Random Forest (RF), Boosting Classifiers, Support Vector Machines, and Long Short-term
    Memory (LSTM). Here we briefly explain different ML models. Readers are referred
    to Kecman (2005), Kavitha et al. (2016), and Tabas and Samadi (2022) for more
    details on ML algorithms. 2.1.1. Random forest Inspired by the work of Amit and
    Geman (1997), Breiman (2001) introduced RF. RF is a collection of tree-structured
    classifiers {h(x, ѳk), k = 1,…} formed based on a set of input vectors (X = X1,
    X2, …, Xn) and random vectors (ѳk) sampled independently but with a similar distribution
    to find a prediction function (f(X)) that can accurately predict the variable
    of interest (Y). RF can be used to solve classification or regression problems.
    After multiple (k) runs, the majority vote of the predictions given by each tree
    is the answer for classification problems whereas the predictions'' average is
    considered the model output for regression problems. Fig. 3 illustrates the workflow
    of RF simulation. The accuracy of the prediction function is given by the loss
    function L (Y, f(X)) which is a measure of the closeness of f(X) to Y. Thus, the
    optimum prediction function minimizes the expected value of the loss function
    EXY (L, f(X)). Download : Download high-res image (137KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The workflow of RF simulation. 2.1.2. Boosting classifiers
    Boosting is a type of ensemble method that builds a good performing model (strong
    learner) by adding up several models in an attempt to combine multiple simulations
    until an accurate prediction is achieved or a maximum number of models are added.
    This is done in a sequential learning process where each model learns from the
    errors of its predecessor and tries to correct them. Popular Boosting ensemble
    models include Adaptive boosting (Adaboost) and Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB).
    In the Adaboost, observations are weighted, and less weight is given to instances
    already well classified whereas those that are more difficult to classify are
    given more weight to be handled by new learners. GTB uses a loss function such
    as squared error to minimize the error as models are added up. 2.1.3. Long short-term
    memory LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) developed by Hochreiter
    and Schmidhuber (1997). Unlike the traditional RNN, LSTM networks allow information
    to persist, thus managing the problem of the vanishing gradient in the traditional
    RNN. The LSTM has a hidden state known as short-term memory and an additional
    cell state, which is the long-term memory. The main attribute of LSTM networks
    is that they can remember information for a long time. Fig. 4 illustrates the
    structure of an LSTM network. As illustrated, the information flow is regulated
    by three gates; the forget gate determines if the information from the previous
    time step should be kept or forgotten, the input gate learns new information from
    the current time step and adds it to the cell, and the output gate that transmits
    the updated information from the current time step to the next one. Download :

    Reinforcement learning algorithms RL is an ML approach where the algorithm learns
    how to map situations to actions by interacting with its environment to attain
    a goal. This continuous interaction with the environment forms a closed loop problem
    solving system where the selected actions depend on learned experience through
    a series of interactions with the environment and the rewards received per each
    action chosen (see Fig. 5). The goal of the RL algorithm is to maximize the cumulative
    rewards through the interactive feedback mechanism that differentiates RL from
    other ML algorithms. Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. RL agent and its interaction with a physical environment
    (i.e., a farm system). RL uses a mathematical model, i.e., the Markov Decision
    Process (MDP), to solve a problem. MDP uses a property that enables the next state
    and reward to be computed given that the current state and action are known. More
    precisely, the agent interacts with the environment in a time sequence of discrete
    time steps. At each time step t, the agent receives the current state of the environment
    with S being the set of all possible states and then selects an action where represents
    actions that can be taken in state . Following the action taken, the agent will
    then be given a reward and the environment transits to a new state . The goal
    of the agent is to maximize the cumulative rewards received from the environment.
    The measure of the values of possible action “a” at state “s” pairs that can be
    taken by the algorithm is determined by a value function . This function can be
    optimized through a series of iterations to give the optimal state action pair
    that results in the highest reward at each time step. For complex environments
    with a high dimensional state-action space, the value function (Q-value) is not
    suitable for defining the reward of each pair. Consequently, a more advanced RL
    algorithm known as Deep Q-Network (DQN) consisting of a combination of Q-learning
    and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is used to solve such complex problems. Instead
    of determining the cumulative reward based on the value function table, DQN leverages
    DNN to approximate the Q-values, the network takes the environment state as input
    and predicts the Q-values for each action. Focusing on RL applications in irrigation
    water use simulation, researchers define the state as actual observations to determine
    a sequence of optimal irrigation that is related to a farm’s environment such
    as soil moisture, crop growth status, and weather conditions. The agent, which
    is the learner and decision maker, is represented by the irrigation system while
    actions are the various choices made by the agent on the amount of irrigation
    water to apply. The reward function (R) is the profit made at the end of the season
    after the expenses associated with irrigating are covered and the goal of the
    agent is to perform a set of actions that maximizes this profit. 3. Literature
    review The literature review focused on collecting a wide selection of refereed
    journals from major publishers. A total of 56 publications were initially found.
    Among them, 16 studies were selected as they were more relevant to the application
    of ML algorithms in irrigation prediction and decision-making. These 16 studies
    are discussed as follows. Navarro-Hellín et al. (2016) were the first scholars
    to use Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Fuzzy Inference Systems
    (ANFIS) to predict the weekly irrigation run time of three drip irrigated citrus
    plantations in Spain. The goal was to find the irrigation duration that maximizes
    the yield while optimally managing water. Using volumetric water content, soil
    water potential and crop evapotranspiration as input data, the predicted irrigation
    run time by the two models were evaluated against irrigation reports provided
    by an agronomist. Both models accurately predicted the irrigation pattern followed
    by the agronomist but ANFIS outperformed PLSR by giving a better estimation of
    weekly irrigation amount. Sun et al. (2017) developed a RL algorithm to perform
    irrigation planning and scheduling. A neural network was used to emulate DSSAT
    in predicting seasonal total soil water content using irrigation and weather information
    as input. A second neural network was then used to predict crop yield using the
    predicted total soil water content. The crop yield prediction was then used as
    the training data to train the RL model. Soil moisture and yield were predicted
    to train the model and find the optimal irrigation schedule that maximizes the
    net return (see Equation 1). The net return was then taken into consideration
    in the model to measure economic gain and adapt to future changes in the produce
    and water price. The model was tested by simulating maize planted fields in Temple,
    Texas, (USA), Kunnunurra (Australia), Hyderabad, (India), and for wheat yield
    prediction in Saskatchewan (Canada). The predicted total soil water results were
    used by an irrigation controller to apply an adaptive amount of water as needed.
    This technique enabled automatic irrigation and surpassed threshold and fixed-based
    irrigation in the tested locations by achieving a higher net return. The developed
    irrigation system addresses the dynamic and complex nature of irrigation scheduling
    and control by taking into consideration the current and future soil water content
    variations to adaptively optimize irrigation schedules which is a significant
    contribution to improved water efficiency in irrigation systems. Its limitation,
    however, is that it is restricted to a small total soil water space and is not
    suitable for large-scale problems (continuous soil water space). Furthermore,
    the proposed system has not been tested with actual field conditions, therefore
    its performance cannot be validated in real applications. Net return = yield (kg/ha)
    * price of product (dollars/kg) – water use (ha-mm/ha) * price of water (dollars/mm)
    Equation 1. Kumar et al. (2017) created a fully automated intelligent irrigation
    system based on IoT to gather temperature, soil moisture, and raindrop sensor
    data. The data collected is used by a microcontroller for analysis of the irrigation
    needs of several crops including beans, curry leaves, lady fingers, moringa, and
    radish. A motor is activated for irrigating the field when moisture values drop
    below a threshold range. Using recorded temperature and water flow data, a linear
    regressor is used to predict the next irrigation water requirement. The system
    then schedules irrigation based on the irrigation amount predicted by activating/deactivating
    a relay which in turn activates or deactivates a solenoid valve as needed. The
    linear regression model is updated in case there is a change in the data. The
    system also includes a mobile app that enables users to have access to field data
    remotely. The performance of the system was, however, not compared to other irrigation
    demand assessment approaches, nor did the authors specify how much water can be
    saved. This work contributed to advancing the automation of irrigation systems
    to enable remote monitoring and control. Its innovative incorporation of IoT technology
    with ML for water demand assessment and scheduling was a stepping stone for achieving
    better results in water use optimization with limited labor. Goap et al. (2018)
    developed a smart irrigation system based on IoT and ML techniques. A combination
    of sensor-collected field data such as soil moisture, soil temperature, Ultraviolet
    (UV) light radiation, and weather forecast data including precipitation, air temperature,
    and other variables, was used to compute future soil moisture based on which irrigation
    requirements were determined. The smart irrigation architecture consists of an
    IoT data collection system that collects, transmits, and processes sensor data
    and weather forecasts. A soil moisture prediction algorithm was developed as a
    combination of SVR and k-means clustering algorithms that calculate soil moisture
    change due to weather conditions. An irrigation scheduling algorithm then takes
    the predicted daily soil moisture, retrieves precipitation information to find
    the nearest day it is expected to rain, and computes the required soil moisture
    to maintain crop growth. If the required soil moisture is below the minimum threshold
    a command is sent to a relay switch to start the water motor and vice versa. A
    responsive web portal is used to view the projected soil moisture along with expected
    rainfall and to start or stop irrigation. The algorithm achieved a correlation
    coefficient and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.56 and 0.135 respectively, when
    estimated soil moisture deficit (SMD) was compared to sensor-based SMD. The limitation
    of this work is that no water-saving analysis was performed to assess its potential
    against other systems. Additionally, the experiment was performed in a garden,
    so there is no record of its performance on a larger area such as a farm system.
    On the other hand, the study exemplifies how fully autonomous smart irrigation
    systems can be developed using sensor-collected data and weather forecasts to
    run ML algorithms and predict water demand. Concurrently, Goldstein et al. (2018)
    used regression and classification algorithms to build an ML model based on sensor
    and weather data to predict irrigation quantities for jojoba-planted fields in
    Israel as prescribed by an agronomist. These data were subdivided into eight subsets
    of different features to determine the accuracy of the models when inputs were
    changed. LR, Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT), and Boosted Tree Classifier
    (BTC) were used to estimate irrigation water demands. The models were evaluated
    on their ability to provide an irrigation value that is not more than 0.2 mm above
    or below the agronomist’s one. It was observed that LR performed unsatisfactorily
    giving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) equal to 0.466 and a performance accuracy
    of 52.3%. GBRT outperformed LR as the lowest RMSE was 0.11 and the accuracy rate
    reached 92.7%. The BTC algorithm also performed well with an accuracy of 95%.
    It was concluded that non-parametric models perform well compared to LR methods
    in cases where there is a non-linear functional relationship between the dependent
    and independent variables. The authors also observed that the model run with less
    input data (such as the model run without saturation/drought data) provided quite
    similar results to the model in which all the variables were used to train the
    model highlighting the fact that selecting appropriate features is more important
    in achieving satisfactory performance. In another study, Adeyemi et al. (2018)
    developed a predictive irrigation scheduling system using the Feed Forward Neural
    Network (FFNN) model and LSTM. A neural network (NN) model was used to predict
    the one-day-ahead volumetric soil moisture using historical soil moisture and
    climatic data. Based on the predicted soil moisture, crop water requirement, and
    soil water retention, the irrigation depth and timing were determined for a potato
    field. According to the obtained results, the two models performed comparably
    on the validation datasets and provided better predictions than those of a non-ML
    approach that estimates the soil moisture from the average of previously observed
    three-day soil moisture values. However, the LSTM model outperformed the FFNN
    model in terms of regression coefficient when datasets from different sites were
    used. This showed the robustness of LSTM networks in approximating the underlying
    functional relationship between inputs and outputs for situations similar to the
    learned ones. The LSTM model was coupled with AQUACROP to simulate potato crop
    growth and develop a predictive irrigation scheduling system whose goal was to
    maintain the soil moisture within a set of upper and lower boundaries during the
    simulation period. Given the predicted soil moisture, the deficit amount of water
    to reach the upper bound was computed and the irrigation amount was defined as
    the water depth needed to replenish the soil to attain the set threshold. The
    system was compared with a rule-based irrigation system, the former achieved a
    water saving of more than 20% in the three tested sites compared to the latter
    while maintaining the same water use efficiency. Using daily climatic data and
    daily irrigation amount collected in a period of one year, Perea et al., 2019
    developed a model to predict irrigation amount based on farmers’ decisions about
    when to irrigate. The crops grown in the area were drip-irrigated tomato and maize
    and rice, which was flood-irrigated. The purpose of the model was to simulate
    the occurrence of irrigation one day ahead as planned by farmers. This model was
    developed using DT and optimized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the optimal
    DT that accurately simulates farmers’ behavior. Based on the defined objective
    functions, three Classification Trees (CT; CT1, CT2, and CT3) were selected. The
    first CT (CT1) outperformed other DTs by accurately predicting all the observed
    irrigation and no irrigation events, achieving a performance accuracy of 100%
    in both cases. CT2 followed with an accurate classification of 73% of the irrigation
    rates and 93% of no irrigation rates. Lastly, CT3 was able to classify 68% of
    the actual irrigation rates and 93% of no irrigation rates. The developed model
    contributes to irrigation management by providing information on when to schedule
    irrigation and hence could help in better coordinating irrigation activities to
    minimize energy and water loss. Weekly irrigation amounts of orchards of citrus
    trees (orange, mandarina and lemon trees) located in Southeast Spain were predicted
    using a modelling system driven by LR, a random forest regressor (RFR), and SVR
    algorithms (Torres-Sanchez et al., 2020). These algorithms were trained to perform
    the irrigation assessment, as such the goal was to imitate the irrigation recommendations
    of an agronomist. Using the daily average matric potential of the previous five
    days, the total water needs, whether the fruit is gaining weight or not expressed
    as a binary value as input the ML models were trained to output the total irrigation
    amount recommended by the agronomists for the following week. The results were
    compared with irrigation prescriptions by agronomists. Results showed that RFR
    performs better than SVR and LR with an RMSE of 16.83m3, 17.13m3, and 19.5m3,
    respectively. A weekly average error of 9% was obtained when the predicted irrigation
    amount was compared with the agronomist’s report. To overcome the drawbacks of
    traditional RL models such as Q - Network (QN), Yang et al. (2020) proposed a
    deep Q - Network (DQN) to control irrigation scheduling. The difference between
    QN and DQN is that the former generates the value function table while learning
    from the data whereas the latter uses ANNs to compute the value function from
    multi-dimensional input data. Hence ANNs offer the possibility to handle a large
    amount of data and precisely render the irrigation scheduling problem more scalable.
    The environment was interfaced by AQUACROP, and simulations were conducted using
    three crops namely maize, wheat, and soybean. The state of the environment was
    described by the date, crop stage, precipitation, reference ET, total water content
    in the effective root zone, stomatal water content, and irrigation. Actions consisted
    of irrigation amounts from 0 mm to 10 mm with a 0.5 mm increment. Results demonstrated
    that the suggested algorithm outperformed traditional irrigation approaches such
    as constant irrigation, and percentage available water in dry, moderate, and wet
    weather conditions and was closest to the Q learning estimation for dry conditions.
    Coupling AQUACROP with DQN for irrigation scheduling allowed for a more comprehensive
    assessment of crop water demand by enabling the simulation of different crop growth
    scenarios based on the applied irrigation amount. This integration also addresses
    the data scarcity issue often encountered in ML modeling. The system was however
    not directly tested on the farm, the replication of results as far as implementation
    is concerned is thus not ascertained. To determine the right set of features to
    use for determining the irrigation scheduling of a drip-irrigated rice field from
    weather parameters based on ML, Sidhu et al. (2020) used correlation to identify
    the dependencies in the data and guide the selection of feature sets. Features
    with a correlation of 0.7 and above were discarded. The variables found useful
    and used as input features for irrigation scheduling were number of days after
    sowing, maximum temperature, dry bulb at 6:00 AM, humidity at 2:00 PM, soil temperature
    20 cm below surface at 2:00 PM, sunshine hours, wind speed, wind direction, ET,
    number of days since last rain and number of days since last irrigation. Among
    different algorithms used in their study, Decision Tree Regressor (DTR) and Adaboost
    outperformed other algorithms. As noted by Goldstein et al. (2018), LR was unable
    to perform well in predicting irrigation demand. It was also demonstrated that
    Adaboost could perform equally well with a limited number of selected input features.
    Zhou (2020) proposed an RL method that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    to estimate the value function used to train the DQN algorithm. The algorithm
    uses sensor-collected soil data such as moisture and humidity, air temperature
    and air humidity, leaf water potential, and leaf conductance collected from a
    grape-growing greenhouse plantation as input features to train the model. The
    system improved irrigation decision-making on the plantation with no human intervention.
    To overcome the limited learning capability of some previously developed ML models,
    Kashyap et al. (2021) created a Deep Learning Intelligent Irrigation System for
    precision Agriculture (DLiSA) based on NN and IoT-enabled approaches that account
    for climate and soil moisture variations. The system comprises the one-day-ahead
    soil water content predicted by an LSTM model, an irrigation scheduler to compute
    the volume of irrigation water, and an irrigation planner to calculate the duration
    of the irrigation period and the water delivery across the field. Irrigation commands
    are then passed to the actuator nodes from which they get to the water valves.
    The particularity of this system is that it integrates feedback from climate and
    soil sensors which enables it to adapt to local changes and perform well during
    historical periods. A comparison of this irrigation system with those obtained
    with a threshold-based irrigation model and an FFNN showed that 43% and 23% of
    water volume, respectively are saved using DLiSA. Jimenez et al. (2021) used LSTM
    with soil matric potential (SMP) collected at three soil depths (i.e., 150, 300,
    and 600 mm), rainfall, and irrigation amounts as input data to predict irrigation
    schedules during a corn-growing season for sandy clay loam and loamy fine sand
    soils for 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h in advance. In addition, three different LSTM
    models were developed by changing inputs to evaluate the predictability of LSTM
    networks concerning the input data. The input data used for the first model were
    SMP at 150-, 300-, and 600-mm soil depths, management zone, rain, and previously
    applied irrigation; the second model used SMP and management zone, whereas the
    third model only used SMP as input. The results indicated that the same error
    and predictability level obtained for the first model can also be obtained using
    only SMP data. In terms of temporal models’ performance, the 1-hour ahead irrigation
    predictions were accurately predicted the same as the three and six hours-ahead,
    but the accuracy gradually decreased for irrigation predictions of 12- and 24-hours
    advance causing overfitting or underfitting. Nevertheless, it was concluded that
    irrigation prescriptions changes can be accurately forecasted on time by LSTM.
    The authors also noted that using rainfall and irrigation data as input caused
    overfitting in the testing period. This is because rainfall patterns change over
    time and those rainfall amount fluctuations might be unknown for the model. Y.
    Chen et al., 2021 combined several classifiers to form a strong irrigation predicting
    approach using stacking and boosting ensemble learning methods. The model was
    developed to predict irrigation volumes for multiple fields in a greenhouse of
    organic vegetables. Air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature, soil humidity,
    and light intensity data were used as input variables to linear SVR, Support Vector
    Classification (SVC), RF, and DT. Model performances of 0.45, 0.675, 0.645, and
    0.54 were obtained for each model, respectively. Stacked generalization was employed
    to combine the advantages of these algorithms using extreme gradient boosting
    (XGBoost) which improved the performance from 0.58 to 0.64. The best performance
    was obtained when simulated and observed water volumes were compared with 3.33
    and 8.16 for the MAE and RMSE, respectively. Concurrently, Deep Q learning was
    implemented by M. Chen et al., 2021 to perform irrigation scheduling for paddy
    rice using short-term weather forecasts. The input features defining the field
    environment on a daily basis consisted of one week forecasted rain sequence, water
    depth as well as minimum and maximum thresholds of water depth and the maximum
    allowable water depth where the maximum allowable water depth and the maximum
    threshold are determined based on the growth stage. The three irrigation actions
    that are defined to irrigate were no irrigation, supplying 50% or 100% of the
    water needed to attain the maximum water depth. Results showed that no yield losses
    were experienced in the studied period. The DQN was able to consider current field
    water conditions and weather forecasts to efficiently choose to irrigate or delay
    irrigation in order to avoid under or over irrigation which resulted in water
    conservation and increased rainfall use. Comparing irrigation with the flooded
    irrigation strategy, the DQN method reduced water use by 23 mm. This research
    demonstrates how advanced computational techniques based on ML can enhance irrigation
    prediction. By applying weather forecasts in crop water demand assessment to limit
    unnecessary irrigation, more water is conserved compared to conventional irrigation
    methods. The study also underscores the ability of the applied algorithm to optimize
    water despite imperfect weather forecasts thanks to its ability to learn from
    past irrigation experiences and weather forecast uncertainties. More recently,
    Alibabaei et al. (2022) trained a DQN to schedule and optimize irrigation for
    a tomato field. The state of the environment was expressed by a combination of
    average temperature, average relative humidity, precipitation, reference evapotranspiration,
    average wind speed, total soil water in profile, and irrigation amount. Actions
    consisted of irrigation amounts ranging from 0 to 60 mm - ha/ha. The agent environment
    was simulated by two LSTM models. One was to predict the one-day soil moisture
    in advance and the other was used to approximate the seasonal harvest based on
    the growing season environmental conditions and then determine the net return.
    To estimate the Q-table, an ANN, an LSTM, and a CNN were used. LSTM surpassed
    other algorithms because it memorized previous input data and used the retained
    information in the subsequent time steps. The results achieved by the developed
    algorithm showed an increase in the productivity in the test field and a reduction
    of irrigation water in comparison to threshold-based and fixed irrigation by 18%
    to 30%. The crucial finding of this study that showcases the strength of ML models
    is the ability of the developed irrigation system to adapt irrigation scheduling
    to the crop growth stages. At the beginning of the season, the system avoids water
    losses by adopting a lower water supply scheduling which gradually increases as
    the season progresses and eventually reduces to stress the plants towards the
    harvest period. This ensures that enough water is available to sustain the plants
    during the critical growth period and minimizes water losses at the start and
    end of the season. The surveyed studies illustrate the ability of ML algorithms
    to make use of data from different sources including weather forecasts, to assess
    crop water demand and predict irrigation schedules in a more efficient way that
    optimizes water use compared to conventional approaches. The attained water efficiency
    is shown by the amount of water saved as opposed to traditional fixed period or
    threshold value irrigation techniques that do not account for spatial-temporal
    changes in soil, crop, and meteorological variables. With the real-time data acquisition
    approaches enabled by IoT and the progress made in coupling IoT with ML models
    as applied and demonstrated in the several presented studies, ML algorithms hold
    great potential for automating the irrigation decision-making process. This will
    improve further timely irrigation scheduling and eradicate the additional work
    of manually controlling irrigation systems. Applying ML models in irrigation decision-making
    and scheduling is also economically beneficial as the crop water waste, the cost
    of water, and labor demand are minimized. Table 1 summarizes the reviewed studies,
    the algorithm used, and the obtained model performance. Table 1. ML based irrigation

    in irrigation water use modeling 4.1. Data scarcity The performance of ML models
    highly depends on the availability of sufficient data to accurately learn the
    underlying relationship between the predictors and the variable to be predicted.
    Due to the high variability of soil and climatic conditions in space and time,
    data should be available at a fine spatial-temporal resolution for proper results
    to be obtained. Data availability is often a challenge as the collected data by
    sensors such as soil moisture, are point measurements and hence do not represent
    the entire field’s conditions. To obtain representative information about the
    field’s conditions and improve the performance of ML models, many sensors need
    to be installed across the field which can be expensive. In addition, satellite-derived
    data can be useful for irrigation prediction but often are not available at the
    field scale. Satellite data can be an alternative source of data, however, the
    frequency at which data is collected is usually low due to orbital paths. The
    collection of good-quality satellite data is also hindered by the effect of canopy
    or cloudy atmospheric conditions which leads to significant data gaps. Moreover,
    the spatial resolution of these data is sometimes not satisfactory. For instance,
    the presently operating soil moisture products are available at a coarse resolution
    that cannot be directly used in irrigation prediction at the field level if not
    downscaled (Zhang et al., 2021). On the other hand, downscaling data adds more
    uncertainties that can compromise the modeling results. The data scarcity problem
    can be addressed by integrating remote sensing and field sensors’ collected data
    to increase the reliability of simulated results. In the event of low sensor coverage,
    satellite-based measurements can help bridge the spatial-temporal data gap. Satellite
    data such as soil moisture, surface temperature, Leaf Area Index (LAI), etc. can
    be used to supplement sensor data in modeling field conditions after carefully
    downscaling the data to the field level. Satellite-based measurements can also
    be used to validate sensor-measured data by detecting outliers. Having a complete,
    reliable dataset would considerably improve the performance of ML models and allow
    farmers and Extension irrigation specialists to make more informed irrigation
    decisions. Furthermore, most models use soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling
    methods; thus, soil moisture is commonly used as an indicator of crop water stress.
    However, plant water stress-related indices can also be useful predictors to assess
    irrigation demand (Jones, 2004, Gu et al., 2020) but no significant work has been
    done to build ML models for irrigation predictions using these variables. Thus,
    data of either plant-water status, such as measurements of leaf/stem/xylem water
    potential and leaf thickness, or plant physiology, such as sap flow measurements
    by sensors, stomatal conductance, and plant thermal sensing, can potentially enhance
    data availability and irrigation prediction accuracy. In addition, data augmentation
    techniques have been proven to remediate the data scarcity problem. Specifically,
    image data can boost the performance of ML models in irrigation modeling and applications.
    Data augmentation techniques are mostly applied in crop-weed classification (Fawakherji
    et al., 2020, Su et al., 2021, Divyanth et al., 2022, Espejo-Garcia et al., 2023)
    and plant disease diagnosis (Wu et al., 2020, Cap et al., 2022, Huang et al.,
    2022) Data augmentation involves implementing a sequence of methodologies to generate
    new images from the existing image dataset. Data augmentation techniques fall
    into three categories; the first class involves basic augmentation techniques
    that increase the size of a dataset by changing the geometric position of points
    in an image hence generating a new data point examples of this technique are geometric
    transformations such as scaling, rotating, and skewing images. Noise injection
    techniques such as Gaussian or uniform noise are also common techniques to increase
    data samples. They entail adding noise to data to increase the variance. The deformable
    augmentation technique is the second category of data augmentation techniques
    that can be used when the basic techniques do not provide satisfactory variability
    and include methods such as spline interpolation, which uses a piecewise polynomial
    function to interpolate a new data point between two observed points. Using statistical
    shape models is another advanced method to generate new data by using observed
    data and a mathematical model to understand the dataset’s variability and implement
    changes within the limit of possible parameters. The third category of data augmentation
    techniques is generative DL techniques. These approaches increase the volume of
    data by learning features in a dataset to generate synthetic but realistic datasets.
    The most common DL networks are generative adversarial networks (GAN) and their
    variants. Adversarial learning refers to the contest between two NNs, a generator
    and a discriminator. The generator learns to generate new data such that the distribution
    of the generated data is as close as possible to that of the observed data. The
    discriminator, on the other hand, learns to evaluate the generated data and differentiate
    them from authentic data. In addition to increasing the sample size, these techniques
    reduce overfitting by introducing new patterns in the data that can make a model
    more generalizable. 4.2. Noisy and heterogeneous data Data is the foundation of
    every ML project. Hence, preprocessing data prior to their use is an important
    step to ensure data quality and reduce the possibility of defective data that
    hinder model efficiency. Data noise and heterogeneity are the common issues encountered
    during data collection and preprocessing. Raw data contains numerous flaws such
    as missing values, incorrect values, and incorrectly formatted values that introduce
    noise to ML. Directly feeding such data to ML models is inappropriate as they
    may fail to derive the right pattern. Poor data quality can thus lead to significantly
    unsatisfactory performance. Data should be machine-readable, trustworthy, and
    impartial. By ensuring data is correctly classified, data curation can assist
    ML model developers in validating the diversity of training data for irrigation
    modeling applications. Therefore, it is important to statistically analyze and
    understand the data and select suitable methods for removing noise and bias in
    the data. To counteract the substantial bias that data preprocessing methods may
    induce in predictions, it is recommended that maximum entropy constraint be applied
    on the inference step (Pfeiffer et al., 2015), forcing predictions to have a distribution
    similar to the one of observed values. Although data sparseness might persist
    and perhaps be exacerbated by big data, the volume of big data presents exceptional
    prospects for predictive analytics because sufficient frequency may have been
    achieved for diverse sub-samples. On-farm big data are in divergent formats, from
    distinct population samples, and so are very heterogeneous. It can be very tedious
    to transform heterogeneous data into a uniform format. In addition, these heterogeneous
    data may be of different levels of importance in the learning process (Zhou et
    al., 2017). Therefore, adding all the features and giving them equal weights in
    ML models is unlikely to lead to optimal learning results. 4.3. Lack of accessibility
    and reproducibility of data and machine learning models Irrigation data is part
    of large earth system datasets that are produced at the farm scale; however, the
    majority of this data is not openly shared and is unavailable. Other irrigation
    metadata are put into password-protected and key-value data structures that limit
    their findability and accessibility significantly. Open access to data should
    be improved to better serve irrigation scheduling applications (Gu et al., 2020).
    Open data advances research by preventing duplicate data collection efforts freeing
    up resources to gather a more distinct collection of data and a more comprehensive
    record of observations. Secondly, open data regulations promote increased data
    usage and reuse. For example, after enacting the Landsat open and free data policy,
    data downloads increased by 20 times from 2009 to 2017, and, according to the
    annual number of publications, data use increased by four times (Z. Zhu et al.,
    2019). Advancing research is not solely limited to making data readily available
    but also requires the availability of developed software. Providing open access
    to software’s source code allows computational and scientific transparency and
    reproducibility. Scientific reproducibility is evasive if free access to code
    is restricted. Gil et al. (2016) argued that simply providing textual explanations
    of algorithms and code implementation may hamper reproducibility. Moreover, open-source
    software favors software reuse which reduces duplication possibilities, promotes
    the use of open data, and guarantees the code’s lifespan (Committee on Best Practices
    for a Future Open Code Policy for NASA Space Science, 2018). A rising recognition
    of the necessity of making data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and
    reusable (FAIR; Wilkinson et al., 2016) has set a standard for expanding the availability
    of research standards and tools that ease data sharing and management (Wagner
    et al., 2022). FAIR principles imply that data and tools must be easily findable,
    freely obtainable, and reusable so that methodology and derived results can be
    entirely transparent (Koymans et al., 2020). Data and tools can be findable when
    they are sufficiently described by rich metadata and registered or indexed in
    a known and accessible searchable resource. Accessibility means that users and
    machines, following appropriate authorization and via a well-defined protocol,
    can obtain data and the related tools. For data and tools to be interoperable,
    they should be described using normative and community-known specifications. Reproducibility
    is another aspect of the FAIR principle that received less attention in the irrigation
    community. Reproducibility necessitates describing in detail the characteristics
    of the data and tools, and their origin according to community standards with
    clear and accessible conditions for usage (Boeckhout et al., 2018). At a minimum,
    ML modeling outcomes should be reproduced and ideally replicated by other users
    before it is deployed. Currently, farm-related data, including irrigation, soil
    moisture, and climate information, are not based on the FAIR principles, nor their
    metadata format and terminology are constrained by these guidelines. To move towards
    a FAIRer future that boosts the availability of farm-related data and tools, continuous
    generation of FAIR metadata standards and reproducible tools are indeed needed
    for future data-driven applications in irrigation modeling. Towards this end,
    scientific communities can adopt several best practices, namely making their data
    and ML algorithms accessible in a public cyberinfrastructure and in a non-proprietary
    standardized format, creating a digital object identifier for their data and tools,
    and providing clear licensing information along with constraints on the use. To
    encourage reusability, software and code should also be openly available through
    a non-restrictive license adopted by the community to facilitate reproducibility.
    4.4. Blackboxness of machine learning models The explainability and interpretability
    of ML models are another aspect of ML that has been questioned in the past (Kaur
    et al., 2020, Moraffah et al., 2020). Enhancing models’ predictability comes at
    the cost of increasing their complexity which often makes them less interpretable.
    However, the interpretability of ML models is more important than their accuracy
    (Rudin, 2019). For example, to trust the irrigation recommendations provided by
    a model, irrigation specialists and crop consultants would be more interested
    in knowing the accuracy of irrigation recommendations for a certain scheduling
    time than in the structure of the algorithms and the types of performance metrics
    used in the model. Explainable ML has initiated a set of methods to increase the
    interpretability and explainability of ML models (Carvalho et al., 2019, Miller,
    2019). In the agricultural domain, these techniques have been applied in several
    prediction tasks such as crop yield estimation (Sihi et al., 2022, Wolanin et
    al., 2020), prediction of daily pan evaporation and evapotranspiration (El Bilali
    et al., 2023, Zhao et al., 2023) and in monitoring fields’ conditions for optimizing
    crop production (Sabrina et al., 2022). To interpret the results of a model, the
    current ML approaches aim to evaluate the effects of various combinations of input
    variables on the results by applying techniques such as Shapely Additive exPlanations
    (SHAP) that can assess the pros and cons of an input feature on the model output.
    Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) is another popular technique
    applied to make ML models’ results human interpretable by estimating the behaviour
    of a complex model, it consists of adding noise to a data point without changing
    the rest of the dataset, fitting the new dataset to the model, and observing the
    behaviour of the model (Ribeiro et al., 2016). To the best of our knowledge, these
    approaches have not yet been adopted in explaining irrigation predicting models;
    there is, therefore, room to improve the understanding of these models by incorporating
    such techniques into the current ML modelling structures. 4.5. Lack of human interaction
    with machine learing-based irrigation modeling Although considerable effort has
    been made to develop irrigation decision-making models, current models lack a
    way to integrate expert knowledge into the simulation process. The limited success
    of these models is partly because the decision rules used in the models are limited
    in scope than the factors growers use to make decisions (Car, 2018). Researchers
    mostly create models that can tackle agricultural problems without the need for
    human interaction. Unfortunately, a majority of existing models have not yet reached
    this degree of intelligence. Due to calculation time constraints and the complexity
    of agricultural problems, models may provide imprecise irrigation recommendations.
    As a result, agricultural knowledge from experienced irrigation specialists, Extension
    professionals, and experienced farmers can be employed in the model to improve
    the feasibility of ML outcomes and validate the results. An interactive interface
    that allows professionals to share their knowledge and perspectives can be an
    approach to considering expert judgment. Another way to allow human control over
    ML models is to develop systems that enable human-in-the-loop feedback and interactions.
    The effective application of ML models in irrigation scheduling systems requires
    that humans control their outcomes to minimize the risk of lethal results. Efficient
    human control is the capability to incorporate human knowledge into the modeling
    process to make informed, timely decisions that provide the greatest operational
    outcomes possible (Boardman and Butcher, 2019). ML systems must create models
    that take into consideration a range of contextual data in order to function well
    in complicated settings (National Academies of Sciences, 2021). This allows the
    systems to make decisions by accurately understanding the current situation and
    projecting future scenarios. However, human-in-the-loop techniques need to be
    developed to ease the collaboration between ML models and irrigation experts such
    as Extension irrigation specialists and experienced farmers. This will help align
    goals and synchronize task prioritization, resource allocations, and improved
    irrigation decisions. 4.6. Uncertainty and error in machine learning simulation
    Although ML techniques for irrigation decision-making were proven to be helpful
    in irrigation planning, all the reviewed papers did not take into consideration
    the errors and uncertainties in the predictions. Uncertainty in irrigation modeling
    stems from the continuously changing environment, such as meteorological conditions
    and soil moisture variations. The lack of uncertainty quantification in the ML
    predictions may result in overfitting or underfitting outcomes. Considering ML
    predictions without assessing the extent to which results are credible given the
    associated uncertainties in the input data and model often leads to inappropriate
    or biased decisions. For example, if the input data fed to a model trained to
    predict the irrigation amount lies outside the training data distribution, the
    model may generate unreasonable irrigation recommendations that are essentially
    based on an “educated guess”. But, if the prediction is accompanied by confidence
    intervals that is the certainty the model itself has of its prediction, the decision
    taker would be informed of this randomness and decide on the irrigation amount
    accordingly. Thus, an assessment of uncertainties in the simulated results is
    crucial to ensure that the results fall within a certain level of confidence.
    Generally, uncertainty can arise from input data and the ML procedures or structure
    in the modeling process. There are two types of uncertainties, (i) epistemic uncertainty
    resulting from the ML architecture choice and model parameters and (ii) aleatory
    uncertainty due to a physical system’s intrinsic randomness. Aleatoric uncertainty
    describes the inherent randomness of the data-generating process, which cannot
    be justified by gathering additional data samples or observations (Kendall and
    Gal, 2017). This form of uncertainty is caused by unknown processes that pertain
    to the concept of randomness, i.e., the unpredictability in modeling outcomes.
    Aleatoric uncertainty can further be subdivided into homoscedastic and heteroscedastic
    uncertainties. Homoscedastic uncertainty is independent of ML inputs, which means
    that it remains consistent regardless of input. Because this sort of uncertainty
    produces uniform variances for all inputs, the variation in observation noise
    for all input parameters is constant (Tabas and Samadi, 2022). On the other hand,
    heteroscedastic uncertainty varies with datasets, where some inputs provide more
    noisy outputs than others. Aleatoric uncertainty does not increase for out-of-distribution
    data contrary to epistemic uncertainty that can be handled in the modeling process
    if sufficient training data is available. Epistemic uncertainty may increase during
    the testing period for those data points that lie outside the training dataset.
    Thus, the larger the training dataset the lower the epistemic uncertainty. Modeling
    these two types of uncertainties increases the predictive performance of models.
    Understanding how individual sources of uncertainty propagate to the integrated
    irrigation system response is useful in analyzing the impact of data and model
    uncertainty on the simulated results. Additionally, distinguishing these uncertainties
    helps understand the sources of errors that have the potential to be reduced.
    Differentiating them also makes decision-making transparent and helps in making
    more informed (irrigation) decisions as unreduced uncertainties are clear and
    known (Der Kiureghian and Ditlevsen, 2009). Uncertainty estimation methods can
    be classified into four categories namely single deterministic methods, Bayesian
    approximations, ensemble learning, and test-time data augmentation methods. The
    most widely used methods are Bayesian approximations such as Monte Carlo dropout,
    Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) optimization methods (Duane et al., 1987), Bayesian
    Model Averaging (Samadi et al., 2020), and ensemble learning methods such as deep
    ensemble, Bayesian deep ensemble, and Dirichlet deep networks (Abdar et al., 2021).
    Largely, data uncertainty for a normally distributed uncertainty can be measured
    by predicting the parameters of a probability distribution for instance the mean
    and standard deviation (Kendall and Gal, 2017, Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017).
    These approaches can be coupled with ML-based irrigation water use modeling to
    reduce errors and uncertainty during both training and testing periods. However,
    to efficiently reduce uncertainty in ML modeling, rigorous tests of the suitability
    of different irrigation process parameterizations and model parameters are needed
    across different model development stages as well as various testbeds and farm
    settings. 5. Physics-guided machine learning (PGML) PGML offers a compelling solution
    to improve irrigation decisions and the interpretability of ML models. The interactions
    between plants, the soil, and the environment are complex and require a wide range
    of physical processes to be accurately programmed and described in space and time
    by a data-driven model. PGML provides an opportunity to leverage the best attributes
    of both data and physical processes in the ML models (Shen et al., 2018). Combining
    physical processes with data-driven capabilities can be performed in a variety
    of ways. Approaches to incorporate physical principles into ML models involve
    constructing new ML architectures that can employ some physical laws and processes
    in the irrigation water use prediction. These improvements are possible because
    ML models are modular and versatile. Scientific knowledge can be utilized to define
    node links that capture physics-based correlations among variables. Another method
    for infusing established physical properties into an ML architecture is to assign
    physical significance to some neurons in the network by incorporating physical
    intermediate variables into the network (see Fig. 6). Daw et al. (2020), for example,
    implemented these two approaches in LSTM for lake temperature modeling by introducing
    physics-informed connections among neurons in the network. Furthermore, they added
    physical significance to some of the network’s neurons by calculating physical
    intermediate elements along the network’s route hence creating a unique physics-guided
    LSTM structure. Another related method is to set some of the neurons’ weights
    to physically meaningful values or parameters and make them constant throughout
    the ML training process. Download : Download high-res image (103KB) Download :

    Daw et al., 2020). Another point of view, however, tackles the challenge of embedding
    prior knowledge in an ML from a different perspective. Currently, rather than
    creating a specific model structure that indirectly imposes prior knowledge, endeavors
    are being made to enforce physics-constrained learning by encoding appropriate
    partial differential equations (PDE) into the loss function of ML approximations
    utilizing methods such as automated differentiation, (see for example Sirignano
    and Spiliopoulos, 2018; Raissi et al., 2019; Y. Zhu et al., 2019; Geneva and Zabaras,
    2020). This approach comprises a double learning process, where an algorithm learns
    to concurrently match the observed data and to produce outputs that approximately
    meet a specific set of physical laws such as energy and mass conservation. Constraining
    the optimization of data-driven models is a natural way to include domain knowledge
    in the process of learning, and by doing so physically implausible predictions
    can be avoided. For problems where linear equations can be used to describe physics-based
    constraints, integrating the latter in existing constrained optimization formulations
    is straightforward. However, many agricultural problems involve complex non-linear,
    and dynamic processes. For instance, simulating crop yield as a function of numerous
    inputs such as irrigation timing and amount, plant cultivar, and soil hydraulic
    properties have constraints that are expressed in complex formulations such as
    non-linear relationships between variables or PDE which are not effectively treated
    by conventional constrained optimization approaches. In this case, it is crucial
    to form constrained optimization methods that can use common PDE forms and can
    handle the non-linearity of physical variables. 6. Discussion This paper reviewed
    16 studies that were relevant to the application of ML in supporting irrigation
    decision-making. The goal was to identify ML algorithms commonly used to build
    systems supporting irrigation decision making, analyze developed systems based
    on these algorithms and discuss their performance and limitations as ways to improve
    irrigation water use management. We observed that the input data for soil and
    weather-related parameters used to train the developed models were obtained mainly
    from sensors distributed across the study areas. Therefore, wireless sensor networks
    and IoT technologies have played an important role in enabling the application
    of ML models in irrigation water use modeling. However, careful selection of input
    features is crucial to obtain a good model performance. While it is important
    to critically select the input data, it was demonstrated by Goldstein et al. (2018)
    and Jimenez et al. (2021), that having many input variables to predict irrigation
    demand does not imply having a better model. More than half of the reviewed papers
    used simple ML algorithms such as LR, RF, SVM, DT, etc. which sometimes do not
    accurately simulate the relationship between the plant and its environment, especially
    for high-dimensional datasets. As stated by Goldstein et al. (2018), Torres-Sanchez
    et al. (2020), and Sidhu et al. (2020), due to the non-linear relationships among
    soil, weather variables, and crop water requirement, linear regression models
    do not perform well because they cannot accurately learn the underlying functions
    and data patterns that relate the input to output process. Therefore, in crop
    water requirement prediction, the algorithms that can simulate the non-linearity
    between the inputs and outputs are recommended. Ensemble learning methods such
    as Adaboost and GBRT provide a way to improve the predictability of ML models
    and have demonstrated good performance in predicting irrigation management over
    algorithms such as LR. According to the results of Alibabaei et al. (2022), LSTM
    networks perform better than other algorithms because they can make use of the
    retained information from previous time steps in the following ones to provide
    better predictions. Hence, they have proven to be robust and able to accurately
    simulate the relationship between the dependent and independent variables when
    data sets from new sites are used. We postulate that PGML can be a better approach
    to modeling the interlinkage between the soil, plant, and climate variables. Moreover,
    these interactions vary extensively in time, distance, and region and physical
    attributes can better describe these variabilities; thereby incorporating physics
    into the ML algorithms can justify these interlinked processes and parameter choices
    for which reliable values can be obtained. On one hand, it was observed that ML
    approaches have shown the potential to support irrigation decision-making and
    reduce the time spent by agronomists on analyzing a large quantity of data to
    determine irrigation water requirements. On the other hand, ML models require
    a wide range of data in space and time which are often not readily available.
    To overcome this challenge, additional data sources were discussed and data augmentation
    methods such as GAN are proposed as approaches to generate new data. However,
    both data and model uncertainty should be addressed in data-driven crop water
    demand modeling. We observed that there is a lack of both aleatoric and epistemic
    uncertainties assessments in all the surveyed studies, yet these uncertainties
    affect considerably the simulation results and, subsequently. the reliability
    of the developed systems. Additionally, there is still a lack of incorporating
    agronomists’ knowledge in the irrigation decision-making process. To bridge this
    gap, human-in-the-loop approaches to enable interactions between farmers and ML
    models should be explored in the future. Lastly, to widen the adoption of the
    ML-based irrigation decision-making systems, we recommend the implementation of
    FAIR principles in irrigation modeling as has been the case for other disciplines
    such as ecological and environmental modeling (Petzold et al., 2019, Quay et al.,
    2021) and water science simulations (Crystal-Ornelas et al., 2022, Cannon et al.,
    2022). For ML-based irrigation decision-making models to have an impact on water
    sustainability and management, data and the resulting tools must be openly accessible,
    easily findable, and reusable. 7. Conclusions This review highlights the outcomes
    of ML based irrigation scheduling models applied in different geographical, farm
    and crop settings. We discussed the current state-of-the-art models and proposed
    several approaches that could complement data-driven irrigation modelling. To
    summarize, the reviewed studies provided promising outcomes for irrigation scheduling.
    As we make progress in data-driven simulation, we expect to gain a new understanding
    of the relative importance of the choice of different neural network architecture
    and their workflow and structure that drive decisions and actions. The review
    analyses presented herein are intended to provide a basis for data-driven irrigation
    scheduling applications across different environmental and geographical settings.
    Further research is, however, needed to ensure the effectiveness of developed
    ML models and their applicability in farms with different soil, weather, and crop
    characteristics. Recognizing a growing enthusiasm for data-driven modeling applications
    in irrigation scheduling, we anticipate growth on several facades: (i) a better
    ML model capable of forecasting irrigation water use in advance, (ii) a better
    benchmarking irrigation model to compare with the data-driven approaches, and
    (iii) a better pre-processing approach for data and error estimation methods and
    the ways to leverage human-in-the-loop in the ML modeling system. As always, we
    welcome discussions with irrigation research communities interested in data-driven
    and other related ML modeling development to address irrigation hydrology challenges.

    security 1. Introduction In Burkina Faso, agriculture is subsistence-based and
    rainfed, subjected to favorable weather conditions during the rainy season (May
    to October) to meet the country’s food demand. Unreliable and erratic rainfall,
    together with a low soil fertility and poor structured soils, are the main abiotic
    stresses constraining crop production. The latter are hindered by inadequate water
    management systems as well as technological agronomic solutions, except for some
    agricultural practices traditionally adopted by Sahelian farmers (e.g., zaï pits,
    stone bunds, agroforestry, and mulching), rendering agricultural systems and livelihoods
    highly vulnerable and exposed to climate threats, including in-season rainfall
    variability and weather extremes. As a result, between 2019 and 2021, 3.8 million
    Burkinabè suffered from undernourishment, roughly 20 % of the population (FAO,
    2022a). What’s more, due to the lack of water resources, agricultural production
    during the dry season has been limited to vegetable gardening, mainly practiced
    through intensive production systems adjacent to water basins. In recent years,
    the nationwide harvested area of tomato has folded, from 1226 to 2045 ha (ha)
    between 2011 and 2020, while the production of tomato fresh yields has remained
    constant (10.8 t/ha) over time (FAO, 2022b). On the other hand, the production
    of staple crops (e.g., millet, sorghum, and maize) during the wet season has become
    vital to ensure the minimum calorie intake for healthy diets and improved nutrition
    (Laudien et al., 2022). Thereby, to cope with increasing food demand, the harvested
    area of staple crops has increased in the past-decade (2011–2020), especially
    that of maize, by about 400000 ha, up to 1.13 million ha in 2020 – likewise to
    that of sorghum (1.18 million ha), but lower to that of millet (1.86 million ha)
    (FAO, 2022b). Despite the increase in harvested area, there is a major production
    gap during the lean season, also described as the hunger gap comprising the three
    months (June to August) preceding the harvesting of rainfed crops. As a result
    of low food availability during the wet season, food assistance programs have
    sought to improve food production during the dry season, particularly along traditional
    lowlands of southwestern Burkina Faso. To increase food production during the
    dry season and to ameliorate nutritional and food safety, the Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) alongside with national agricultural research centers and academia,
    have promoted drought-tolerant crops (e.g., quinoa) capable of tackling both malnutrition
    and the impacts of increasing abiotic stresses associated with weather extremes
    and climate variability (Alvar-Beltrán et al., 2019, Dao et al., 2020). However,
    while crop breeding programs have played a key role on increasing crop water productivity
    (CWP) in the past, such gains are not foreseen into the future (Molden et al.,
    2010). Thereby, modelling crop water consumption and CWP is a key step towards
    optimizing water resources in the Sahel region. In recent years, a considerable
    amount of research has been conducted to assess the impacts of climate change
    and improve agricultural water management through water conservation methods,
    yet little is known about ways of coping with dry-spells during the agricultural
    campaign through small-scale irrigation for highly water demanding crops (e.g.,
    maize and tomato). The latter is key to reduce the yield gaps of subsistence (maize),
    highly nutritious (quinoa) and cash crops (tomato), particularly among rural and
    resource constrained communities. Therefore, the Sahel region, continues to have
    a paucity of literature applying CWP models, which are essential to support farmers
    and agricultural extension workers make agricultural water management informed
    decisions during the growing season. Existing CWP experiments have aimed to increase
    crop yields (per unit of land area) by using similar or less amount of water inputs.
    For example, in Burkina Faso, Wellens et al. (2013a) and Alvar-Beltrán et al.,
    2021a, Alvar-Beltrán et al., 2021b have successfully applied CWP models (AquaCrop)
    to optimize cabbage and quinoa yields, while minimizing crop water use. The General
    Large Area Model for Annual Crops (GLAM) has also been used to improve maize planting
    dates (Waongo et al., 2014) and the Système d′Analyse Régionale des Risques Agroclimatiques
    (SARRA) has been tested by agronomists and agrometeorologists working in the Sahel
    for risk analysis and yield forecasting (Traoré et al., 2011; Genesio et al.,
    2011). In West Africa, the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) and
    the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) have been widely
    used to assess climate change impacts on sorghum yields (Guan et al., 2017, Arumugam
    et al., 2023) and to support decision making on nitrogen management for pearl
    millet (Akponikpè et al., 2010). In Burkina Faso, APSIM has been tested to evaluate
    the effect of soil, climate, and sowing dates on the temporal variability of maize
    yields (Waha et al., 2015). Some of the existing literature using AquaCrop in
    West Africa for irrigated maize and tomato show that, if management practices
    are not improved, climate change might adversely impact crop production (Raes
    et al., 2021). At the regional level, the AGRHYMET center has worked for decades
    on research, development, and implementation of crop models for Sahelian cereals
    based on the SARRA model family (Oettli et al., 2011, Vintrou et al., 2014). However,
    AGRHYMET acknowledges new challenges such as the need to enhance the production
    of irrigated vegetables and cash crops and, thus, has requested a wider scope
    of solutions based on other crop models, including AquaCrop. In addition, the
    AGRHYMET regional center calls for action to strengthen in-situ data collection
    for model calibration and operational use as well as to develop and implement
    an integrated climate, hydro, and crop modelling framework for operational crop
    monitoring and yield forecasting at the regional level. Besides of partially fulfilling
    AGRHYMET needs in the region, the herein pilot study rolls-out a hybrid approach
    that fills the gap in literature by blending weather and agronomic observations
    with CWP models (AquaCrop) with the objective of (i) developing an irrigation
    DSS to increase staple crop (maize) production and food availability both during
    the dry and lean season, (ii) diversifying household income by enhancing the production
    of cash crops (tomato) during the dry season, (iii) ameliorating the diet of food
    insecure people by promoting highly nutritious crops (quinoa) recently introduced
    in the region, and (iv) assisting extension workers in the development of irrigation
    advisory services. As a result, this study monitors the phenological development
    of tomato, maize, and quinoa, besides quantifying crop water requirements during
    the growing season to ultimately provide extension workers with guiding material
    to minimize water use and modulate the adverse effects of abiotic stresses. In
    addition, the here presented innovative task force and inter-agency communication
    approach represents a steppingstone towards developing a comprehensive DSS for
    improved irrigation management in the Sahel region. This is achieved by systematically
    running CWP models that estimate crop water requirements during the growing season
    which, consequently, improve weather-informed decision making at the farm level.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Area of study According to Köppen’s climatic classification,
    Burkina Faso is divided into three climatic regions: (i) hot-desert climate (BWh),
    (ii) hot semi-arid climate (BSh), and (iii) tropical savanna climate (Aw). This
    study is performed at the Institut de l′Environnement et des Recherches Agricoles
    (INERA), Farako-Ba research station (11° 05′ N, 4° 19′ W, 421 m.a.s.l) (Fig. 1).
    INERAs research station is found within the tropical savanna region (so-called
    Soudanian agroclimatic zone), characterized by dry winters and warm year-round
    temperatures. In this region, the total annual precipitation ranges between 900
    and 1200 mm, scarce from November to April and abundant over the summer months.

    Fig. 1. Selected site for testing an irrigation DSS in Burkina Faso. 2.2. Experimental
    design The here presented pilot agronomic experiment is rolled-out during two
    consecutive dry seasons, comprising the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 periods. Agronomic
    experiments are deployed over a surface area of 680 m2, including 140 m2 of bare
    soil left between field plots to avoid side-effects. An area of 180 m2 is assigned
    to each crop (tomato, maize, and quinoa), where each field is divided into three
    replicates sizing 60 m2, and split into 15 rows spaced by 0.8 m. In both years,
    the sowing of maize and quinoa is done on December 14; whereas tomato plants are,
    first, sown on seedling trays and, afterwards, transplanted into the field on
    December 14. Upon proper calibration of the AquaCrop model, the proposed irrigation
    DSS uses daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc) simulated values under net irrigation
    to, afterwards, estimate crop water requirements (reference value necessary to
    determine the timing and amount of water application at a given time) under optimal
    water growing conditions. While the ETc values for the first experiment (2020–2021)
    are merely based on simulated reference evapotranspiration (ETo) derived from
    daily meteorological data from the field using the Penman-Monteith equation, the
    second experiment (2021–2022) uses a learning approach (based on historical simulated
    ETc values from the first experiment) to enhance the irrigation DSS and, consequently,
    improve water use efficiency and crop yields during the second year. 2.3. Model
    theory The AquaCrop model has been developed by the Land and Water Division at
    FAO to assess the effect of different environmental conditions and field management
    practices on crop production. The model simulates yield in four steps: (i) crop
    development, (ii) crop transpiration, (iii) biomass production, and (iv) yield
    formation (Steduto et al., 2012, Vanuytrecht et al., 2014, Raes, 2017). The first
    step, i.e., the development of the crop green canopy cover (thereafter CC), is
    simulated as the soil fraction covered by the canopy of the crop. Afterwards,
    the crop transpiration (Tr) is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) by the crop coefficient (Kc) that depends on the CC. Then, the actual transpiration
    (Ta) is calculated from the potential evapotranspiration. The third step estimates
    the production of above-ground crop biomass, which is proportional to the cumulative
    water transpired by the crop (Eq. 1). Lastly, through the harvest index (HI),
    corresponding to the share of harvestable product to the total above-ground biomass,
    the crop yield is obtained (Eq. 2). (1) Crop biomass (B) = ∑ Tr * WP (2) Crop
    yield (Y) = HI * B 2.4. Model parametrization 2.4.1. Climate module The National
    Meteorological Service of Burkina Faso (ANAM) has provided this work with the
    weather data necessary for running the climate module in AquaCrop. Weather data
    (Fig. 2), automatically recorded every 3 h, including maximum and minimum temperatures
    (ºC) and precipitation (mm), has been transferred (twice a week) to crop modelers
    responsible for computing crop water requirements under net irrigation requirements
    over the entire experimental period (see Section 2.4.3). Afterwards, climate files
    have been uploaded into AquaCrop to compute twice a week the ETo derived from
    daily meteorological data using the Penman-Monteith equation, which includes all
    the parameters governing the energy exchange and latent heat-flux (Raes, 2017).
    In the case weather data (e.g., humidity, solar radiation and windspeed) necessary
    to compute ETo through the Penman-Monteith equation is missing, procedures to
    estimate missing climatic data are used according to the methodologies outlined
    in the Irrigation and Drainage Paper No 56 (FAO, 1998). Download : Download high-res

    Crop module In AquaCrop, the fine tuning of crop parameters is achieved using
    field information on the planting method and plant density, field management,
    plant phenology and soil profile conditions (Table 2). Additional crop parameters,
    affected by crop’s responses to abiotic stresses, such as water, temperature,
    soil salinity and fertility, are calibrated based on an extensive search of literature
    (Alam et al., 2017, Alvar-Beltrán et al., 2020; FAO, 2012; Wahid et al., 2007).
    Crop development, including the canopy cover (CC) and the crop phenological phases,
    is monitored on weekly basis for the CC and when 50 % of the plants have reached
    a specific growing stage (time for plant emergence, time for maximum CC, time/duration
    of flowering, start of canopy senescence, and physiological maturity) (Table 1).
    In addition, the Canopeo App., tool for measuring the fractional green CC of the
    plants (at 60 cm distance from the top of the canopy), is employed to monitor
    the development of the CC in the field. Emerging CC findings are used to complement
    the field data section in AquaCrop. Lastly, to avoid any side effects, readings
    from the five middle-rows in each plot are collected to monitor both the crop
    growth and development. (3) Table 1. Summary of field observations per experiment.

    et al. (2021a) Where FW corresponds to the fruit weight (in kg) produced by one
    plant calculated as the average of 10 plants/replicate, PD to the plant density
    (25,000 plants/ha), and MC to the moisture content adjusted at 90 % necessary
    to convert fresh tomato yields into dry yields in AquaCrop (FAO, 2012). (4) Where
    GW corresponds to the grain weight (in kg) produced by one plant as the average
    of plants in 20 m2 (125 plants/replicate), H to the humidity level when measuring
    grain weight (18 % in 2020–21 % and 13 % in 2021–2022), (100−15)/85 to the yield
    adjusted at 15 % moisture, and S to the surface area (20 m2) of the five middle-rows
    comprising 125 maize plants/replicate. (5) Where SW corresponds to the weight
    of seeds (in g) produced by one plant calculated as the average of 100 plants/replicate,
    while PD to the plant density (125,000 plants/ha). 2.4.3. Irrigation module To
    calculate the amount of irrigation in the field, a water counter is placed (⌀
    1/2\") at the entry of each experimental block. Every row, spaced by 0.8 m, within
    each plot is equipped with a drip-irrigation pipeline (at a flow rate of 1.05 l/hour
    per emitter) and where emitters are spaced 30 cm from each other. Afterwards,
    to determine the crop water requirements in AquaCrop, crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) is derived from in-situ weather observations necessary for estimating reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) and crop characteristics necessary for determining crop
    evapotranspiration (Kc). To adjust the irrigation quantity in the field based
    on ETc simulations from AquaCrop, an iterative ETc simulation process in AquaCrop
    is performed for the previous five-days and, afterwards, extrapolated for the
    succeeding week. Although the AquaCrop model does not allow the user to perform
    sub-daily crop water requirement simulations, and to minimize losses from direct
    evaporation in the field, irrigation is applied either at dawn and or at dusk.
    In addition, to minimize potential water stresses to the canopy expansion, stomata
    closure and early senescence, field (observed) and simulated (AquaCrop) net irrigation
    requirements (quantity of water necessary for optimal crop growth) are regularly
    monitored and adequately adjusted in the field. This approach has ensured an optimization
    of water resources in the field and has likewise minimized physiological water
    stresses to the plant. To achieve so, the root zone depletion is parametrized
    in AquaCrop to a level where water resources may not drop below 30 % readily available
    water (RAW), and where 0 % RAW corresponded to the field capacity and 100 % RAW
    to the threshold triggering stomatal closure. The former is a steppingstone towards
    improving the irrigation DSS in the 2021–22 experiment, where ETc daily values
    from the 2020–21 experiment, together with in-situ daily weather observations
    from the 2021–22 experiment, are used as a baseline to anticipate crop water requirements
    in the forthcoming days. This approach allowed a better estimation of crop water
    requirements in the 2021–22 experiment, besides optimizing water resources and
    improving crop yields without incurring in crop water stresses (see results in
    3.1 Agroclimatic information, 3.2 Crop water requirements). 2.4.4. Field management
    module To guarantee an optimal crop development in the field, adequate levels
    of soil fertilization and frequent management of weeds (every three weeks) is
    performed during the entire growing cycle. For example, two NPK fertilizations
    (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) are applied to tomato plants, 250 kg/ha
    of NPK during transplanting and 200 kg/ha of NPK 15 days after transplanting,
    amounting to a total of 450 kg/ha of NPK (Table 1). An additional 100 kg/ha of
    urea (equivalent to 46 kg N/ha) are applied both at 25 and 40 days after transplanting.
    For maize, at the time of sowing, the field is fertilized at a rate of 200 kg/ha
    of NPK, with an additional 100 kg/ha and 50 kg/ha of urea at 20 and 30 days after
    sowing, respectively. Lastly, at the time of quinoa sowing, NPK is applied at
    a rate of 100 kg/ha, with an additional 100 kg/ha and 50 kg/ha of urea at 25 and
    35 days after sowing, respectively. 2.4.5. Soil module The soil profile in AquaCrop
    is composed by different soil horizons, each with its own physical characteristics.
    Therefore, to determine soil-classes at two different depths (0–20 and 20–40 cm),
    five soil samples are randomly collected from the experimental field. Overall,
    the experimental field displayed a sandy-loam and sandy-clay-loam soil characteristics,
    respectively at the upper and lower depths (Table 2). Additional values regarding
    the soil water content at saturation, field capacity, and permanent wilting for
    the different soil-classes are retrieved from the soil curve numbers publicly
    available in AquaCrop’s manuals on calculation procedures (Raes et al., 2018a).
    2.5. Statistical analysis To test the performance of the AquaCrop model against
    observed values in the field, different statistical indicators are used. For example,
    the Pearson correlation coefficient (r, Eq. 6) measures the strength and direction
    of the relationship between two variables (e.g., observed and simulated CC), while
    the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE, Eq. 7) is used to assess
    the predictive skill of the AquaCrop model. In addition, the root-mean square
    error (RMSE, Eq. 8) is useful for testing the differences between predicted and
    observed values (Jacovides and Kontoyiannis, 1995) and the normalized-RMSE (NRMSE,
    Eq. 9) provides relevant information about the average of the measured data ranges.
    For the NRMSE, AquaCrop findings are considered highly performant if the differences
    between observed and simulated values are below 5 %, and good when ranging between
    6 % and 15 % (Raes et al., 2018b). Lastly, the Willmott’s index of agreement (d,
    Eq. 10) provides a measure of the agreement of the deviation between modelled
    and observed values from the observed mean, where 0 indicates disagreement and
    1 perfect agreement between simulated and observed values (Willmott, 1984). (6)
    (7) (8) (9) (10) Where Oi and Pi corresponds to the observed and simulated values,
    respectively, and n to the number of observations. While the RMSE has the same
    units as that of the variable being simulated (kg/ha), NRMSE units are displayed
    as a percentage. In addition, O′I = [Oi – ] and P′I = [Pi – ] shows the differences
    between observed and simulated values, with and as the observed and simulated
    means, respectively. 3. Results 3.1. Agroclimatic information There are significant
    precipitation differences between the 2020–21 and 2021–22 dry-season experiments,
    respectively recording 19 and 87 mm/season (Fig. 2). The average Tmax and Tmin
    recorded during the 2020–21 and 2021–22 experiments is of 36.3/34.4 ºC and of
    15.6/14.8 ºC, respectively. In addition, the average (absolute) Tmax observed
    during the pollination phase of tomato, maize, and quinoa is of 35.1/33.1 ºC (36.8/35.2
    ºC), 35.7/32.9 ºC (38.3/38.0 ºC) and of 35.0/32.8 ºC (36.8/34.7 ºC), respectively
    in 2020–21 and 2021–22. For tomato and quinoa, the AquaCrop simulations suggest
    that the average crop cycle temperature stress and the average crop cycle water
    stress affecting the canopy expansion and stomatal closure is of 0 % for both
    years. For maize, the average crop cycle temperature stress affecting crop transpiration
    is of 0 % for 2020–21 and of 1 % for 2021–22, while the average crop cycle water
    stress affecting the canopy expansion and stomatal closure is of 0 % for both
    years. These simulation findings suggest that the soil water stresses affecting
    the CC development and the expansion of the root zone, inducing stomata closure
    and reducing crop transpiration rates, are minimal in both experiments. This is
    because the total available water in the root zone during the entire growing cycle
    is constantly above the plant’s wilting point and below the field capacity, thus
    indicating that neither biomass production nor yields are constrained by reduced
    transpiration. Lastly, with regards to air temperature stresses, although temperatures
    occasionally breached the critical threshold for pollination (see calibrated values
    in Table 2), its effects on pollination are considered null because the duration
    and intensity of the stress are limited in time. 3.2. Crop water requirements
    In this study, to sustain maximum crop productivity and, at the same time, minimize
    water use and reduce the number of irrigation events, the progress of crop water
    requirements is constantly monitored and assessed during the entire growing cycle.
    The observed precipitation and applied irrigation, as well as the crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) during the 2020–21 and 2021–22 experiments are displayed in Table 3 and

    water productivity (WPET in kg/m3) under a DSS and net irrigation requirements
    in (a) 2020–21 and (b) 2021–22. For tomato, the accumulated ETc under net irrigation
    requirements during the 80- and 73-day growing period is of 341 mm/season (2020–21)
    and of 288 mm/season (2021–22), while the accumulated ETc using a DSS is of 229 mm/season
    (2020–21) and of 208 mm/season (2021–22), respectively after transplanting (Fig.
    3). Although dry yields using a DSS are similar in both experiments (1960 and
    2018 kg/ha of dry weight), a higher ET water productivity (WPET expressed as kg
    of dry yield per m3 of water evapotranspired) is observed in 2021–22 (0.97 kg/m3)
    compared to 2020–21 (0.86 kg/m3). These WPET differences are explained by lower
    ETc requirements during the 2021–22 experiment compared to 2020–21. In addition,
    the observed WPET using a DSS is 42 % higher to that simulated under net irrigation
    requirements (average of both years). Despite rainfall downpours in the 2021–22
    experiment, irrigation management is improved during the second year because similar
    or slightly higher yields are obtained with a lower number of irrigation events,
    25 events in 2021–22 instead of 29 events in 2020–21. For maize, the accumulated
    ETc under net irrigation requirements during the 91- and 92-day growing period
    is of 389 mm/season (2020–21) and of 384 mm/season (2021–22), while the accumulated
    ETc using a DSS is of 303 mm/season (2020–21) and of 324 mm/season (2021–22) (Fig.
    4). Although water inputs in 2020–21 are 22 % lower than in 2021–22, the yield
    loss is not more than 8 % compared to 2021–22. This is because increasing water
    inputs, in the form of precipitation in 2021–22, occur once the crop is fully
    developed and, therefore, do not have a negative effect on crop yields. Lastly,
    the observed and simulated WPET using a DSS requirements is similar in both years;
    though, the WPET using a DSS is 27 % higher to that simulated under net irrigation
    requirements (average of both years). For quinoa, the accumulated ETc during the
    75- and 70-day growing period is of 285 mm/season (2020–21) and of 254 mm/season
    (2021–22), respectively, while the accumulated ETc using a DSS is of 191 mm/season
    (2020–21) and of 189 mm/season (2021–22) (Fig. 5). Since higher yields are observed
    with a similar amount of water evapotranspired, the WPET in 2021–22 is slightly
    higher (0.73 kg/m3) to that of 2020–21 (0.67 kg/m3). For quinoa, as for tomato
    and maize, the observed WPET using a DSS is 49 % higher to that simulated under
    net irrigation requirements (average of both years). Lastly, the number of irrigation
    events in 2021–22 is reduced due to a higher number of rainy days and increased
    water application per irrigation event, 10.9 mm/event in 2021–22 instead of 9.1 mm/event
    in 2020–21. 3.3. Model performance A successful parametrization of the canopy
    cover (CC) curve over the growing season is key to provide accurate soil evaporation,
    crop transpiration, biomass, and yield estimates. The AquaCrop model is calibrated
    based on field observations, resulting in a good model performance as indicated
    by the NRMSE for the CC development of tomato (12.9 % and 9.2 %), maize (8.8 %
    and 8.7 %), and quinoa (14.2 % and 15.2 %), respectively in 2020–21 and 2021–22
    (Table 4, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8). A high Pearson correlation coefficient and
    Wilmott’s index agreement indicates a well modelled CC estimates against observed
    values. The calibrated model also elucidates a high model performance when comparing
    the observed and simulated yield values, as indicated by the NRSME for tomato
    (1.97 %), maize (4.11 %), and quinoa (5.43 %) yields on average for both years
    (Table 4). In addition, the observed (simulated) tomato (after converting fresh
    fruit into dry weight), maize and quinoa yields are of 1989 (2007), 2685 (2668),
    and 1332 (1253) kg/ha, respectively on average for both experiments. Table 4.

    Yield gap reduction and water optimization Real-time and precision irrigation
    scheduling can improve or maintain crop yields with similar or less amount of
    water applied. The average tomato (19890 kg/ha of fresh yield), maize (2685 kg/ha),
    and quinoa (1332 kg/ha) yields observed in this study, using an enhanced DSS,
    together with optimal fertilizer and weeding conditions, are double (+90 %) to
    those reported for tomato (10449 kg/ha), notably higher (+59 %) to those of maize
    (1691 kg/ha), and slightly higher (+8 %) to those of quinoa (1233 kg/ha) in Burkina
    Faso (Alvar-Beltrán et al., 2019; FAO 2022a). These differences between actual
    and potential yields are described by improved water and soil management in the
    field. In addition, AquaCrop simulations on crop water requirements are, to some
    extent, in harmony with satellite remote sensing estimations. For maize, for example,
    actual ET satellite estimations along the Kou Valley (southwestern Burkina Faso)
    are of 549 mm/season (Sawadogo et al., 2020), while those reported in this study
    are of 387 mm/season under net irrigation requirements. These ET differences for
    maize are explained by a delayed sowing date in Sawadogo’s et al. (2020) study,
    which is affected by higher ET rates occurring during the pre-rainy season (March
    and April). Higher ETc findings to those of this study (315 mm/season under net
    irrigation requirements) are reported for tomato during the dry season (413 mm/season)
    in Tougou valley (Sahelian agroclimatic zone) during the dry season (Mandé, 2006).
    The latter ET differences are described by a longer crop cycle, 10 weeks instead
    of 8 weeks, and higher latitudes to those of this study and, consequently, with
    higher ET rates. For quinoa, lower ETc values under net irrigation requirements
    (270 mm/season) are simulated in this study compared to full irrigated conditions
    (394 mm/season) for the same location (Alvar-Beltrán et al., 2019). These differences
    are explained by an optimization of water resources in this study and, consequently,
    lower ETc rates, as well as by a different ET calculation method when computing
    crop water requirements to those of this study, Hargreaves and Samani equation
    instead of Penman Monteith. 4.2. Evaluation of an improved irrigation DSS Real-time
    irrigation scheduling, on daily and hourly basis, has received little attention
    in the Sahel region. New DSS tools (e.g., AquaCrop) for improved irrigation management
    are increasingly used in Burkina Faso for developing efficient irrigation schemes
    (Wellens et al., 2013a, Alvar-Beltrán et al., 2021a). Additional studies on vegetables
    have identified irrigation calendars using satellite information together with
    the assistance of AquaCrop (Wellens et al., 2013b, Traore, 2018). Overall, the
    high performance of AquaCrop when considering the four steps describing yield
    production is improved thanks to increasing number of model inputs, particularly
    those related to the plant phenology, canopy development and final yield are essential
    for accurate estimates of tomato, quinoa, and maize yields in Burkina Faso. This
    study also reveals the capacity of the model to deliver semi-automated support
    at the field level by determining both the irrigation intervals and thresholds
    when the total available water in the soil is above the lower and below the upper
    thresholds affecting canopy development, inducing stomata closure, and triggering
    early canopy senescence. 4.2.1. Usefulness of the DSS This study’s findings highlight
    the usefulness of applying a DSS that integrates crop-water productivity tools
    to facilitate planning and management of irrigation schemes at the field level,
    besides displaying a yield reduction gap with the same or less amount of water
    resources. In addition, since ETc is constantly monitored on AquaCrop, crop water
    stresses are avoided in both experiments. Water optimization during the 2021–22
    is constantly enhanced through historical ETc observations collected during the
    2020–21 experiment. The former allows the crop modeler to estimate ETc beforehand
    and, with high confidence, forecast ETc values regardless of the weather conditions,
    which generally do not display large daily variations at this latitude. Moreover,
    improved irrigation schemes are extremely useful to the scheme manager for deciding
    the timing to switch from the arranged schedule, when water demand is low, to
    the fixed rotation, when water demand is high (Lozano and Mateos, 2008). The latter
    is particularly relevant for vegetable crops, where difficulties related to communally
    managed waters resources often results in conflicts among farmers in Burkina Faso
    (De Fraiture et al., 2014). Lastly, another advantage of the proposed DSS is that
    the user can make real-time decisions on whether it’s necessary or not to irrigate
    the field and avoid unnecessary motorized travelling and ignition of fuel propelled
    pumps with the associated economic costs to the farmer as well as to the environment.
    4.2.2. Limitations of the DDS and solutions One of the major drawbacks of AquaCrop
    standalone program is regularly assessing crop water requirements. This iterative
    process is time consuming, however it can be overcome by developing a semi-automated
    R-environment that simultaneously runs and evaluates the ensemble of field level
    simulations, as described by Sallah et al. (2019). Some of the shortfalls of AquaCrop
    is that the field is assumed to be uniformed without spatial differences in crop
    development, transpiration, soil characteristics or management. In addition, only
    vertical incoming (precipitation, irrigation, and capillary rise) and outgoing
    fluxes (evaporation, transpiration, and deep percolation) are considered, whereas
    the horizontal movement of water is overlooked. Developing an irrigation DSS that
    is scalable and robust in a non-controlled environment is extremely complex. The
    latter requires bringing together different national institutions and research
    institutions, and, foremost, their targeted audiences (farmers) that make decisions
    based on weather-informed agricultural advisories provided by agricultural extension
    workers. A solution to bridge the last-mile gap is creating a dashboard that allows
    user-friendly consultations for irrigation programming and monitoring, as described
    by Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2018). 5. Conclusions Although it is widely understood
    that full irrigation can increase crop yields, new irrigation control methods
    can substantially improve yields and evapotranspired water productivity in arid
    environments. The proposed irrigation DSS using the AquaCrop model has proven
    suitable and useful for assisting and enhancing irrigation management in the field
    (Fig. 9). The model has supported the field technician in a semi-automated way
    to calculate real-time crop water requirements based on daily ETc values. Several
    years of experiments are essential in designing iterative learning processes and,
    foremost, to adjust in an effective and fast manner irrigation schemes to ensure
    that the soil-water balance is kept above the upper threshold reducing canopy
    expansion and below the field capacity to avoid water losses into the environment,
    including plant transpiration interferences. Overall, the proposed DSS is viewed
    as a benchmark for future research studies and projects/programmes such as CREWS.
    The piloted framework is a steppingstone towards operationalizing the irrigation
    DSS within the region (Table 5). This can be achieved by creating a digital portal
    that provides a gateway to automatically access, through an application programming
    interface, climate, crop, soil, and management site-specific and geospatial information
    collected by National Agricultural Research Centers and National Meteorological
    and Hydrological Services within the region. While technical agronomic experts
    are still required to feed the system, no additional interaction is required to
    process the batch (AquaCrop plugin), which can run automatically and release outputs
    for users to make weather-informed decisions at the field level. In addition,
    weather observations can likewise be complemented by a network of soil moisture
    sensors that provide more accurate and reliable information about the soil-water
    balance. The proposed DSS should also be tested during the rainy season to modulate
    the adverse effects of more recurrent and prolonged dry-spells on rainfed crops,
    which are essential for sustaining agricultural production and food security along
    the Sahel region. Ongoing agricultural meteorology programs within the region
    could roll-out and test this methodology during the rainy season and scale-up
    this intervention during the dry season. This might improve the quality of existing
    weather-informed irrigation advisories, besides partially fulfilling the call
    for action made by AGRHYMET regional center to operationalize the use of crop-water
    productivity models such as AquaCrop in the Sahel. Download : Download high-res

    Drylands (hyper-arid, arid, semiarid, and dry sub-humid parts) occupy 41% of Earth’s
    surface, supporting 38% of global population [1,2]. Agriculture and pastoralism
    are the major livelihood sources for most of the population, largely dependent
    upon natural resources [3]. About 70% of the world’s drylands exist in developing
    countries where people are confronting the stark challenge of poverty, food insecurity,
    malnourishment, poor economic conditions, and marginalization [4,5]. Water availability
    and agricultural productivity are the most pressing issues associated with drylands
    and land degradation [6]. Globally, water scarcity is already affecting 1–2 billion
    people, and a majority of them are concentrated in drylands, where the supply
    of water is insufficient to meet the user demands [7]. Future climate projections
    also suggest that in coming decades more people will be facing huge shortages
    of water. Consequently, climate change and water management decisions will adversely
    affect drylands and their inhabitants [8]. As global population is increasing
    rapidly, agricultural productivity in drylands needs improvement to meet food
    security demands. Therefore, adopting smart irrigation approaches is a viable
    option to better utilize the available water resources and improve water productivity
    in drylands. Water scarcity has become one of the critical issues and threatens
    the sustainable development in drylands [9]. Water scarcity occurs when water
    demand becomes equal or even exceeds the total available fresh water resources
    [10]. Water scarcity should be considered from both physical and economic perspectives
    [11]. Physical water scarcity has two aspects: green water scarcity (soil moisture
    in root zone is insufficient to meet crop water demands), and blue water scarcity
    (both surface and ground water availability is unable to meet human water needs)
    [12]. The economic water scarcity occurs when water resources are physically available,
    but lack of institutional capacity and socioeconomic conditions limit the use
    of that water [13]. Water scarcity negatively impacts social integrity and sustainable
    economic development, especially in drylands. The primary sector, which is seriously
    affected, is agriculture, utilizing more than 80% of total fresh water [14]. Intensification
    of agricultural water scarcity could affect food production and threaten food
    security in drylands in the future [15]. Further, it may seriously impact the
    associated Sustainable Development Goals of SDG-2 (Zero hunger), SDG-6 (Clean
    water), SDG-7 (Clean and affordable energy), SDG 15.3 (Desertification control)
    and SDG-14 (Life below water), which are directly or indirectly dependent on water
    availability [16,17]. Since the available water resources are limited and to obtain
    more yields with less water use, efficient management of available water with
    improved water productivity is direly needed to meet future food demands [18].
    Managing irrigation efficiently is challenging in drylands because there are so
    many factors to take into account, such as crop type, climate, soil type, and
    irrigation methods [19]. Drylands are characterized by high potential evapotranspiration,
    low and erratic rainfall and high temperature [20]. Additionally, predicted extreme
    weather events due to climate change will further worsen the situation. Besides
    hostile environmental conditions, increasing water scarcity in these regions is
    posing serious threats to irrigated agriculture and sustained food production
    [16]. Although agriculture consumes about 80% of the total water utilized in the
    agriculture sector globally [14], this irrigation generates a lower return per
    unit of water used than other economic sectors [21]. The use of traditional irrigation
    methods and low water use efficiency (35–40%) caused by poor management are major
    constraints to sustainable crop production in drylands [22,23]. Moreover, farmers
    in these regions still rely on traditional irrigation systems that manifest the
    lowest WUE. This situation puts enormous pressure on the agriculture sector to
    become more efficient in irrigation water use and evoked the call for a “Blue
    Revolution” in water-limited agricultural regions “to produce more crop per drop
    of water.” Efficient water-saving irrigation approaches, especially the application
    of smart irrigation systems, have the potential to meet this critical challenge
    in dryland productivity. A smart irrigation system applies water in the right
    amount, at the right time and place, in a field [24]. Smart irrigation offers
    better irrigation decision-making by using several factors, including soil and
    climate variation, soil hydraulic properties, plant responses to water deficits,
    and changes in weather factors, that can help save water and increase yields [25].
    By using smart irrigation systems, farmers can save precious resources without
    exposing plants to moisture deficiencies [26]. Smart irrigation has been argued
    as a way to manage soil variability and gain economic benefits by fulfilling the
    specific irrigation demands of individual crops [27]. It is also implied that
    the smart irrigation system will be managed in such a way that will enable nutrients
    and water to be delivered directly to the plant roots [28]. To the best of our
    knowledge, studies addressing the issue of low water productivity in dryland agriculture
    and its improvement through adoption of smart irrigation approaches is limited.
    Therefore, the specific objectives of this article were (i) to present an overview
    of the constraints of low water use efficiency in dryland agriculture, (ii) to
    assess the conventional irrigation scheduling methods, and (iii) to examine the
    feasibility and benefits of smart irrigation systems for better irrigation management
    to enhance water productivity in water-scarce regions. 2. Major Constraints of
    Agricultural Productivity in Drylands 2.1. Land Degradation Natural processes
    such as vegetation loss, wildfires, overgrazing, climate change, wind and water
    erosion and other adverse/destructive anthropogenic activities cause land degradation
    (Figure 1) [3,29]. This causes a substantial decline in the functional capabilities
    of those specific areas, negatively influences agricultural activities and productivity
    and natural resources management, creates economic loss, and loss in biological
    activity [30]. Generally, land degradation is more critical or serious in dryland,
    semiarid and arid areas [31]. These include some parts of central Asia, China,
    Africa and the Mediterranean basin [32]. Land degradation in Africa highly impacts
    Somalia, Eritrea, and Ethiopia (horn of Africa) [33]. A prominent sign of land
    degradation is the occurrence of unexpected climatic conditions and vegetative
    stress [34]. Moreover, low levels of soil nitrogen and organic carbon (C) show
    a state of land degradation that leads to very low soil fertility [35]. Stavi
    and Lal [36] reported that land degradation increases by 5–10 million hectares
    every year globally. Ibrahim et al. [37] found that the increase in land degradation
    observed in the Africa Saharan region was mainly due to the increase in drought
    frequency from 1968–1990. Figure 1. Global distribution of land degradation based
    on severity of human-induced pressure [29]. To gain insight into land degradation
    intensity, statistical methods and models have been utilized using data collected
    over the years. These models allow precise predictions about land degradation
    intensity [38]. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is one of the methods
    used to measure the vegetation mass over a specific area [39]. NDVI represents
    the vegetation state of an area in terms of numerical values. If numerical values
    are negative, it means there is a reduction in vegetation. A study carried out
    by Ibrahim et al. [37] using residual trend analysis of NDVI showed substantial
    evidence of soil degradation in sub-Saharan West Africa. The study also highlighted
    the drought occurrence caused by vegetation decline in Africa. Pravalie et al.
    [40] reported that the impending increase in land degradation is posing serious
    threats to the people of developing countries. Disease proliferation, decrease
    in crop yields and increasing armed conflicts are the major outcomes of land deterioration.
    A possible solution to land degradation is to achieve a state of land degradation
    neutrality (LDN) [41]. LDN is a state where land is retained in a stable condition
    capable of enduring biological functions including facilitating appropriate food
    security [42]. Sustainable land management practices such as soil amendments (addition
    of biochar, manuring, composting) to restore degraded lands could be used to decrease
    the effects of land degradation [43]. 2.2. Water Scarcity Issues and Sustainable
    Development Goals Water availability is one of the main indicators of land degradation,
    and upsurge in land degradation is potentially aggravating water scarcity [44,45].
    Availability of water is jeopardized by lessening of ground and surface water
    due to reduction in biomass [46]. This results in less water available for agricultural
    (Figure 2) [16] and domestic use. Scarcity of water is an indicator of safe water;
    hence, water scarcity is a deficiency in fresh water resources to meet the standard
    water demand [11]. Successful achievement of SDGs is dependent upon the water
    security of both human and environmental systems (Figure 3) because water is directly
    linked to all SDGs [7]. The leading reasons for water scarcity are droughts, climate
    change, and inaccessibility and inadequate management of resources [47]. Rosa
    et al. [16] reported that in 2012, almost 2.3 billion people did not have access
    to safe water. Access to safe water is an important factor as it decreases disease
    frequency and social problems, including unemployment, malnutrition, and poverty
    [48]. Agriculture and industrial sectors use the largest proportion of water,
    and this water is usually drawn from below ground, lakes and rivers [49]. Falkenmark
    [50] reported that water scarcity poses substantial threats to the agriculture
    sector, which requires sufficient quantity of water for irrigation. Crop production
    and food security are directly dependent on sufficient water availability [51].
    Water scarcity leads to plant stress, resulting in various environmental problems,
    such as intensified soil erosion and salt concentration [52]. Increasing climate
    change, land degradation, and population necessitate the development of effective
    management systems to wisely mitigate water scarcity [53,54,55]. Figure 2. The
    global distribution of agricultural blue water scarcity (BWS), green water scarcity
    (GWS), and economic water scarcity (EWS) [16]. Figure 3. Interlinkage of SDGs
    and water highlighting the importance of water security for humans and environment.
    Liu et al. [12] described the common indicators employed to evaluate water scarcity,
    such as IWMI, (a system that evaluates the economic and physical changes influencing
    the availability of water within a country), the criticality ratio (a ratio of
    water consumption to the available water resources) and Falkenmark indicator (which
    compares the quantity of available water against the number of people who consume
    that water). Water stress and crowding indices may also be employed to measure
    water scarcity in a country. These indices also estimate the decrease or increase
    in water scarcity. Efforts are required to curtail the water scarcity issues.
    In this regard, implementing efficient water use practices and managing water
    in high-risk regions are important aspects to address [45]. These efforts could
    decrease water scarcity and increase access to adequate agricultural and drinking
    water. Moreover, by taking care of structural and social customs, governments
    can effectively resolve major conflicts. Hence, joint efforts are needed from
    governments and research institutes to resolve the water scarcity problem successfully
    [56]. 2.3. Climate Variability Variations/changes in climatic conditions often
    impact human, biological and agricultural systems through decreasing water resources,
    rising global temperatures, heavy precipitation, elevation in permafrost thawing,
    worsening water and air quality, rise in sea level, health risk, food supply and
    availability, intense drought, disturbing rainfall periods, and devastating effects
    on coastal infrastructure [57,58]. East Africa is an example of climatic anomalies,
    and the progression of increased rainy seasons, droughts and temperatures is detrimental
    to the development of this area [59]. In Tanzania, crop data techniques predicted
    a yield reduction of 7.6%, 8.8%, and 13% in rice, sorghum and maize by 2050, respectively
    [3]. The impacts of variation in climatic events are significantly negative [60],
    for example, the Mediterranean Basin has shown a prominent rise in average temperatures
    beyond global changes, with significant impacts on plant processes and water resources
    [61]. Climatic variation may induce a significant reduction in crop growth and
    productivity and increase vector-borne diseases, thus threatening food security
    [62]. Heavy rain and early frost may have negative effects on flowering periods
    and induce frost damage, while dry seasons or droughts largely decrease the decomposition
    of soil organic matter [63]. Such alterations induce negative impacts on biological
    systems. Fitness of the population is one of the main factors negatively affecting
    community structures and population dynamics [64]. Thus, it becomes vital to develop
    mitigation practices to decrease climate change impacts on agriculture. Several
    mitigation protocols for climate change impacts suggested by Haussmann et al.
    [65] and Gomez-Zavaglia et al. [66] are: (i) developing skills for water management,
    (ii) improving methods of breeding selection, (iii) capacity building of farmers,
    (iv) genetically improved seeds with better adaptation to increased temperatures,
    (v) reducing livestock and crop emissions, (vi) changes in net irrigation, and
    (vii) sequestering carbon in soils. 2.4. Overexploitation of Groundwater Increasing
    economic growth has resulted in continuous demand for water, leading to groundwater
    overexploitation, especially in big cities [67]. Both humans and the environment
    rely heavily upon groundwater; therefore, understanding its environmental implications
    is vital [68]. Over-pumping of water is a global issue, primarily caused via agricultural
    water use. Among its effects are the drying of wetlands and streams, phreatophytic
    vegetation elimination, soil subsidence, storage loss, decline in groundwater
    level, increased pumping cost, and soil salinization [69,70]. Recently, the exploitation
    of groundwater resources has become increasingly critical, especially in semiarid
    and arid coastal areas. In these regions, the coastal aquifers are at risk due
    to the intrusion of salty marine water. For example, Tripoli in northwestern Libya
    has been experiencing progressive seawater intrusion into its coastal aquifers
    since the 1930s due to its ever-growing demand for water [71]. Groundwater overexploitation
    not only causes water-quality degradation and aquifer depletion but also influences
    the ecological stability of wetlands and streams, resulting in substantial losses
    of biodiversity and habitat. Therefore, societies should realize that water resources
    are vulnerable and finite and discover methods to resolve the stresses of human
    development on nature’s tolerance. Educating the public about human influences
    on the environment is the first step toward sustainable water use. 2.5. Socioeconomic
    Drivers The adverse impacts on water availability, agricultural productivity,
    and economic feasibility have been correlated with the displacement of residents
    [49]. Countries dependent on other countries’ agricultural productive capabilities
    are also seriously affected. Food insecurity and hunger are common outcomes of
    poor agricultural production phases for millions who are dependent on agriculture
    [72]. The 1980s famine in Africa resulted from a decline in agricultural productivity
    [73,74]. Generally, droughts indicate decreased food security [75]. Between 1992
    and 1995, drought periods aggravated already problematic conditions in Africa.
    There was income loss for farmers, a rise in unemployment, and a decline in maize
    export to neighboring states. Moreover, there was an emergence in incurred service
    debts through farmers [76]. Gebremskel et al. [33] stated that drought periods
    in East Africa have caused more than 0.5 million deaths and financial losses up
    to US $1,500,000. Several rural residents heavily rely on land productivity. Thus,
    rising water scarcity, land degradation and drought frequency cause adverse effects
    on people’s lives [77]. Couttenier et al. [78] reported that social conflict could
    erupt as a result of decreased availability of farmland and water (e.g., civil
    war in Darfur). Rifts for agricultural resources and farmland often generate deadly
    circumstances. Ongoing conflicts among Fulani herdsmen farmers in Nigeria are
    another example of such conflicts. These conflicts resulted in 68% of total deaths
    in north-central Nigeria [79]. 2.6. Droughts Drought is a condition of abnormally
    dry weather sufficiently prolonged, lacking water to induce hydrologic imbalance
    and constraining agricultural activities in the affected region [80]. Drought
    types such as inter-annual droughts stay longer and decrease crop productivity,
    whereas inter-seasonal drought may be short and controlled via efficient water
    management [81]. Hermans and McLeman [82] reported that repeated occurrence of
    drought contributed towards degradation of land. Henchiri [83] reported that sub-Saharan
    Africa has faced long periods of drought with greater intensity. Nijbroek et al.
    [84] demonstrated that Namibia is an arid country and faced drought for many years,
    as well as neighboring counties of South Africa being liable to droughts repeatedly
    triggered by El Niño—Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a system of warm seawater that
    passes over the Pacific about every 10 years. Climate change could trigger desertification,
    induce natural calamities and environmental susceptibility. An increase in drought
    frequency is also expected because of climate change [85]. Droughts cause extreme
    distress to food security, agricultural productivity, and the economy [81]. Losses
    of up to US $120,000,000,000 were noted over a period of 30 years in Europe. In
    southern Africa, more than 10,000,000 tons of food was needed in terms of aid
    to drought-affected areas [3]. Africa has an unpleasant history of droughts with
    devastating effects on food security [86]. The most disturbing drought was during
    1991–1992. It caused a huge loss in agricultural productivity, massive unemployment,
    and economic despair. Given the detrimental effects of drought, it is important
    to improve agricultural practices in response to droughts. One such practice is
    environmental restoration. Land restoration helps to reduce land degradation impacts
    [87]. Rigorous land restoration can be attained through tree plantations in degraded
    lands. Alternatively, in situ planting of seeds that could lead to natural regeneration
    may also be used [87]. Predicting droughts is also useful for proper mitigation.
    Recently, scientists in Kenya introduced a technology by satellite analysis, which
    can forecast droughts with 90% accuracy [88]. Moreover, better water management
    techniques and planting drought-resistant trees and crops may remove the distressing
    damage droughts have on the agriculture. Thus, most African nations should focus
    on irrigation as a method to reduce drought impacts (Figure 4) [89]. Figure 4.
    Countries affected by drought in 2020–2022 [89]. 2.7. Conventional Technology
    In dryland regions, most farmers employ old farming techniques that result in
    failure to manage food for increasing populations [90]. The traditional farming
    techniques generate little food [3]. Agriculture conservation (crop rotation,
    soil cover and minimum tillage) could help to enhance crop yields with increasing
    profitability and decreasing soil degradation [91]. Some techniques are not used
    by subsistence farmers mainly because of unfamiliarity [92]. The implication of
    microbial-resistant varieties or seeds is less common in Africa [93]. These advancements
    have the capability to improve yield and increase stress tolerance. Nonetheless,
    most farmers in rural areas are lacking access to services and information to
    be effectively used in their favor [94]. Sarkar et al. [95] reported that the
    use of modern techniques is helpful and provides opportunities to farmers for
    increasing the crop yields. Digitizing farming methods permits farmers to guess
    the yield and weather forecast, select suitable crops according to the area, and
    improve irrigation systems. Nuclear technology is also used as a tool to increase
    yield via radioactive isotope utilization. These are used as early detectors and
    tracers of the existence of diseases. Moreover, applying nuclear technology in
    agricultural practices can increase crop productivity by 40%, improve soil structure
    and texture, and decrease labor and input costs [96]. Nonetheless, the main hindrance
    is that modern farming techniques and technologies are not available to the majority
    of farmers in dryland areas. 3. Traditional Approaches Used for Irrigation Scheduling
    The amount of water and its application timing is crucial in irrigation scheduling
    (IS), either in agriculture or landscapes [97,98]. Irrigation water requirement
    is measured following a criterion that determines irrigation needs and methods
    to apply a calculated amount of water [18]. In order to use irrigation water efficiently,
    we have to understand the dynamics of plant water use, together with weather,
    plant physiology, and soil properties. Among the various irrigation scheduling
    approaches developed and suggested, three types are most important: weather-based,
    soil moisture-based, and plant water status-based [28,99]. 3.1. Weather-Based
    Irrigation Scheduling In weather-based irrigation planning, reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) is calculated by measuring the weather elements that reflect the amount
    of water lost via plants and soil [28]. Solar radiation, humidity, air temperature
    and wind speed influence the quantity of water lost through evapotranspiration.
    In the absence of soil and plant measurements, weather attributes are used to
    determine irrigation schedules based on evapotranspiration [100]. Reference evapotranspiration
    can be calculated following the FAO Penman–Monteith equation by measuring the
    solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature and humidity [100,101]. Daily crop
    water use can be calculated by: ETc = Kc × ET0 where ETc = crop evapotranspiration
    (mm day−1), Kc = crop coefficient, and ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm
    day−1). The method is strongly dependent on (1) the accurate calculation of ET0,
    (2) better Kc curve development over the entire crop-growing season, (3) determination
    of soil water-holding capacity by analyzing soil properties, and (4) quantifying
    site-specific rainfall [102]. Mostly, real-time weather monitoring systems are
    equipped with an automatic weather station containing sensors for temperature,
    rainfall, wind speed, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation [103].
    These data loggers are designed to obtain data automatically at periodic intervals,
    and these data are transferred to an online data access portal. Data loggers communicate
    with remote servers using a wireless sensor network (WSN) or Internet of Things
    (IoT) framework [18]. WSN is one of the most popular technological methods that
    is used to precisely monitor the weather and environmental parameters [104,105,106,107,108].
    These data finally reach smart irrigation controllers, which in combination with
    site-specific variables (e.g., soil type), set up the irrigation schedule. The
    selection and performance of a weather monitoring system depends upon different
    accuracy, installation, robustness, data acquisition, maintenance, and power requirements.
    An IoT-based weather monitoring system demonstrated by Wasson et al. [109] monitors
    and analyzes the crop environment in terms of wind speed, temperature, solar radiation,
    soil moisture, and humidity using various weather-based sensors connected through
    a wireless network for data transfer and web-based services. Likewise, Khoa et
    al. [110] implemented an IoT platform for smart irrigation management. They suggested
    an innovative topology of sensor nodes with low cost. The authors were satisfied
    with the performance of the LoRa LPWAN (long-range low-power wide area network)
    technology transmission module system. A multiagent-based monitoring approach
    consisting of an open-source platform (PANGEA) was used to collect data on weather
    elements and soil moisture via different sensors. This platform is equipped with
    several master and slave nodes connected through sensors for data transfer [111].
    Many researchers [112,113,114] have also employed WSN and IoT based platforms
    for weather-based monitoring and reported satisfactory performance of the systems.
    Although weather-based irrigation scheduling is widely practiced, the heterogeneity
    of soil properties used to estimate soil water volume affects the amount of available
    soil water. In addition to that, spatiotemporal, variability in large-scale evapotranspiration
    is another challenge confronted by this approach. 3.2. Plant-Based Irrigation
    Scheduling Plant-based irrigation scheduling mainly relies on several indices
    indicating plant water status [115]. The relationship between soil moisture deficit
    and crop water stress helps to determine irrigation scheduling. Plant-based irrigation
    scheduling is sensitive to measurements conducted at a specific crop stage to
    determine water deficit in plants [18]. Since varying plant species, plant tissues,
    and crop growth stages have variable sensitivity to moisture deficit, several
    plant-based stress measurements have been suggested for irrigation scheduling
    [99]. There are two principal categories based on plant variable measurements
    used for irrigation scheduling: firstly, plant water status-based direct measurements
    including leaf, stem, and xylem water potential status and indirect measurements
    pertinent to leaf thickness, turgor pressure, and trunk diameter [116,117]; and
    secondly, plant physiology-based estimates including sap flow, stomatal conductance,
    xylem cavitation, and thermal sensing [118]. A leaf turgor pressure sensor estimates
    the relative change in leaf turgor pressure to determine leaf water stress [119].
    In addition to transpiration water loss, root water uptake and cellular osmotic
    pressure determine the magnitude of turgor pressure. For example, a ZIM probe
    (leaf turgor pressure sensor) is a noninvasive leaf patch clamp pressure probe
    that can detect leaf turgor pressure. ZIM probes are capable of measuring even
    minute shifts of turgor pressure within leaves in real time [119,120]. Due to
    advanced electronic technologies, researchers have developed small leaf sensors
    and tested them against cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum
    L.) plants. Leaf thickness-based irrigation timing improved WUE by 25–45% compared
    to preset irrigation plans [121]. In another study, Afzal et al. [122] reported
    that leaf thickness and leaf electrical capacitance (CAP) could be employed for
    leaf water status monitoring. Based on energy balance and heat pulse, thermal
    sensors have been developed to determine sap flow from plant stems, assisting
    irrigation scheduling. Sap-flow methods are able to provide in situ measurements
    of plant water use and transpiration dynamics. The Dynagage sap-flow sensors are
    the latest ones used to estimate sap flow and thus the water consumption by plant.
    The amount of heat utilized by the sap is measured by the energy balance sensors
    and gives the real-time sap flow in grams or kilograms per hour. These sensors
    require no calibration and offer an efficient and affordable method to determine
    the water use of plants [28]. During transpiration, the water in the xylem subjected
    to tension is directly proportional to the deficit in water to the point where
    the water columns can rupture or cavitate [123]. This cavitation leads to the
    eruptive formation of a bubble that contains water vapor [124]. Audio or ultrasonic
    frequency signals can detect these cavitation events, and the associated embolisms
    can hinder water flow [116]. Detection of such ultrasonic acoustic emissions (AEs)
    indicates plant stress and cavitation events. Thus, the AE rate can be used as
    a sensor to detect plant stress. Stem Diameter Fluctuations Stem and fruit diameter
    experience diurnal fluctuations due to changing water content [125]. Various water
    stress indicators can be determined by analyzing the daily patterns of stem diameter
    variation (SDV) [126]. The maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) and stem growth rate
    (SGR) are commonly used indicators for scheduling irrigation [115]. Currently,
    different optical sensors are used to detect plant water status, nutrient level
    and health condition. Two types of optical sensors (contact and noncontact) are
    primarily used [18]. Contact sensors are physically connected to plants, whereas
    noncontact sensors are vehicle-mounted, fixed, handled, or remotely controlled
    (aerial vehicles or satellite data) [28]. In many studies, monitoring through
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high-resolution cameras helped to generate
    irrigation maps over large cropped areas [127,128]. In another study, Lozoya et
    al. [129] used a sensor network to control green pepper growth under four different
    irrigation designs. Bauer and Aschenbruck [130] employed IoT and sensor network
    integration to monitor leaf area for optimizing irrigation. Several factors other
    than water content can affect the SDV-derived index, such as plant age, crop load,
    and field management practices. Furthermore, SDV estimates are usually affected
    by small raindrops and animals [131]. Canopy temperature measurement is another
    key method commonly employed for irrigation scheduling. Major canopy temperature-based
    methods include the crop water stress index (CWSI), temperature–time threshold
    (TTT), and temperature stress day (TSD) [132,133,134]. Infrared thermometers and
    thermal cameras are used to detect temperature. However, diurnal dynamics of temperature
    remain a major challenge for all the canopy temperature-based methods [99]. A
    major drawback of using plant-based sensors for irrigation management is that
    they lack direct estimates of irrigation water amount to be applied. Soil textural
    variability is another challenge affecting the accurate estimation of irrigation
    amounts needed. 3.3. Irrigation Scheduling Based on Soil Moisture Soil moisture
    monitoring is one of the fundamental approaches used for irrigation scheduling,
    and it is conducted by determining the soil water content or the soil water potential
    [135]. Monitoring soil moisture at high spatial and temporal resolution is critical
    for optimal irrigation scheduling [28]. Different types of sensors, such as time-domain
    transmission, neutron probes, granular matrix, and capacitance, are commonly implemented
    for soil moisture determination [136]. Gravimetric sampling to estimate soil moisture
    fluxes and a tensiometer is also used to measure soil matric potential, reflecting
    the amount of soil water available for plant use [99]. With the advancement of
    technology, satellite and groundwater sensors are becoming popular as irrigation
    tools. Soil moisture sensors can be installed at multiple depths in the field
    and capture soil moisture dynamics. They enhance accuracy and improve understanding
    of changes appearing in soil water content pertinent to crop water use and irrigation
    [137]. Soil sensors also provide information about soil chemical, physical and
    mechanical properties obtained in the form of optical, electrical, mechanical,
    electromagnetic, acoustic, radiometric, and pneumatic measurements [138]. Measurement
    of these attributes assists in the estimation of maximum allowable depletion [139].
    Soil moisture sensors estimate the volumetric moisture content (VMC) by detecting
    changes in soil electrical and thermal properties [140]. Frequency-domain reflectometry
    sensors (FDR) can estimate field soil moisture content [129]. The sensors are
    put near the crop roots and show a moisture content range of 0–50% with 0.1% resolution,
    thus optimizing water use for vegetables. Shigeta et al. [141] found that real-time
    soil moisture sensing can be used in practical measurements of soil moisture fluxes
    by correlating the VWC of the soil with the capacitance of sensors inserted in
    the soil. In TDR sensors, two parallel rods are inserted at the desired depth
    to measure the soil moisture content. The rate of the electromagnetic pulse, which
    radiates from the sensor into the soil and returns to the soil surface, is directly
    proportional to soil water content. However, this is an expensive method for farmers.
    Other studies [142,143,144] interconnected IoT-based field monitoring with cloud-based
    monitoring and data analysis using an Ardunio controller. They found that the
    collected data were used to make predictions that helped reduce water consumption
    and improve crop yields. In another study, six capacitance-based sensors were
    used at three locations with a data logger [145]. This method improved the WUE
    compared to traditional approaches. Soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling
    has the disadvantage that plant water uptake and stress are affected by soil moisture
    content and also influenced by environmental conditions, pests and diseases, root
    zone salinity, and nutrient availability. Variation in soil properties also affects
    irrigation scheduling, which necessitates soil testing at multiple points for
    accurate estimation of soil moisture content. 4. Innovative Smart Irrigation Approaches
    A smart irrigation system consists of firmware, software, and hardware interconnected
    via various computational techniques, including artificial intelligence (AI) and
    deep learning (DL) etc., which ensures the right amount of water at the appropriate
    time in crops to improve WUE, increase yield, reduce fertilizer use, reduce labor
    cost, and save energy [146]. Various control methods are employed to improve irrigation
    system efficiency by monitoring variables such as canopy and air temperature,
    evapotranspiration, rainfall, and solar radiation. By integrating information
    from multiple sources, smart irrigation systems can significantly improve crop
    production and resource management [147]. The following section presents various
    recent techniques associated with smart irrigation systems in agriculture. 4.1.
    State-of-the-Art Smart Irrigation Technologies 4.1.1. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and Deep Learning AI is a machine’s ability to learn and implement tasks
    similar to those of a human brain, and it is powered by computers [148]. When
    applied to a certain problem domain, AI algorithms can mimic human decision-making.
    Irrigation systems have been integrated with AI for adaptive decision-making through
    fuzzy logic, expert systems, and ANNs [149]. An artificial neural network (ANN)
    is an algorithm for processing information that is inspired by the working of
    the human brain [150]. Like human brain neurons, an ANN also contains a neural
    network, but synapses are substituted with biased connections and weights [151].
    This facilitates the mapping of input and output relationships [152]. ANN-based
    control systems can learn and adapt to the variable dynamics, making them ideal
    for irrigation systems. Additionally, ANNs have been used as smart strategies
    in dealing with the issue of formulating mathematical models based on first principles.
    Recently, many researchers have employed ANN methods for irrigation scheduling.
    Using the AQUACROP model integrated with a dynamic neural network, Adeyemi et
    al. (2018) [149] simulated soil moisture for a potato crop. Karasekreter et al.
    [153] demonstrated energy and water savings up to 23.9% and 20.5%, respectively,
    by implementing an ANN integrated with soil physical properties and moisture content
    in a strawberry orchard. Umair and Muhammad [154] designed an ANN-based controller
    model in MATLAB using climate variables as input. A fuzzy logic system is an extension
    of Boolean logic that expresses logical values in the form of true or false and
    demonstrates the nonlinearity and uncertainty in real-world problems [155]. The
    fuzzy system uses different sets of input data to categorize data in membership
    classes, and then applies a decision rule to every set to produce human-like decision
    outputs [103]. Many researchers have recommended the use of fuzzy logic in irrigation
    control systems. Mendes et al. [156] designed a fuzzy inference system that can
    control the speed of the central pivot according to the spatial field variability.
    A fuzzy irrigation system developed by Mousa et al. [157] was used to compute
    evapotranspiration (ETo) via a fuzzy inference system using weather variables
    as input. They found that the fuzzy model was accurate and quick in obtaining
    the required evapotranspiration and net irrigation to recover the water loss.
    An expert system is another type of intelligent system used for irrigation control.
    Basically, an expert system is a computer program that simulates the verdict and
    behavior of an individual or organization with expertise in a certain area through
    the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies [158]. Expert systems can
    be used for problem-solving activities such as monitoring, control, planning,
    forecasting, prescribing, fusion, and decision-making [159]. An expert-controlled
    irrigation system enables farmers to quantify the water amount needed by crops
    at the appropriate time by considering the weather and soil conditions. Many researchers
    [160,161] have implemented expert systems for irrigation management. The expert
    system uses various knowledge-based inputs for accurate decision-making about
    irrigation scheduling. However, errors in knowledge-based input can seriously
    affect the performance and reliability of expert systems [162]. A hybrid intelligence
    system is another type of intelligent control system in which at least two artificial
    intelligence algorithms such as fuzzy logic and neural network are combined, known
    as “neuro-fuzzy” [149]. Other examples of such hybrid intelligence systems include
    fuzzy PID and GAPSO. Tsang et al. [152] employed seven different machine-learning
    algorithms to assess soil moisture conditions using aerial images of agricultural
    fields to control irrigation. The results demonstrated a 52% reduction in water
    consumption by reducing timing, irrigation level, and location errors. Similarly,
    a combination of ANN, genetic algorithm (GA) and the Bayesian framework was implemented
    to forecast daily irrigation demand under limited data conditions [163]. The results
    exhibited an improvement in forecast precision by 3% and 11%. Many other studies
    also demonstrated the use of intelligent hybrid systems and reported precise forecasting
    and improved control of irrigation systems [164,165]. The deep learning method
    is now applied to deal with millions of weights among neurons for a better understanding
    of behaviors owing to recent developments in computing technology in parallel
    processing, software and hardware. Deep learning has developed a revolutionary
    epoch, since it can solve the problems confronted by artificial intelligence for
    a long period [166]. Deep learning has been applied in the agriculture and hydrology
    fields due to difficulty in software data availability, budget, and complexity,
    such as crop evapotranspiration modeling and approximation [167]. Wang and Ma
    [168] reported that the traditional machine learning and deep learning models
    work similarly as a data-driven artificial intelligence technique and could be
    applied to model the convoluted correlation between input and output (Table 1).
    Nonetheless, deep learning has an advantage over traditional machine learning
    techniques because of its great hierarchical structure model [169]. Table 1. Application
    of various artificial intelligence technologies for irrigation management. 4.1.2.
    Model Predictive Irrigation Systems Development in smart agriculture through internet
    usage and increasing computational power facilitated large data collection from
    agricultural systems [180]. The model predictive system has been employed in irrigation
    scheduling, irrigation canal control, soil moisture, and stem water potential
    regulation [55]. Model predictive control (MPC) has manifested applicability to
    gate operation and control the canal flow. The management goal of model predictive
    control for canals is to maintain the level of water as close to the set-points
    as possible [181]. Thus, an appropriate model regulating the dynamics of canal-water
    levels is required. A model predictive control system has been employed to model
    water movement in the canals, keeping a specific level of water at different locations
    and the flow of water that affects these water levels [182,183,184]. The controlling
    instruments maintain the flow of water, by which the regulator can attain the
    management goals [180]. Nonetheless, attaining this goal is not straightforward,
    as variations in inflows and outflows interrupt the whole water system. To estimate
    future water flows and levels in response to control actions and disturbances,
    the water system (controller, canal reaches, disturbances and structures) needs
    to be modeled. Several authors have applied MPC in driving irrigation flows of
    canals. For instance, Puig et al. [185] applied MPC to create flow control approaches
    from the source of water to the user and Guadiana River’s irrigation territory.
    The results exhibited the usefulness of the MPC application. Zhang et al. [186]
    developed a non-cooperative distributed MPC algorithm based on Nash optimality
    for the regulation of water levels in canals. The simulation of system results
    indicated the efficacy of the advocated algorithm. To efficiently deliver the
    flow of a canal without oscillations, MPC was combined with online water storage
    to allow for a delay and evade wave distraction. The results indicated the significant
    development of canal setups using automation [180]. 4.1.3. Variable-Rate Irrigation
    (VRI) VRI is a method of applying irrigation at variable rates in different irrigation
    management zones over the entire field in an optimized way [187]. Normally, the
    application of irrigation water is uniform in the entire field. However, owing
    to soil spatial variability in soil topography, hydraulic properties and vegetation
    condition, the soil moisture content remains nonuniform [188]. When such soil
    spatial variability becomes significant, the field is split into different management
    zones consisting of those field areas with the same soil properties and crop conditions
    [150]. Then, irrigation is applied at differential rates in different management
    zones [189]. Such variable irrigation management may enhance the economic value
    of irrigation by improving WUE, increasing productivity and reduction in nutrient
    leaching [190]. This enables an accurate and timely water application based on
    soil spatiotemporal properties and plant demand [191]. In other words, VRI technology
    ensures the application of the right amount of water at the right time in the
    right field zone, resulting in significant water savings. The main components
    of VRI technology include sensors, prescription maps, spatial information, and
    a unit system to apply VRI prescription (lateral irrigation) in the crop field
    [192]. Optimization of VRI prescriptions is usually determined by using remote
    sensing, yield maps, topography, soil apparent electrical conductivity and soil
    maps [193,194]. There are different types of irrigation systems used for VRI applications.
    The variable-rate lateral irrigation system contains a global navigation satellite
    system (GNSS) or global positioning system (GPS) receiver, custom software-operated
    relays, and valves, thus supplying water at variable rates using the nozzle-pulsing
    method with a speed controller [26]. This system has high accuracy in controlling
    the irrigation rate and forward speed [195]. Likewise, the center pivot VRI system
    consists of a VRI and pivot control panels, control nodes, solenoid valves, a
    GNSS, a remote sensing control system, and a variable-frequency drive (VFD) [191].
    The speed and operation of the pivot are regulated by pivot control. The VRI controller
    panel governs the irrigation application based on pivot location and the prescription
    map. The flow of sprinkler heads is controlled by solenoid valves [26]. The pivot
    positioning is regulated by the GNSS system, and the control nodes attached to
    the pivot govern the valve opening and closing. VFD regulates the pressure by
    altering the irrigation rate at different points in the field [196]. The rotation
    speed of the pump impeller is also controlled by the VFD in response to the input
    communicated by the pressure switch mounted on the pump. It helps to maintain
    the pressure within the predefined threshold limits [197]. The use of VRI technology
    offers several advantages over conventional irrigation methods. VRI can substantially
    improve overall yields by avoiding under-irrigation and/or over-irrigation. The
    growers usually set up soil moisture sensors in those field areas with low soil
    water-holding capacity (WHC) to prevent under-irrigation in the field [198]. This
    practice may increase irrigation frequency, leading to over- irrigation with high
    soil WHC. Over-irrigation may result in yield loss due to nutrient leaching and
    depletion of oxygen in the root zone [39]. The prevention of under-irrigation
    in those field areas with higher yield potential could help optimize water input.
    Another advantage of using VRI is that irrigation can be withheld over those field
    areas that are not arable [199]. VRI also supports fertilizer application at variable
    rates that would benefit in matching the variability in crop nutrient requirements
    [200]. A two-year study led by Sui and Yan [192] demonstrated that crop water
    productivity for corn and soybean was much better under VRI than uniform rate
    irrigation (URI) in Mississippi. In another investigation, application of VRI
    with delineated management zones based on the difference in WHC showed better
    crop water productivity for maize and winter wheat, which was higher than the
    overall average of the field [201]. Besides its several advantages, VRI also has
    some disadvantages, including higher cost, complexity in developing soil maps,
    and maintenance of the system [202]. Overall, VRI technology is a good option
    to precisely utilize precious water resources, but considerable efforts are needed
    to make this technology affordable and more user-friendly. 4.1.4. Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for Irrigation Management UAVs, also called drones [203], are
    frequently linked with military operations, as they are used as weapons for targeting
    aircraft and involved in intelligence services. Recently, drones have been used
    in a wide range of applications, including delivery services, weather monitoring,
    traffic monitoring, surveillance, and rescue [204]. Several studies emphasized
    UAV utilization for forecasting and monitoring in agriculture to maintain crop
    health [205]. Drones are also useful for irrigation monitoring, as they use infrared
    or thermal imaging cameras in the IOT network [206]. Manual spraying of pesticides
    induces lethal diseases to workers globally, as described by the World Health
    Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization [207]. Thus, UAVs could be
    a potential alternative to manual pesticide spraying, reducing the potential ecological/environmental
    risks and health problems [205]. Recently, UAVs with IoT-based sensor networks
    have been used for smart irrigation purposes, thus significantly improving crop
    productivity [208]. Chebrolu et al. [209] suggested a technique of UAV images
    to rebuild a three-dimensional crop model that mediates crop growth monitoring
    based on a plant level. Likewise, the plant height of sorghum and maize plants
    was measured based on UAV images and a three-dimensional model [210]. Roth et
    al. [211] reported that the RMSE (root-mean-square error) was 0.33 m for a single
    sorghum’s height. The soybean leaf area index was extracted using 3D and UAV plant
    models. In another study, carried out by Deng et al. [212], different cameras
    were fixed on UAVs for smart farming. The results indicated that the UAV-based
    multiband images are useful and showed substantial ability for precise irrigation
    and agriculture management. RGB (red, green and blue) cameras can be used with
    a drone to determine crop biomass using visible reflectance for assessing vegetation
    indices [213]. According to Rokhmana [214], using UAVs for remote sensing can
    support precision farming. They can be used to obtain periodic information from
    the field, i.e., stock evaluation, plant health and vegetation monitoring. Several
    researchers examined the chances of applying IoT systems to govern crop health
    and irrigation monitoring. Automated water irrigation was innovated and employed
    by mobile applications [215]. The designed smartphone application can process
    and develop the soil images near the root surface of plants to ascertain sensor-less
    water quality. A smart drip irrigation method was established using an ARM9 processor,
    involving environmental conditions including CO2 amount, low moisture, and high
    temperature [216]. Zaier et al. [217] suggested an irrigation system controlled
    wirelessly to promote groundwater usage in large-scale fields of Oman. Oksanen
    et al. [218] stated that big data and IoT could be used to establish a real-time
    crop growth monitoring system, facilitating precise irrigation estimates. Based
    on the collection of plant data, they suggested establishing a central unit to
    develop a crop growth model, Oksanen et al. [218] proposed a method to forecast
    and diagnose wheat diseases, weeds, and pests using a computerized IoT-based method.
    A fungicide and insecticide management system based on predictive models for pests
    and crop diseases has also been developed using the IoT [219]. A new irrigation
    method based on the IoT was proposed by [220] where humidity sensors were applied,
    and high humidity values of 90–95% were recorded (Table 2). Table 2. Application
    of different types of UAVs for irrigation management. 4.2. Forecasting Smart Irrigation
    Technology with DSSIS A decision support system (DSS) is an interactive software-based
    system used to identify, analyze, and improve decisions based on raw data, documents,
    and personal knowledge [99]. Various decision support systems (DSSs) have been
    designed for managing irrigation water to improve WUE [230,231]. A smart and efficient
    DSS has to consider several factors, such as soil water status, crop type, irrigation
    method, weather information, and application, to develop irrigation scheduling
    [19]. To facilitate precise irrigation scheduling by minimizing errors in field
    soil moisture estimates, DSSs provide irrigation schedules not only for the current
    day but also to forecast irrigation events for future days. Based on the idea
    of forecasting irrigation, recently a prototype of an irrigation scheduling DSS
    called decision support system for irrigation scheduling (DSSIS) has been developed
    for arid regions [232]. This DSSIS has the ability to predict irrigation events
    for the current day as well as forecast irrigation for the future by using the
    weather information of the next 4 days. The DSSIS prototype consists of irrigation
    pipelines, software and hardware to control irrigation and peripheral equipment
    The irrigation pipelines consist of a drip irrigation system, valves and polyvinyl
    chloride pipes. The software controlling the irrigation system includes RZWQM2
    (Root Zone Water Quality Model) integrated with an irrigation scheduling software
    (RZ Irrsch and an online weather data acquisition system [233]. The irrigation-controlling
    hardware contains automatic control equipment. A peripheral equipment consists
    of a water reservoir, circulating pumps, and strainers. In DSSIS, the RZWQM2 model
    works as an engine and facilitates decision-making about irrigation scheduling.
    The RZWQM2 is first calibrated and validated according to site-specific experimental
    data (crop, weather, and soil data). The IrrSch software generates daily weather
    data from the nearby weather stations and also forecasts upcoming 4-day weather
    using a weather application program interface (API) then transfer this information
    to RZWQM2 [99]. Based on the information given by IrrSch, RZWQM2 predicts crop
    evapotranspiration, soil water stress factor (SWFAC), and soil moisture content
    for the current and next 4 days. When the current day’s water stress level falls
    below the preset threshold, an irrigation event is initiated. The amount of water
    to be supplied is computed by RZWQM2 using field capacity and the predicted soil
    water content and rooting depth. This system (DSSIS) has been tested for cotton
    irrigation scheduling under full, deficit, experience, and sensor-based irrigation
    treatments in an arid region. Under deficit irrigation, DSSIS saved 50% of irrigation
    water with a 4% increase in yield and up to 80% increase in water productivity
    over experience-based irrigation [232]. In another study, Chen et al. [234] evaluated
    the effect of irrigation scheduling by DSSIS on water productivity, seed cotton
    yield, and economic profitability under an arid desert climate. Under DSSIS, water
    productivity, seed cotton yield, and economic benefit were higher than soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation scheduling. Full irrigation DSS also maintained crop yield
    under deficit irrigation treatment. In a three-year field study, Chen et al. [233]
    evaluated irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) in cotton using the RZWQM2 model
    with DSSIS in an arid oasis. After validation, the RZWQM2 model was run with seven
    irrigation scenarios (from 850 to 350 mm water), and the long-term weather data
    (1990–2019) were used to estimate the best IWUE. The results manifested that the
    irrigation with 660 mm water produced the highest seed cotton yield (4.09 Mg ha−1),
    whereas irrigation with 550 mm water exhibited the highest IWUE (6.53 kg ha−1mm−1).
    These findings provided important guidelines for farmers to use deficit irrigation
    strategies. This will also help the farmers to develop and improve irrigation
    scheduling strategies with respect to their specific crop production settings.
    This irrigation forecasting DSSIS has been tested on a small scale in an arid
    oasis and provided satisfactory results regarding water productivity. It could
    be promoted over a large scale. To further improve the site-specific irrigation
    management, the soil textural variability could be analyzed and a local-level
    soil database could be developed through extensive soil sampling and analysis.
    This soil database could be integrated with DSSIS for scheduling irrigation for
    a specific field. This concept of irrigation is termed soil test-based irrigation
    prescription (STIP). Availability of site-specific soil information may result
    in potential gains in improved WUE and higher profitability in arid regions where
    existing irrigation strategies are poorly connected with local agronomic and biophysical
    settings. Hence, development of the STIP concept could be a way forward to improve
    WUE and further strengthen efforts to conserve and efficiently utilize the limited
    water resources in arid and hyperarid regions. 5. Future Prospects This paper
    presented an overview of advanced and smart irrigation practices for improving
    WUE in water-limited regions, but still there are some challenges that are important
    to consider for designing smart, sustainable and user-friendly irrigation systems.
    I. Variability in soil texture is a vital source of uncertainty because it influences
    the current and potential soil water storage estimates both vertically and latterly
    in a field. Therefore, site-specific soil analysis is one way to rectify this
    problem and obtain the exact soil parameter information needed for accurate irrigation
    scheduling. Site-specific soil test-based information integrated with smart irrigation
    systems can help to improve WUE in arid and semiarid regions. This method is called
    soil test-based irrigation prescription (STIP). The proper execution of STIP needs
    specific field soil sampling, analysis of soil properties and development of a
    soil database. This soil information with crop and weather data can be integrated
    with a model or decision support system to forecast an irrigation event. II. Most
    of the experiments related to smart irrigation systems were conducted on a small
    scale in research fields or under controlled environmental conditions, which cannot
    represent commercial farming practices. Therefore, more on-farm studies in large
    fields are needed for a clear understanding about the implementation of smart
    irrigation technology. III. Most of the commercial smart irrigation systems offered
    by different irrigation companies help to improve water use efficiency, but the
    high cost of these state-of-the-art devices is a serious challenge for farmers.
    Moreover, these commercial smart irrigation systems are custom-built, meaning
    difficulty in control and adaptability. Therefore, affordable and user-friendly
    equipment should be manufactured at a local level. IV. Most of the farmers in
    dryland regions are not well educated and should be trained through practical
    demonstration of smart irrigation systems by expert extension workers. Furthermore,
    governments should provide subsidies to farmers for dissemination of such technologies
    on a large scale. 6. Conclusions This article provided an overview of the major
    constraints to agricultural productivity, traditional irrigation scheduling methods,
    and efforts and advancements that have been achieved to enhance WUE, conserve
    water, and most importantly guarantee food security through the adoption of different
    smart irrigation approaches in dryland regions. Dryland agriculture is largely
    affected by low WUE because farmers are relying upon traditional irrigation scheduling
    methods, resulting in over- and/or under-irrigation of fields and yield reduction.
    In this situation, adoption of smart irrigation approaches or technologies including
    artificial intelligence and deep learning (ANN, fuzzy logic, expert system, hybrid
    intelligent system, and deep learning), model predictive irrigation systems, VRI
    technology, and UAVs could ensure high water use efficiency and productivity in
    water-scarce regions. These technologies consider several factors, including soil
    and climate variation, soil structure and hydraulic properties, plant responses
    to water deficits, and changes in weather factors to apply the right amount of
    water at the right time and place. However, all these methods face some challenges
    regarding accurate execution and performance under field conditions, which could
    be rectified by incorporating indigenous knowledge and through practical demonstrations
    to the farmers. Smart irrigation technologies are revolutionizing global agriculture.
    Such technologies are highly desirable to achieve the SDGs and improve the living
    standards of poor farmers in drylands. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning show potential
    for improving irrigation use efficiency. In this study, two independent methods
    to determine the irrigation dose in processing tomatoes were calibrated, validated,
    and tested in an irrigation experiment. The first method used multispectral imagery
    acquired from an unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) to estimate the FAO-56 crop coefficient,
    Kc. The second method used an artificial neural network (ANN) trained on eddy
    covariance measurements of latent heat flux and meteorological variables from
    a nearby meteorological station. An irrigation experiment was conducted, where
    the farmer was instructed through a mobile application with updated irrigation
    recommendations. Evapotranspiration estimated by the new methods was set as the
    irrigation dose for the UAV and ANN treatments. The best-practice irrigation,
    commonly used by the regional farmers, was set as the control treatment (100%),
    guided by an irrigation expert and soil sensors for feedback. Derivatives of this
    treatment at 50%, 75%, and 125% of the control irrigation dose were tested. Yield,
    water use efficiency (WUE), and Brix level were measured and analyzed. Results
    show that both methods, UAV and ANN, estimated evapotranspiration to derive the
    irrigation dose at a near-perfect agreement with best-practice irrigation, both
    in the total amount and irrigation rate. Furthermore, there were no significant
    differences between the best practice and the experimental treatments in yield
    (117 ton/ha), water-use efficiency (31.7 kg/m3), and Brix (4.5°Bx). These results
    demonstrate the potential of advanced machine learning techniques and aerial remote
    sensing to quantify crop water requirements and support irrigation management.

    1. Introduction Water demand is expected to increase by 55% globally between 2000
    and 2050, mainly for manufacturing, electricity, and domestic use (OECD, 2012).
    This will leave a small margin to increase water supply to agriculture, and therefore,
    it is imperative to increase the agricultural water use efficiency. A precise
    estimation of crop water requirement, or crop evapotranspiration (ETc), can improve
    irrigation management and water use efficiency throughout the growing season.
    Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) is one of the most important vegetable crops
    globally, with production estimated by 180 million tons in 2017 (FAOSTAT, 2019).
    It is also one of the most demanding in water (Peet, 2008). Sub-optimal irrigation
    in some growing stages has been shown to significantly affect the marketable yield
    (e.g., Kuşçu et al., 2014). Accordingly, improvement in tomato irrigation could
    result in significant water savings. Therefore, tomato is a suitable model crop
    for evaluating novel irrigation strategies. The FAO-56 crop coefficient approach
    is one of the most commonly applied irrigation management methods (Allen et al.,
    1998). Using this approach, ETc is estimated based on the reference evapotranspiration
    from a hypothetical crop (ET0) such that: (1) ETc=Kc x ET0 where ET0 is commonly
    derived using the Penman-Monteith Method, while Kc for specific crops in specific
    environments is empirically determined in water consumption experiments to isolate
    the atmospheric evaporative demand from the plant reaction. Standard Kc tables
    that were derived by extension services worldwide are given by FAO-56 (Allen et
    al., 1998). However, tabulated Kc values may not be sufficiently accurate when
    the regular crop development is inhibited by stress factors or irregular weather
    conditions. Therefore, remote sensing estimations of Kc based on vegetation indices
    that reflect the ground cover and crop development level in near-real-time can
    serve as surrogates of Kc that overcome this limitation (Rozenstein et al., 2018,
    Rozenstein et al., 2019, Kaplan et al., 2023). In a previous study, Kc estimation
    models were developed for processing tomatoes based on Sentinel-2 imagery that
    is available at a frequency of 5 days at 10–20 m spatial resolution, and Venµs
    imagery that are available at a frequency of 2 days at 5–10 m spatial resolution
    (Kaplan et al., 2021a, Manivasagam et al., 2019). This development facilitated
    estimating Kc at a high enough temporal resolution for irrigation decisions that
    well capture within-ﬁeld variability. However, in cloudy environments, even such
    a high revisit time may not be enough to support near-real-time estimations of
    Kc from optical satellite imagery. In addition, satellite pixels are too coarse
    to properly estimate Kc in narrow plots. Low-flying, unoccupied aerial vehicles
    (UAV) can overcome such limitations. A UAV can capture imagery on days not covered
    by satellite overpasses and even under clouds (Tmušić et al., 2020). Moreover,
    the spatial resolution of low-altitude remote sensing imagery is better suited
    for small plots (Aasen et al., 2018, Malachy et al., 2022). Kc estimations from
    UAVs equipped with multispectral cameras have been previously used, e.g., by Zhang
    et al. (2019), Tang et al. (2019), and Shao et al. (2021) for maize. These studies
    demonstrated the ability of UAV multispectral imagery to reflect the crop ET status,
    also under deficit irrigation. Gautam et al. (2021) used a UAV equipped with a
    multispectral sensor to estimate Kc at the single vine level. Their results could
    improve precision irrigation by capturing the spatial variability of Kc within
    the vineyard. In parallel with the increased use of UAV, in recent years, there
    has been an upsurge in the use of machine learning for system modeling, not only
    for remote sensing data but also for irrigation management (e.g., Ohana-Levi et
    al., 2019; Shao et al., 2021; Romero et al., 2018). Reichstein et al. (2019) recently
    highlighted the potential of using deep learning techniques in geoscience to model
    dynamic time series. Fine et al. (2022) also used a deep learning approach to
    fill gaps in eddy covariance evapotranspiration data in different field crops
    in Israel. Input variables were air temperature, relative humidity, net radiation,
    wind speed, time of day, or various combinations of these variables. Results showed
    that the deep learning algorithm was superior to the commonly used gap-filling
    method based on lookup tables. Broad research was done on predicting reference
    evapotranspiration using machine learning (e.g., Laaboudi et al., 2012; Kumar
    et al., 2011, and references therein), but few on actual evapotranspiration (ETc)
    measurements over agricultural crops. Kelley and Pardyjak (2019) measured by eddy
    covariance actual crop evapotranspiration, ETc, from vegetable beans and hazelnuts
    and compared the results with ANN estimations. Results showed that the ANN approach
    robustly estimated ETc using input data of the variables: air temperature, solar
    radiation, air humidity, time of day, and wind speed. An ANN model was developed
    and tested by Yohanani et al. (2022) for estimating the actual evapotranspiration
    of a banana screenhouse crop, and the results were in good agreement with eddy
    covariance measurements. However, both Kelley and Pardyjak (2019) and Yohanani
    et al. (2022) conducted their ETc measurements in close geographic proximity to
    the meteorological sensors used to later predict ETc. In addition, the ANN presented
    by Kelley and Pardyjak (2019) did not include any input variable to represent
    the crop. Therefore, their ANN could not accurately predict ETc when the environmental
    and crop conditions differed from the training period. The above review suggests
    that UAV and ANN were widely used for evapotranspiration estimation but less for
    irrigation management. Moreover, no study examined these approaches for processing
    tomatoes irrigation. Hence, the overall aim of this research is to test two novel
    independent approaches to determine the irrigation dose in processing tomatoes.
    Specifically, actual evapotranspiration, ETc, was determined by estimating Kc
    from UAV multispectral imagery, and by the application of an ANN model, based
    on meteorological data. These approaches were tested in a field experiment against
    the current best practice in processing tomato irrigation. To capture potential
    deviations from optimal tomato yield, deficit and over irrigation treatments were
    also examined in the irrigation trial. Another scientific objective was to demonstrate
    that an empirical model to estimate Kc from Sentinel-2 imagery can be successfully
    migrated to be used for UAV imagery. 2. Materials and methods This chapter includes
    three sections. Section 2.1 describes the eddy covariance campaigns in the processing
    tomato fields used to measure the actual evapotranspiration (ETc) and ancillary
    data. Section 2.2 presents the calibration and validation of the UAV and ANN models
    based on the measurements in Section 2.1, and Section 3 describes the layout of
    the irrigation trial, the irrigation treatments the mobile application for irrigation
    management of the ANN treatment, and the performance evaluation. 2.1. Eddy covariance
    measurements and actual Kc estimations The eddy covariance (EC) method is one
    of the most accurate and direct approaches for measuring field-scale ETc over
    crops (Burba, 2013). This study is based on three datasets of eddy covariance
    campaigns over processing tomatoes in the Hula Valley (northern Israel; 33º08′
    N, 35º36′ E) (Fig. 1). The region has a Mediterranean climate: The summer is hot,
    rainless, and predominantly sunny with slight variation from day to day, and winter
    is cool and rainy. Processing tomato is grown in the dry summer and relies entirely
    on irrigation. Download : Download high-res image (710KB) Download : Download

    2020 (T20). Kavul: The weather station used for training the ANN model. Processing
    tomato fields were chosen according to EC measurement requirements: flat, uniform,
    and large enough to contain most of the flux footprint. All fields were drip-irrigated,
    and plant density was 25000 plants ha−1, as commonly practiced in Israel. The
    farmers'' experience dictated the irrigation regime, together with the FAO-56
    method as a reference. In T19a (Gadash 2019), the farmer received feedback from
    a tensiometer station with sensors at 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 m to ensure the irrigation
    replenished the soil water to the desired level. In T19b (Gadot 2019) and T20
    (Gadot 2020), the farmer’s experience was that a point measurement by a tensiometer
    station did not provide good representation of a large plot, and therefore it
    was not used. T19a campaign was conducted in the experimental field crop farm
    (‘Gadash’) with tomato cultivar ‘H-4107′ (Fig. 1). T19b and T20 campaigns were
    conducted at Kibutz Gadot, in two adjacent commercial fields in 2019 and 2020,
    with tomato cultivars ‘BQ-328′ and ‘H-4107′, respectively. Soil samples were tested
    for the soil properties (gravimetric water content, bulk density and soil particle
    distribution) using a soil sample rings kit (Eijkelkamp, Giesbeek, Netherlands),
    in order to calculate soil heat flux. Soil particle distribution was analyzed
    using the laser diffraction method (Mastersizer 2000, Malvern Instruments Ltd,
    Malvern, UK). The EC sensors in T19a, T19b, and T20 were installed at heights
    of 2.13, 2.17, and 2.2 m above the ground, respectively. The sensors'' height
    was determined as a compromise between sufficient fetch (distance from the edge
    of the field) and adequate height above the plant canopy (to be located within
    the constant flux layer). The EC system was installed in the middle of the fields
    to account for winds from all directions, except for T20, where it was installed
    20 m south of the center in order to improve the flux footprint containment inside
    the field, following the footprint modeled for T19b in the adjacent plot where
    the conditions were similar. Raw 20-Hz data was acquired by EC systems consisting
    of an open path gas analyzer (LI-7500DS; LI-COR Biosciences, USA) and a three-axis
    ultrasonic anemometer (Windmaster Pro; Gill Instruments Limited, Lymington, UK).
    In addition to the EC system, the experimental setup of each campaign included
    a net radiometer (Q*7.1; REBS, Seattle, WA, USA), soil heat flux plates (HFT-3.1;
    REBS, Seattle, WA, USA) and soil thermocouples. A combined temperature-humidity
    sensor measured air temperature and humidity (HMP45, Campbell Sci., Logan, UT,
    USA). Each dataset, which was between 50 and 70 days long, consisted of half-hourly
    latent heat flux (LE; associated with ETc) along with meteorological variables
    measured at the same tower: net radiation (Rn; W m−2), air temperature (°C), relative
    humidity (%), and wind speed (m s−1). These variables were chosen because, except
    for Rn, they are prevalent in standard meteorological stations. Raw data of the
    EC systems (20 Hz data) and meteorological variables were processed using EddyPro©,
    version 7.0 (LI-COR Biosciences, USA). The procedure employed by EddyPro included
    linear detrending, correction of low-pass and high-pass filtering effects, covariance
    maximization, and density fluctuation compensation with the Webb correction. Spikes,
    amplitude resolution artifacts, and unrealistic drop-outs, including other artifacts,
    were filtered using the statistical tests of Vickers and Mahrt (1997). After these
    procedures, the half-hourly flux data underwent additional analyses. Quality analysis
    based on the fulfillment of the theoretical assumptions of EC method (Foken et
    al., 2004) showed that the data exhibited some gaps in rare occasions. These gaps
    were related to rainy days scrambling the sensor’s reading or sensor malfunction.
    Very short gaps (up to three half-hours) were filled using linear interpolation,
    while days containing longer gaps during the daytime were filtered out entirely.
    This analysis further showed that during the daytime only 2% of the data was of
    low quality. Most low-quality data were at night when latent heat flux values
    were close to zero and thus negligible. Consequently, since the artificial neural
    networks require gap-free data for the training process, low-quality data were
    not filtered out. However, points of clear error were removed after a meticulous,
    manual data inspection. Four soil heat flux plates were buried at a depth of 0.08 m;
    two were on the plant bed (beneath the plant canopy), and two were on the path.
    Two thermocouples were buried above each soil heat flux plate at depths of 0.02
    and 0.06 m; a total of eight thermocouples were used to measure the soil temperature.
    The energy balance closure analysis is a common method to examine the quality
    of Eddy Covariance flux data. The energy balance is analyzed as the relation LE+H
    = a(Rn-G) + b, where, in a perfect closure, a= 1 and b= 0. In addition to that,
    the source area of the measured flux is estimated by calculating the 90% flux
    footrprint (according to Kljun et al., 2015, python script available online at
    http://footprint.kljun.net/). Every week or two, around noontime, the leaf area
    index (LAI) was measured in two areas in the field, averaging 30 readings in each
    area, using Sunscan-SS1 (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Derbyshire, U.K) (Kaplan and Rozenstein,
    2021). For the Kc calculation, ET0 data (downloaded from http://www.mop-zafon.net/)
    of the closest meteorological stations were used: ‘Hava 1′ station for Gadash
    and ‘Gadot’ station for Gadot. Both stations included the following sensors: A
    combined temperature-humidity sensor (HMP50, Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA), a
    pyranometer (LI200X, Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA), and an anemometer (03101 R.M
    Young Wind Sentry Anemometer, Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA). Both stations are
    located less than 1 km from the measured fields. This ET0 calculation was chosen
    in order to be comparable to the Kc values provided by the Israeli Extension Service
    (''Shaham'') and used by farmers. 2.2. Calibration and Validation of the models
    2.2.1. UAV The Kc estimation models developed for Sentinel–2 (Kaplan et al., 2021a)
    were applied to UAV 10–band multispectral imagery acquired with a Micasense (Seattle,
    WA, USA) Dual Camera system integrating the RedEdge-MX and RedEdge-MX blue Sensors.
    The Micasense system has a separate Downwelling Light Sensor (DLS2, Micasense,
    Seattle, Washington, USA) to provide multispectral calibration information in
    changing light conditions. In order to match the Micasense camera bands with the
    Sentinel-2 bands, we used four co-occurring satellite and UAV acquisitions of
    agricultural crops from January to March 2020, including two visits to a wheat
    field near Latrun monastery (31°49''31\"N 34°58''06\"E, 10 ha on 26/1 and 16/3),
    a wheat field near Volcani institute (31°59''50\"N 34°48''49\"E, 2.3 ha on 26/3)
    and an avocado plantation near Kfar-Monash (32°20''31\"N 34°56''19\"E, 11 ha on
    5/2). Flights took place as close as possible to the time of satellite overpass
    (around 10:30 AM local time). Flights were conducted at 100 m above ground at
    a speed of 10 m s−1 with 85% side and front overlap between images, resulting
    in a ground sampling distance of 7.3 cm pixel−1. An image of a radiometric calibration
    panel was captured before each flight and was used to obtain corrected reflection
    values. Micasense imagery was processed into orthomosaics using Pix4Dmapper (Pix4D
    S.A., Prilly, Switzerland). Level 2 A corrected Sentinel-2 Images were downloaded
    from the Copernicus Open Access Hub website (scihub.copernicus.eu). Satellite
    and UAV images were then resampled using bilinear interpolation to 10 m resolution,
    and the areas of the fields were extracted. In total, 3244 10 m by 10 m pixels
    from the four fields were extracted. Subsequently, linear regression models were
    fitted to overlapping pixels of Sentinel-2 and Micasense bands with similar central
    wavelengths (Manivasagam et al., 2019). The result was transformation equations
    from Micasense to Sentinel-2 reflectance values (Table 1) to which the Kc estimation
    models (Kaplan et al., 2021a) could be applied. The transformation achieved for
    the blue.444 band was not very good (R2 =0.136), but it did not affect the model
    used in this work that relied on the red and NIR bands. The data processing chain
    is described in Fig. 2. Table 1. Constants for use in the transformation equations

    (https://www.tensorflow.org/), was comprised of an input layer with seven variables,
    two fully connected hidden layers of 48 neurons each, and an output layer with
    one variable (Fig. 3). The activation function of the hidden layers was a variant
    of the ReLU, called leaky-Rectified Linear Units (leaky-ReLU). The leaky-ReLU
    had a small slope for negative values instead of a flat slope that helped mitigate
    a known problem of non-active ReLU due to 0 values (Xu et al., 2015). Next, each
    one of the hidden layers was followed by a dropout layer with a drop rate of 0.3,
    meaning 70% of randomly selected neurons were active in each iteration. The dropout
    layer and the relatively small size of the network were chosen in order to mitigate
    the risk of overfitting (model that perfectly predicts training samples but poorly
    predicts new data). Finally, the network was optimized using a Huber-loss. This
    makes the training less rigid and allows accounting for inaccuracies in the various
    variables fed to the network. Download : Download high-res image (226KB) Download

    used for modeling half-hourly evapotranspiration for irrigation. In the end, the
    network learns the relation given in Eq. 1, where ψ is the neural network and
    t is the time of the prediction (half-hourly data points). The network takes as
    an input two crop variables: the leaf area index (LAI) and days after planting
    (DAP), four meteorological variables: the air temperature ( Tair), the relative
    humidity (rH), the solar radiation (Rs), the wind speed (WS), and the time of
    day (TOD). Please note that the TOD and time of prediction are different: the
    TOD is the time since the beginning of the day, while the time of prediction is
    a timestamp, the amount of seconds since the 1st of January 1970. (1) LEt = (LAIt,
    DAPt, Tairt, rHt, Rst, WSt,TODt·) The output (i.e., the target; the latent heat
    flux LE) was taken from the eddy covariance measurements described in Section
    2.1. It can then be converted into ETc by scaling the latent heat flux using a
    fixed constant. The LAI was acquired from ground measurements using the Sunscan-SS1
    (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Derbyshire, U.K) and was interpolated to half-hourly data
    points and smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter (a 5th-order polynomial filter
    with a window length of 1501 points). Days after planting (DAP) was calculated
    from the day of transplanting as reported by the farmer. The meteorological variables
    were collected from the nearby meteorological station ‘Kavul’ (Fig. 1), which
    included the following sensors: A combined temperature-humidity sensor (HMP155,
    Vaisala, Finland), a pyranometer (SR20-T1, Hukseflux, The Netherlands), and an
    anemometer (4.3351.00.00 Wind Transmitter \"First Class\" Advanced, Thies Clima,
    Germany). Despite using the weather stations ''Hava 1′ and ''Gadot'' for the analysis
    of the EC data, as mentioned above, it was decided to use the ‘Kavul’ station
    as the source of the meteorological data for training the ANN for several reasons:
    1) to provide an estimation that is not based on in-situ sensors, which would
    allow access to all farmers in the region; 2) It provides high-temporal resolution
    data (every 10 min) and was found to be complete and reliably maintained; 3) It
    is fairly close to the Gadot and Gadash sites (7 and 9 km, respectively, see Fig.
    1) and at a similar elevation and climatic conditions. The training dataset comprised
    two processing tomato seasons: T19a (Gadash; 4019 half-hourly data points) and
    T19b (Gadot; 5049 half-hourly data points), overall 9068 data points. The dataset
    was split into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a test set
    using a 0.7/0.1/0.2 split, where the points in each set are selected randomly.
    The neural network was trained in 10,000 steps using the ADAM optimizer (Kingma
    and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 0.0005 and a batch size of 256 data points.
    The model was trained on a laptop with a Linux operating system, i5 CPU, and 16 GB
    of RAM in approximately 10 min. The model (trained on Gadash 2019 and Gadot 2019)
    was then validated against the eddy covariance measurements in Gadot 2020 and
    was also compared to the common FAO-56 method. For the latter, the crop coefficient,
    Kc, was taken from Shaham''s official Kc table according to the region and the
    planting date (Shaham, 2013). The Shaham Kc was multiplied by reference evapotranspiration,
    ET0, calculated from the closest meteorological station (‘Kavul’; 7 km away).
    ANN validation was quantified through daily RMSE calculations against the FAO-56
    estimations and the eddy covariance data, excluding rainy days due to limitations
    in the eddy covariance system (open-path gas analyzer). 3. The Irrigation experiment
    3.1. The experimental layout An irrigation trial was conducted in Gadash farm,
    close to the previous data-collection campaigns (33°10′55″N35°34′57″E). Processing
    tomato cultivar H-4107 was transplanted with a plant density of 25000 plant ha−1.
    After transplanting, the entire field was irrigated with 30 mm of water in order
    to fill the soil profile. Then it was uniformly irrigated according to the irrigation
    expert''s guidance for two months, after which the irrigation trial began. In
    total, six different irrigation treatments were tested: 1) “Control” – the ’best-practice’
    irrigation, our baseline. 2) 50% of the control. 3) 75% of the control. 4) 125%
    of the control. 5) “ANN” – irrigation based on the trained machine learning model.
    6) “UAV” - irrigation based on the Kc estimated from the UAV. Each treatment had
    six repetitions, as seen in Fig. 4 where each repetition comprised three 10 m
    by 2 m rows (60 m2). A timeline of the events is shown in Table 2. Download :

    Tomato irrigation methods 3.2.1. Control The new irrigation methods were compared
    with the current best-practice irrigation in Israel. This control treatment consisted
    of an expert relying on a set of soil tensiometers to determine the irrigation
    dose. The expert used the soil water tension data at three depths as feedback
    to confirm the correct irrigation; if a desired water tension threshold was not
    reached, the next irrigation could be supplemented to reach the target value.
    Three more treatments were derived from the control treatment as ratios of 50%,
    75%, and 125% of the 100% control irrigation dose. 3.2.2. Irrigation estimation
    from UAV The UAV equipped with a multispectral camera acquired images to estimate
    Kc and compute the required irrigation dose. The Kc estimation model developed
    for Sentinel–2 (Kaplan et al., 2021a) was adapted to multispectral imagery acquired
    with a Micasense1 RedEdge-MX Sensor using the developed transformation equations
    (see Section 2.2.1). UAV flights took place at the irrigation experiment site
    in Gadash Farm in the Hula Valley (33°10′55″N 35°34′57″E) around noon time every
    5–10 days during the 2020 growing season (Table 2) from an altitude of 50 m above
    the ground, with 85% front and side overlap to facilitate the generation of a
    good quality orthomosaic. A buffer masked every treatment replicate to include
    only pixels that were 2 m away from an adjacent treatment, i.e., only the middle
    section of the middle of the three rows was used for calculations. The average
    Kc value in the masked UAV treatment replicates together with ET0 data from a
    nearby meteorological station (Kavul station; 33°06′03″N 35°36′34″E) was used
    to calculate the actual ETc in this experimental treatment and to instruct the
    grower with an irrigation recommendation via the mobile application. The average
    Kc value remained constant between each flight while the ET0 was automatically
    updated. 3.2.3. Irrigation estimation from ANN The ANN used meteorological variables
    collected from the weather station at Kavul, including solar radiation, temperature,
    humidity, and wind speed, the average Leaf Area Index (LAI) of the control treatment,
    and time of the day and days since planting. The LAI was measured every one or
    two weeks around noontime, while the weather variables were acquired at a ten-minute
    sampling rate. Since irrigation was applied every day, an algorithm capable of
    forecasting the LAI while taking into account past measurements was built. A K-Nearest-Neighbour
    (KNN) algorithm was used to predict future LAI values with a two days sampling
    rate. This meant that the LAI was modeled at the beginning as the mean of all
    the past measurements. Then, as new measurements were collected, the extrapolated
    points followed the growth curve of the most similar examples in the database.
    To interpolate between the predicted points, a spline was fitted on top of them,
    relaxing the shape of the predicted curve and making the sampling of the predicted
    LAI more convenient. In the end, this model allowed us to predict the ETc at a
    half-hourly rate. We integrated the predicted values over a day to get the daily
    irrigation recommendation. ‘ANN’ treatment was deployed via a web application
    to provide the grower with daily evapotranspiration values. These daily ETc values
    were stored and displayed in graphic and textual formats. The display was updated
    daily with a new recommended irrigation dose according to the water consumption
    of the previous day (Fig. 4). When the irrigation frequency was less than daily
    (e.g., every two days or more), the grower added the estimated daily ETc values
    since the last irrigation to determine the recommended irrigation dose. Fig. 5.

    3.2.4. Performance evaluation Three metrics were used to evaluate the performance
    of the different irrigation methods: yield, water use efficiency, and brix. The
    yield is the most important metric; it is a measure of the fresh biomass of harvested
    red tomato fruit per unit area (e.g., ton ha−1). The yield was harvested only
    from 5 m of the middle row (total of 10 m2) and was weighed in the field; the
    outer rows acted as barriers from the adjacent treatments. This metric is supplemented
    by the water use efficiency, calculated by dividing the total yield (kg) with
    the total applied irrigation volume (m3) in each treatment. Finally, Degrees Brix
    is a measure of the sugar content in an aqueous solution. One Brix degree corresponds
    to one gram of sugar in 100 g of liquid. In the case of tomatoes, the Brix level
    is a common way to quantify their quality; higher is better, but there is usually
    a trade-off between quality and quantity. In general, less irrigation typically
    results in higher Brix but lower yield. To measure the Brix levels, 10 tomatoes
    were processed in a juicer, then the serum was extracted and measured using a
    refractometer (ATAGO CO., Japan). This process was repeated six times for each
    treatment. 4. Results 4.1. Eddy covariance measurements The meteorological characteristics
    of the datasets of the three eddy covariance campaigns are shown in Table 3. Table

    Energy balance closure is presented in Fig. 6 as scatter plots of half-hourly
    values of consumed energy (LE+H) versus available energy (Rn-G). For all three
    datasets, R2 is above 0.9. Additionally, Gadash 2019 (T19a) and Gadot 2019 (T19b)
    showed slopes of 0.9, while Gadot 20 (T20) showed a slope of 0.83. The bias of
    the linear regression was close to zero in all datasets. This indicated a good
    energy balance closure, as common in such flux measurements (Wilson et al., 2002),
    and, therefore, a reliable flux measurement by the eddy covariance system. These
    results also demonstrate the suitability of the field conditions, mainly the footprint
    and turbulence levels, for EC measurements. Gadash 2019 and Gadot 2019 are higher
    than the average closure indicated by Wilson (2002) (slope of 0.8), probably because
    of improvements in sensors and processing procedures over the last two decades
    (Aubinet et al., 2012). The favorable summer climatic conditions with a relatively
    high air temperature could also contribute to the high energy balance closure
    (Cui and Chui, 2019) during these campaigns. A possible reason for the slightly
    lower energy balance closure and R2 in Gadot 2020 is frequent disturbances to
    the net radiometer, IRGA and sonic anemometer caused by large presence of birds.

    (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Derbyshire, U.K), and Kc (crop coefficient), as calculated
    by dividing the ETc from the eddy covariance measurements with ET0 calculated
    from the nearby meteorological station, are shown in Fig. 8. LAI in Gadot 2019
    and 2020 showed a similar course but 2019 lagged by about two weeks. LAI in Gadash
    2019 was much lower than the other seasons. There is a clear resemblance between
    LAI and Kc courses with similar LAI to Kc differences among the seasons. During
    vegetative development, Kc increased rapidly and saturated from 55 DAP. Kc stayed
    relatively constant until 80 DAP with an average of 1, 1.23, and 1.3 for Gadash
    2019, Gadot 2019, and Gadot 2020, respectively, for that period. Gadot seasons
    had around the same mid-season values as the standard Kc (provided by Shaham).
    This is a known phenomenon in processing tomato, in which the addition of leaf
    layers does not increase the rate of transpiration due to full coverage of the
    surface and due to reproductive growth that comes at the expense of vegetative
    growth (Hanson and May, 2006, Shaham, 2013). Above LAI of 6, Gadot crop coefficients
    have not increased with the increase in LAI. Download : Download high-res image

    Kc course of Gadot 2020 was similar to the standard Kc values provided by Shaham.
    The major decline in the standard Kc values was not presented in Gadot 2020. Similar
    behavior is observed for Gadot 2019, although a shift of about a week is noticeable
    compared to the standard table. Standard Kc also preceded Gadash 2019 in about
    a week, and values were generally higher than Gadash except at the end of the
    season, where the measured Kc exceeded the standard table value. 4.3. ANN validation
    In Fig. 9, the eddy covariance daily ETc measurement of Gadot 2020 is shown, together
    with the ETc predicted by the artificial neural network (ANN) and ETc as estimated
    using the FAO-56 method. Point ‘a′ on Fig. 9, is a drop in both the ANN and the
    FAO-56 predictions due to differences between solar radiation measured on-site
    and that measured at ‘Kavul’ station, 9 km away. Point ‘b′ is a drop in the ANN
    prediction, related to rainy days. In point ‘c′, FAO-56 prediction is much lower
    than water consumption because of ‘deficit irrigation’ dictated by the Kc standard
    table (this is the agricultural practice by the end of the season before harvest).
    The daily root mean square error of the ANN prediction was lower than the FAO-56
    (excluding rainy days and deficit irrigation), 0.68 versus 0.9 mm relative to
    eddy covariance ETc measurements. Download : Download high-res image (119KB) Download

    season and comparison to two ETc estimation methods: artificial neural networks
    and FAO-56. 4.4. The irrigation experiment This section compares the different
    treatments using the metrics defined earlier (section 2.4). Until 54 DAP, 100 mm
    of irrigation was applied uniformly to all treatments. Fig. 10 shows the cumulative
    irrigation of the different irrigation treatments from 54 DAP to the end of the
    irrigation period. On that figure, two ANN series are shown: one is the actual
    irrigation (in a green solid line with full circles) and the second is the estimation
    based on the ANN model (green dashed line with empty circles). The reason for
    that difference is an erroneous irrigation of 18 mm that occurred in the first
    day of the differential irrigation period, accounting for 5.9% error from the
    estimation. The other treatments had lower application errors in the range of
    − 1.73% to + 1.22% (Table 4). The estimated ETc, according to the ANN, almost
    perfectly agrees with the best practice (control), both in the total amount and
    rate of irrigation. The FAO-56 method, which was not tested in this experiment,
    is shown in a yellow dashed line for reference. Although the total irrigation
    at the end of the season is similar to the control treatment, the irrigation rate
    differed, as shown by a steeper slope until 90 DAP and smaller slope from that
    point to the end of the season. Download : Download high-res image (147KB) Download

    The yield was converted to standard scores (Fig. 11), and repetitions with a standard
    score below − 1.5 were excluded from the final yield analysis. Anomalous yield
    results in the North Western part of the field (Fig. 11) were probably due to
    wind direction. During summer, the prevailing wind direction in that region is
    northwest. It is hypothesized that the wind carried away water vapor from the
    plants'' canopy close to the upwind edge of the field and caused stress expressed
    in a yield reduction. For that reason, those repetitions, including the repetition
    of treatment 3 in the far northwest corner, were removed from the final yield
    results. Download : Download high-res image (147KB) Download : Download full-size

    ANN; (6) UAV. Fig. 12 shows the metrics for each irrigation method throughout
    the season. The graphs show the treatments'' average performance across the five
    repetitions and their standard deviation. As shown in Fig. 12a, the control, the
    ANN, and the UAV all achieve a similar yield, around 120 ton ha−1. This is expected
    because the rate and dosage of irrigation were similar throughout the experiment.
    On the same graph, we can also see that although the 125% treatment consumed more
    water than the control, its yield was not significantly higher than the other
    methods while still exhibiting considerable variation among repetitions. As a
    result, the water use efficiency of the ‘125%’ treatment was lower than the control,
    UAV and ANN. This shows that both experimental methods (UAV and ANN) and the control
    performed near the optimal yield/irrigation ratio. At the same time, the 50% and
    75% treatments consumed less water while their yields were lower than the other
    treatments (significantly lower only for the 50% treatment). Download : Download

    the 50% and 75% treatments both have a high water use efficiency but this comes
    at the cost of the yield. On the other hand, we can see that the 125% treatment
    has the lowest water use efficiency, while it does not have a significantly higher
    yield than the other treatments. In the end, we can see that from the irrigation
    and yield perspectives, the examined methods performed as well as the best-practice
    irrigation (control). The Brix measurements, shown in Fig. 12c, displayed negligible
    variance across the different repetitions of each treatment. The 50% treatment
    was slightly higher than the rest, but this difference was not statistically significant.
    The reason for that is the inverse relationship between yield and quality depending
    on the irrigation regime (Luchinsky, 1986). Brix levels were generally lower than
    average in Israel in recent years, around 4.8 (Erlich, 2018). 5. Discussion Irrigation
    based on a continuous estimation of ETc, throughout the growing season can assist
    in irrigation management by adapting the irrigation to the crop water consumption.
    Here we demonstrated several novelties in estimating ETc to determine the required
    irrigation dose. Both methods (UAV and ANN) required calibration against field
    measurements of ETc. We showed that this could be achieved using the eddy covariance
    method, as was also demonstrated by Kelley and Pardyjak (2019) and Yohanani et
    al. (2022) for the ANN model. However, this method is expensive and requires highly
    trained professionals to deploy, maintain, and process the data to achieve good
    results. Replicating this calibration procedure for additional crops will require
    significant effort, but it can be done, as demonstrated here. Another novelty
    was applying the Kc estimation method calibrated for satellite imagery to UAV
    imagery, which proved successful. This accomplishment is not trivial since UAV
    and satellite data interoperability is challenging (Alvarez-Vanhard et al., 2021).
    This challenge is mainly due to the surface bi-directional reflectance distribution
    function (BRDF), which can sometimes be considered lambertian for satellite observation
    geometry, but usually not for UAV (Stow et al., 2019). In this study, all the
    UAV multispectral image acquisitions were performed around the same time of the
    day, and roughly in correspondence with the Sentinel-2 overpass time. This practice
    facilitated good calibration between the Micasense camera and Sentinel-2 MSI and
    helped minimize the BRDF effect on the transformed spectra used in the Kc estimation.
    Therefore, it is quite possible that the transformation functions between Sentinel-2
    and the UAV cameras could be used to convert other models developed for Sentinel-2,
    in particular for use in agriculture (Segarra et al., 2020), which should be further
    explored in future studies. The FAO-56 model requires precise meteorological conditions
    to estimate ET0 and tabular Kc (Allen et al., 1998), or a remote sensing estimate
    of Kc (Rozenstein et al., 2018, Rozenstein et al., 2019, Kaplan et al., 2021a,
    Kaplan et al., 2023). On the other hand, the ANN model requires precise meteorological
    conditions and LAI measurements. Like the method presented here to replace tabular
    Kc with remote sensing estimations, future studies could integrate the estimation
    of crop LAI from satellite imagery (e.g., Kaplan et al., 2021a, Kaplan et al.,
    2021b) as input into the ANN instead of field measurements. However, since the
    ANN needs to be trained for specific weather stations, it is currently restricted
    to certain regions. While ANNs might be trained on large datasets that include
    many weather stations in various conditions against eddy-covariance measurements,
    this remains to be demonstrated. This demonstration would ideally be based on
    high-quality eddy covariance measurements, i.e., measurements throughout the growing
    season, with very good energy balance closure, of the same crop in multiple locations.
    However, these datasets are not easily obtained and often not shared, inhibiting
    this research line. However, applying Kc estimation based on multispectral imagery
    from a UAV or satellite will likely work anywhere since the spectral reflectance
    of crops is not site dependent, i.e., tomato fields in different parts of the
    world should look the same in Sentinel-2 or UAV imagery, as demonstrated recently
    by Pelta et al. (2022). Remote sensing provides a better spatial representation
    of the field compared to point measurements or a single tabular value. Therefore,
    another advantage of remote sensing estimation of Kc is that it is sensitive to
    spatial variability, unlike the ANN, and can thus be used for precision irrigation.
    For farmers like the one in Gadot that avoided the use of a single tensiometer
    that does not represent well the entire field, Kc maps might offer a better alternative.
    Naturally, there is a trade-off between a single sensor with continuous temporal
    data and spatial continuous data from remote sensing that lacks temporal continuity.
    Since we are not dealing with irrigation timing, but with irrigation dose, the
    temporal continuity is of minor significance. Since the revisit time of Sentinel-2
    is 5 days, and that of a UAV can be even shorter, either one of those, or a combination
    of both is much better than a standard Kc table that provides weekly values of
    Kc at best. Therefore, it would make sense to invest resources in developing Kc
    estimation models based on multispectral imagery for more crops, which are not
    location specific like the ANN. Integrating information from satellite imagery
    to crop models might also prove helpful for in-season yield forecasts (e.g., Manivasagam
    et al., 2021, Berger et al., 2022). This type of data assimilation can be upscaled
    regionally to serve as more than just a farm management aid but to inform a wide
    range of stakeholders, including governmental decision-makers, insurance companies,
    and investors (Manivasagam and Rozenstein, 2020). While in this work, we showed
    that irrigating according to the crop water consumption led to optimal yield,
    some critics have lately been raised by Friedman (2023), stating that using the
    estimated crop evapotranspiration as the right amount to replenish the soil could
    either substantially overestimate or underestimate the optimal irrigation rate.
    This claim holds merit, particularly in cases of extensive, low-frequency irrigation
    of deep-rooted crops grown in fine-texture soils during or after the rainy season
    where contribution of soil water and shallow groundwater to crop water uptake
    is significant, and in the cases of intensive, high-frequency irrigation of shallow-rooted
    crops planted in coarse-texture soils, where deep percolation occurs. In both
    cases, estimates of ETc as the required irrigation dose would not be optimal.
    Accordingly, we conclude that ETc estimates must be supplemented by a more complex
    model that considers the water movement in the soil. Assimilating this information
    into a crop model, for example, directly from remote sensing measurements or from
    an ANN, would make ETc estimates beneficial for determining the optimal irrigation
    rate under a wide range of conditions. Both examined irrigation methods should
    ideally rely on a nearby weather station. The experiment in this study was done
    in a field several kilometers away from the meteorological station used to infer
    the local field conditions. This worked well thanks to the uniform conditions
    over the Hula Valley. However, in many other environments, where conditions change
    substantially along climatic gradients or where microclimatic conditions in the
    field differ from where the nearest weather station is located, the performance
    of both methods is expected to deteriorate. Accordingly, users of such practices,
    or even of the FAO-56 method to determine the irrigation dose, should invest in
    good weather stations close to their farm, in settings that represent the same
    conditions as the irrigated field. While on-farm experimentation can be expensive
    to perform, testing applied innovations in real-world settings is necessary to
    demonstrate their value. While the calibration of models in this study was performed
    in commercial environments without affecting the farmer''s decisions, the irrigation
    trial, where the irrigation was managed by the methods tested, was conducted in
    a small 0.2 ha plot in a regional experimental farm. Before commercial use, this
    experiment should be replicated at this scale at least once again before testing
    it on a commercial plot that is typically 100 times larger in the study region.
    6. Conclusions Overall, this experiment, in which we delivered real-time irrigation
    recommendations to the farmer, was successful. The whole pipeline worked reliably
    for the entire summer season, from data-scrapping to predicting and forwarding
    the predictions to the farmer. This allowed us to show that the irrigation recommendation
    from the novel yet independent ANN and UAV approaches almost perfectly agreed
    with the best practice, both in the total amount and rate of irrigation throughout
    the season. Moreover, they resulted in similar yield and Brix levels. While the
    control treatment relied on an experienced agronomist who specializes in vegetable
    crops cultivation that had the benefit of feedback from soil tensiometers, the
    experimental approaches included the estimation of Kc from UAV multispectral imagery
    and the application of an ANN trained to predict latent heat fluxes based on meteorological
    data. The multispectral imagery-based Kc estimation model, originally calibrated
    for Sentinel-2, was successfully transformed to work from a UAV with a multispectral
    camera payload. The trained ANN model demonstrated its validity by estimating
    ETc more accurately (more similar to EC measurements) than the commonly used FAO-56
    method. There were no significant differences in yield quality and quantity between
    the approaches in the irrigation experiment. Although the study included only
    one irrigation experiment, the results illustrate the capacity and ease of implementation
    of novel techniques based on UAVs and ANNs for irrigation management. Future work
    should replicate the experiment to establish further the experimental approach
    for irrigation management. Funding This research was supported by grants from

    May 2022 Introduction Water resources management has direct impact on the economic
    development and human activity through history. During the past century, the plant
    population grew rapidly with increased human consumption of natural resources.
    In this century, water consumption growth was two times larger than population
    growth and caused every continent to experience water scarcity (United Nation
    2020). Seckler et al. (1999) approaches in 118 countries from 1990 to 2025 show
    that a quarter of the global population and a third of the population in developing
    countries will suffer from severe water scarcity in the next century. In particular,
    arid and semi-arid regions with sparse precipitation are more vulnerable to water
    scarcity issues. Recent studies showed an increase in drought severity in Afghanistan,
    Central Asia, and Iran, which are dominated by arid and semi-arid climates (Li
    et al. 2017; Qutbudin et al. 2019; Ta et al. 2018; Zoljoodi and Didevarasl 2013).
    Therefore, proper management practice for the water resources is essential for
    those regions to ensure the economic development and access to the safe, healthy,
    and sustainable sources of water. Afghanistan’s economy highly depends on agricultural
    activity. This sector makes 18.6% of the gross domestic product (GDP) and directly
    or indirectly impacts 80% of the total population’s livelihood in rural areas
    (Mahmoodi 2008; NSIA 2019). The surface water is the country’s most important
    source of irrigation and provide 86% of irrigation water demand (Rout 2008). A
    traditional operation system is used for irrigation water management in the country
    by the water users headed by mirabs (Viala 2003). Mirab, a combined Arabic and
    Persian word, means watermaster, and this term is used widely in Iran and Central
    Asia. The traditional mirab system mainly manages the water allocation in the
    main, secondary, and tertiary canals, and they do not have the support of the
    higher institution at the village or provincial level (Ward et al. 2013). The
    decision on the main canal’s water allocation was made by the River Basin Authority,
    managed by Ministry of Energy and Water. Salman et al. (2017) highlighted the
    issue of uneven water allocation among water users where the upstream users receive
    more water than the downstream in Afghanistan, especially during the low flow
    period. Despite less precipitation in the country still, there is a huge capacity
    of unused water resources. Decades of war and conflict collapsed Afghanistan’s
    irrigation infrastructures. Country has \\(7.9\\times {10}^{6}\\,\\mathrm{ ha}\\)
    of arable land, and in 1980, \\(3.3\\times {10}^{6}\\,\\mathrm{ ha}\\) of land
    was cultivated. During year 2008, just \\(1.8x{10}^{6}\\,\\mathrm{ha}\\) of those
    arable land were cultivated (Mahmoodi 2008). The current irrigation challenges
    in Afghanistan can be categorized into two major issues: (1) lack of hydraulics
    structures and (2) water resource management issue. To overcome the current problems,
    Afghanistan needs put both into consideration. Hard approaches include the rehabilitation
    of the existing infrastructure and the construction of new irrigation structures
    with improved efficiency can address the first issue. On the other hand, soft
    approaches refer to policy development for water resource management should be
    considered for water management and decision on infrastructure construction. The
    Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a useful tool for performing irrigation
    and chemical yield assessments in watersheds. Scholars have used the SWAT model
    to investigate different scenarios in irrigation water management and worldwide
    agricultural practice. Many scholars successfully used SWAT for runoff and sediment
    modelling (Dhami et al. 2018; Himanshu et al. 2017), management of the chemical
    yield and sediment (Himanshu et al. 2019), assessing the impact of alternative
    agriculture management projects (Ullrich and Volk 2009), drought in catchment
    scale based on evapotranspiration (Dash et al. 2021), impact of using technological
    upgrades and innovation to increase the water productivity (Huang and Li 2010),
    estimation of crop water productivity (Faramarzi et al. 2010), assessing different
    management practices, and finding the optimum solutions (Huang and Li 2010; Panagopoulos
    et al. 2014). The literature proves SWAT is a reasonable tool for assessing different
    irrigation water management policies and proposals before implementation and finding
    their impacts. The current study aims to assess the optimal locations of hydraulic
    dams using multi-criteria decision analysis and to assess the impact of proposed
    dam construction over the study region on water resources management, especially
    for downstream agricultural water usage using SWAT. The study adopts analytical
    hierarchy process (AHP) under multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to decide
    the optimal dam site location. AHP is widely used to solve a broad range of multi-criteria
    decision-making problems to calculate the weight of every criterion (Cabrera and
    Lee 2019; Tuy et al. 2022). AHP has been used in dam site suitability (Noori et
    al. 2019; Shao et al. 2020). Noori et al. (2019) used the dam site suitability
    analysis to find a suitable site for dam location in northern Iraq to reduce the
    impact of climate change and long-term drought caused water shortage and water
    issues in the study region. Another study used the dam suitability stream model
    (DSSM) coupled with AHP to give weight to the input parameter in the northern
    Pakistan (Shao et al. 2020). Identifying the criteria and their importance for
    the dam site suitability varies from study to study (Karakuş and Yıldız 2022;
    Noori et al. 2019; Raaj et al. 2022; Shao et al. 2020). The main aim of this study
    is to present a sustainable engineering-based solution for the water resource
    management in in a less developed watershed using the hydrological models coupled
    with MCDA. This study adapts a multidisciplinary approach for mitigating irrigation
    water resource management, overcoming water supply issues, flood risk reduction,
    sustainable energy generation, and CBA for the dam construction. The findings
    in this study could help the decision-makers for further decisions on water resources
    in the basin. This paper adopts the SWAT modelling of the basin adopts from a
    previous study by Hussainzada and Lee (2021). Also, it contains the dam site suitability
    analysis using AHP, and proposes an engineering-based solution by adding a hydraulics
    structure and revising the irrigation scheme adopted from the study of Hussainzada
    and Lee (2022). Furthermore, this paper developed the CBA for the proposed scenario.
    Materials Study area The current study originated in northern Afghanistan in a
    semi-arid climate. Afghanistan is officially divided into five major basins: the
    Harirod Murghab, Kabul (Indus), Helmand, Amu Darya, and Northern River basins
    (Fig. 1a). The study area is the Balkhab River basin (BRB) (Fig. 1b) in the Northern
    River basin (NRB) of Afghanistan, with an elevation range from 202 to 4616 m.
    Five hydrometrological stations are installed in the entire basin and record discharge
    and other climatic parameters (Fig. 1c). The average annual precipitation in this
    basin is 247 mm based on the data provided by the Ministry of Energy and Water
    (MEW) between 2010 and 2018. Most of the water resources in the basin are consumed
    by the agriculture sector for irrigation of 296,744 ha of land. The irrigation
    water is distributed through 101 irrigation canals and three regulator dams. Based
    on the investigations in the current research, 11 downstream canals of BRB face
    severe water shortages for irrigation of farm products, especially during the
    low flow period. Please refer to Table 1 for the details of 11 subbasin canals.
    Based on the recorded discharge in the most downstream station, an annual average
    discharge of \\(1657\\times {10}^{6} \\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}\\) passed this section
    of river from 2010 to 2018. Fig. 1 Map of the study area: a Afghanistan map showing
    the five major basins and elevation, b Balkhab River basin (BRB) with the Balkhab
    River, five hydrometeorological stations, and eleven irrigation canal downstream

    irrigation canals (NRBA 2019) Full size table Datasets In this study, the SWAT
    model was used to model the hydrological regime for the study region. The inputs
    for modelling purposes are climatic data precipitation, relative humidity, maximum
    temperature, minimum temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed. Also, the digital
    elevation model (DEM), land cover, soil type, and canal water allocation were
    fed to the model. Finally, monthly average discharge was used for model validation
    purposes. Daily weather data for the maximum temperature, minimum temperatures,
    precipitation, relative humidity, and river discharge were collected from a hydrometrological
    station installed in the basin (Figure S1). The solar radiation and wind speed
    were retrieved from the NASA Prediction of World Energy Resources in the same
    coordinates of hydrometrological stations. Table 2 depicts the summary of the
    dataset used for the current research. Table 2 Summary of the datasets used in
    the SWAT modelling Full size table DEMs were obtained from the ALOS PALASAR Radiometric
    Terrain Correction (RT1) dataset provided by the Alaska Satellite Facility Distributed
    Archive Data Center (ASF DAAC) with a spatial resolution of 12.5 m. The land-cover
    map used for the current study is from the FAO Agricultural Market Information
    Services System in association with the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and
    Livestock, Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (FAO 2016). A proper soil type map
    does not exist in many parts of the world, but the global soil type maps of Harmonized
    World Soil Database (HWSD_v121) and FAO/UNESCO soil map of the world can be used
    as a substitute (Abbaspour et al. 2019). The FAO/UNESCO soil map of the world
    with corresponding data was used as input for the SWAT model. This soil map was
    developed from the World Inventory of Soil Emissions (WISE) database by statistical
    analysis 4353 soil profiles in the inventory, which was developed at the International
    Soil References and Information Centre (ISRIC) to provide geographical descriptions
    of soil factors that influence global change (Batjes 1997). Doe (1962) provided
    further information and a description of the world’s FAO/UNESCO soil map. Meanwhile,
    a huge portion of the streamflow in BRB is consumed by the agriculture sector.
    The water allocation to the canals and geographical coordinates for the canal
    intake are included in the SWAT model from official reports by NRB (NRBA 2019,
    pp. 24–26). Seasonal crop cultivation Based on the Hussainzada and Lee (2022),
    the common crop types in northern Afghanistan are wheat, cotton, barley, rice,
    maize, pulses, vetches, potato, clover, oil seed, lucerne, vegetables, melons,
    and opium poppy. In order to synchronize between water delivery patterns and crop
    life cycle, a proper understanding of crop calendar information is necessary (Murthy
    et al. 1998). Cropping calendar and crop water requirement can lead us to an accurate
    estimation of irrigation water demand in the basin on a monthly basis. Afghanistan’s
    irrigation data are scarce and limited for scientific studies. The current study
    adopted crop water requirements from a recent published study in Khost Province,
    southern Afghanistan (Wali et al. 2019). Wali et al. (2019) used remote sensing
    techniques to estimate crop water requirements for 2017. The weather conditions
    in Khost Province with mean annual temperature 10.4 °C and the mean annual precipitation
    188 mm are similar to BRB climate conditions. The crop water requirements from
    Wali et al. (2019) in different months are summarized in Table S1 in Supplementary
    material. Current irrigation status The water allocation to the main canals is
    decided by the local government and managed through irrigation canals by mirabs.
    The data for water allocation to the main canals are collected from the official
    NRB report (NRBA 2019). However, there is an exception for water allocation to
    downstream canals due to water scarcity issues during the year. Water allocation
    amounts for the 11 downstream irrigation canals (Table 1) are based on the available
    water in the main river. The water allocation of 11 downstream canals (Table 1)
    were decided based on tax payments and the agricultural land area in each region
    (G. Sakhi, personal communication, November 2, 2020). The water rights for the
    11 canals in the percentage of available water in the main river based on the
    records in the Rabat-i-Bala (Table 1). Methodology Irrigation scenario In this
    study, a detailed investigation of the current irrigation scheme was conducted,
    and the irrigation water management was revised as a new irrigation scenario based
    on land area, crop water requirement, and crop type. The crop type was determined
    based on the national agriculture profile from 2016 to 2018, and the agricultural
    land area was consider based on NRB official reports. Per the NSIA (2019), the
    main cultivated different crops (and associated cultivation areas) are wheat (60.0%),
    rice (3.3%), barley (3.3%), maize (3.6%), pulses (2.3%), vegetable (4.3%), potato
    (1%), onion (0.3%), fruits (9.3%), almond (0.6%), oil seed (2.6%), and others
    (9.4%). The new irrigation scenario proposed by the current study is wheat (65%),
    rice (5%), maize (5%), pluses (4%), spring vegetables (5%), summer vegetables
    (4%), and orchards (12%) for entire BRB downstream. In addition, based on the
    crop water requirements for different crop types (Table S1) and the specified
    irrigation area for each crop (Table 3), the monthly water requirement for 1 ha
    of agricultural land is estimated as shown in Table 3. Table 3 Estimation of monthly
    irrigation water consumption for 1 ha of agricultural land in BRB downstream adopted
    from (Hussainzada and Lee 2022) Full size table Table 3 summarizes the water consumption
    of a single hectare of agricultural land if it is cultivated as the proposed crop
    type percentage scenario. Estimations show that for irrigation of unit area of
    land in BRB \\(4559.5 \\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}/\\mathrm{ha}/\\mathrm{year}\\) of water
    is required. Table 4 shows the current irrigation water allocation and proposed
    scenario water allocation for 11 downstream canals. The cell with the white background
    is the water allocation to each canal based on the newly proposed scenario, while
    the cell with the grey background in Table 4 shows the current water allocation
    to the canals by NRB. The proposed irrigation scenario is based on the storing
    water during the winter and high flow behind the storage dam and use it during
    low flow period with high irrigation water consumption. Table 4 Monthly required
    water allocations for the 11 downstream irrigation canals and required water allocation
    based on the purposed irrigation scheme scenario Full size table SWAT model set-up
    with a proposed dam The SWAT is a semi-distributed physical model capable of predicting
    the impact of water management, agriculture chemical yield, and sediment in the
    large watershed on different timescales (Arnold et al. 1998; Duan et al. 2018;
    Grusson et al. 2015). The model inputs are precipitation, relative humidity, temperature,
    wind speed, and solar radiation, on a daily basis. The model is capable of computing
    the output on the temporal resolution of the daily, monthly, or annual timescale.
    SWAT is widely used for water resource assessment (Guiamel and Lee 2020), evaluations
    of non-point source pollution, and climate change in relation to water supplies
    and watersheds (Adu and Kumarasamy 2018; Reddy 2019). The model predicts surface
    runoff based on a water balance equation (Eq. 1). $${SW}_{t}=SW+\\sum_{t=1}^{t}({R}_{i}-{Q}_{i}-{ET}_{i}-{P}_{i}-{QR}_{i})$$
    (1) where \\({SW}_{t}\\) and \\(SW\\) are the respective final and initial soil
    water contents at time \\(t\\), respectively; \\(R\\), \\(Q\\), \\(ET\\), \\(P\\),
    and \\(QR\\) are daily precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration, percolation,
    and the return flow, respectively; and all units are mm of H2O. The major procedure
    for the SWAT hydrological model set-up and sustainable water resource management
    using AHP for decision-making over BRB watershed is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Methodological
    flow chart for hydrological modelling with SWAT and sustainable water resource
    management and dam site suitability analysis using AHP Full size image Step 1.
    : Watershed delineation: The SWAT in ArcGIS Desktop interface was used for stream
    flow simulation. In this step, the watershed was divided into smaller 31 subbasins
    with DEM as a input to the model. Step 2. : Hydrological response units (HRUs)
    definition: Land use–land cover, soil type, and slope maps were used to divide
    the 31 subbasins to smaller units with homogeneous characteristics. In this step,
    the 31 subbasins were divided into 1,532 HRUs. Step 3. : Creating input tables:
    The weather data were entered as the input data for the streamflow simulation
    into model database from 2010 to 2018 with daily resolutions. Step 4. : Calibration
    and validation: Parameter optimization was performed for the SWAT model using
    the SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Procedure (SWAT-CUP) v5.2.1 (Abbaspour 2007)
    and the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Algorithm (SUFI2) for model calibration
    and uncertainty analysis. The SUFI2 details were presented by Homan et al. (2011)
    and Abbaspour (2007). The model was run for the entire BRB within three-time periods;
    three years warmup period (2010–2012), three-year calibration period (2013–2015),
    and two-year and nine-month validation period from January 2016 to September 2018.
    The model calibration and validation were based on the monthly average streamflow
    observations recorded on the subbasins 7, 10, 28, and 30 on the Rabat-i-Bala,
    Pul-i-Baraq, Doshqadam, and Nazdik-i-Nayak stations respectively. The SWAT hydrological
    model of BRB used for testing the improved irrigation scenario purposed in the
    current study. The SWAT hydrological model of BRB is adopted from a previous study
    over BRB from Hussainzada and Lee (2021). Dam suitability assessment using analytical
    hierarchy process (AHP) Dam suitable sites is the primary water resource management
    strategy (Karakuş and Yıldız 2022). A quantitative assessment for Dam site selection
    depends on multiple criteria, such as soil type (S), drainage (D), slope (Sl),
    elevation (E), and land use–land cover (LULC). Furthermore, in this study, appropriate
    areas of the dam site were identified using GIS and AHP under the multi-criteria
    decision analysis (MCDA). The list of criteria was preselected by the author’s
    decision. The level of importance of each criterion was identified using expert
    opinions. The questionnaire was sent to 13 experts in the field via email and
    10 of them were used as the source for ranking the criteria and three of them
    were inconsistent. Below is the list of criteria and its description. Natural
    break method was adopted for the classification of the criterion to very low,
    low, medium, high, and very high suitable for dam construction, and the result
    is given in Table 5. Soil: Soil type and hydrological soil classification are
    significant factors in determining an area''s water holding and infiltration characteristics
    (Cabrera and Lee 2018). The harmonized world soil database was used for this purpose.
    Discharge: The amount of water flow in the river (m3/s). The river discharge comes
    from the precipitation, snowmelt, and groundwater flow in the Basin (Hussainzada
    and Lee 2021). Slope: When the slope increases, the flow velocity will also increase.
    A rise in the gradient lowers infiltration but increases surface runoff; as a
    result, in areas with a lower gradient, a large volume of water gets stagnant,
    resulting in flooding (Lei et al. 2020). Elevation: The movement of the overflow
    direction and the depth of the water level are controlled by the elevation (Al-Ruzouq
    et al. 2019). Land Use and Land Cover: The built-up area and agricultural lands
    are less desirable for the dam construction while the barren land has higher desirability
    because of the land price. Table 5 Summary of the criteria classification used
    for the AHP Full size table The pairwise comparison matrix is the first step in
    the AHP method. Each criterion was compared to another criterion from the 1–9
    scale from Saaty (1980). In this paper, we adjusted the scale from one to five
    based on the number of criteria of the study. The second step is the normalization,
    where each value in the comparison matrix (\\({C}_{ij}\\)) is divided by the sum
    of column in the pairwise comparison matrix to get the normalized value (\\({X}_{ij}\\))
    (Eq. 2). $${X}_{ij}={C}_{ij} /{\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{C}_{ij}$$ (2) The next step is
    to generate the weight of each criterion (\\({W}_{ij}\\)) by dividing the normalized
    value (\\({X}_{ij}\\)) by the number of criterion (\\(n\\)) (Eq. 3). $${W}_{ij}={\\sum
    }_{i=1}^{n}{X}_{ij}/n$$ (3) The consistency ratio is the last part in the AHP
    procedure with three subcomponents. The first subcomponent is to determine the
    consistency measure (CM). CM can be derived by multiplying the pairwise matrix
    with the weight (\\({W}_{ij}\\)), and the result is divided by the weighted sum
    vector with the criterion weight. Next, the consistency index (\\(CI\\)) is calculated
    using Eq. 4, where the \\({\\lambda }_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) is the average of the
    CM and n is the number of criteria. Finally, the consistency ratio (\\(CR\\))
    is derived using Eq. 5, where the value of the relative index (\\(RI\\)) is defined
    in the relative index table of Prof. Saaty (1980). $$CI = \\left( {\\lambda \\max
    - n} \\right) / \\left( {n - 1} \\right)$$ (4) $$CR=CI/RI$$ (5) Results SWAT model
    calibration and validation The SWAT model was set up using ArcGIS Desktop as the
    platform with three years of warmup period, three years for calibration, and two
    years and nine months for the validation from January 2010 to September 2018 using
    SWAT-CUP. Firstly, the model was calibrated using an elevation band; secondly,
    the snow parameters were calibrated; then, the most sensitive parameters were
    selected for the calibration. Seven parameters were found to be the most sensitive
    parameters, namely threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for
    return flow to occur (GWQMN), groundwater “revap” coefficient (GW_REVAP), groundwater
    delay (GW_DELAY), available water capacity for the soil layer (SOL_AWC), SCS runoff
    curve number (CN2), soil evaporation compensation factor (ESCO), and saturated
    hydraulics conductivity (SOL_K). The river discharge baseflow is affected by seepage
    and spring water discharge, especially during the dry season between July to September.
    Since there was no record of the river discharge, the point-source station discharge
    records were used to estimate the contribution of groundwater and spring to the
    flow. The hydrograph in Fig. 3 shows the comparison between model output and monthly
    observations for river discharge in the four stations in subbasins 7, 10, 28,
    and 30 (Fig. 1c). The model performance was assessed using the coefficient of
    determination (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) (Nash and Sutcliffe 1970),
    and per cent BIAS (PBAIS) (Gupta et al. 1999) in the four stations from upstream
    to downstream in the BRB. The SWAT modelling results exhibit a good agreement
    with the station’s monthly discharges. Statistics for model performance are summarized
    in Table 6. The model is adopted from Hussainzada and Lee (2021). Please refer
    to Hussainzada and Lee (2021) for more details on the process and result for calibration
    and validation. Fig. 3 Comparisons between the observed and simulated monthly
    discharge in a subbasin 7 [Rabat-i-Bala], b subbasin 10 [Pul-i-Baraq], c subbasin

    (Weight) containing the relative importance weights of every criterion. This study''s
    \\(RI\\) and \\({\\lambda }_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) values are 1.12 and 5.15, respectively.
    Moreover, the CR value is 0.033, indicating a level of coherence in comparing
    each criterion. Finally, the suitability index (\\(SI\\)) using GIS and remote
    sensing technology was calculated on Eq. 6. This equation is derived from the
    AHP weights, as shown in Table 8. Table 7 Pairwise comparison matrix for dam suitable

    (6) The output of the AHP process for the dam site suitability analysis is shown
    in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4a, based on the specified criteria and its importance, the
    suitable area for dam construction is dedicated by red colour. The subbasins 10,
    9, 7, and 1 are found to be most suitable for dam construction. The authors tentatively
    select subbasin 10 as the best location for dam construction. The reason behind
    this selection is that BRB is mountainous in the southern part, and most of its
    flat area is in the northern part of BRB, where suitable lands for the agriculture
    exist. Selection of dam in the most upstream gives more chance for land development
    in the dam downstream. Figure 4b is LULC prepared using the Landsat 8 level 1
    imagery for more detail of the area and location of the dam. The author decides
    to locate dam in the southern part where the agricultural land and built-up are
    in minimum and most of the surface coverage is barren land to reduce the land
    cost for the dam construction project. As shown in Fig. 4c, the dam located in
    subbasin 10 with an estimated height of 69 m of water can store 197,900,938 m3
    of water and will submerge an area of approximately 748 ha and a length of 1600
    m. The mentioned capacity is chosen because the water shortage for irrigation
    water supply happens in three consecutive months February, March, and April. The
    total difference between supply and required water for the current conditions
    estimated to be 131,820,480 m3. The extra storage is considered to be used for
    flood control and storage of surplus water. Fig. 4 Dam site suitability map using

    Water resource management Irrigation water management As per Hussainzada and Lee
    (2022), the irrigation water allocation in the BRB is determined based on the
    tax and agricultural land and available water in the river for each month. (Refer
    to Table 1 for the percentage of water allocation to each canal in the BRB downstream.)
    The comparison between the current and proposed irrigation scenarios in Hussainzada
    and Lee (2022) shows that the BRB downstream farmers face water shortages during
    February, March, April, July, and August and extra water in other months than
    the irrigation consumption. The most significant water shortage happens during
    the three consecutive months in February, March, and April with shortage of \\({138,820,480}
    \\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}\\) for irrigation. The annual average flow in subbasin 10
    was estimated as \\(1.578\\times {10}^{9} \\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}\\) by the SWAT
    model from 2013 to 2018. Additionally, the irrigation water requirement in the
    BRB was estimated to be \\(1.395\\times {10}^{9} \\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}\\) including
    20% loss in the irrigation channels (Hussainzada and Lee 2022). The dam can regulate
    the water flow for entire year to fill the gap between the consumption and natural
    flow in the river. Figure 5 illustrates the hydrograph in the subbasin 7 under
    three different conditions: (1) the blue line represent the river flow in the
    subbasin 7 in the current condition, (2) the red line shows the controlled river
    flow by dam constructed in the subbasin 10 and release water based on the existing
    crop water requirements plus 20% possible water loss in the irrigation canals
    and releasing of a minimum 20 m3/s during non-irrigation months to maintain the
    downstream ecosystems, and (3) grey line represent the ideal case of no water
    loss in the irrigation canals. The calculation based on Table 4 and considering
    the scenario of releasing at least 20 m3/s of water during the non-irrigation
    period shows that the Balkhab River owns a surplus water of approximately\\(84\\times
    {10}^{6} \\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}\\). As a possible scenario, the surplus water can
    be used for the irrigation of 17,180.5 ha of new arable land in the BRB (Hussainzada
    and Lee 2022). Fig. 5 Resulting hydrographs from subbasin 7 with (red) and without
    (blue) dam inclusion in subbasin 10 Full size image Hydroelectricity generation
    The dam can be used for multiple purposes. Energy generation is one of the possible
    surplus uses of the dam. A Dam with \\(69\\, \\mathrm{m}\\) head and annual flow
    of \\(1.578\\times {10}^{9} \\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}\\) has a theoretical capacity
    of generating \\(25.4\\,\\mathrm{MW}\\) or \\({87,840}\\,\\mathrm{MWh}\\) of energy
    based on Eq. 7 if we consider the annual average flow from the dam. Considering
    the dam outflow schedule in Table 4, the minimum and maximum discharge are \\(131\\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}/\\mathrm{s}\\)
    and \\(31.97\\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}/\\mathrm{s}\\) which can generate \\(66.5\\,\\mathrm{MW}\\)
    and \\(16.23\\,\\mathrm{MW}\\) respectively. As per Ahady et al. (2022), the residential
    energy consumption in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan is \\(236,526.3\\,\\mathrm{kWh}\\)
    for cooling, heating, lightening, and domestic hot water usage. The population
    of Mazar-i-Sharif is 584,886 (NISA, 2020). The generation from the dam is 37 times
    bigger than the demand for the Mazar-i-Sharif which is one of five big cities
    in Afghanistan. $$P=g\\times H\\times Q\\times \\mathrm{Efficiency}$$ (7) where
    the \\(P\\) is power generated in \\(KW\\), \\(g\\) is the gravitational acceleration
    (\\(9.81\\,\\mathrm{m}/{\\mathrm{s}}^{2}\\)), H is effective head (m), \\(Q\\)
    is the amount of water flow (\\({\\mathrm{m}}^{3}/\\mathrm{s}\\)), and efficiency
    is how well the turbine and generator convert the power of falling water into
    electric power. The average flow from dam is \\(50.04\\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}/\\mathrm{s}\\),
    and the efficiency of the turbine and generator are between 95 and 75% where to
    be in safe side the lower range were included in the estimation. Water supply
    The river has a surplus flow of \\(84\\times {10}^{6}{m}^{3}\\) flow after irrigation
    of the existing lands. In this study, the urban population living in BRB are targeted
    as the consumer of the water supply system. The urban population in the BRB was
    reported at 584,886, and the population growth rate was reported at 2.14% (NISA
    2020). If we consider the geometric population growth in Eq. 8, the projected
    population of BRB in 50 years will be 1,686,024. Afghanistan Ministry of Urban
    Development and Land determined the per capita demand for water supply as \\(140\\,\\mathrm{l}/\\mathrm{day}/\\mathrm{person}\\).
    The estimation shows that \\({86,155,856}\\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}\\) is sufficient
    for the water consumption of the urban population in 2070. The surplus water in
    the BRB is almost sufficient for a water supply project with 50-year life span.
    $${P}_{t}= {P}_{0}{\\left(1+r\\right)}^{n}$$ (8) where \\({P}_{t}\\) is the projected
    population at time \\(t\\), \\({P}_{0}\\) is the initial population, \\(r\\) is
    the population growth rate, and \\(n\\) is the number of years for the future
    projection. Flood control The Balkhab River experiences the highest flow in May
    (\\(113\\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}/\\mathrm{s}\\)) due to rapid snowmelt and rainfall
    (Hussainzada and Lee 2022). The driest month in the basin is September, with an
    average total monthly flow of 31.97 m3/s. The most extreme flood events were recorded
    (\\(1190\\,{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}/\\mathrm{s}\\)) in the Rabat-i-Bala station during
    May 2014 (Figure S1), and the accumulated volume of water within a day was 102
    million m3. The capacity of the dam is approximately \\(192\\,\\mathrm{million
    }{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}.\\) Therefore, the volume of water in the extreme event is
    only 53% of the dam’s capacity. Then, add the 84 million m3 as surplus water based
    on the result in Sect. 4.3.1. The total volume of water is\\(196 million {m}^{3}\\).
    Thus, the overflow is only \\(4\\,\\mathrm{ million }{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}\\) which
    the dam outflow rate can handle. The dam can control the water flow during extreme
    scenarios and reduce the damage downstream. Cost–benefit analysis (CBA) An estimation
    of the costs and benefits of the dam is presented in Table 9. The construction
    cost was estimated based on similar dams constructed in Afghanistan. In western
    Afghanistan, the Salma dam construction was finished in 2016 with a capacity of
    640 million m3, and electricity generation of 42 MW costs 290 million USD (BBC
    2016). Comparing the Salma dam reservoir capacity and electricity generation capacity
    BRB dam is almost one-third in size and will roughly cost 89.6 million USD. The
    operation and maintenance of the dam will cost 1.5–2.5% construction cost (Paul
    Lako, Giorgio Simbolotti, 2010). The price for a single hectare of land was determined
    based on the interview with local people to be 10,130 USD/ha in subbasin 10. Table
    9 CBA results for the dam construction with an effective life span of 50 years
    Full size table On the other hand, the electricity price is 0.056 USD/kWh. The
    price for the agricultural products were estimated based on the market price in
    Afghanistan, and the agriculture products were estimated based on the yield of
    agriculture products per hectare of land. The average revenue of 20% was consider
    as farmer profits. The municipal and industrial water supply price is currently
    0.36 USD/m3. There is no record for the flood damage in region scales. However,
    the annual flood damage in Afghanistan estimates at 54 million USD, and we consider
    the flood damage as total damage divided by the number of provinces times 50 years.
    The revenue for the fishery was compared with the Darunta dam located in eastern
    Afghanistan. Discussion Economical impact of dam reservoir Most BRB residents
    rely on the agriculture sector and agriculture activities. Farming is one of the
    low-income activities in the country. The agriculture sector makes up 18.6% of
    the country''s GDP, while 80% of the population is directly or indirectly engaged
    in agricultural activities (Hussainzada and Lee 2021). Farmers lose their agricultural
    products near harvesting time due to lack of water, or they do not cultivate the
    total capacity of their land from the beginning. The severe water shortages made
    the farmers move to the big city and engaged labour work for their livelihood.
    The construction of the BRB dam can improve the farmers'' economic condition.
    The adequacy of water can let the farmers shift to more profitable products and
    use the full capacity of their land. Regulation of the water under a controlled
    hydraulics structure can encourage the farmers and investors to invest more in
    the agriculture sector. Currently, farmers use traditional agricultural techniques
    for farming and irrigation. Cheap manpower is being used instead of agricultural
    machinery, and the most used irrigation system are earth open channels and surface
    irrigation. A more stable water source can change the agriculture sector to more
    mechanized modern techniques and increase product yields. The cost and benefit
    analysis shows that the dam construction is economically feasible. The dam''s
    construction can affect the resident''s daily life by providing sustainable irrigation
    and water supply. A sustainable source of irrigation can improve the farmers''
    economic status and prevent them from migrating to the urban area by increasing
    the incomes from the agriculture sector. The power generation from the dam can
    provide the energy source to the resident and in case of connection to the power
    grid for the neighbouring provinces. Energy generation alone can provide enough
    revenue to cover the costs of the dam. Besides, dam construction can substantially
    reduce the flood risk downstream, causing the fatality and loss of agricultural
    products, livestock, and residents'' shelter. In addition, the resident can benefit
    from the improvement in the fishery and recreational activities in the dam site
    and neighbourhood. Downstream water resource development Proper water resource
    management in the basin with limited amounts of water is essential for the sustainable
    development and improvement of the residents'' livelihoods. The scholars used
    a similar approach for water resource management also. For example, Talebi et
    al. (2019) used the SWAT model analytical network process (ANP) to determine the
    suitable location of underground dams for subsurface flow in Iran. Another study
    evaluates the rainwater harvesting system using the SWAT model and MCDA in Iran
    (Doulabian et al. 2021). In this study, the SWAT was used as a tool to simulate
    the streamflow and test the proposed solution. In the current study, SWAT modelling
    was coupled with MCDA to solve the irrigation water management issues at the basin
    level. On the other hand, the dam can be used for power generation. Afghanistan
    installed capacity during 2020 was \\(1030.87\\,\\mathrm{GWh}\\), while the country
    imports from neighbouring countries was \\(5151.87\\,\\mathrm{GWh}\\). The construction
    of the multi-purpose dam can fulfil the country''s energy requirements and improve
    the country''s economy through job creation and power independence. As it is already
    discussed in Sect. 4.3.2, the capacity of power generation from the dam is 37
    times bigger than the demand in the urban area located in the BRB. The BRB residents
    rely on groundwater for their water supply. They use shallow to deep wells to
    extract the water for domestic usage. The high demands in recent decades caused
    groundwater degradation and groundwater table reduction, especially in the populated
    urban area. It is possible for the local government to use the irrigation surplus
    water for the water supply consumption of the urban area. The estimation in Sect.
    4.3.3 shows that the Balkhab River can provide the domestic water demand for population
    until 2070. However, more detailed studies are required for the water quality
    and project feasibility. The construction of the dam will reduce the risk of flooding
    in the downstream and lessen the lost in the agriculture products, livestock,
    and reduce casualties. BBR will directly benefit from the dam by increasing agricultural
    products, stable water supply sources, renewable energy production, and downstream
    flood control. Indirectly, the construction of dams will create lots of jobs in
    construction, operation, and maintenance. The other benefits from the dam construction
    are the increase in food security for the country, providing more income for local
    communities from recreational activities, fishery, and reduction in CO2 emission.
    Conclusions This study presents a package for water resource management in the
    less developed basin. The study contents start with hydrological modelling in
    the basin and a consequence of other studies for sustainable water resources management
    in the basin with low precipitation and limited water resources. The basin''s
    hydrological model is used to determine the basin''s hydrologic regime and find
    the strong and weak points of the stream flow. Consequently, current water management
    practices in the basin were analysed to find the gaps in the management. After
    identifying the problems and evaluating the resources, engineering-based solutions
    were proposed and tested in the basin using the hydrological models already prepared.
    After testing the proposed mitigation, further detailed studies were conducted
    to develop the possible management practices for the existing resources. AHP was
    used to determine the suitable site for dam construction. Then, the dam reservoir
    capacity (\\(192\\,\\mathrm{million }{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}\\)) and height (\\(69\\,\\mathrm{m}\\))
    were measured using remote sensing techniques. The mitigation scenarios to overcome
    water shortages were estimated, and possible usage for the surplus water (\\(84\\,\\mathrm{million
    }{\\mathrm{m}}^{3}\\)) was proposed in the current study. The surplus water can
    be used for electricity generation, domestic water supply, and agriculture land
    development. Finally, a CBA was included in determining the feasibility of implementation
    for the proposed solutions. The outcomes of the current study could be used for
    the primary investigations in the basins with limited water resources which faced
    the water shortage for irrigation activities. Specifically, the content of the
    current study could be used as the starting point for the decision-makers in developing
    the BRB. The outcomes show that not only the BRB owns a sufficient amount of water
    resources for current activities but also there is a potential of further development
    in case of proper management of existing resources. Data availability Available

    1. Introduction The citrus crop in Spain occupies about 300,000 ha (93% under
    irrigation). In terms of surface area, it is the fourth most representative woody
    crop after olive, vine, and almond. The average annual production is close to
    6.4 Mt (MAPAMA, 2018). Of the Spanish regions, Valencia (162,000 ha) and Andalucía
    (85,500 ha) are the most representative with average yields of around 3.1 and
    2.5 Mt, respectively (CAMACCRD, 2020, ESYRCE, 2018). Spain is the main citrus
    producer in the EU and is ranked sixth worldwide (FAO, 2017), and it is the main
    country in terms of citrus exports regarding sweet oranges, tangerines, and lemons
    — around 3 Mt with a market value of up to 3100 M€ (MAPAMA, 2017). Water-saving
    strategies for perennial crops in semi-arid areas of southern Spain are not optional
    but mandatory in contexts of water scarcity, and the case of citrus is no exception.
    Obviously, such strategies are going to limit the maximum potential yield, but
    at the same time proper resource management (i.e., water, energy, and fertilisers)
    could help compensate for the economic loss by reducing production costs. Studies
    of the main effects of regulated and sustained deficit irrigation (DI) strategies
    on sweet orange yield and fruit quality (García-Tejero, Durán-Zuazo, Arriaga-Sevilla,
    & Muriel-Fernández, 2012; García-Tejero, Durán-Zuazo, Muriel-Fernández, Martínez-García
    and Jiménez-Bocanegra, 2011; García-Tejero, Jiménez-Bocanegra et al., 2010; García-Tejero,
    Muriel-Fernández et al., 2011; García-Tejero, Romero-Vicente et al., 2010, Tejero
    et al., 2011) have concluded that the flowering and fruit-growth periods are the
    most limiting in terms of water stress. Moreover, the low-frequency DI strategy
    allows water savings of close to 2000 m ha−1 while keeping yield losses to below
    15%. This strategy is thus regarded as a promising technique in severe drought
    situations. More recent work (Gasque, Martí, Granero, & González-Altozano, 2016)
    achieved water savings of close to 40% (regarding total water requirements) during
    the fruit-growth period, with minimal yield losses by establishing a threshold
    value of stem water potential ( ) close to −2.0 MPa. To apply proper irrigation
    scheduling based on DI strategies, it is necessary to monitor the crop water status,
    as well as to define the physiological changes related to the crop’s response
    under drought conditions in order to minimise yield losses and maximise water
    savings and irrigation water productivity. Traditionally, this assessment has
    been done by manual measurements of the leaf or stem water potential ( ) and gas-exchange
    parameters. Although this kind of measurement offers very reliable information
    about the crop water status, its main limitations come from the labour intensive
    and time consuming aspects related to the reading procedure. Additionally, this
    kind of measurement does not permit real-time monitoring, so that there is a lack
    of information during the gap between measurements, and automatic irrigation scheduling
    is obviously impossible. The Internet of Things (IoT) is widely applied in several
    areas such as smart cities, home environments, agriculture, industry, intelligent
    buildings, etc. (Siow, Tiropanis, & Hall, 2018). Usually, such IoT environments
    require the use of sensors and actuators shared through all these areas, and these
    generate a vast amount of data. Moreover, machine learning (ML) is being successfully
    applied to a variety of production sectors such as markets (Choudhry & Garg, 2008),
    finance (Alaka et al., 2018), medicine (Rajkomar, Dean, & Kohane, 2019), commerce
    (Siegel, 2013), and agriculture (Liakos, Busato, Moshou, Pearson, & Bochtis, 2018),
    among others. The IoT and ML are techniques that would seem well suited for data
    acquisition and the prediction of different crop-related situations such as water
    status. In particular, the present study posited a series of research hypotheses
    concerning application of IoT and ML in the context of citrus fruit: • R1. It
    is possible to predict automatically the water status of citrus by using ML applied
    to IoT sensor data. • R2. Using a leaf turgor pressure sensor is sufficient to
    determine the water status of citrus by using ML applied to IoT sensor data. •
    R3. Weather data is sufficient to identify the water status of citrus, and consequently
    specific leaf sensors are unnecessary. • R4. An expert system to determine the
    water status of citrus is able to help users apply suitable irrigation strategies
    based on irrigation-restriction cycles. To test the above research hypotheses,
    several field experiments were carried out in order to design an effective expert
    system which can help farmers optimise irrigation based on the afore mentioned
    DI system. Consequently, the main contributions of the present communication are
    the following: • A novel leaf turgor pressure sensor able to gather leaf turgor
    data from trees is described. • An evidence-based demonstration that data extracted
    from the leaf turgor pressure sensor is an appropriate approach for training models
    to predict the citrus crop water status. • A set of experiments is described that
    shows the performance of different ML models for predicting the water status of
    citrus crop. • The expert system based on IoT and ML is able to predict the citrus
    water status with a 99% F1-score. The rest of the paper is structured as follows.
    In Section 2, we give an overview of existing approaches related to the IoT and
    ML focused on agriculture. In Section 3, we present the system design support
    developed by defining the material and methods used to achieve it. Section 4 describes
    the results obtained from the experiments carried out to calibrate the system.
    Section 5 discusses this approach, and finally the conclusion to be drawn are
    presented in Section 6. 2. Related studies The use of Precision Agriculture in
    citrus orchards has made it possible to gain knowledge about the spatial variability
    in a plantation and even inside a tree, forecasting production and quality using
    hyperspectral imaging (Jie et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2021). With this variability
    taken into account, it has been possible to reduce production costs, and modulate
    pesticide and herbicide application rates (Martinez-Guanter, Agüera, Agüera, &
    Pérez-Ruiz, 2020). Devices such as sap flow meters (Ballester, Castel, Testi,
    Intrigliolo and Castel, 2013), dendrometers (García-Tejero, Romero-Vicente et
    al., 2010, Ortuño et al., 2009, Velez et al., 2007), or thermal cameras (Ballester,
    Castel, Jiménez-Bello, Castel and Intrigliolo, 2013) are examples of reliable
    technologies that provide a large amount of individual data on citrus-related
    tree water status. They are still of too high a cost, however, for a commercial
    orchard since a large number of sensors are required in the field to provide sufficient
    data for decision making. A further step in the digitisation of the land will
    be the creation of a network of sensors capable of providing information that
    can be integrated into a platform for aggregate analysis. In this regard, micro-tensiometers
    are devices designed for continuous monitoring of plant water status (Pagay et
    al., 2014). They are accurate and affordable, and their results correlate well
    with those achieved with a Scholander pressure chamber. However, an obstacle to
    the popularisation of this technique is that the installation of these devices
    on the tree trunk is delicate, and must be carried out by qualified personnel
    (in order to avoid embolisms). As noted above, the IoT and ML have been successfully
    applied to a broad variety of production sectors such as finance, medicine, industry,
    and agriculture (Liakos et al., 2018), among others. In the rest of this section,
    the relevant papers related to ML and irrigation systems will be described, identifying
    the lack of crop water status prediction systems, even though this parameter is
    the essential datum required to implement a DI system. In Seyedzadeh et al. (2020),
    ML techniques are applied to ensure the correct use of these systems. According
    to those authors, one of the characteristics that most affects the correct use
    of drip irrigation systems is uniform emitter discharge, which is affected by
    operating pressure and water temperature. They therefore applied these two parameters
    to train models based on artificial neural networks, least-squares support-vector
    machines, or clustering. To this end, they implemented a physical drip irrigation
    system, from which they obtained the data to train and test their models. In Goap,
    Sharma, Shukla, and Rama Krishna (2018), a smart irrigation system based on the
    IoT and ML is proposed. Firstly, different IoT sensors of air temperature, air
    humidity, radiation, etc. acquire data from the crop environment. Secondly, these
    together with weather forecast data are used to predict soil moisture from both
    k-means clustering and support-vector regression models. Thirdly, this prediction
    is used to suggest irrigation techniques to the farmer. In addition, it is possible
    to configure the architecture to make decisions automatically, thus implementing
    an automatic irrigation system. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the ML models
    evaluated was 0.368% (soil moisture percentage). There is, however, no implementation
    of any smart irrigation schedule such as a DI system which would require predicting
    the crop water status. In Freeman et al. (2019), thermal images are used to identify
    early indicators of water stress. For this purpose, small drone systems are deployed
    which take infrared images of the crops. These images are used to train models
    using the IBM Watson Visual Recognition service. With these models, it is possible
    to predict water stress in different crops with sufficient lead time for farmers
    to select an appropriate irrigation strategy to cope with the situation. The study
    defines the performance of the proposal’s models in terms of the area under the
    curve (AUC) (Kubat, 2017), with values between 0.99 and 0.50 depending on the
    species being assessed. In Loggenberg, Strever, Greyling, and Poona (2018), hyperspectral
    imaging is used in conjunction with ML techniques to detect water stress in vineyards.
    The study was conducted in a Shiraz vineyard with several hyperspectral cameras
    acquiring images of the vineyard. These images were then processed and used to
    train models capable of discerning which parts of the vineyard were water-stressed.
    Two ML techniques were used — random forest and extreme gradient boosting. From
    these two techniques, the authors generated ML models that achieved a classification
    accuracy of 83.3% with the former and of 80.0% with the latter. Some studies have
    developed models for irrigation scheduling and crop management based on crop evapotranspiration.
    Feng, Peng, Cui, Gong, and Zhang (2017) estimated daily evapotranspiration for
    two scenarios using models that were first trained and tested using local data
    from each of six regional meteorological stations, and then trained using pooled
    data from all stations. The features analysed were temperature (maxima, minima,
    and m-height), mean relative humidity, wind speed at m height, and hours of sun.
    Artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and generalised
    regression neural network (GRNN) techniques were used. The results were expressed
    in terms of RMSE (mm/day), with values of 0,209 for ELM and 0.194 for GRNN. Patil
    and Deka (2016) estimated weekly evapotranspiration based on data from two meteorological
    stations, analysing such features as local maximum and minimum air temperature,
    solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere, and evapotranspiration. Their system
    used ANN and ELM techniques. The results were expressed in terms of RMSE (mm/day),
    with values of 0.33 for ELM, 0.34 for ANN, and 0.33 for a least-squares support-vector
    machine (LS-SVM) approach. In Mohammadi et al. (2015), the daily dew point temperature
    is predicted using the following features: weather data such as mean air temperature,
    relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, vapour pressure, and horizontal global
    solar irradiance. The system uses ANN and ELM techniques. The results in terms
    of RMSE (°C) were: 0.5662 for ELM, 1.2589 for ANN, and 1.0086 for LS-SVM. Mehdizadeh,
    Behmanesh, and Khalili (2017) estimate monthly mean reference evapotranspiration
    for arid and semi-arid regions, analysing such features as maximum, minimum, and
    mean temperatures, relative humidity, solar irradiance, and wind speed. The system
    uses regression algorithms including multivariate adaptive regression splines
    (MARS). The results in terms of RMSE (mm/day) were: 0.57 for gene expression programming,
    0.47 for a polynomial SVM model, 0.33 for a radial basis function SVM, and 0.07
    for MARS. Liakos et al. (2018) provide a systematic literature review, identifying
    multiple ML algorithms including ANNs, Bayesian models, dimensionality reduction,
    decision trees, ensemble learning, instance-based models, and SVMs. These algorithms
    should be tuned, trained, and validated for specific crops, however, and take
    into account the context in which they are grown. The use of turgor probes in
    agriculture has been tested in woody crops other than citrus such as grapevines
    (Westhoff et al., 2009), grapefruit (Rüger et al., 2010), banana (Zimmermann et
    al., 2010), and olive (Fernández et al., 2011). In this last case, crop water
    status thresholds were established, and the shapes of the daily curves corresponding
    to each threshold were determined manually. Although in all cases, the sensor
    data were taken into account, and changes in the daily pressure dynamics of the
    leaves were observed in accordance with the plant’s water status, the processing
    of the data did not apply a ML system or identification algorithms. By way of
    synthesis, Table 1 lists related studies that have pursued the same aim as the
    present proposal: to achieve optimal water-resource utilisation in the precision-farming
    context. The works reviewed took a variety of approaches, such as predicting evapotranspiration
    (Feng et al., 2017, Mehdizadeh et al., 2017, Patil and Deka, 2016), soil moisture
    (Goap et al., 2018), and daily dew point temperature (Mohammadi et al., 2015).
    However, knowledge of these parameters is insufficient for the successful application
    of DI techniques. Other studies, i.e., Freeman et al. (2019) and Loggenberg et
    al. (2018), took hyperspectral imaging as the ML data source to construct predictive
    models of water status. The appearance of IoT in the agricultural field has been
    a step forward in the digitisation of this sector. However, there is a gap between
    data interpretation and the actual use of the data for decision making. It is
    necessary to develop in parallel algorithms capable of interpreting these data
    and providing simple, fast information for decision making. The proposal presented
    in this communication is based on leaf turgor pressure as a data source for ML
    models to predict a crop’s water status. To the best of our knowledge, this is
    a novel method for this type of prediction. In this sense, not only is a ML algorithm
    proposed, but it is also applied in the field by means of the experiments to be
    described. Thus, the proposal is defined not only by taking into account how to
    predict water status but also in an agricultural context where using DI strategies
    and water status prediction make it possible to apply only the minimal water resources
    the crop needs. Table 1. Key elements of the related works summarised. Article

    expert system for citrus: Material and methods This communication describes the
    design of a novel expert system to determine the water status of citrus. It includes
    both an IoT environment setup and a ML process to predict the water status, the
    most important datum needed to implement an intelligent irrigation system. The
    context of the citrus grove, the data acquisition, ML setup, and experiments carried
    and their results will be presented below. Fig. 1 shows the system architecture
    deployed to predict citrus water status. The main elements are the sensors, the
    gateway, and the expert system. The following sections describe the sensors and
    the context in which they were deployed, and how the data was collected from them.
    Then the pre-processing techniques applied to this data are explained. Finally,
    details are given of the ML algorithms applied, and of the experimental setup
    and the experiments carried out to calibrate the system. Download : Download high-res

    data gathering and the expert system. 3.1. Experimental conditions and irrigation
    treatments Firstly, the experimental conditions will be described. An experimental
    plot of sweet orange (Citrus × sinensis (L.) Osbeck cv. Navelina) was used in
    2020, during the late fruit-setting to ripening period (June to October), in a
    commercial farm (37°30′15.9 N 5°59′03.6 W) located 1.5 km from the IFAPA “Las
    Torres”. Sweet orange trees had been planted in 2012 and 2014, spaced 6 × 4 m,
    and grafted onto ‘Citrange’ carrizo rootstock. The trees, in perfect phytosanitary
    and developmental conditions, were drip-irrigated with two lines of emitters,
    1 m apart in each line, and a nominal flow rate of 2.3 L/h. The soil is a typical
    silty loam fluvisol, more than 2.5 m deep, with organic matter 1.0%. Roots were
    located predominantly in the top 50 cm of soil, corresponding to the intended
    wetting depth. Soil water content values at field capacity and permanent wilting
    point were close to 0.40 and 0.15 m m−3, respectively. The climate of the study
    area is meso-mediterranean, with an annual potential evapotranspiration ( ) rate
    of 1400 mm, and accumulated rainfall of 540 mm occurring mainly from October to
    April (average data corresponding to the last 15 years, obtained from the Agroclimatic
    Information Network RIA, 2020). Two irrigation treatments were arranged: (i) full
    irrigation (FI), which received 100% of the irrigation requirements (IR) throughout
    the season; and (ii) a low-frequency DI treatment (LFDI) which was subjected to
    irrigation-restriction cycles. Thus, during restriction periods, irrigation was
    suppressed until stem water potential values ( ) between −1.8 and 2.0 MPa were
    reached. Then irrigation was begun with the same frequency as FI until the reached
    values similar to those being recorded in FI. The length of the irrigation-restriction
    cycles varied depending on the phenological stage and the weather conditions.
    On average they ranged between 10–14 days, with 5–7 days of water restriction
    and something similar for the recovery periods. IR was calculated in accordance
    with (Allen, Pereira, Raes, Smith, et al., 1998a), obtaining the values of the
    reference evapotranspiration ( ) using a weather station (Davis Advance Pro2,
    Davis Instruments, Valencia, Spain) installed very close to the trial ( 800 m).
    During the experimental period, the effective rainfall and crop evapotranspiration
    ( ) were 21 and 392 mm, respectively. The fertiliser rate applied was in accordance
    with commercial practices in the area (150-70-110 kg ha−1 of N, P O , and K O,
    respectively). Routine cultivation techniques were applied for disease and insect
    control. Taking into consideration the accumulated spring rainfall (280 mm) and
    the soil–water content, from the beginning of the sampling period (1st June: 153
    day-of-the-year, DOY) to the end of the irrigation season (14th October: 288 DOY),
    FI received 199 mm, while LFDI accumulated a total of 117 mm. and underwent six
    restriction cycles. 3.1.1. Turgor sensor: hardware description The turgor sensor
    consists of a pressure chip embedded in a gel encased in a plastic chamber. Surrounding
    the chamber is a metal ring which, together with a counter magnet, is fixed to
    the tree leaf (see Fig. 2). Changes in the water status of the plant cause an
    increase or decrease in the size of the leaf, which the chip records. The sensor
    turns these changes into an electrical signal that it sends continuously to a
    communication box. The communication box is equipped with Bluetooth, and every
    3 min sends the readings to a gateway that stores the information, and sends a
    data packet once an hour to a cloud where it is stored and processed. Download

    Plant measurements and IoT sensor data acquisition Since the main aim of this
    experiment was to relate the stem water potential values (easily identifiable
    information) with that provided by the turgor pressure probes, in both trials
    all the measurements were taken from three trees under LFDI and two under FI conditions.
    Probes were placed around the canopy – 6 on each tree with LFDI treatment and
    3 on each tree with FI treatment. Thus, each trial involved 24 probes, 18 on trees
    under LFDI conditions and 6 on trees under FI conditions. Fig. 3 shows the citrus
    tree distribution map in which are identified details of the two irrigation treatments
    carried out throughout the experiment. The readings were taken at noon (solar
    time), with a periodicity of 4–7 days, depending on the evolution observed in
    the previous measurements. They were made using a portable Scholander pressure
    chamber with an external source of nitrogen. Before the measurements, the selected
    leaves (mature, healthy and well-developed) were previously covered with aluminium
    bags at least 30 min before the readings in order to reach equilibrium between
    leaf and stem water potential. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Location of the grove where the data were acquired.
    The full irrigation treatment (FI) is termed Control, and the low frequency DI
    treatment (LFDI) is termed Low-frequency. Finally, with the aim of correlating
    leaf measurements with the evolution of fruit growth, three fruit dendrometers
    (TechInCrop Agroresearch Corp. Seville, Spain) were installed for each irrigation
    treatment and experimental plot. These were placed on one of the selected trees
    where the turgor pressure probes were installed, selecting representative fruits
    in terms of size that were located on the northern internal face of each tree.
    3.3. Data analysis and processing The values were subjected to a one-way analysis
    of variance using the SPSS statistical package (SPSS 15.0, Chicago IL, USA), with
    a t-test for mean separations ( ). Previously, Levene’s test was applied to check
    for homogeneity of variance. Daily fruit growth (DFG) was estimated for each treatment
    and cultivar from the fruit-diameter readings in accordance with the method proposed
    by Pérez-López et al. (2013). Both parameters were subjected to the same statistical
    tests as . For the FI treatment, three crop water status thresholds were established
    in base POT (Table 2). For the LFDI treatment, the DFG in FI (DFG-FI) and in LFDI
    (DFG-LFDI) were considered to rank the crop water status. In this, if DFG-LFDI
    was similar to DFG-FI, status 0 was assumed, even though it was possible to observe
    LFDI values between −1.4 and −1.7. This situation was observed above all in the
    first days of the restriction cycles. If DFG-LFDI was below that observed for
    DFG-FI, status 1 was assumed, even though it was possible to observe LFDI values
    of up to −1.4 MPa (Table 2). These criteria were selected in accordance with the
    reference values of stem water potential defined by García-Tejero, Durán-Zuazo,
    Muriel-Fernández and Jiménez-Bocanegra (2011) and of fruit-growth status defined
    by García-Tejero et al. (2012). Table 2. Water stress levels defined in terms
    of stem water potential ( ) and daily fruit growth (DFG). Empty Cell FI LFDI Empty
    Cell Empty Cell 0 −1.4 0 1 Not detected −1.7 −1.4 1 1 2 −1.7 2 Not detected 2
    Assumptions similar to the above were made for the more stressful conditions.
    Thus, if the DFG-LFDI values were 0 or negative, status 2 was assumed, even if
    the values were within the range −1.4 to −1.7 MPa. Finally, if the DFG-LFDI values
    were below those observed in DFG-FI, but greater than 0, status 1 was assumed,
    even if the LFDI values were below −1.7 MPa (Table 2). In citrus, it is possible
    to establish irrigation schedules based on according to the phenological stage
    and the thresholds accepted for each period (Goldhamer & Salinas, 2000), and even
    increase the effectiveness of the strategy by applying water deficits in two or
    more moments of the crop cycle (García-Tejero et al., 2012). However, the limitations
    of this model are, on the one hand, the excessive labour involved in taking measurements
    in the plot given its spatial variability, And, on the other, the determination
    of the beginning and end of each phenological stage. Irrigation doses that lead
    to more negative values of the potential than those established for each period
    can lead to economic losses in the final yield (in quantity and/or quality). Likewise,
    reaching more positive values of potential implies water savings inefficiency
    in the plot with the associated costs. Data were acquired using the weather sensors
    and the leaf turgor sensors located on the citrus tree from 1st June 2020 to 27th
    October 2020 at a 3-min frequency. This data was stored to be used for the ML
    training. The original data set citrusdata.csv includes the columns defined in
    Table 3. Next, two descriptive data processes were carried out. Firstly, the data
    correlation matrix was analysed, but no correlations were found. Secondly, the
    features were analysed individually (feature/water status scatter plots), trying
    to find the features most representative of the water status. However, although
    some trends were observed, no feature individually capable of representing the
    water status was found. Table 3. Data set description of citrusdata.csv. Feature

    estimated by the Penman–Monteith equation Sensor error code 3.4. Data pre-processing
    techniques, ML algorithms, and learning model validation Pre-processing the data
    set is one of the principal phases in any ML project. The pre-processing phase
    is performed before training the learning models, and is aimed at generating reliable
    input data. The main objective of this phase is to enhance the performance of
    the learning models in terms of classification accuracy, time in constructing
    a classifier, the size of the classifier, etc. (Crone et al., 2006, Uysal and
    Gunal, 2014). Two types of pre-processing techniques can be distinguished: (1)
    data Reduction, and (2) data projection. Data reduction includes those techniques
    that focus on modifying data features in order to optimise data quality. Data
    projection focuses on the necessary transformations of the raw data into an optimised
    and feasible representation for each particular learning algorithm (Crone et al.,
    2006). Data reduction The techniques applied in this context are Oversampling
    and Feature Selection. Oversampling means increasing the volume of instances of
    a particular class (Ali et al., 2013, Barua et al., 2014). Feature selection focuses
    on selecting the most relevant features from the data and eliminating the rest
    (Gu et al., 2018, Kwak and Choi, 2002). Data projection The techniques applied
    in this context are Min–Max Normalisation and One-Hot Encoding. Min–max normalisation
    (Eq. (1) is a technique to scale data into a range delimited by pre-defined minimum
    and maximum limits (Patro & Sahu, 2015). (1) where A is the min–max normalised
    data, [C,D] is the pre-defined boundary, and A is data within the range of the
    original data. One-hot encoding is used to allow the learning algorithms to process
    the categorical data. It transforms a single variable with observations and distinct
    values into binary variables with observations each. Each observation indicates
    the presence (1) or absence (0) of the dichotomous binary variable (Potdar, Pardawala,
    & Pai, 2017). 3.4.1. Algorithms applied In order to carry out the experiments,
    various ML algorithms were applied (Kubat, 2017): k-nearest-neighbours, support-vector
    machine, and gradient boosting classifier. • k-Nearest-Neighbours(k-NN) (Kubat,
    2017) is based on determining the similarity between examples. Thus, the classifier
    compares their attributes-based descriptions. The fact of each example being represented
    by a point in an n-dimensional space makes it possible to calculate the geometric
    distance between any pair of examples. The closer to each other the examples are
    in the instance space, the greater their mutual similarity. The classifier identifies
    not just one neighbour but k neighbours. So the k-NN classifier is a similarity
    classifier in which k is the number of voting neighbours. • Support-Vector Machine
    (SVM) is a kernel-based (and hence supervised) ML algorithm for regression and
    classification analysis (Boser, Guyon, & Vapnik, 1992). Its aim is to optimise
    a mathematical function of the given data to find the set of support vectors and
    the margins that allow the data to best be separated and/or sorted. Specifically,
    it seeks to determine those vectors representing the data points (the support
    vectors) that maximise the separation of the data according to different features
    (Noble, 2006). Consequently, training an SVM algorithm involves searching for
    hyperplanes that allow the data to be separated by certain features in such a
    way that the margin, i.e., the separation, between the two subsets is maximised
    (Kelleher, Mac Namee, & D’arcy, 2020). • Gradient Boosting Classifier consists
    of ensembles usually built from Decision Tree models. They are trained step by
    step, with the model of each step trying to improve the errors of the previous
    ones. This is based on the AdaBoost technique where the examples for each decision
    tree are chosen from a probabilistic distribution that is gradually modified in
    a way that makes the whole ensemble focus on those aspects that appear to be difficult
    (Kubat, 2017), specifically the cost function. Additional ML models had been tested
    previously. Specifically, recurrent neural networks such as LSTM networks (Kubat,
    2017) (given the recurrent nature of the problem) and ELM neural networks (Huang,
    Zhu, & Siew, 2004). However, they presented three major disadvantages than the
    previously ML models defined: (1) Slower model training, (2) Greater complexity
    in terms of model training (network architecture development and parameter configuration)
    and, (3) Greater complexity in data curation, especially in LSTM networks. 3.4.2.
    Learning model validation measurements In order to evaluate the performance of
    the trained learning models, we used measures such as Precision and Recall (Powers,
    2011). Precision (Eq. (2)), or confidence as it is called in data mining, denotes
    the proportion of Predicted Positive cases that are correctly predicted as Real
    Positives (Powers, 2011), i.e., the number of True Positives divided by the sum
    of True Positives and False Positives: (2) Recall (Eq. (3), or sensitivity as
    it is called in psychology, is the proportion of Real Positive cases that are
    correctly Predicted Positive (Powers, 2011), i.e., the true positive rate (the
    number of True Positives divided by the sum of True Positives and False Negatives):
    (3) The F1_score (Eq. (4) is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and
    recall: (4) Additionally, well-known measures such as the receiver operating characteristic
    (ROC) and the AUC (Kubat, 2017) will be used to assess the performance of the
    proposed ML models, as well as the recall and 1 - Specificity (Kelleher et al.,
    2020), where the specificity is the analogue of recall but for negative examples
    instead of positive: (5) The ROC curve summarises all the confusion matrices that
    each threshold produced. That is, it is obtained by moving the model threshold
    between [0-1] and plotting the values of recall and 1-Specificity for each threshold.
    Although ROC curves are commonly used in binary classifications to study the output
    of a classifier, they can be extended to multi-label classification by a process
    to binarize the output. Finally, the ROC index or AUC measures the area underneath
    a ROC curve (Kelleher et al., 2020). For ML models with multi-class classification,
    AUC is calculated for each class and two additional metrics, micro-average and
    macro-average (Kelleher et al., 2020). 4. The expert system tuning experiments
    and results This section presents how the experiments in ML were set up, and then
    describes them. Table 4 summarises the experiments carried out from data set after
    its pre-processing. Each experiment uses a subset of the data set columns in order
    to identify the minimal set of features required to suitably predict the citrus
    water status ( ). The set of experiments was designed taking into account the
    knowledge of experts. Table 4. Experiments carried out to identify the minimum
    set of characteristics needed to determine the water status of citrus. ExperimentID
    Description Experiment 01 Only weather data were used throughout the experiment
    Experiment 02 Only turgor of the leaves was used throughout the experiment Experiment
    03 Turgor and temperature of the leaves were used throughout the experiment Experiment
    04 All data sets were used throughout the experiment 4.1. Experiment setup and
    experimentation 4.1.1. Application of pre-processing techniques Data Reduction
    and Data Projection techniques were applied in order to pre-process data for the
    experiments. Common shortcomings identified in a data set are class imbalance
    (Buda, Maki, & Mazurowski, 2018), irrelevant and redundant features (Gu et al.,
    2018, Kwak and Choi, 2002), and noise in the data (Zhu & Wu, 2004). The oversampling
    pre-processing technique was applied to solve the class imbalance problem, so
    that instances with fewer examples were incremented to create similar instances.
    Next, the feature selection pre-processing technique was applied to solve the
    irrelevant and redundant features and noise in data problems, thus eliminating
    irrelevant or erroneous instances. The One-Hot Encoding pre-processing technique
    was applied in order to enable the learning algorithms to process the categorical
    variables. In addition, the pre-processing technique Min–Max Normalisation was
    applied in order to optimise the training of the learning models (Kubat, 2017).
    4.1.2. Experiment feature selection The feature selection process was carried
    out following a protocol developed for this purpose. It is a three-stage iterative
    protocol based on the wrapper feature selection method (a supervised feature selection
    technique) (Cai, Luo, Wang, & Yang, 2018). The protocol is as follows: (1) the
    experts suggest a feature selection set based on their previous knowledge (and
    results); (2) an experiment is carried out regarding the selection made; (3) the
    experts analyse and discuss the results. Not only were the four experiments included
    in this communication undertaken with this iterative protocol, but several other
    experiments were carried out with the aim of gathering knowledge about the response
    of the learning algorithms to the different sets of selected features. This made
    it possible to determine the best selection of features to train the models. In
    addition, new relevant features for training the models, such as , , or , , ,
    were identified and included. Following this experimental phase, the experts identified
    four experiments they considered to be the most relevant to the literature. 4.1.3.
    Data set in experiments The original data set included 923,669 rows which were
    reduced to 153,253 rows after the application of the pre-processing techniques.
    The training and validation sets included the same volume of instances in each
    experiment. Specifically, the training set included 120,000 rows, and the validation
    set 33,253 rows, i.e., 78.3% and 21.7% of the data, respectively. Finally, it
    should be mentioned that each experiment was designed to use only one feature
    set of the total data set features available. This was due to the research questions
    that are addressed in this communication. 4.2. Experiment 01: Using weather data
    to train the ML models In Experiment 01, the aim was to determine whether it is
    possible to predict the water status of citrus crops ( ) using only weather data.
    The first experimental approach was based on the fact that meteorological data
    are the most widely used to develop irrigation schedules based on the replacement
    (total or partial) of orchard evapotranspiration (Allen, Pereira, Raes, Smith,
    et al., 1998b). Subsequently, the results of this method were compared with those
    of the present work’s novel method of using leaf turgor pressure. Therefore, in
    this first experiment, the following data set features were selected: , , , ,
    , , , , , , , , , , . Different ML algorithms (k-NN, gradient-boosted regression
    trees GBRT, and SVM) were trained. The results are given in Table 5. It should
    be noted that the best values for k-NN were obtained with . The ROC curves and
    the AUC values are shown in Fig. 4. Analysing the results, it is possible to state
    that the traditional method of using weather data is effective in predicting the
    water status of citrus, allowing learning algorithms to train models with an F1-score
    of 75.33% in the case of the SVM learning algorithm. However, it is unsatisfactory
    to use this algorithm for an expert system to determine the water status of citrus.
    This prediction, based only on meteorological data, could be valid for irrigation
    schedules designed to replace 100% of the plot evapotranspiration, which maintain
    an optimal water status of the trees. However, when using DI strategies, there
    results a percentage of uncertainty that may lead to the trees being left to suffer
    water stress and a consequent reduction in yield and/or final quality. Table 5.

    only leaf turgor data ( , , , ) In Experiment 02, only leaf turgor pressure data
    were used as input. The correlation analyses found and to be uncorrelated. However,
    in Fernández et al. (2011), the values take into account 24 h of data. Consequently,
    we defined new dataset features , , which calculate the maximum leaf turgor pressure
    in 24 h, the minimum leaf turgor pressure in 24 h, and the average leaf turgor
    pressure in 24 h, respectively. The results of the experiment are given in Table
    6. The ROC curves and the AUC values are shown in Fig. 5. Analysing the results,
    it is possible to confirm the experts’ hypothesis. The k-NN algorithm is able
    to train models with an f1-score of 73.66% in predicting the water status of citrus
    crops using only the leaf turgor pressure as input data. This f1-score is very
    close to that obtained in Experiment 01, in which all the acquired meteorological
    data were used. In this case, the use of the sensor is an additional cost for
    the prediction of the water status which could otherwise be done more cheaply.

    46.33% 42.33% 41.33% 0.58 0.57 4.4. Experiment 03: Using only leaf turgor sensors
    to train the ML models The leaf turgor pressure sensors collect not only leaf
    turgor pressure data, but also leaf temperature. Temperature is a critical input
    datum in traditional predictive methods used to infer crop condition. Therefore,
    in this experiment leaf turgor pressure and leaf temperature were used together.
    The features selected were , , , and , , , . The experiment’s results are given
    in Table 7. The ROC curves and the AUC values are shown in Fig. 6. Analysing the
    results, it is possible to state that the combination of the traditional method
    with our novel method shows better performance in terms of the F1-score for classifying
    the water status of citrus crops than their separate use. The worst result is
    very similar to the best result of both Experiments 01 and 02. As for the best
    result, it is obtained with the k-NN algorithm with a 99% F1-score. The high success
    rate of this technology would allow the efficient design of DI strategies based
    on tree water potential thresholds with a negligible margin of error. Achieving
    this level of accuracy with traditional methods would mean taking manual measurements
    of potentials at several points in the orchard on a daily basis. This translates
    into increased labour costs that are not economically feasible. Table 7. Experiment

    Experiment 04: Using all data set features and the following additional features
    , , , , , Experiment 04 was aimed at obtaining maximal performance from the learning
    algorithms. In view of the results of Experiment 03, a reasonable hypothesis would
    be that the union of all the climate data (used in Experiment 01) and the data
    from the leaf turgor pressure sensors ( and ) might comprise a data set with the
    potential to train learning models with a superior performance to those of the
    previous experiments. Note that aggregate features such as , , , , , were calculated
    and added to the data set. So the features selected were , , , , , , , , , , ,
    , , , , , , , , , , , . The experiment’s results are given in Table 8. The ROC
    curves and the AUC values are shown in Fig. 7 These results are similar to those
    of Experiment 03. Consequently, the most important data with which to obtain suitable
    predictions are based on those from the leaf turgor pressure sensor, i.e.,  ,
    , , , , , , . Hence, additional resources to measure weather characteristics are
    not needed for deployment in the field. It implies that leaf turgor response represents
    a combination of weather changes and plant behaviour (Li et al., 2018). The algorithm
    is able to isolate the weather effect and focus on plant response, so that, for
    production purposes, only turgor-pressure sensors are needed. Table 8. Results

    0.94 0.93 SVM 74.33% 75% 74.66% 0.89 0.88 Note that k-NN is one of the most important
    machine learning models for classification problems. It classifies new data based
    on the similarity measure of the earlier stored data points. It is recommended
    when data are properly labelled and noise-free. In this project, the data are
    indeed suitably labelled and the data set has been pre-processed to avoid data
    noise. Additionally, the pre-processing techniques led to a balanced data classification,
    which improved the results of all the models applied during the experiments, but
    especially those given by k-NN (F1-score of 99%) were considerably improved. Thus,
    data pre-processing is essential to obtaining suitable results with k-NN. 5. Discussion
    The proposed expert system based on the IoT and ML models makes it possible to
    predict the crop . The turgor pressure probes gather data from the crops, while
    a ML model predicts the current . Despite turgor pressure probes having been used
    for other crops such as grapevine (Westhoff et al., 2009), grapefruit (Rüger et
    al., 2010), banana (Zimmermann et al., 2010), and olive trees (Fernández et al.,
    2011), the device used in this work is a novel technology, and very few researchers
    have access to it. This communication has presented a unique combination of artificial
    intelligence and breakthrough technology. To ensure excellent results, especial
    attention was paid to selecting the most adequate techniques to achieve successful
    conclusions: comparing and selecting the most suitable data pre-processing method
    and algorithm to use. Although several methods (Feng et al., 2017, Goap et al.,
    2018, Mehdizadeh et al., 2017, Mohammadi et al., 2015, Patil and Deka, 2016, Seyedzadeh
    et al., 2020) use different IoT sensors to gather crop and weather data with which
    to feed their ML models, they do not use turgor pressure probes which produce
    enough data to make it possible to predict . Note that is an essential datum for
    the implementation of DI strategies. Also, various pre-processing data techniques
    and ML models were tested. The results showed that k-NN offers better predictive
    performance than SVM. The SVM algorithm uses hyperplanes between support vectors
    that depend on the kernel used in order to establish the boundary between the
    classes (water status in the present case). If the boundary between classes is
    not linearly separable with support vectors, the dimensionality can be increased
    to try to separate the classes linearly with hyperplanes. But if the classes are
    still not linearly separable, SVM will be unable to train models with a good predictive
    performance (Chauhan, Dahiya, & Sharma, 2019). k-NN, however, is a clustering
    algorithm that establishes the boundary between classes based on the closeness
    of the instances to be classified to a certain number (the parameter ) of already
    classified instances (Pratama & Sarno, 2015). In this way, k-NN is able to establish
    nonlinear boundaries between the classes. In view of the results of the experiments
    carried out and the properties of these algorithms described above, it is possible
    to state that the boundary between the classes of our classification problem is
    not linearly separable (even when the dimensionality is increased). Consequently,
    k-NN is able to train models with a better predictive performance than SVM. The
    results make it possible to discuss the expert system’s utility for users. At
    this point, it must be remembered that currently crop is calculated manually —
    an expensive and tedious task which must be carried out for each sector of the
    citrus grove. Furthermore, the value of is the critical datum for the implementation
    of suitable irrigation restriction strategies for a citrus crop. • R1. It is possible
    to predict automatically the water status of citrus by using ML applied to IoT
    sensor data. The system developed based on IoT and ML makes it possible to calculate
    the citrus crop water status (as defined previously in terms of ) daily with a
    99% F1-score. Hence, the expensive, manual process of obtaining the citrus crop
    can be replaced. • R2. Using a leaf turgor pressure sensor is sufficient to determine
    the water status of citrus by using ML applied to IoT sensor data. The leaf turgor
    pressure sensor was the key element in obtaining the best ML results that were
    presented. The and data provided by the leaf turgor pressure sensors and the aggregate
    24-h data ( , , , , , ) were identified as the critical data with which to determine
    the crop water status using ML algorithms. • R3. Exclusively if no water restrictions
    are applied are weather data sufficient to assume that an optimal citrus water
    status has been achieved. Although weather data is important for the description
    of crop irrigation systems, when the target is to aid in making decisions of how
    to apply a deficit irrigation strategy, weather data are not enough. Consequently,
    this has to be rejected as a hypothesis. • R4. An expert system to determine the
    water status of citrus is able to help users apply suitable irrigation strategies
    based on irrigation-restriction cycles. This is the most important contribution.
    The proposed system is novel and makes it possible to assess the crop water status
    in order to reduce water consumption in the current scenario of climate change.
    Thus, although turgor sensors and the IoT infrastructure required are costly,
    applying only the water resource that a crop really needs could save water in
    a field context in which water is a scarce resource. Additionally, the proposed
    system helps farmers reduce costs by avoiding the need to apply manual techniques
    to calculate the water status. To use the proposed expert system, the following
    issues should be considered: • The system requires deploying several leaf turgor
    sensors over all of the citrus orchard. This deployment requires a sporadic manual
    effort. • The sensor data should be analysed in order to discard erroneous data
    due to the device being unsuitably located or having stopped working. These are
    important issues we are currently working on. • System connectivity is an additional
    issue that should usually be taken into account in any IoT environment, although
    current gateways offer enough connectivity to gather sensor data suitably. • Analysing
    massive data from sensors is a challenge that could be tackled by using the possibilities
    of ensemble classification models for distributed, parallel big data processing
    as outlined by  Cao et al. (2021) and Wei et al. (2020). • It is very important
    to take into account the orchard’s spatial variability, in order to define different
    areas with which to have the most appropriate information for decision-making.
    For instance, identifying spatial patterns of soil and plant properties might
    be an efficient approach to establishing site-specific management in delineated
    areas with homogeneous characteristics (i.e., management zones, MZs)  (Millán,
    Moral, Prieto, Pérez-Rodriguez, & Campillo, 2019). • Although this system represents
    an advance in irrigation support systems, manual labour is still required to resolve
    physical problems such as sensor installation replacement, detachment and falls,
    etc. 6. Conclusions The digital transformation of agriculture can help farmers
    to improve their processes by using technology based on the Internet of Things,
    Big Data, and Machine Learning. These processes include using better irrigation
    processes such as DI. The weather data traditionally used to infer valuable information
    to support the decision of an appropriate irrigation strategy gave very similar
    results to those of the novel use of leaf turgor (75% F1-score). But the combination
    of temperature, specifically leaf temperature, and leaf turgor gave results that
    were clearly superior to those from the use of these data separately (99% vs 75%
    F1-score). Therefore, the experiments revealed that the performance of this novel
    ML-based method is suitable to support decision-making in terms of irrigation
    strategy, making it possible to apply complex irrigation techniques such as DI
    without putting the plant or the crop production at risk. Future work should test
    whether the ML models described in this communication and the algorithm developed
    are valid for other orange tree varieties and other citrus in general, such as
    lemon or mandarin trees, and if so, what is the efficiency of these models. Finally,
    irrigation scheduling should be carried out based on the expert system created
    for oranges in order to determine the potential savings in citrus orchards. CRediT

  description: Accurate ahead forecasting of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is
    crucial for effective irrigation scheduling and management of water resources
    on a regional scale. A variety of methods are available for ETo simulation, but
    the most trending is complementary artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms. In
    this research, a novel Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition technique (MVMD)
    integrated with the Ridge Regression (RR) feature selection algorithm and Kernel
    Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) model (i.e., MVMD-RR-KELM) was adopted to multi-step
    ahead (t + 3, and t + 7) forecasting of daily ETo in different climate of India.
    Here, the complementary expert system hybridized with the Boosted Regression Tree
    (BRT) and Extreme Gradient Boosted (XGBoost) along with the standalone counterpart
    models (KELM, BRT, and XGBoost) were examined to validate the robustness of the
    primary model. The complementary (i.e., MVMD-RR-KELM, MVMD-RR-BRT, & MVMD-RR-XGBoost)
    and their standalone counterpart models were trained and tested using daily climatic
    data of Hisar (located in Haryana State), Bathinda, and Ludhiana (located in Punjab
    State) sites. The forecasting accuracy of standalone and hybrid AI models was
    assessed using six goodness-of-fit metrics, i.e., R (Correlation Coefficient),
    RMSE (root mean square error), MAPE (mean absolute percentage error), NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe
    Efficiency), IA (Index of Agreement), U95% (Uncertainty Coefficient with 95% level)
    along with visual interpretation. According to the testing results, the hybrid
    MVMD-RR-KELM models had superior performance than other AI models for forecasting
    three and seven days ahead ETo. The KELM model optimized using the MVMD-RR technique
    provides promising and robust results with higher forecasting accuracy and minimum
    error for multi-step ahead forecasting of ETo in semi-arid and sub-humid regions.

    (ET) comprises two major processes: evaporation from plant and soil surfaces and
    transpiration from plants to air (Adnan et al., 2021a, Adnan et al., 2021b). ET
    is essential for estimating hydrological processes, agronomy systems, irrigation
    water demands, etc. (Muhammad et al., 2021, Shiri et al., 2013). Accurate ET estimation
    is crucial also for irrigation plans and enhances the efficiency of water resource
    usage (Ferreira et al., 2019). Accurate ET computation is highly reliant on the
    availability of ETo which is the ET of a hypothetical grass with a fixed surface
    resistance of 70 sm−1, the uniform height of 0.12 m, and an albedo of 0.23 (Allen
    et al., 1998a, Allen et al., 1998b). ET computation requires precise ETo estimation
    for improved agricultural water reuse and irrigation efficiency (Feng et al.,
    2016, Shiri et al., 2013). Literature review reported three frequently used empirical
    formulations for the ETo assessment including Thornthwaite (Pereira and Pruitt,
    2004), Hargreaves (Hargreaves and Allen, 2003), and FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (PM)
    (Penman, 1948). The first two methods are based on temperature single factor.
    Whereas, PM based on multiple factor synthesis method (Li et al., 2022). The PM
    method based on empirical formulations and the laws of energy balance and aerodynamics
    and remains the most widely used ETo computation method. It is also used for the
    validation of other ETo methods (Tabari et al., 2012). The PM approach, on the
    other hand, necessitates several climatic parameters, including maximum & minimum
    air temperatures, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed, which makes
    it challenging to use, especially in developing nations (Abdullah et al., 2015,
    Traore et al., 2010). As a result, a simpler model with fewer meteorological characteristics
    is needed to estimate ETo with adequate precision. Many scholars have used empirical
    approaches such as radiation-based, humidity-based, temperature-based, water budget-based,
    pan-based, and mass transfer-based approaches to estimate reference evapotranspiration
    using inadequate meteorological data (Bickici Arikan et al., 2021, Xu and Singh,
    2002). Others focused on the remote sensing dataset for estimating and mapping
    the crop evapotranspiration (Pôças et al., 2020). In the absence of enough meteorological
    variables, the radiation-based, humidity-based, and temperature-based models are
    typically employed to compute ETo rather than the PM technique (Priestley and
    Taylor, 1972). The simplicity and great precision of the Hargreaves (H) and modified
    Hargreaves (MH) methods (temperature-based) made them the most employed ETo estimation
    methods (Luo et al., 2014). Improved versions of the 11 temperature-based approaches
    to estimate ETo and noted that the H method achieved the best accuracy (Almorox
    et al., 2015). The commonly available radiation-based models are the Priestley-Taylor
    (PT), Markkink (M), & Ritchie (R) models. These models have been evaluated for
    ETo computation, and it was found that the PT and R equations were more accurate
    than the M equation (Feng et al., 2016). Another study reported the use of multiple
    empirical models to estimate ETo, such as the PT, M, R, Jensen–Haise, and Turc
    models; the study found the R equation to outperform the other models (Tabari
    et al., 2012). The humidity-based models, such as the Schendel (S) and Romanenko
    (ROM) equations, are often employed to derive ETo from humidity-based weather
    data (Djaman et al., 2015, Mehdizadeh et al., 2017). But despite the good performance
    of several empirical models, such as the H, MH, PT, R, ROM, and S equations, in
    calculating ETo, their effectiveness varies greatly among locations. In another
    study, 16 empirical models were tested for ETo computation in the absence of comprehensive
    meteorological data; the study found that the ETo was either overestimated or
    underestimated by the empirical models (Djaman et al., 2015). Hence, more research
    and development are required to build superior ETo estimation models with better
    precision while using fewer meteorological variables. 1.2. Soft computing literature
    review ETo computation using meteorological data has been deemed a regression
    task that artificial intelligence (AI) models that can solve in recent decades,
    thanks to the rapid advancement in computational capacity and AI theory (Cui et
    al., 2022, Danandeh Mehr et al., 2022, Dou and Yang, 2018, Halder et al., 2021,
    Kalteh, 2015). The first AI model adopted for ETo prediction was the Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN) (Kumar et al., 2002). Later, a self-organizing map neural
    network was built to measure the variability of evaporation based on meteorological
    factors (Chang et al., 2010). The extreme learning machine (ELM) model has also
    been evaluated for ETo estimation and found to be suitable for the modeling task
    (Abdullah et al., 2015). The support vector machine (SVM) was designed to forecast
    ETo using only radiation data and air temperature; the assessment showed that
    SVM performed better than the H and PT methods in ETo estimation (Wen et al.,
    2015). Multivariate Relevance vector machine is used to build a forecasting for
    ETo based on limited dataset and the model confirmed its potential against classical
    empirical formulation (Torres et al., 2011). In Saudi Arabia, researchers used
    a back-propagation technique for multilayer perceptron (MLP) transformation into
    a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for ETo prediction (Yassin et al., 2016).
    The study noted that this modification (the addition of a BP method) was required
    to bridge the accuracy gap between PM and ANN models. In southwest China, metrological
    data from two stations have been used to build random forests (RF) and generalized
    regression neural networks (GRNN) for daily ETo estimation (Feng et al., 2017).
    Both models (local and external RF and GRNN models) were found to efficiently
    estimate the daily ETo even though the RF model outperformed GRNN. Meteorological
    data from 8 weather stations across China has been used to build RF, M5tree, extreme
    gradient boosting (XGBoost), SVM, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and
    ELM models for daily ETo estimation (Fan et al., 2018). The performance of the
    XGBoost and GBDT models were found to be similar in terms of stability and accuracy
    to the performance of the ELM and SVM; however, the computation cost of the XGBoost
    and GBDT models was substantially less. The study thereby recommended the XGBoost
    and GBDT models for daily ETo estimation in the studied region of China. The hybridization
    of RF and a wavelet technique for ETo estimation in the southern region of Iran
    has been presented by Shiri (2018). The study results proved the feasibility of
    the hybridized RF model as it demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional
    RF and empirical models. Similarly, a hybridized GPR model has been shown to perform
    better ETo estimation than a standalone model (Karbasi, 2017). ETo estimation
    within the African region using a hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
    with a nature-inspired tuning optimization technique has been reported (Tao et
    al., 2018). Daily ETo prediction using four ELM models optimized with bio-inspired
    algorithms (Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Flower Pollination
    Algorithm (FPA), and Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA)) has been reported by Wu et
    al. (2019); the study observed a good match between the predicted and computed
    ETo values using the FAO-56 PM method. The ELM-FPA and ELM-CSA models performed
    better ETo prediction than the standard ELM model. An assessment of four supervised
    learning algorithms for future ETo prediction has been reported by Saggi and Jain
    (2019); the evaluated models (Deep Learning-Multilayer Perceptron (DL), Generalized
    Linear Model (GLM), RF, and GBDT) performed well when it came to modeling daily
    ETo. Several studies have confirmed the viability of ML models for ETo prediction
    in various locations around the globe (Chen et al., 2020, Huang et al., 2019).
    For complicated hydrological processes like ETo estimation, hybrid models built
    by combining two or more ML models often perform better than standalone models
    (Jing et al., 2019). ETo estimation in the north-western region of China (with
    limited metrological data) using an optimized ELM model with particle swarm optimization
    (PSO) has been reported by Zhu et al. (2020). Another study in Malaysia used metrological
    data from 3 stations in Sarawak to confirm the performance of the hybrid ELM-PSO
    model, moth-flame optimization (MFO), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) on
    ETo prediction (Chia et al., 2021). The study found WOA-ELM to achieve a higher
    average rank score based on the data. Daily ETo estimation at four sites in China''s
    arid region and four stations in the humid region using a hybrid XGBoost-WOA model
    has been reported (Yan et al., 2021). The study found that ETo estimation using
    the XGBoost-WOA model is a promising technique when there is a dearth of long-term
    historical or complete recent data. The combination of the kernel ELM model with
    K-means clustering and firefly algorithms (FFA) for monthly mean daily ETo prediction
    in the Poyang Lake basin of South China has been reported by Wu et al., 2021b,
    Wu et al., 2021a. The proposed model was benchmarked against other models such
    as ANFIS, RF, M5tree, and three well-known ML models. The performance of the FFA-KELM
    model was a bit better than that of the ANFIS model, but both models outperformed
    the RF and M5P models. Other applications of AI models in predicting and forecasting
    ETo include the use of Genetic Programming (GP) (Goci et al., 2015), Gaussian
    Process Regression (GPR) (Karbasi, 2018), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines
    (MARS) (Kisi, 2016), Group handling method (Ashrafzadeh et al., 2020), Gene-Expression
    Programming (GEP) (Gavili et al., 2017, Shiri et al., 2014, Shiri et al., 2012,
    Wang et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2016). Hybrid deep learning (Ahmed et al., 2022).
    1.3. Research motivation and objectives Although remarkable progress has been
    witnessed over the literature on developing versions of AI models for modeling
    ETo, some limitations are still associated with such a kind of theoretical model.
    For instance, machine learning (ML) algorithms like AI models behave differently
    from one region based on the physical meaning of the climate. On the other hand,
    using the data decomposition-based (complementary) models based on several hydrometeorological
    parameters to forecast evapotranspiration has received much attention. One of
    the requirements of these methods is to use the feature selection strategy to
    reduce unimportant components in the forecasting process, which could reduce the
    computational cost and enhance the accuracy of the forecasting procedure. Hence,
    the current research objective is the development of a powerful expert complementary
    system comprised of the MVMD decomposition scheme coupled with the ridge regression
    feature selection and three efficient ML approaches (i.e., BRT, KELM, and XGBoost)
    to forecast the daily ETo in three regions of India. Here, five important meteorological
    inputs, including the maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax, & Tmin, °C), relative
    humidity (RH, %), wind speed (Us, km/h), and solar radiation (Rs, MJ m−2 d−1)
    were simultaneously decomposed using MVMD pre-processing scheme. Then, after identifying
    the critical antecedent information (two first lags), the most significant decomposed
    components were utilized to feed the ML models for the multi-step ahead (t + 3,
    and t + 7) forecasting of the ETo in three regions of India. Several visual validation
    tools and statistical analysis were implemented to compare the performance of
    the complementary models and standalone counterpart models. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Study location and data acquisition In the present study, three stations,
    including i) Bathinda, ii) Ludhiana, and ii) Hisar, were considered for daily
    ETo forecasting using advanced ML techniques. The Bathinda and Ludhiana stations
    lie in Punjab State, and Hisar station lies in Haryana state (see Fig. 1). Furthermore,
    both the states are part of the Trans-Gangetic plain of India. Appendix A provides
    the latitude, longitude, altitude, agro-climatic region, and climatic data period.
    The study sites cover an area of 3385 km2 (Bathinda), 3767 km2 (Ludhiana), and
    3983 km2 (Hisar). The climate on study sites varies from semi-arid (Bathinda and
    Hisar) to sub-humid (Ludhiana) (Kumar et al., 2008, Niwas et al., 2006). On study
    sites, the maximum (hottest) temperature experienced in summer (28–48 °C at Bathinda,
    43–45 °C at Ludhiana, and 40–48 °C at Hisar), and minimum (coolest) through winter
    (4–21 °C at Bathinda, 0.6–5.8 °C at Ludhiana, and sub-zero to 6 °C at Hisar) (Sharma
    et al., 2021, Vishwakarma et al., 2022). The sites received an average annual
    rainfall of 436 mm at Bathinda (75% received during July to September), 528–680
    mm at Ludhiana (70% received during July to September), and 470–472 mm at Hisar
    (80% received during July to September), individually (Anurag et al., 2017, Majumder
    et al., 2020, Malik et al., 2021, Rawal et al., 2020). The daily weather data,
    i.e., maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax, & Tmin, °C), relative humidity (RH,
    %), wind speed (Us, km/h) (wind speed was measured using a cup anemometer placed
    at 3.5 m height in agrometeorology for Bathinda, Ludhiana & Hisar stations, and
    then adjusted to the standard height of 2 m above the ground surface using the
    procedure recommended by Allen et al., 1998a, Allen et al., 1998b), and solar
    radiation (Rs, MJ m−2 d−1) of 4-years for Bathinda was acquired from observatory
    installed at Jodhpur research farm of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Regional
    Research Station (RRS), Bathinda, for Ludhiana were collected from School of Climate
    Change, and Agrometeorology, PAU, Ludhiana, and for Hisar were obtained from CCSHAU
    (Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University), Hisar. All the three-weather
    observatories/stations are installed on the land surface (reference site conditions)
    for measuring the atmospheric conditions. After that, the obtained data of 4-years
    was partitioned into two sets: one for training, which consists of the year 2016–2018
    (1096 observations) for Bathinda & Ludhiana, and year 2011–2013 (1096 observations)
    for Hisar, whereas the second for testing comprises 365 observations (the year
    2019 for Bathinda & Ludhiana, and year 2014 for Hisar). Download : Download high-res

    studied sites. 2.2. Data quality and integrity assessment Generally, the quality
    and integrity of data are assessed using double-mass curve technique, which requires
    more than 30-years of record of many locations, but in our case the length of
    the data is 4-years in three locations which can be simply examined by doing the
    basic statistical analysis i.e., minimum, maximum, range, mean, standard (std.)
    deviation, skewness, kurtosis. Table 1 summarizes the statistical features of
    daily climatological data i.e., Tmin, Tmax, RH, Us, Rs, and ETo in training and
    testing phases. It can be clearly seen from Table 1 the skewness was positive
    and negative, while the kurtosis indicates the platykurtic and leptokurtic nature
    of climatic variables in training and testing stages. Similarly, the mean, and
    std. deviation values of Tmin, Tmax, RH, Us, Rs, and ETo variables are not have
    much variation in training and testing datasets which help in building the best
    possible models with less uncertainty in forecasting daily ETo at study sites.
    Fig. 2 demonstrates the original signals of the ETo for each station. Table 1.

    Penman-Monteith FAO-56 description The present study utilized the Penman-Monteith
    (PM) model of FAO-56 (Food and Agricultural Organization, Manual No. 56) for the
    computation of daily ETo at Bathinda, Hisar, and Ludhiana stations. Mathematically,
    the FAO-56 PM model is written as (Allen et al., 1998a, Allen et al., 1998b):
    (1) Here, ETo represents reference evapotranspiration (mm/day), denotes slope
    of saturation vapor pressure (kPa/°C), indicates net radiation (MJ/m²/day), designates
    soil heat flux density (MJ/m²/day), labels psychrometric constant (kPa/°C), represents
    the means air temperature (°C), signifies the wind speed at 2 m height above the
    ground surface (m/s), and calculated as , here, is the measured wind speed at
    z m above ground surface (m/s), and z is the height of measurement above ground
    surface (m) (Allen et al., 1998a, Allen et al., 1998b), and and are saturation
    and actual vapor pressures (kPa). The CROPWAT 8.0 software developed by the FAO
    (built & formulated FAO-56 PM model) was used to calculate the values of daily
    ETo and considered as the baseline data for the assessment of AI models in semi-arid
    and sub-humid climates. 2.4. Ridge regression feature selection Hoerl and Kennard
    (1970) introduced the Ridge regression modeling approach to deal with collinearity
    issues. The issue of multicollinearity or collinearity in terms of moderate, exact,
    complete and severe/supercollinearity collinearity exists amongst highly correlated
    regressors or predictors. The predictors used for daily ETo forecasting have a
    similar nature. In a set of κ-dimension predictors with N data points, each feature
    is standardized to have zero mean and a variance of 1. To give reliable estimates
    of features, the following cost function for ridge regression is applied (Fan
    and Li, 2020): (2) Where { } represents a random sample of the linear regression
    model whereby = and = ; and = ( , ,., ) are model parameters or regression coefficients;
    is a penalty term regulated by the ; while is the square loss term. The ridge-regression
    penalty term (aka L2 norm) is as follows: (3) The ridge regression penalty term
    shrinks the size of the regression coefficients whereby a multidimensional sphere
    represents the constraint region, hence for a solution, the elliptical contours
    can intersect anywhere on the sphere. As a successor algorithm of the ordinary
    least squares regression, the ridge regression overcomes the collinearity issues
    by penalizing the least-squares loss on the regression coefficients by a L2 penalty
    (Wu, 2020). 2.5. Multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) The MVMD was
    developed by Rehman and Aftab (2019), which is an advancement of the robust variational
    mode decomposition (VMD) (Dragomiretskiy and Zosso, 2014). In VMD, a one-dimensional
    predictor variable, , is decomposed into M amplitude-modulated-frequency modulated
    sub-signals called the band-limited intrinsic mode functions (BL-IMFs), (Dragomiretskiy
    and Zosso, 2014). Hence, the signal can be reconstructed in least square sense
    by summing up the M BL-IMFs (i.e., ) as follow: (4) The MVMD advances this approach
    to multivariate signals. For instance, for a matrix of k multivariate signals
    , the MVMD extracts m multivariate BL-IMFs where . The alternating direction method
    of multipliers (ADMM) approach is applied to resolve the optimization of variational
    modes in the Fourier domain (Rehman and Aftab, 2019). This approach yields an
    optimal set of multivariate decomposed signals with matching center frequencies
    and narrow bandwidths present in all multivariate signals (Rehman and Aftab, 2019).
    The MVMD has the following features that make it a superior multivariate decomposition
    tool; a) splits the multivariate modulated frequencies that otherwise would not
    be possible with multivariate data set; b) mode alignment ability of multivariate
    signals; c) robustness to noise; and d) quasi-orthogonality across decomposed
    signals (Gavas et al., 2020, ur Rehman and Aftab, 2019). For more information
    on MVMD, readers can refer to (Rehman and Aftab, 2019). 2.6. Boosted regression
    tree (BRT) The BRT is a non-parametric model beneficial for data mining since
    it does not assume any prior knowledge about the connection between independent
    and dependent variables (Saha et al., 2021). BRT is a model that combines regression
    trees with boosting (Friedman, 2001). This model is one of the various ways to
    enhance the performance of a single model through multiple independent models
    (Faskari et al., 2022). BRT is a hybrid approach that combines two techniques:
    ( ) CART regression tree and ( ) the development and integration of a series of
    models using the boosting technique. In comparison to a single model, this method
    produces more accurate and robust models. BRT addresses the single decision tree''s
    primary shortcoming, which is a rather poor match. BRT generates just the initial
    tree from the whole training set; the remaining data from the original tree is
    used to construct the succeeding trees (Elith et al., 2008). Boosting procedures
    are used to increase the regression tree''s predictive power. This method is similar
    to model averaging. The averaged results of numerous models are employed, except
    that the boosting operation is a step-by-step process in which models are fitted
    to a subset of the training dataset in each iteration step. However, this demands
    the inclusion of additional tress ( ) to the model (Carty et al., 2015). This
    approach offers many advantages, including the ability to evaluate huge amounts
    of data quickly and is less susceptible to model overfitting (Westreich et al.,
    2010). Fig. 3a illustrates the framework of the BRT method. Download : Download

    KELM model. 2.7. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) The XGBoost modeling approach
    was initially proposed by Friedman (2001) and later developed by Chen and Guestrin
    (2016). It is an efficient implementation of regression trees that incorporates
    boosting to an ensemble of regression trees (Naganna et al., 2020). Each tree
    is generated independently with respective self-governing binary rules terminating
    at the nodes having continuous scores. The mapping of respective trees is carried
    out during the training process to fit the training samples, and the final output
    is an aggregation of scores at corresponding nodes. The output function ( ) of
    the total ‘T′ number of the tree is calculated as follows (Chen and Guestrin,
    2016): (5) where is the generated tree, and is the newly created tree model. The
    trees in the XGBoost model are determined through minimization of a regularized
    objective function (Chen and Guestrin, 2016): (6) where g represents a differentiable
    convex loss function, which computes the difference between and in which is the
    mapping result and is the observed output values. The and represents two coefficients
    while represents the number of nodes/leaves in the respective th tree and is the
    scores vector of respective th tree nodes. During model training, an iterative
    process is used to add respective trees in each separate iteration. Then a greedy
    algorithm is utilized to iteratively add splits to the tree beginning from the
    solitary tree. The regularization term, as shown in Eq. (6) penalizes the complexity
    of the ensemble model to avoid overfitting, for this normalization is used in
    the objective function. In addition, shrinkage and column subsampling is also
    employed further to reduce overfitting (Yu et al., 2020). This modeling approach
    has been found to have better predictive performance than solitary tree modeling
    techniques (Yu et al., 2020). Here, XGBoost model was performed using XGBoost
    library on Python environment and main significant tuning parameter to adjust
    the XGBoost model are N_Estimation, Max-Depth, Learning rate, and child_weight
    (Singh et al., 2022). The schematic flowchart of the XGBoost is illustrates in
    Fig. 3b. 2.8. Kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) The extreme learning machine
    (ELM) was built to train single hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFN) quickly
    (Huang et al., 2006). Input weights and hidden biases can be assigned randomly
    in ELM (Araba et al., 2021). Despite this, global approximation features of SLFN
    networks trained using the ELM technique have been established. The randomly assigned
    network hidden layer parameters, on the other hand, add to the instability of
    the analytical conclusions derived using the ELM model. KELM is an extension of
    ELM; however, the feature mapping in ELM has been replaced with a kernel matrix,
    which results in a technique with greater stability and accuracy than ELM (Huang
    et al., 2011). Different kernel functions, such as the linear, polynomial, and
    radial basis, can be employed to solve various issues in KELM. SLFN may be demonstrated
    as follows (Huang et al., 2011): (7) where is the input sample and as well as
    denote the hidden layer feature mapping matrix, respectively, and is the weight
    between the hidden and output layers. The weight in ELM may be computed using
    the following equation: (8) Where is the penalty factor or regularization coefficient
    that is used to balance the empirical and structural risk of KELM, is the unit
    matrix, and is the target matrix. Thus, ELM may be stated simply as: (9) The kernel
    function is added in KELM to replace the hidden layer''s feature mapping . As
    a result, Eq. (6) is expressed as follows: (10) is a kernel matrix defined as
    follows: (11) The Gaussian kernel function, which is the most often utilized,
    is presented in the following equation: (12) Additionally, the KELM-based model
    optimizes only two hyperparameters, and (kernel parameter), by utilizing the grid
    search approach. The KELM method''s structure is depicted in Fig. 3c. 2.9. Validation
    and assessment of proposed models The capability and prediction accuracy of proposed
    KELM, BRT, and XGBoost models, as well as their combination with MVVMD, were evaluated
    and compared using the goodness of fit values and statistical errors such as correlation
    coefficient (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), Willmott''s agreement Index (IA)
    (Willmott et al., 2012), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient
    of uncertainty with a 95% confidence level ( ) and Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency
    coefficient (NSE) (Ahmadianfar et al., 2020, Rehamnia et al., 2021). Nevertheless,
    all the performance indictors should not principally be utilized to compare model
    accuracy at geographically different locations. Thus, we used two additional performance
    indicators IA and . The IA tackles the insensitivity issues as the differences
    between the observed and forecasted data are not squared where the differences
    are substituted by the ratio of the mean squared error in calculations (Kanti
    et al., 2021, Willmott, 1982, Willmott et al., 2012): (13) ̅ ̅ ̅ ̅ (14) (15) ̅
    ̅ (16) (17) ̅ (18) where is the forecasted evapotranspiration value and is the
    observed evapotranspiration value. ̅ is the average of the forecasted results.
    ̅ is the average of observed evapotranspiration values. N denotes the total number
    of samples collected. denotes the standard deviation of estimation error. A perfect
    model''s Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) is one (NSE = 1). NSE = 0 indicates that
    the model has the same predictive ability as the time series mean. When the observed
    mean exceeds the model''s prediction, the efficiency is less than zero (NSE< 0)
    (McCuen et al., 2006). It should be emphasized that a perfect model has R, & IA
    = 1 and RMSE, MAPE, & U95% = 0. 3. Model development 3.1. Dataset pre-processing
    and feature selection procedure In this research work, three newly hybridized
    models, such as MVMD-RR-KELM, MVMD-RR-BRT, and MVMD-RR-XGBoost were created in
    MATLAB R2020a and Python programming languages for multi-step forecasting the
    daily ETo in three locations (i.e., Bathinda, Hisar, and Ludhiana) in India. It
    is to be noted that the XGBoost model was designed in a Python environment using
    the open-source software library. In contrast, MVMD and KELM, and BRT models were
    constructed in a MATLAB environment. Adding to this, the BRT method adopted the
    “fitrensemble” learner function. Besides, the RR feature selection model was implemented
    in Python via Scikit-learn open library (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Execution of
    these models was carried out on Intel(R) Core (TM) i7–6700, CPU series 2.40 GHz,
    and 16 G RAM. Fig. 4 shows the schematic diagram of the proposed modeling approach
    to forecast multi-step evapotranspiration in three regions of India. Further steps
    of the model development are described in detail as follows: Download : Download

    multi-step daily forecasting of ETo using the multivariate decomposition-based
    intelligent models and their standalone counterpart. Step 1: Extraction of significant
    antecedent information At this step, the correlation of antecedent time-lagged
    input data (i.e., Tmin, Tmax, RH, Us, and Rs) with ETo was determined with the
    help of the cross-correlation function. The results confirmed that the two first
    lags (i.e., t-1 and t-2) for horizons of (t + 3) and (t + 7), for all three stations,
    based on the trial and error approach appeared to be statistically the most important
    and significant, influencing the forecasting accuracy of the models. Thus, the
    significant lags at (t − 1) and (t - 2) were used to forecast the daily ETo in
    all regions. Step 2: Decomposition of significant input lags via MVMD technique
    This is the primary pre-processing step of the proposed newly hybrid modeling
    approach. The MVMD method is applied to demarcate each input time series simultaneously
    at (t + 3) and (t + 7) time horizons. The MVMD approach is more efficient due
    to simultaneously decomposing input features than the VMD method. The decomposed
    signals of each input are comprised of the IMFs and residuals. The number of modes
    in this study has been optimized by adopting the trial-and-error process. For
    Bathinda station, the number of (K=3 modes) for each input has been considered,
    whereas Hisar and Ludhiana stations, these numbers are K = 8 at both (t + 1) and
    (t + 7), respectively. Appendix B shows the parameters setting of the MVMD pre-processing
    procedure for all three stations. For Bathinda station, the total number of decomposed
    factors (IMFs + residuals) is 40, while these decomposed components for Hisar
    and Ludhiana stations are acquired as IMFs + residuals = 90 (total). Step 3: Feature
    selection using RR method Determining the best feature is a critical step in designing
    an ML-based model. Feature selection is advantageous because it reduces the computational
    complexity and the reduction of dimensionality to enhance the accuracy and foster
    better interpretability (Bennasar et al., 2015, Maier et al., 2010). The RR technique
    was used to determine the crucial components for ETo forecasting at both (t + 1)
    and (t + 7) scales. The RR feature selection strategy is based on the important
    concept of ridge regression theory. All the decomposed signals by MVMD were examined
    in the RR technique to filter/select/determine the important features which can
    reduce cost and computational time. Fig. 5 showed the selection procedure via
    the RR approach to filter out the unimportant features for each component in the
    understudy regions. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Feature selection procedure via the ridge regression approach
    to unimportant filter features to feed the ML models. According to Fig. 5, the
    number of filtered features for Bathinda station is 14 and 17 at (t + 3) and (t
    + 7) time step while the number of unimportant/remained features are 26 and 23,
    respectively. On the other hand, the total filtered/selected features are 47 and
    43 for the time horizon at (t + 3) and (t + 7), respectively, in the Hisar station.
    The features which are remaining unimportant turns out to be 43 (t + 3) and 47
    (t + 7)-time scale. For Ludhiana station, the filtered decomposed features = 17
    with remaining features = 73 at (t + 3) whereas these filtered features = 29 and
    remaining = 61 at (t + 7) respectively. The results of steps 3 are also summarized
    in Appendix B. The results of the feature selection process (i.e., RR) in filtering
    the IMFs+residuals show that the reduction percentage is approximately 35% and
    42.2% for Bathinda station, 52.20% and 44.40% for Hisar station while 18.88% and
    32.22% for Ludhiana station to forecast daily ETo at (t + 3) and (t + 7) respectively.
    Step 4: Preparations of models feeding All the decomposed components are used
    as the input to directly feed the ML models after filtering by RR feature selection.
    In the case of machine learning (ML) models application, there is no hard and
    fast rule for splitting the dataset into training (calibration) and testing (validation)
    periods, it is based on the author''s choice, availability, and length of data.
    Generally, for training 60–80% of data, and for testing 20–40% of data of the
    entire dataset length is used (Barzegar et al., 2019, Deo et al., 2017). In the
    current case, the 4-years data obtained from the pre-processing stages were divided
    into training subset (= 1093 and 1090 for the horizons of t + 3 and t + 7, respectively)
    and testing subset (= 364 and 363 for the horizons of t + 3 and t + 7, respectively)
    with a ratio of 75–25% to design ETo forecasting AI-based models. Moreover, the
    cross-validation or any data random sampling cannot be adopted as time-series
    data by definition occur in a temporal order/sequence and this order or sequence
    must be preserved in order to keep the structure of the series intact (Bergmeir
    and Benítez, 2012). Here, three robust ML techniques were employed: XGBoost, BRT,
    and KELM. The normalization and denormalization process of training and testing
    sets were also adopted to unify the data scale and increase the convergence speed
    of the models. Since the main objective of this research study is to examine and
    explore the effect of the pre-processing procedure on improving the forecasting
    accuracy of daily ETo, it is crucial to benchmark the performance of the proposed
    hybrid models with the state-of-the-art standalone models. Thus, to design the
    standalone models, it is required to ignore steps 2 and 3 and directly use the
    information related to the lags at (t + 3) and (t + 7) of the input time series.
    Notably, the features number in each standalone model in both horizons is 10 for
    all three study stations. 3.2. Setting and tuning parameter optimization One of
    the most critical tasks in constructing the forecasting methods based on ML models
    is to adjust the tuning and pruning of parameters connected with these ML models
    to attain optimum accuracy (Rehamnia et al., 2020). Different techniques were
    utilized to fine-tune the parameters to obtain optimum ML models. The list consists
    of metaheuristic optimization algorithms (Jamei et al., 2021), grid search (Shahsavar
    et al., 2021), random search, and manual search methods (trial and error strategy)
    (Xia et al., 2017), etc. The grid search methodology was utilized to get the optimum
    parameters based on RMSE as a convergence criterion. Appendix C (standalone models)
    and Appendix D (hybrid models) display the details on setting up the parameters
    during the multi-step forecasting of daily ETo. The parameters used to design
    the XGBoost model are N_Estimation, Max-Depth, Learning rate, and child_weight.
    The BRT model utilizes Learning rate, MaxNumSplits, and NumLearningCycles, while
    the number of parameters for KLM is two: Regularization coefficient and kernel
    parameter. The comprehensive details on fine tuning of these parameters are provided
    in the Appendix C and D during the optimum performance of the standalone models
    as well as hybridized models for all study regions. 4. Application results and
    analysis In this study, three standalone (KELM, BRT, & XGBoost) and three hybrids
    (MVMD-RR-KELM, MVMD-RR-BRT, & MVMD-RR-XGBoost) complementary AI models were employed
    for multi-scale ahead (i.e., t + 3, and t + 7 days) forecasting of ETo in semi-arid
    (Bathinda & Hisar) and sub-humid (Ludhiana) climates. The developed complementary
    AI models were trained (1096 data) and tested (365 data) using daily climatic
    data of Tmax, Tmin, RH, Us, and Rs. Their predictive accuracy was evaluated using
    goodness-of-fit metrics (R, RMSE, MAPE, NSE, IA, U95%) and through graphical interpretation
    (scatter plots, Taylor diagram, residual plots, uncertainty plot, & temporal plots).
    The complementary AI model with minimum values of RMSE, MAPE, U95%, and maximum
    R, NSE, and IA in the testing phase will be considered optimal for multi-scale
    ahead forecasting of ETo. The obtained results are discussed in the following
    sub-sequent sections: 4.1. Application of AI models at study sites Table 2 outlined
    the training and testing results of standalone and hybrid AI models for t + 3,
    and t + 7 days ahead foresting of ETo at Bathinda (semi-arid region). The forecasting
    accuracy for training period can be seen in Table 2. For t + 3-day forecasting,
    the highest values of R, NSE, IA, and U95% are 0.949, 0.899, 0.974, and 1.379
    respectively and the lowest values of RMSE = 0.497 mm/day, and MAPE = 13.537%
    during the testing yielded by MVMD-RR-XGBoost model. Similarly, for t + 7, these
    values are [R = 0.938, NSE = 0.874, IA = 0.968, U95% = 1.538, RMSE = 0.555, MAPE
    = 17.006%] produced by MVMD-RR-XGBoost model. These assessment metrics for benchmark
    comparing models can be seen in Table 2. Table 2 shows that the hybrid complementary
    AI models produced better forecasts than standalone models. Also, the superior
    forecasting was attained by the hybrid MVMD-RR-KELM against comparing models for
    t + 3, and t + 7 forecasting horizons. Therefore, the rank of models was assigned
    based on their testing performance as MVMD-RR-KELM>MVMD-RR-XGBoost>MVMD-RR-BRT>XGBoost>KELM>BRT
    to forecast ETo in both horizons. Table 2. Goodness-of-fit metrics of forecasting

    by the complementary AI models are given Table 3. As observed from Table 3 the
    performance metrics are: MVMD-RR-KELM [R = 0.972, NSE = 0.944, IA = 0.986, and
    U95% = 1.364, RMSE = 0.494 mm/day, MAPE = 12.299%] for t + 3 day ahead forecasting
    of ETo. Likewise, for t + 7 days ahead, the MVMD-RR-KELM model appeared to be
    the best by acquiring the highest values of R, NSE, IA, U95%, and lowest magnitudes
    of RMSE, and MAPE error metrics. Please refer to the Table 3 for more details.
    The complementary MVMD-RR-KELM model produced better outcomes than the other models
    at both timescales. Also, the proposed models follow the same ranking order as

    Appendix E, F and G demonstrate the scatter plots of KELM, BRT, XGBoost, MVMD-RR-KELM,
    MVMD-RR-BRT, and MVMD-RR-XGBoost models for t + 3, and t + 7 days ahead ETo forecasting
    during training and testing phases at Bathinda, Hisar, and Ludhiana stations,
    respectively. The blue circle represents the training dataset, and the red circle
    signifies the testing dataset. Both periods'' datasets were plotted against the
    measured ETo concerning the best fit line (solid black line). Also, the relative
    error bands of 30% (dash-dot lines) were added about the best fit line for checking
    the distribution pattern of data. It is clearly noted that the MVMD-RR-KELM model
    outcomes concentrate more towards the best fit within the relative error bands
    or less amount of diffusion than the other applied AI models for t + 3 and t + 7
    days ahead ETo forecasting at three study locations. Also, the scatter plots confirm
    the forecasting superiority of the KELM model enhanced with the MVMD-RR technique
    in semi-arid and sub-humid climates. Fig. 6 shows the Taylor diagram of measured
    and forecasted ETo values on t + 3, and t + 7 days ahead on Bathinda, Hisar, and
    Ludhiana using KELM, BRT, XGBoost, MVMD-RR-KELM, MVMD-RR-BRT, and MVMD-RR-XGBoost
    models during testing. Taylor diagram (Taylor, 2001) is a set of three statistical
    measures, including standard deviation ( ), RMSE, and R in a polar coordinate
    system. A model with minimum value std, & RMSE, and maximum value of R is considered
    optimal. Another way to judge the model accuracy is if the test field is close
    to the reference field is marked as the best model. Fig. 6 test fields are KELM,
    BRT, XGBoost, MVMD-RR-KELM, MVMD-RR-BRT, MVMD-RR-XGBoost models, and the reference
    field is measured ETo represented by the red circle on the x-axis. These figures
    clearly show the MVMD-RR-KELM model is close to the measured ETo for both horizons
    at all three study sites. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download :

    residual errors are lowest (within ± 2.0 to ± 2.5 for t + 3 days, and ± 3.0 for
    t + 7 days) of the MVMD-RR-KELM model at study locations. Overall, evaluation
    of results indicates that the MVMD-RR-KELM model provides the best ETo forecast
    on 3 and 7 days ahead, closely followed by the MVMD-RR-XGBoost model under in

    of the testing phase of the KELM, BRT, XGBoost, MVMD-RR-KELM, MVMD-RR-BRT, and
    MVMD-RR-XGBoost models on three and seven days are compared in Fig. 8 in terms
    of uncertainty analysis at Bathinda, Hisar, and Ludhiana stations. These uncertainty
    plots of semi-arid and sub-humid climates proved that the MVMD-RR-KELM model is
    more accurate than other proposed models for multi-scale daily ETo forecasting
    with Tmax, Tmin, RH, Us, and Rs climatic variables. Similarly, the temporal variation
    of ETo measured (dash-dot black line) and forecasted values of 3 and 7 days are
    plotted in Appendix H only for MVMD-RR-KELM (dash-dot red line), MVMD-RR-BRT (dash-dot
    green line), and MVMD-RR-XGBoost (dash-dot blue line) models during testing. Appendix
    H clearly reveals that the ETo forecast of the MVMD-RR-KELM model is close to
    the measured ETo for both horizons in semi-arid and sub-humid climates. Additionally,
    by considering the statistical measures and uncertainty plots it was also detected
    that when the forecasting shifted from t + 3 to t + 7 days, it indicates a slight
    reduction in performance of the MVMD-RR-KELM model. This reflection led to future
    development research and boosted the proposed models for weekly and monthly scale
    ETo forecasting. Granata and Di Nunno (2021) recommended that the deep learning-based
    models provide better ETo predictions for 1–7 days ahead in south Florida and
    central Nevada. They also noted a slight reduction in the performance of deep
    learning models for 7 days ETo predictions. In our study, based on the performance
    indicators it was noted that the obtained results of the ML models are slightly
    reduced on the t + 7 horizon than the t + 3 horizon for all sites and agreed with
    Granata and Di Nunno (2021) findings. Thus, the applied ML-based models are more
    viable for t + 3 horizon forecasting at study sites. In addition, the weather
    station density on a spatial scale does not affect the performance of the employed
    ML models (i.e., KELM, BRT, XGBoost, MVMD-RR-KELM, MVMD-RR-BRT, and MVMD-RR-XGBoost)
    because these models are classified as “Lumped” means treat the region/area as
    a single unit. They provide no information about the spatial distribution of inputs
    and outputs and simulate only the gross response of the region/area (Dawson and
    Wilby, 2001). Download : Download high-res image (345KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Uncertainty of both horizons to forecast the ETo on three study
    sites. Evapotranspiration is a complex environmental process, affected by many
    climate parameters. In the past half-century, the major influencing factor was
    climate change. A variety of models exits for ETo estimation, namely combination,
    radiation, mass transfer, water budget, and temperature-based. All these models
    are site-specific, and not valid for all regions and climates (Gao et al., 2017).
    The FAO-56 PM model is more precise and widely adopted for ETo estimation, but
    it needs more data, which is unavailable in developing countries (Tikhamarine
    et al., 2019, Tikhamarine et al., 2020a). Hence, building a reliable and robust
    paramount model is the demand of the current scenario to reduce water losses and
    wastages by filling the gaps between water application and crop water requirements
    and improving crop productivity and agricultural practices. Nowadays, this issue
    has been tackled by the AI/ ML (machine learning) models and received a massive
    application for ETo forecasting in different climates over the globe (Granata,
    2019, Granata et al., 2020, Malik et al., 2019, Sharma et al., 2021, Tikhamarine
    et al., 2020b, Tikhamarine et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2021b). Hence, the outcomes
    of the proposed AI models in the present study were standardized with the existed
    studies on ETo forecasting using ML (standalone and hybrid) models (Kaya et al.,
    2021, Kisi et al., 2021, Maroufpoor et al., 2020). Adnan et al., 2021a, Adnan
    et al., 2021b estimated monthly ETo at Dhaka and Mymensing stations of Bangladesh
    using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and their hybrid, i.e., ANFIS-WCA
    (water cycle algorithm), ANFIS-MFO (moth-flame optimization algorithm), and ANFIS-WCAMFO
    models. Perusal of results reveal superiority of ANFIS-WCAMFO model (RMSE = 0.220/0.275 mm/month,
    NSE = 0.943/0.893) over ANFIS (RMSE = 0.259/0.314 mm/month, NSE = 0.922/0.865),
    ANFIS-WCA (RMSE = 0.252/0.312 mm/month, NSE = 0.926/0.865), and ANFIS-MFO (RMSE
    = 0.241/0.291 mm/month, NSE = 0.932/0.887) models at Dhaka/Mymensing stations
    in testing phase. Ahmadi et al. (2021) compared the results of the hybrid AI model,
    i.e., SVR-IWD (support vector regression-intelligent water drops) against the
    SVR, GEP (gene expression programming), HS (Hargreaves-Samani), and PT (Priestley-Taylor)
    models for estimating monthly ETo in semi-arid and arid climates of Iran. They
    found hybrid SVR-IWD model outperformed the other AI models in both environments.
    The above-reported state-of-arts also confirms the better feasibility of hybrid
    AI models for ETo estimation in different climates. Furthermore, many AI models
    are sensitive to outliers and need to be optimized properly by tuning their parameters.
    The proposed MVMD-RR-KELM model is very strong to outliers and has good generalization
    ability than other AI models. So, it is anticipated that the MVMD-RR-KELM model
    can provide better forecasts of ETo for three and seven days ahead on study locations.
    Henceforth, the obtained results of the hybrid MVMD-RR-KELM model explore its
    capability in forecasting ETo in semi-arid and sub-humid climates and marked as
    a more robust, reliable, and dynamic model. In addition, this way of ETo forecasting
    will help in maintaining agricultural operations with the available water resources
    on a regional scale and handle the issue of increasing water stress in agriculture
    due to climate change. 5. Conclusion The precise forecasting of ETo is crucial
    for managing field scale-based agriculture. These days, AI techniques are excellent
    tools for constructing forecasting models. The present research investigates the
    feasibility of a newly proposed hybrid AI model, i.e., MVMD-RR-KELM against the
    KELM, BRT, XGBoost, MVMD-RR-BRT, & MVMD-RR-XGBoost models for three and seven
    days ahead ETo forecasting in semi-arid and sub-humid climatic zones. The goodness-of-fit
    metrics and visual inspection were employed to check the proposed AI models''
    forecasting accuracy (standalone & hybrid). Appraisal of results based on goodness-of-fit
    indicators reveals that the KELM model integrated with the MVMD-RR algorithm (MVMD-RR-KELM)
    outperformed the KELM, BRT, XGBoost, MVMD-RR-BRT, & MVMD-RR-XGBoost models for
    both horizons ETo forecasting at study locations. Additionally, better outcomes
    of the MVMD-RR-KELM model were found for t + 3 horizon ETo forecasting, and a
    slight reduction in accuracy of AI models was noted for t + 7 horizon ETo forecasting
    in both climates. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy of the MVMD-RR-KELM model
    improved remarkably. Comprehensively, the findings of this study are immensely
    significant to develop a smart intelligence system for precisely forecasting daily
    ETo and accordingly scheduling irrigation plans for the protection of available
    water resources in the study regions. This study is limited with the three stations
    of two states (i.e., Punjab and Haryana) of India. The obtained results cannot
    generalize the capability and accuracy of employed machine learning models for
    other climatic conditions/zones in the world. So, it is recommended that the aerial
    extension (i.e., India versus other countries with different environmental conditions)
    need to be analyzed and confirms the feasibility of the applied machine learning
    models. Therefore, future research will include more stations from different locations
    across the globe to overcome this difficulty and make generalized conclusions
    about the efficacy of the machine learning models. In addition, the geospatial
    technique will be considered for projecting the impact of reference evapotranspiration
    on a spatial scale. Furthermore, the different percentage of training and testing
    datasets will be considered to strengthen the predictability of applied ML models
    against the other ML (i.e., simple & hybrid) models for future studies. Funding

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam SECTION I. Introduction
    In recent years, global problems, such as world hunger, wars, etc., have promoted
    the development of agriculture. Agriculture development has become essential and
    more urgent than ever, especially in an agriculture-dependent country like Vietnam.
    Effective farming, which aims to achieve high productivity and efficient resource
    usage, has become an interesting topic and attracted the attention of both industry
    and academia. Moreover, smart irrigation is an interdisciplinary topic aiming
    to automatically irrigate plants with a minimal amount of water but still guarantee
    the growth of plants and crop yield during harvest seasons by applying information
    technology in agriculture. Moreover, several major farming regions in Vietnam
    face a lack of fresh water, which is a consequence of several natural problems,
    such as drought, soil salinization, and global warming. D. H. Ha et al. analyzed
    the need for water savings in Vietnam’s agriculture in [1] . Therefore, building
    a smart irrigation system, which can autonomously schedule the irrigation plan,
    and minimize water consumption but still guarantee crop production, has become
    essential. Several works [2] , [3] have proposed methods to automate this irrigation
    process based on soil moisture information. A straightforward approach to controlling
    soil moisture is to apply some rules, such as starting the irrigation process
    when the soil humidity is below a threshold or at a fixed time frame daily, etc.
    However, this approach cannot adapt the system’s policies when the environmental
    factors change, such as the demands of plants on soil moisture are various at
    different crop stages or with different kinds of plants, etc. In another way,
    AI-based works usually make assumptions about the rightness of farmers’ irrigation
    behaviors and try to mimic these experiences based on historical data [2] . However,
    the farmers’ decisions may tend to over-irrigate, leading to a waste of freshwater
    resources and soil erosion [4] or under-irrigate, leading to reduce the final
    crop yield. Another disadvantage of this approach is that it cannot autonomously
    adapt to environmental changes and requires the interventions of farmers or experts
    to adjust its wrong predictions. This paper aims to propose a simple, novel method
    for irrigation scheduling problem, which initially mimics the farmers’ experiences
    and, after that, autonomously improve itself based on the responses from the environment.
    Moreover, unlike reinforcement-learning or model-based approaches, our method
    is semi-supervised learning and does not require several trial-error processes
    to find an optimal policy, which is time-consuming and impractical in production
    environments. In this paper, we proposed a semi-supervised learning method, which
    means that our method can automatically change its behaviors based on environmental
    responses without the intervention of farmers during the irrigation process. Moreover,
    our method is light-weight, simple, and does not require running intensive computations.
    The remaining sections are organized as follows. Section II describes related
    works. Section III describes our system architecture and deployment. Then, Section
    IV describes the conventional supervised-learning irrigation method and our proposed
    method. In Section V , we describe our experiments’ environment and results. Finally,
    Section VI consists of concluding remarks and our future work. SECTION II. Related
    Work There were several works using sensor systems to control the irrigation process
    autonomously. The previous irrigation scheduling methods can be categorized into
    two classes, namely evapotranspiration-based methods and soil moisture-based methods.
    Regarding evapotranspiration-based methods, researchers estimated the evapotranspiration
    rate or water consumption rate based on environmental features. In [5] , Howell
    et al. analyzed the relationships between crop production and evapotranspiration
    rate. After that, several works [6] – [8] based on estimated evapotranspiration
    rate and weather forecasts to suggest suitable irrigation plans. However, these
    methods usually make some impractical assumptions to estimate the evapotranspiration
    rate. Additionally, improving the accuracy of this estimated variable has still
    been a challenging problem. In another way, several works [2] , [9] – [14] based
    on the soil moisture sensors to evaluate the current status of soil and propose
    an optimal irrigation time. D. C. Trinh et al. in [9] proposed an autonomous irrigation
    system based on LoRA protocol to transmit data from sensor nodes to a concentrator.
    Moreover, their system’s irrigation policies were based on heuristic rules with
    soil moisture information. Therefore, they were impractical or unable to adapt
    to concept drift problems. In another approach, several works built machine learning
    models based on the experiences of farmers or suggestions of agriculturists to
    schedule the irrigation time. These works were mainly categorized into two types:
    supervised-learning schema [2] , [15] , [16] and model-based methods [3] , [17]
    , [18] . Regarding the supervised-learning approach, researchers trained a prediction
    model to estimate irrigation time or water volume based on the historical data.
    However, these methods were unadaptable to environmental changes or required human
    interventions to adjust the system manually. To overcome this drawback of supervised-learning
    schema, model-based methods were proposed with adaptability by evaluating the
    environment’s responses and autonomously improving itself. Nevertheless, these
    kinds of methods depended on the reliability of simulation to evaluate their policies.
    Especially, the previous open-source simulators for agriculture had limited configurations
    that made the conditions of some specific regions cannot be simulated correctly.
    Moreover, running several trial-error steps on simulators can consume a lot of
    computational resources, which makes it impractical in the production environment.
    Unlike previous works, we will propose a semi-supervised learning method to overcome
    these practical drawbacks of both conventional supervised learning and model-based
    methods. Remarkably, our proposed method can autonomously change its irrigation
    policies with the changes in environments by considering the responding soil moisture
    after executing irrigation decisions. Besides that, our algorithm is light-weight
    and does not require running expensive simulation stages. SECTION III. System
    Architecture and Deployment 1) Abstract Design In this section, we will briefly
    describe our system architecture. Figure 1 depicts the abstract design of our
    system. Our irrigation system will directly connect to a sensor network of an
    environmental monitoring system. Particularly, the system has three major working
    flows: Thread 1: The data from the environmental sensors will be periodically
    collected, aggregated at edge stations, and sent to a remote central system. Our
    system serves not only an irrigation application but also multiple applications,
    such as environmental monitoring dashboards, crop management applications, etc.
    Therefore, the data will be sent to a topic of a Kafka module to serve for different
    applications. Regarding our irrigation application, we use a Spark [19] cluster
    to subscribe to the related topic, pull data from the Kafka module, and pre-process
    them before storing them in a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Thread 2:
    In this flow, our application will load historical data from the HDFS, train a
    new model, and send this model to an MLflow [20] tracking server. Moreover, MLflow
    is a machine learning monitoring tool, which aims to manage, monitor, and standardize
    the developing pipeline of machine learning models. Therefore, we use this tool
    to manage our experiments. Thread 3: The application will suggest a suitable irrigation
    plan based on environmental information. This decision will be sent to remote
    stations to execute the irrigation decision. 2) System Deployment This paper collects
    data from an environmental monitoring sensor system deployed at a garden in Dong
    Thap Province, Vietnam. The garden, which is mainly planted with mangoes, has
    a rectangular-like area of about 5000 m 2 . Figure 2 roughly illustrates how we
    deploy the sensor system. In particular, we deploy six soil sensors to monitor
    land parameters, such as moisture, temperature, pH, etc. These soil features will
    be accumulated and pre-processed by a station every five minutes. We also deploy
    water sensors near an irrigation motor to monitor the motor’s status, flow rate,
    and water quality parameters. SECTION IV. Irrigation Scheduling Algorithms In
    this section, we will describe an autonomous irrigation method based on the conventional
    supervised learning schema and our proposed adaptive irrigation methods. A. Conventional
    Supervised Learning Method The conventional irrigation algorithm is described
    in Algorithm 1 . In this kind of approach, at the initial stage, irrigation experiences
    will be extracted from farmers’ activity logs or manually labeled by agriculturists.
    Then, a supervised learning model will be trained based on this dataset. The supervised
    model can be a regression or classification model to predict suitable irrigation
    plans. At the deployment stage, the algorithm predicts a suitable irrigation time
    based on the current environmental data for examples the soil moisture is below
    a humidity threshold, or the soil temperature is too high, etc. This threshold
    can be a fixed value or adjusted over time. The prediction will be sent to farmers’
    devices, and they will decide to adjust or apply this prediction. The farmers’
    decisions will be assigned as new labels for the related environmental samples.
    The supervised model will be periodically retrained with the new dataset. This
    approach was described in several previous works [2] , [21] . A typical problem
    of this approach is that it still requires the involvement of humans in the irrigation
    process, which leads to an increase in the system operating costs. Another drawback
    of this method is that human decisions tend to over-irrigate leading to waste
    of fresh water, which has recently emerged as a remarkable issue in agriculture
    sustainability, especially in Vietnam. Fig. 1 The abstract design of our system
    Show All Fig. 2 The deployment of our sensor system Show All B. Adaptive Method
    1) A Naive Approach Aiming to adapt the autonomous irrigation system to the change
    in environments, we propose a novel algorithm as in Algorithm 2 . Especially,
    different from Algorithm 1 , our proposed algorithm will base on the change of
    soil moisture after executing the irrigation decision to adjust the wrong decision.
    A decision is determined as being wrong if its related soil response is out of
    a pre-defined bound. Then, the prediction model will be updated if some conditions
    are satisfied, such as a number of making wrong decisions is larger than a threshold,
    etc. Algorithm 1 Conventional irrigation scheduling method. Show All 2) A Practical
    Approach Although Algorithm 2 considers the environment’s responses, the irrigation
    policies are only updated after a retraining step. To overcome this problem, we
    propose a practical version of the above algorithm in Algorithm 3 . Moreover,
    instead of running the prediction model to suggest a suitable irrigation time,
    we store the previous samples in a database. We will extract the related prediction
    of old samples for each incoming sample, and the trained model only predicts new
    ones. Furthermore, because the incoming features are continuous values and sparse,
    which can reduce the prediction model’s performance, we assume that rounding the
    incoming environmental features will not affect the rightness of decisions of
    the system. Therefore, the incoming samples will be rounded before being stored
    in the database. Finally, the prediction model is only updated after a fixed period
    or a number of wrong decisions. Algorithm 2 A naive adaptive irrigation scheduling
    method. Show All C. Irrigation time prediction model In the irrigation time prediction
    problem, data collection is time-consuming, making it impractical to collect a
    large number of data samples for training a single strong model. Therefore, we
    chose the ensemble learning method as a pertinent approach for the prediction
    model. In particular, we train three weak base models with a cross-validation
    schema. Then, we use these base models to predict samples of the original dataset
    and build a new dataset by adding these predictions as new features to the original
    dataset. Finally, a meta-model is trained based on this new dataset. Figure 3
    depicts our prediction model. SECTION V. Experiments A. Metrics Algorithm 3 A
    practical adaptive irrigation scheduling method. Show All Fig. 3 Stacked Generalization
    Ensemble Learning Show All We consider two criteria to evaluate the effectiveness
    of our proposed method, namely minimizing both irrigation time and a penalty metric.
    Remarkably, we define a penalty metric to assess how efficiently the irrigation
    method preserves soil moisture in an appropriate range without wasting irrigation
    water. In particular, an irrigation algorithm will be penalized if its decision
    is in one of two following cases: Under-watering decision: The soil moisture after
    irrigating is still below a lower bound. Often under-irrigation can lower the
    crop yield, harm the soil quality, etc. Over-watering decision: Besides wasting
    fresh water, over-irrigation can damage the soil quality by increasing salinity,
    extracting valuable nitrogen, etc. Moreover, if the waterlogging persists for
    a few days in the middle of the growing season; the moisture can kill some kinds
    of plants. The details of this penalty metric will be described in the following
    section. B. Settings We simply use real-time data from the environmental sensor
    network described in Section III . With regard to collecting irrigation labels,
    when farmers use our system to control the irrigation process, their activities
    will be recorded and stored in an agricultural diary. Because the pump capacity
    is a fixed value, the amount of irrigation water directly depends on the irrigation
    time. Besides that, because of the sparsity of training data, resolving the irrigation
    problem as a regression problem can be very hard and ineffective. Therefore, we
    consider the prediction problem as a classification problem. We extract irrigation
    time from the diary and group them into four classes. For simplicity and without
    loss of generality, although our monitoring system can collect various environmental
    features as described in Section III , we only use five basic parameters to run
    experiments. Table I illustrates the environmental input features and irrigation
    labels. Furthermore, instead of directly applying the irrigation system in the
    real environment, we implement a virtual experimental environment, which we can
    easily configure and control, to evaluate our proposed method with various environmental
    conditions. We also define three penalty scenarios, from relaxed to strict constraints,
    to evaluate the penalty metrics as in Table II . TABLE I INPUT FEATURES AND IRRIGATION
    LABELS Regarding soil moisture thresholds, because the evapotranspiration rate
    is different at different time frames in a day, it is reasonable to configure
    a higher threshold for soil moisture in the middle of the day and a lower threshold
    at night. Therefore, we will configure the bound of soil moisture as in Table
    III . C. Results Firstly, we want to evaluate how effective the re-training step
    and the relabeling method can improve the supervised learning model. In particular,
    we train an ensemble learning based on historical data. Then, we compare Algorithm
    2 without retraining and Algorithm 2 (with retraining after every ten wrong decisions).
    We denote Algorithm 2 without retraining as Algorithm 2* . Meanwhile, we measure
    their total irrigation time per day and penalty metric. Remarkably, to demonstrate
    the correlation between these two metrics more clearly, we replace their actual
    values with their normalized values. Figure 4 illustrates the results of the experiment.
    Especially, retraining the prediction model has significantly improved the irrigation
    time of Algorithm 2 . Regarding penalty metric, Algorithm 2 is worse than Algorithm
    2* in two days of a week in easy and medium scenarios and in three of seven days
    in the hard setting, which indicates that Algorithm 2 tends to under-irrigate
    and makes the soil moisture below the lower bound in these days. Nevertheless,
    when comparing their average of the normalized penalty with all settings in a
    week as in Figure 5 , Algorithm 2 is still better than Algorithm 2* . Table IV
    shows the details of irrigation time and penalty of two algorithms. TABLE II PENALTY
    SCENARIOS TABLE III CONFIGURATION OF SOIL MOISTURE BOUND TABLE IV AVERAGE OF IRRIGATION
    TIME AND PENALTY OF TWO ALGORITHMS OF A WEEK. Secondly, we compare the practical
    approach ( Algorithm 3 ) with the naive one ( Algorithm 2 ) for the adaptive irrigation
    method. Both algorithms will retrain the prediction model after a hundred of wrong
    decisions. Figure 6 shows the results after we run these algorithms for six days.
    The results show that Algorithm 3 has comparable performance to Algorithm 2 .
    To better compare, we compute the average of the normalized irrigation time and
    normalized penalty as in Figure 7 . The results demonstrate that Algorithm 3 is
    approximate to Algorithm 2 in terms of penalty and reduces slightly better irrigation
    time. Fig. 4 Comparison on normalized values of irrigation time and penalty between
    Algorithm 2* and Algorithm 2 in a week. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusions and Future
    Work Fig. 5 Average of normalized irrigation time and penalty of Algorithm 2*
    and 2 . Show All Fig. 6 Comparison on normalized values of irrigation time and
    penalty between Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3 in six days. (Medium Moisture Scenario)
    Show All Fig. 7 Average of normalized irrigation time and penalty of Algorithm
    2 and 3 in 6 days. Show All This paper proposes an adaptive method for the irrigation
    scheduling problem. Our model is more effective than the conventional supervised-learning
    method in terms of saving water resources and preserving the soil moisture within
    a threshold bound. We also propose a practical version for our adaptive method
    and compare it with the original version. Remarkably, the practical version has
    comparable performance with the original one. However, our work still has the
    following drawbacks, which are also our future works: Our current solution can
    run multiple irrigations in a day to preserve the soil moisture in a threshold
    bound. In the practical irrigation system, daily irrigating several times can
    reduce the lifetime of the irrigation motor. In the future, we will consider this
    constraint in our solution. At this stage, we only evaluate our method in the
    virtual environment. In the future, we will apply and evaluate our method in a
    real environment and compare it with manual irrigation in more diverse environmental
    conditions Deploying the sensor system to monitor the environment in large scope
    can be very expensive; thus, scaling an autonomous irrigation system in a large
    area has still been a challenging problem. It is also one of our future directions
    toward applying our method into practice. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was conducted

  description: To optimize the irrigation scheduling of field crops to maximize irrigation
    water productivity requires expert knowledge of the crop development and its productive
    response to water deficit. Implementing this idea with commodities such as barley,
    whose current global profitability is low, and, more specifically, in areas where
    the availability of water resources for irrigation is limited, requires a proper
    decision support system. In this research, AquaCrop and MOPECO models were used
    to compute and compare both the crop-water production and irrigation water productivity
    functions generated by several irrigation strategies provided by each model for
    the typical irrigated crop barley grown in the area. Furthermore, we evaluated
    both models’ performance with a 3-year field experiment applying the methodology
    of optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water
    (ORDIL) in barley crop. The results obtained from the production functions show
    that gross irrigation water depths (GIWD) of more than 310 mm can be useful to
    attain the potential crop yield, depending on the criteria considered to generate
    the irrigation scheduling. However, with less GIWD available, the simulated barley
    development was subjected to water deficit, leading to a reduction in both crop
    yield and irrigation water productivity. Thus MOPECO simulated higher crop yields
    and irrigation water productivity values than those obtained by AquaCrop, being
    between 16% and 27% for crop yields and between 8.0% and 27.5% for irrigation
    water productivity, under similar GIWD levels. These differences are mainly due
    to how the irrigation strategies are outlined in the two models and the different
    evapotranspiration methodologies they deploy. Finally, both models provided performed
    appropriately in simulating final crop yield (errors lower than 0.50 × 103 kg
    ha−1), as well as canopy cover and aboveground biomass evolution, in the case
    of AquaCrop, whose goodness of fit indicators were close to 0.90 or higher. In
    terms of crop evapotranspiration, AquaCrop simulated a 12% higher average value
    than MOPECO. It can be concluded that both models are complementary, and their
    use will depend on the necessities of the final user. Thus, MOPECO offers a wider
    range of irrigation strategies, while AquaCrop offers a more detailed information
    about the physiological response of the crop during its development, being the
    results of the simulations accurate enough in both models.

    To optimize the irrigation scheduling of field crops to maximize irrigation water
    productivity requires expert knowledge of the crop development and its productive
    response to water deficit. Implementing this idea with commodities such as barley,
    whose current global profitability is low, and, more specifically, in areas where
    the availability of water resources for irrigation is limited, requires a proper
    decision support system. In this research, AquaCrop and MOPECO models were used
    to compute and compare both the crop-water production and irrigation water productivity
    functions generated by several irrigation strategies provided by each model for
    the typical irrigated crop barley grown in the area. Furthermore, we evaluated
    both models’ performance with a 3-year field experiment applying the methodology
    of optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water
    (ORDIL) in barley crop. The results obtained from the production functions show
    that gross irrigation water depths (GIWD) of more than 310 mm can be useful to
    attain the potential crop yield, depending on the criteria considered to generate
    the irrigation scheduling. However, with less GIWD available, the simulated barley
    development was subjected to water deficit, leading to a reduction in both crop
    yield and irrigation water productivity. Thus MOPECO simulated higher crop yields
    and irrigation water productivity values than those obtained by AquaCrop, being
    between 16% and 27% for crop yields and between 8.0% and 27.5% for irrigation
    water productivity, under similar GIWD levels. These differences are mainly due
    to how the irrigation strategies are outlined in the two models and the different
    evapotranspiration methodologies they deploy. Finally, both models provided performed
    appropriately in simulating final crop yield (errors lower than 0.50 × 103 kg
    ha−1), as well as canopy cover and aboveground biomass evolution, in the case
    of AquaCrop, whose goodness of fit indicators were close to 0.90 or higher. In
    terms of crop evapotranspiration, AquaCrop simulated a 12% higher average value
    than MOPECO. It can be concluded that both models are complementary, and their
    use will depend on the necessities of the final user. Thus, MOPECO offers a wider
    range of irrigation strategies, while AquaCrop offers a more detailed information
    about the physiological response of the crop during its development, being the
    results of the simulations accurate enough in both models. Previous article in

    Worldwide, cereal crops occupy around 51% of the total growing area. In Spain,
    the seventh largest cereal producer in Europe with a production of 5.8 million
    Mg in almost 2.6 million ha of cereal planted area (FAOSTAT, 2019), these commodities,
    especially barley, are a key alternative for field agricultural systems. In semiarid
    regions, such as the centre and south of Spain, where there is a clear tendency
    towards water resource scarcity (Cramer et al., 2020), reductions in irrigation
    water abstraction in both Guadiana and Júcar rivers basins in Castilla-La Mancha
    (CLM) region (Spain) are already a fact. Applying deficit irrigation techniques
    (DI), either sustained (SDI) or regulated (RDI) (Fereres and Soriano, 2007), during
    crop growth, would allow for irrigation strategies that are able to improve crop
    irrigated water use, without causing significant yield losses. This methodology
    would help mitigate climate change effects, maximize the production per unit of
    water consumed, developing more resilient agricultural systems and limiting desertification.
    Several papers on the barley crop response to water deficit have reported that
    the end of the vegetative period, flowering and yield formation are the most sensitive
    stages, affecting the final crop yield and harvest quality (Abrha et al., 2012,
    Acevedo et al., 2002, Cossani et al., 2009, Giunta et al., 1993, Ugarte et al.,
    2007). Barley crop water requirements in CLM are around 400–500 mm, according
    to cycle length, which varies between 155 and 210 days (Pardo et al., 2020), with
    the average irrigation water requirements being 250 mm (JCRMO, 2020). Thus, the
    yield of irrigated barley is between 4 and 5 times higher than under rainfed conditions
    (ITAP, 2020). However, the current low profitability of this crop, and the increasing
    tendency of the water authority to limit the volume of water for irrigation in
    the area (CHG, 2020, CHJ, 2020) are forcing growers and technicians to adopt optimal
    irrigation techniques to reduce the use of irrigation water with the aim of maximizing
    economic irrigation water productivity (Pardo et al., 2020). Several authors have
    developed algorithms for optimizing irrigation scheduling based on the crop development
    and its productive response to water deficit (García et al., 2020, Kloss et al.,
    2012, Kuschel-Otárola et al., 2018, Schütze et al., 2012), as well as on the real-time
    readings obtained from weather stations and soil moisture sensors installed in
    the field (Domínguez-Niño et al., 2020). One of these methodologies is called
    optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water
    (ORDIL) (Domínguez et al., 2012a, Leite et al., 2015), the main objective of which
    is to maximize yield at harvest when the amount of available water is lower than
    the typical irrigation requirements of the crop (Pardo et al., 2020). This methodology
    is based on the total available volume of irrigation water at the beginning of
    the irrigation season, the sensitivity of the crop to water deficit at its different
    development stages, the evolution of climatic conditions, the amount of water
    received by the crop at each phenological stage and the amount of irrigation water
    remaining for the following phenological stages until physiological maturity.
    Crop simulation models, when calibrated and validated, can be used as decision
    support systems for the management of crops, farms or agricultural systems. Among
    other functions, these models calculate the crop water requirements, determine
    the irrigation scheduling and simulate crop yields according to the amount of
    irrigation water supplied during crop development (de Wit et al., 2019, Pereira
    et al., 2003, Stöckle et al., 2014). MOPECO (Ortega Álvarez et al., 2004) and
    AquaCrop (Steduto et al., 2009) were designed to be used by researchers and also
    by technicians and advanced farmers. Both models are based on FAO methodology
    (Allen et al., 1998, Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and the number of parameters
    required for the simulation of annual crops is low compared with other models,
    as reported by López-Urrea et al. (2020), who parameterizated the two models for
    a barley crop using the data set of a three-year experiment carried out in Albacete
    province (in the CLM region). MOPECO offers several options and tools that may
    be useful for the management of actual irrigated farms, such as ORDIL, the effect
    of irrigation uniformity on final yield (López-Mata et al., 2010) or the optimal
    distribution of crops depending on the available amount of irrigation water and
    cultivable area (López-Mata et al., 2016). AquaCrop is able to more precisely
    simulate the development of annual crops and their final biomass depending on
    the climatic conditions and availability of water in the soil during the growing
    cycle, providing irrigation scheduling strategies, such as full irrigation, or
    allowing a certain soil water depletion level at which an irrigation event is
    applied. Therefore, the main aim of this research was to assess how operational
    are both models generating irrigation water scheduling and the model responses
    with the ORDIL methodology for barley crop under the semiarid climatic conditions
    of CLM. To achieve this aim, the following partial objectives were proposed: 1.
    To improve the parametrization of both models for a barley crop developed by López-Urrea
    et al. (2020), determining the average length of the different growing stages
    of this crop for the different irrigated areas of CLM. 2. To compute and compare
    the crop-water production functions generated by the tools and strategies provided
    by each model for the typical conditions of CLM. 3. To evaluate the accuracy of
    MOPECO and AquaCrop models by comparing their results with those obtained in a
    three-year experiment conducted in Albacete, where the ORDIL methodology was applied
    to a barley crop (Pardo et al., 2020). 2. Material and methods 2.1. Description
    of crop models. Approach simulation The AquaCrop model (Steduto et al., 2009)
    maintains the original concept proposed in FAO-33 (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979)
    but, in this case, it estimates biomass production from actual crop transpiration
    through the normalized water productivity (WP) parameter (Steduto et al., 2012),
    since the model separates soil evaporation from crop transpiration as is also
    done by FAO-56 methodology (Allen et al., 1998, Pereira et al., 2021a). Crop cycle
    length is determined by days after sowing (DAS), or calculated by using the growing
    degree days methodology (GDD, ºC). Finally, crop yield is estimated from the biomass
    production and the harvest index. Several stress coefficients (soil water, air
    temperature, soil fertility and soil salinity) are used to adjust the daily green
    canopy cover, crop transpiration, above-ground biomass and yield formation. AquaCrop
    model is now designed to be used with annual crops, whose conservative crop parameters
    are provided in the AquaCrop software for many species (maize, barley, wheat,
    cotton, rice, soybean, potato, sunflower, tomato, among others; Vanuytrecht et
    al., 2014). AquaCrop can be used to report the role of different soil-climate
    systems in water-limited crop production as well as the analysis of different
    scenarios, such as climate change, water supply, crop type, field management,
    etc. (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014). In addition, the AquaCrop plug-in program (Raes
    et al., 2017) and AquaCrop-GIS (Lorite et al., 2013), together with AquaCrop-OS,
    the open source version (Foster et al., 2017), allow the simulation time to be
    significantly reduced when both a larger number of simulations are carried out
    and interpretation and analysis of the results is complex (Vanuytrecht et al.,
    2014). MOPECO was conceived to optimize the gross margin of farms through the
    use of deficit irrigation strategies (De Juan et al., 1996). It is based on FAO-33
    (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998, Pereira et al., 2020,
    Pereira et al., 2021b) methodologies. For the simulation of yield, the model determines
    the ratio between actual and potential (maximum) crop evapotranspiration (ETa
    and ETm, respectively) for each growing stage (Domínguez et al., 2011), where
    soil evaporation and crop transpiration components are not separated. Similarly
    to AquaCrop, the crop development is simulated using both DAS and GDD. Yields
    for different amounts of irrigated water supplied to the crop are used to determine
    the “yield vs. irrigation depth” function. The simulation of the irrigation water
    allocation during the growing period is determined by the optimized regulated
    deficit irrigation (ORDI) methodology. ORDI maximizes yield for a certain water
    deficit target by determining the ETa/ETm ratios to be applied at each growing
    stage (Domínguez et al., 2012a). Under real management conditions, where climatic
    conditions for the growing period are unknown and the amount of available irrigation
    water is limited, MOPECO uses the ORDIL methodology (Leite et al., 2015). Both
    methodologies have been applied to different crops: maize (Domínguez et al., 2012a),
    onion (Domínguez et al., 2012b), garlic (Domínguez et al., 2013, Sánchez-Virosta
    et al., 2020), carrot (Carvalho et al., 2014), melon (Leite et al., 2015), potato
    (Martínez-Romero et al., 2019) and barley (Pardo et al., 2020). 2.1.1. AquaCrop
    model. Irrigation water scheduling When the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa)
    is calculated, the AquaCrop model separates the soil water evaporative component
    from the crop transpiration (Steduto et al., 2009). Thus, this model takes into
    account both the water inputs (net irrigation, rainfall and capillary rise) and
    outputs (runoff, deep percolation and ETa) at the crop root zone in order to compute
    a daily soil water balance. An accurate description of the soil water movement
    is made by dividing soil depth into several compartments, with the thickness of
    each one being variable according to user specifications. The AquaCrop manual
    (Raes et al., 2018) shows a detailed description and the algorithms used to calculate
    the soil water balance. From that balance, AquaCrop model simulates the irrigation
    management in three alternative ways: a) by resolving the net irrigation water
    requirements of the crop, keeping the soil water depletion at the root zone above
    a threshold, which is delimited by the user (generally 50% of the readily available
    water, RAW). These requirements do not take into account the irrigation uniformity
    effect; b) by considering a previously designed irrigation schedule where each
    irrigation event is specified by the user; thus, date of irrigation event, net
    irrigation depth and the quality of water (electric conductivity, ECw) must be
    given for each irrigation event; c) by allowing AquaCrop to automatically generate
    an irrigation schedule according to the criteria established by the user. In the
    third alternative, users define in AquaCrop the way an irrigation event must be
    simulated. Thus, two criteria are considered: (i) when the irrigation event has
    to be triggered (irrigation time criterion, ITC), and (ii) how much water has
    to be applied through the irrigation system (irrigation depth criterion, IDC),
    being specified to either all the crop cycle or a certain period of time. The
    ITC can be established by the user, who either fixes a constant number of interval
    days between irrigation events or selects a soil water depletion threshold (either
    mm of water or % of RAW). The IDC also offers two options, namely, to refill the
    soil water content up to field capacity or to fix a constant net irrigation depth
    (mm). The former option allows over-irrigation (for avoiding the effect of a low
    uniformity of irrigation) or under-irrigation (erratic rainfall distribution)
    to be considered. Finally, in this third method, which also considers water quality,
    users cannot generate an irrigation schedule, coordinating two different options
    for each criterion along the crop cycle, either the ITC or IDC. Graphically, users
    may compose their own irrigation strategy according to the crop growth stage (initial,
    development, mid-season, flowering and late season) and the different soil water
    stress thresholds (mainly leaf expansion growth, stomatal closure and canopy senescence).
    Finally, the model distinguishes between different wetted soil fractions, depending
    on the irrigation system considered. Thus, the percentage of the wetted soil surface
    fluctuates from 100% (sprinkler, border and basin irrigation) to 0% (subsurface
    drip irrigation), with intermediate values for other irrigation systems (30–100%
    in furrow irrigation and 15–40% in trickle (drip)-micro irrigation). 2.1.2. MOPECO
    model. Irrigation water scheduling MOPECO calculates the daily soil water content
    in the root area following the FAO-56 approach (Allen et al., 1998), balancing
    inputs (net irrigation, precipitation, and deep water reached by roots) and outputs
    (runoff, crop evapotranspiration and deep percolation) (Domínguez et al., 2011).
    In this sense, MOPECO computes the total available water (TAW) in the root zone,
    understanding TAW as the difference in soil water content between field capacity
    and permanent wilting point; and considers a depletion fraction “p” threshold
    which is the fraction of TAW that a crop can extract without suffering water stress
    (Allen et al., 1998, Domínguez et al., 2011). In addition, the MOPECO irrigation
    scheduling module requires as input data: (i) the interval of maximum and minimum
    irrigation depth that can be supplied by the irrigation system per irrigation
    event (MID and mid, respectively); (ii) minimum and maximum number of interval
    days to trigger an irrigation event; (iii) maximum level of soil water content
    that can be refilled by an irrigation event (% TAW) with the aim of decreasing
    or avoiding percolation when there is unexpected rainfall after an irrigation
    event. Thus, three situations can be distinguished: a) maintaining no water deficit
    along the crop cycle, when the soil water content is always higher than p and
    the irrigation water depth per event is calculated, in order to refill the soil
    water content in an intermediate point between field capacity and (1-p)*TAW (%TAW
    selected by the user); b) reaching a certain global water deficit level for the
    complete crop cycle (global ETa/ETm ratio defined by the user), with MOPECO aiming
    to determine the water deficit level to be caused to the crop at each phenological
    stage in order to maximize final yield; and c) distributing a certain volume of
    irrigation water during the crop cycle according to the water deficit level for
    each phenological stage that maximizes yield without exceeding the limited volume
    according to the progress of climatic conditions. In situations b) and c), MOPECO
    calculates the daily accumulated ETa/ETm ratio from the beginning up to the end
    of each growth stage. If the daily accumulated ETa/ETm ratio at a certain date
    is higher than the ETa/ETm target ratio for that stage, MOPECO does not apply
    any irrigation unless the maximum number of days without water supply (irrigation
    or rainfall) is reached, or the daily ETa/ETm ratio reaches a minimum value fixed
    by the user (0.35 is recommended), to avoid excessive depletion of soil moisture.
    (Domínguez et al., 2011). The global ETa/ETm ratio of each crop growth stage is
    established following the ORDI and ORDIL methodologies (Domínguez et al., 2012a,
    Leite et al., 2015, Pardo et al., 2020), which produces the highest crop yield
    for a certain overall deficit target or for a limited irrigation water volume,
    using non-linear optimization software such as Solver (Microsoft, 2018). MOPECO
    is sometimes unable to attain the target deficit rate proposed for each growth
    stage by the user or by the optimizer. In these cases, the irregular distribution
    of rainfall and/or the high soil water content at the beginning of the simulation
    are the main causes of this mismatch between the objective and the final deficit
    rate. 2.1.3. Model parameterization López-Urrea et al. (2020) described in detail
    the parameterization of both models (Table 1) for barley crop growth under different
    irrigation regimes, using the data of a three year experiment (from 2011 to 2013)
    conducted under the semiarid conditions of Albacete province (Fig. 2). Table 1.

    Spain in a semiarid area where around 70% of water resources used for irrigated
    crops are from groundwater (Domínguez and De Juan, 2008). The three main affected
    aquifers are Eastern Mancha, Western Mancha and Campo de Montiel, whose irrigated
    area is around 350,000 ha distributed over 29,000 km2 (Fig. 1). Irrigated barley
    crop is usually managed under a sprinkler irrigation system because the seasonal
    average rainfall is between 300 and 350 mm year−1, from September to June, and
    with high reference evapotranspiration (~1150 mm year−1) (Domínguez et al., 2013).

    Fig. 1. Location of the main irrigated areas in Castilla-La Mancha region and
    field barley areas monitored by the Irrigation Advisory Service from 2002 to 2013.
    The typical soils in this area are characterized by shallow depths (0.40–0.55 m)
    which are limited by a somewhat fragmented limestone sedimentary rock. They have
    a slightly basic pH (7.5–8.5), low organic matter content (1.2–1.6%) and their
    general texture is classified as loam or sandy clay loam soils (Domínguez and
    De Juan, 2008). 2.3. Crop cycle length influenced by climatic variability To determine
    the average length of the barley crop cycle, as well as its development stages
    in the study area, 28 crop phenological monitoring studies, carried out by the
    Irrigation Advisory Service (IAS) of CLM (SIAR-CLM, 2014), were used. This monitoring
    work included the four main irrigable areas (Fig. 1) over 11 cropping seasons,
    where short cycle varieties of barley sowed at commercial field, which mean area
    ranging between 5 and 75 ha, were mainly studied since they are mostly grown under
    irrigated conditions (sowing date by mid-January and harvest date at the end of
    June). The BBCH-scale (Bleiholder et al., 2001) was used to determine the phenological
    growth stages of barley related to the input parameters required by both models
    (canopy development, mid-season and late season for AquaCrop; Kc and Ky coefficients
    for MOPECO; Table A1, Annex). The thermal time duration of the barley growth stages
    in terms of accumulated GDD was obtained for both models. AquaCrop establishes
    three different methods to calculate GDD (Mcmaster and Wilhelm, 1997), with the
    first method (Raes et al., 2018) being used for simulations, while MOPECO uses
    the double triangulation method (Sevacherian et al., 1977) which is suitable in
    the area. The mean accumulated GDD value for each growth stage of barley was calculated
    taking into account the base temperature (TB) and the upper temperature (TU) thresholds.
    Combining a set of values reported from several studies (from 0 ºC to 10 ºC and
    from 20 ºC to 38 ºC, for TB and TU, respectively; López-Bellido, 1991; Juskiw
    et al., 2001; Araya et al., 2010; Abrha et al., 2012) and those shown in Table
    1, the selected final threshold values were derived from the lowest standard deviation
    and coefficient of variation GDD data for all monitoring barley growth stages.
    2.4. Typical meteorological year A typical meteorological year (TMY) represents
    the conditions considered “typical” over a long period of time, and consists of
    12 months selected from individual years and concatenated to form a complete year
    with daily values (Pardo et al., 2020). In this study, an intermediate TMY (TMYintermediate),
    determined by Leite et al. (2015) with a weather station located in the experimental
    area (Albacete, southeast Spain; Fig. 2), was used. The main values computed for
    TMYintermediate were 1212 mm year−1 and 289 mm year−1 for reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) computed using the FAO56 Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al., 1998) and
    precipitation, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download

    management Using the GDD methodology already described and applied for a TMYintermediate
    in the study area (Leite et al., 2015), the crop barley yield and irrigation water
    productivity (IWP; expressed as kg of commercial crop yield per m−3 of irrigation
    water supplied to the crop) response to irrigation scheduling were simulated with
    AquaCrop and MOPECO. The derived crop-water and IWP-water production functions
    were compared to evaluate the performance of both irrigation scheduling tools.
    Four irrigation strategies (IS) were designed to be implemented in the AquaCrop
    model (IS1_Aq, IS2_Aq, IS3_Aq and IS4_Aq; Fig. 2). The four strategies were considered
    as sustained irrigation through the simulated crop cycle. In two of the IS strategies
    (IS1_Aq and IS2_Aq), a time criterion was fixed with an interval time between
    1 and 27 days, where odd days were used, obtaining 14 simulations for each IS
    (Fig. 2; Table 2). The depth criteria of these IS was different: IS1_Aq applied,
    at each irrigation event, 23.5 mm of gross water depth; while IS2_Aq refilled
    the soil water content up to field capacity minus 10 mm as a margin for unexpected
    rainfall events. The other two IS strategies (IS3_Aq and IS4_Aq) considered the
    irrigation event was triggered when a certain soil water content was depleted
    (represented as mm), being 12 simulations per each IS (Fig. 2; Table 2), and following
    the same irrigation depth criteria previously described, i.e. to apply 23.5 mm
    per irrigation event (IS3_Aq), and to refill up to field capacity minus 10 mm
    (IS4_Aq). Table 2. Irrigation strategies simulated by AquaCrop (Aq) and MOPECO

    gross irrigation depth of 23.5 mm was established since it is the most widely
    used according to the representative farm area and the daily irrigation time normally
    used. In addition, barley crop yield was also simulated under rainfed conditions
    in order to find the ordinate of the crop-water production function. Finally,
    the regulated deficit irrigation scheduling, taking into account crop growth stages,
    was not analysed because of the huge number of combinations which may be derived,
    surpassing, in this case, the goals for managing this model by an intermediate
    user. In the case of MOPECO, two irrigation strategies were performed (IS1_ORDI
    and IS2_ORDIL; Fig. 2). The first strategy established an optimized regulated
    deficit irrigation with ten global ETa/ETm ratio objectives (between 1.00 y 0.55)
    (Fig. 2; Table 2). To simulate the ORDIL irrigation strategies (IS2_ORDIL), ten
    gross irrigation water amounts were fixed as the input data model, which derived
    in different global ETa/ETm ratios (Table 2). In the former IS, the maximum simulated
    irrigation water amount had a global ETa/ETm ratio equal to 1.00 (i.e. the same
    total irrigation depth simulated in IS1_ORDI, 312 mm), and the rest of simulations
    were run for irrigation depths differentiated at intervals of 20 mm (Table 2).
    A total of 15 and 2 days were established as maximum and minimum intervals between
    irrigation events when no rainfall occurs. The gross irrigation water depth per
    event was set between 4 and 30 mm (Fig. 2). For the simulations, the sowing date
    was January 13th, the maximum root depth was 1.0 m although its development was
    limited by the root restrictive layer (0.40 m). The physical and hydraulic soil
    characteristics were those measured by Pardo et al. (2020) which are representative
    of this production area. Both models were run in GDD mode, using the average GDD
    for each growth stage from the GDD methodology previously described, and using
    the parameterized coefficients shown in Table 1. In this work, a value equal to
    85% of irrigation efficiency was established, corresponding to a sprinkler irrigation
    system. The initial soil water content was established at 80% of field capacity.
    In the case of AquaCrop, the simulated dry matter yield outputs were normalized
    to standard commercial yields (12% of moisture content), since yield outputs computed
    by MOPECO are given as commercial yield. 2.6. Experimental dataset using the ORDIL
    methodology Evaluating the performance of the AquaCrop and MOPECO models, as well
    as their inter-comparison, we used several irrigation schedules generated by ORDIL
    methodology with a limited total irrigation depth (Pardo et al., 2020). Pardo
    et al. (2020) conducted the field trials in 2015, 2016 and 2017 on an experimental
    farm located in Albacete (SE Spain). Its geographic coordinates are 1° 53′ 58″
    W, 38° 56′ 42″ N, and the altitude is 695 m above mean sea level. Five treatments
    of ORDIL irrigation strategies were carried out to analyse their effects on both
    IWP and crop yield in the “Shakira” barley cultivar. A control treatment (no water
    deficit, ND) received the full crop water requirements following López-Urrea et
    al. (2020), while the other four irrigation treatments received a percentage of
    the net typical irrigation water requirements (T100, 100%; T90, 90%; T80, 80%
    and T70, 70%) which were adjusted to 2500 m3 ha−1 (Pardo et al., 2020). All irrigation
    schedules were obtained from Pardo et al. (2020). Those authors carried out four
    optimizations during the crop cycle length (one per each Ky stage; Table 1) in
    order to maximize crop yield according to the water deficit (in terms of ETa/ETm)
    applied to each barley Ky stage. The soil of the experimental plot, classified
    as clay-loam, was a shallow soil (0.40 m of average soil depth), whose available
    water content was 0.124 cm3 cm−3 (0.313 cm3 cm−3 for field capacity and 0.189 cm3
    cm−3 for permanent wilting point). During the three experimental cropping seasons,
    ETo was between 12.5% and 25.0% higher than the TMYintermediate (400 mm), while
    the total precipitation was lower for 2015 and 2016 experimental seasons (around
    20%) and slightly higher for 2017 season (5%) with respect to the TMYintermediate
    (165 mm) (Pardo et al., 2020). Real-time ETa/ETm optimizations for each Ky crop
    stage were fitted to the weather conditions occurring during the current year.
    The total water received by crop (rainfall and irrigation) and crop yield obtained
    for each treatment and experimental seasons are shown in Table 3 (Pardo et al.,
    2020). Table 3. Total water received by the crop, commercial yield (12% grain

    grain (12% of water content). # values between brackets are the standard deviation
    (SD). In addition, for each irrigation treatment, during the three experimental
    seasons, both the total crop biomass and the leaf area index (LAI) evolutions
    were measured (approximately every 15 days in two subplots of each treatment).
    Two samples of 0.5 × 0.5 m were collected and measured per treatment by using
    an electronic meter device (LI−COR-3100 C, Licor, Inc., Lincoln, NE) to determine
    LAI and were introduced into an oven at 70 °C up to constant weight for crop biomass.
    Crop canopy cover (CC) was estimated from the measured LAI using the Ritchie equation
    (Ritchie et al., 1985), where the extinction coefficient was established as 0.60.
    (1) where CC is canopy cover; K is extinction coefficient; LAI is leaf area index.
    2.7. Statistical analysis to evaluate the irrigation schedule tools and model
    performance Several evaluation indices were performed to estimate the goodness
    of fit for both simulated crop-water and the IWP-water production function of
    each IS (CWPF and IWPPF, respectively), with the gross irrigation-water depth
    (GIWD) being the dependent variable in both functions. Curvilinear and lineal
    models were used to fit these functions (Saseendran et al., 2015, Stewart and
    Hagan, 1973), since a portion of the applied water is not used in evapotranspiration
    and is lost in different process (Fereres and Soriano, 2007). Thus, the coefficient
    of determination (R2), the significance of both model parameters and R2 (p-value),
    as well as the standard error (SE) of estimate of the regression model were analysed.
    Statgraphics® Centurion XVII software was used to calculate these statistics.
    (2) (3) where Z is the commercial crop yield (Y; kg ha−1) or irrigation water
    productivity (IWP; kg m−3); a, b, c are the model’s coefficients; GIWD is the
    gross irrigation water depth (mm). With respect to the performance of both models
    in simulating three experimental trials under ORDI methodology, the evaluation
    indices used to determine the goodness of fit of the simulations were: root mean
    square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), efficiency model (EF), and index of
    agreement (d; Willmott, 1982). (4) where RMSE is the Root Mean Square Error; n,
    is the number of observations; Si and Oi are the simulated and observed values,
    respectively. (5) where MBE is the mean bias error. (6) ̅ where EF is the efficiency
    model. (7) ̅ ̅ where d is the index of agreement. RMSE was used to analyse the
    variance of the error, which ranges from 0 to positive infinity, with the former
    indicating good, and the latter poor, model performance. The MBE expresses the
    average size of the estimated errors and was used to indicate the under- or overestimations
    of the model. Finally, the EF and d statistics (non-dimensional) were used as
    the indicator of model quality, where values close to 1 mean there is a good agreement.
    EF ranges between -∞ to 1, while d index ranges between 0 and 1. These statistics
    were computed using the number of independent observations for each treatment
    for canopy cover and biomass progression (only with AquaCrop). However, those
    statistics were calculated for standard commercial yield (12% of water content)
    with the data set obtained from the five treatments during the three experimental
    seasons (both AquaCrop as MOPECO). Finally, the differences between observed and
    simulated yield values were computed to estimate the performance model following
    the criteria established by a number of authors (differences between simulated
    and observed data lower than 10% and with more than 70% of cases achieving the
    former percentage; (Domínguez et al., 2012c, Farahani et al., 2009, Heng et al.,
    2009, López-Urrea et al., 2020). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Duration of barley
    growing stages in Castilla-La Mancha Analysing the barley growth stages with all
    monitoring field data, the lowest values of standard deviation and coefficient
    of variation were obtained with a temperature combination of 2 ºC and 28 ºC as
    TB and TU thresholds, respectively. These temperatures are similar to those proposed
    by López-Bellido (1991) and Araya et al. (2010), and the same as those of Abrha
    et al. (2012) and López-Urrea et al. (2020). These results strengthen the values
    stipulated by the authors previously cited, whose studies were carried out under
    similar climatic conditions. The mean length of barley crop stages for CLM conditions
    are shown in Table 4. Table 4. Length of barley growing stages in Castilla-La

    The methodologies used by both crop models, computing the required thermal time
    for reaching each development stages, showed similar values when the barley crop
    attained the same phenological stage (i.e. BBCH scales 39, 71 and 89), obtaining
    differences lower than 4.0%. In this sense, the accumulated GDD progression at
    the different crop growth stages (either those used by MOPECO or by AquaCrop)
    was similar in all monitored cropping seasons (Table A2, Annex), with the GDD
    variability decreasing (represented as coefficient of variation; Table 4) with
    time, as has also been observed by other authors using GDD (Lancaster et al.,
    1996, Marinaccio et al., 2015, Pereira et al., 2015, Piccinni et al., 2009, Ruiz-Corral
    et al., 2002). Analysing variability in days after sowing, there were differences
    in duration of between 2 and 11 days for the stages established by both crop models.
    These numbers of days represent, as a maximum, around 7% with respect to the total
    crop growth length (150 days). Thus, these variation results can be considered
    as acceptable, following the same criteria given by Domínguez et al. (2012c) in
    a maize crop cultivated in the same production area. Finally, the average thermal
    time values calculated for the three main phenological stages used by the AquaCrop
    model (Table 4), were very similar to those calibrated by López-Urrea et al. (2020).
    These authors parameterized the conservative parameters “Time to maximum canopy
    cover” and “Length of the Harvest Index accumulation” as 619 GDD and 675 GDD,
    respectively. Taking into account that the crop canopy development stage (CnDv)
    is the same as the first previous parameter described, CnDv was 13.4% higher.
    This difference for the crop stage may be acceptable since the highest variations
    are usually found in the first crop growth stage (Table 4). Conversely, the second
    conservative parameter is represented as the GDD remainder between late-season
    (LSsn (Table 4) and CnDv, obtaining 680 GDD, which is very close to the stage
    parameterized by López-Urrea et al. (2020). Therefore, the average thermal time
    reported in Table 4 will be used to simulate the crop cycle length under the conditions
    of TMYintermediate. 3.2. “Crop vs. irrigation water” production function obtained
    by the different irrigation tools provided by the models The four irrigation strategies
    simulated by AquaCrop with a TMYintermediate reached a maximum yield of 11.70 × 103
    kg ha−1 (IS1_Aq, IS2_Aq, IS3_Aq and IS4_Aq; Table 2; Fig. 3a). In the same way,
    and as expected, similar maximum yields were simulated by MOPECO for the two irrigation
    strategies simulated (ORDI and ORDIL; Table 2; Fig. 3a). Although the MOPECO model
    was calibrated for a Ym = 9.00 × 103 kg ha−1 (Table 1), according to the results
    obtained in the experiments carried out by López-Urrea et al. (2020), the Ym is
    not a constant value and depends on many factors, such as climatic conditions,
    soil characteristics and crop management (Sadras et al., 2015). Consequently,
    this value must be adapted for the conditions of the farm and the year where the
    simulations were or will be carried out. In this sense, and in order to achieve
    a proper comparison between both models, the maximum yield obtained by AquaCrop
    was considered as Ym for MOPECO. Download : Download high-res image (314KB) Download

    irrigation water depth (GIWD) (a), and irrigation water productivity and GIWD
    (b) simulated by both AquaCrop (white symbols) and MOPECO (black symbols) models.
    The barley yield simulated by using AquaCrop under rainfed conditions in a TMYintermediate
    was 2.80 × 103 kg ha−1 (Table 2). This value, as well as the maximum simulated
    yield can be considered appropriate, according to the crop statistics and field
    trials carried out in this area (ITAP, 2020, MAPA, 2020). With respect to MOPECO,
    the rainfed condition was not simulated since simulated yields are unreliable
    when the computed ETa/ETm ratio for one or more development stages is lower than
    0.5, as happens under rainfed conditions (Domínguez et al., 2012a, Doorenbos and
    Kassam, 1979). Overall, all ISs simulated by both models showed that the maximum
    yield was reached when gross irrigation water depth (GIWD) was between 300 and
    390 mm (Table 2; Fig. 3a). In the case of AquaCrop, and excepting IS1, all ISs
    simulated yields were close to 11.70 × 103 kg ha−1 when GIWD was higher than 350 mm
    (Table 2), while slightly lower GIWD values (ranging between 300 and 330 mm) decreased
    by yield around 12%. In contrast, the two ISs simulated by MOPECO (ORDI and ORDIL)
    obtained the maximum yield supplying 312 mm of GIWD (Table 2). Simulating GIWD
    lower than 300 mm, both crop models showed that barley crop was subjected to water
    deficit (ETa/ETm ratio lower than 1; Table 2). Nonetheless, all ISs simulated
    by MOPECO attained crop yields between 16% and 27% higher than those obtained
    by AquaCrop, considering similar GIWD applications (Fig. 3a). Analysing the IS
    simulated by AquaCrop, IS1, applying irrigation depths fixed at 23.5 mm per event,
    with an interval time between irrigation events of 1–7 days, showed that is not
    feasible at either economic or environmental level. In this simulated interval
    time, deep percolation was highly significant (between 88 and 2800 mm; Table 2),
    causing crop yield not to increase significantly with a GIWD of more than 350 mm
    (Table 2; Fig. 3a). Thus, IS1 simulated around 18% less crop yield for a GIWD
    interval between 300 and 390 mm. On the other hand, the irrigation scheduling
    managed by AquaCrop using the readily available water in the soil (% RAW) as time
    criterion, showed that, depleting soil water up to a 34 mm, and requiring GIWD
    between 330 and 490 mm, the simulated crop yield was close to the maximum yield,
    obtaining ETa/ETm ratios of around 0.95 (Table 2), whereas with depletion thresholds
    higher than 34 mm or by fixing interval time between irrigation events at more
    than 11 days, the AquaCrop model simulated significant decreases in crop yield,
    with global ETa/ETm ratios lower than 0.85 (Table 2). The AquaCrop results simulating
    high-frequency irrigation strategies (interval irrigation events between 1 and
    5 days or with a depletion threshold between 12 and 27 mm, IS2-Aq and IS4-Aq,
    respectively), obtained average irrigation depths from 3 mm to 12 mm per irrigation
    event (Table 2). These irrigation schedules are not useful, according to the typical
    irrigation amount per event, although they attained the largest ETa/ETm ratios
    (>0.97%; Table 2). Finally, IS4-Aq also simulated irrigation scheduling with low
    frequency of irrigation events (from 3 to 10 events along crop growth cycle; Table
    2) whose average irrigation depths per event were between 25% and 88% higher than
    the objective irrigation water depth (23.5 mm), and consequently ETa/ETm ratios
    were lower than 0.88 (Table 2). Regarding the two ISs simulated by MOPECO, both
    showed that crop yield and ETa/ETm ratio had a similar behaviour, since the GIWDs
    and MIWDs simulated in each case were very close (Table 2), obtaining almost overlapping
    production function-curves (Fig. 3a). Comparing the number of irrigation events
    simulated by both models, and under a similar ETa/ETm ratio value, the strategies
    performed by MOPECO provided more frequent irrigation events than AquaCrop. In
    the case of the simulated ETa, and comparing data with similar ETa/ETm ratios
    (Table 2), AquaCrop computed around 14% above MOPECO because of the different
    method of calculating evapotranspiration. In general, the calculated IWP values
    ranged between 0.184 kg m−3 and 5.435 kg m−3 (Table 2). The IWP simulated by AquaCrop
    showed a higher variability than MOPECO (from 0.184 kg m−3 to 4.921 kg m−3 vs.
    from 3.619 kg m−3 to 5.435 kg m−3, respectively; Table 2, Fig. 3). Thus, the IWP
    differences for the four ISs simulated by AquaCrop were significant, with GIWD
    lower than 200 mm (up to 20% less), while these differences were between 9.5%
    and 15% with GIWD above 200 mm (Fig. 3b), excepting IS1, whose calculated IWP
    tended to drop off significantly with respect to the rest of ISs (values lower
    than 3.0 kg m−3; Fig. 3b). In contrast, the IWP computed by MOPECO had a similar
    behaviour under the same GIWD (differences lower than 1.0%; Fig. 3b), as was also
    shown with the simulated crop yield (Fig. 3a). Overall, the MOPECO model computed
    higher IWP-GIWD relationships than those calculated by AquaCrop, being between
    8.0% and 27.5% on average when water deficit was triggered. The production and
    IWP function curves obtained with MOPECO contained those generated with AquaCrop
    (Fig. 3). The main reason for this is the way to outline the different ISs, where
    the ISs considered for AquaCrop were sustained throughout the crop cycle, whereas
    the ISs simulated by MOPECO established regulated irrigation management based
    on the water deficit sensibility of each crop growth stage. Similar differences
    between ORDI and sustained deficit irrigation (SDI) strategies were computed by
    the MOPECO model, optimizing the deficit irrigation strategies for maize in the
    same area (Domínguez et al., 2012a). The models derived from the simulated ISs
    with both AquaCrop and MOPECO showed that crop yield-water production functions
    had a high goodness of fit with the second-degree polynomial model (R2 > 0.92;
    Table A3, Annex), while IWP-GIWD relationships for all ISs were faithfully fitted
    to a linear model (Table A3, Annex). The selected curvilinear model, as well as
    their parameter values for each IS, were, in most cases, highly significant, with
    standard errors of the model ranging between 0.17 × 103 and 0.85 × 103 kg ha−1
    (Table A3, Annex), where the ISs generated by AquaCrop simulated a 67% larger
    standard error than MOPECO. In the case of linear models, errors were around 0.01 kg m−3
    for the ISs simulated by MOPECO and between 0.06 kg m−3 and 0.19 kg m−3 for those
    generated with AquaCrop (Fig. 3b). Finally, the curvilinear model adjusted to
    IS4 showed that the squared term had no significance, being a linear relationship
    that would achieve highly significant model coefficients. Trout and DeJonge (2017),
    in a field trial with maize during four cropping seasons, derived consistent and
    highly significant fits of crop-water production functions to a curvilinear model.
    These authors, relating crop yield vs. evapotranspiration with the former model,
    obtained similar results, despite several studies having projected linear relationships
    in field crops (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979, Fereres and Soriano, 2007, Saseendran
    et al., 2015, Steduto et al., 2007, Tanner and Sinclair, 1983). In this sense,
    reasons such as evaporation losses decreasing as water deficit limits transpiration
    could partly explain those results (Trout and DeJonge, 2017). 3.3. Simulation
    by AquaCrop of the data from the ORDIL experimental field tests, validation of
    the results, and comparison with MOPECO outputs Overall, the AquaCrop model performance
    simulating the irrigation scheduling derived from different ORDIL levels was appropriate
    during the three experimental seasons. The progression of the main crop growth
    variables simulated by AquaCrop (canopy cover, CC; aboveground biomass, AGB),
    as well as final crop yield (Y) followed a tendency close to the measured data
    (Fig. 4; Table 5). The calculated evaluation indices between observed and simulated
    data showed that CC was underestimated with MBE values between 0.6% and 7.1%,
    and whose variance of error values were around 11.0% for all treatments, being
    the highest computed values for the three water deficit treatments (Table 5).
    Most values of EF and d were close to 0.90 or higher, excepting two treatments
    during the 2016 cropping season (80% and 70%; Table 5) where the observed CC during
    the senescence stage in these treatments had a higher variability than the rest
    of treatments (Fig. 4d,e). Nevertheless, AquaCrop had a good goodness of fit in
    this crop growth parameter. This slight underestimation of the CC by AquaCrop
    also resulted in the same trend at that of the measured AGB data (Fig. 4), reporting
    errors ranging from 0.76 × 103 to 2.17 × 103 kg ha−1 (Table 5). Conversely to
    the CC evaluation indices, AGB’ bias for the simulations of 2016 treatments showed
    to be slightly lower than the rest of experimental years (Table 5). In this case,
    the method to estimate the crop evaporative demand by the model could partially
    explain these results. In spite of everything, goodness of fit indicators were
    similar to those computed for CC in this research. Download : Download high-res

    from the simulated values with AquaCrop model. # values between brackets are the
    standard deviation. With respect to the simulated crop yield, AquaCrop simulated
    values close to those observed, including the standard deviation values (Table
    5). Thus, the percentage of deviation between both simulated and observed values,
    for all treatments, was within ±10% (Table 5); obtaining errors between 0.26 × 103
    and 0.46 × 103 kg ha−1 with high EF and d values (Table 5). The crop yield evaluation
    indices computed, between the data simulated by MOPECO vs. the observed data,
    showed similar results to those obtained with AquaCrop, with the RMSE values being
    somewhat lower (Table 5). Pardo et al. (2020) extensively discussed testing the
    MOPECO model with the ORDIL methodology, concluding that Ym is the most important
    variable to fit the potential crop yield to the actual yield, according to phenological
    stage duration, suitable parameterization of Kc and Ky and optimal volume water
    distribution along the crop cycle, depending on the actual weather conditions.
    Comparing the former results with those reported by López-Urrea et al. (2020),
    who parameterized this model for barley under the same climate conditions, it
    is worth noting that all evaluation parameters used to test both models were similar.
    Thus, these findings confirm the suitability of barley parameterization in AquaCrop
    and MOPECO and, in addition, the different irrigation strategies developed by
    ORDIL methodology, and tested in the field, were faithfully replicated by the
    models. In terms of evaporative demand simulated by both models, the accumulated
    maximum and actual crop evapotranspiration (ETm and ETa, respectively) simulated
    by AquaCrop were, respectively, around 17% and 8% higher than those obtained by
    MOPECO (Table 6). In this sense, both the total actual crop transpiration (Ta)
    and the total actual soil evaporation (Ea) values simulated by AquaCrop were not
    satisfied in any irrigation treatment without water deficit (i.e. ND and 100%
    over 2500) during the three seasons (Table 6). However, the ETa/ETm ratio values
    calculated by MOPECO for ND treatment were fully satisfied, excepting the second
    experimental season with 0.96 (Table 6). In this sense, López-Urrea et al. (2020)
    reported differences in the ETa and ETm simulated by the models. This research
    shows again that as water levels are reduced, the differences in simulated ETa
    and ETm across crop models are larger (mean values from 4% and 15% for ND to 11%
    and 20% for 70%, respectively; Table 6). The main factors that might explain these
    differences are: - The single and dual Kc approaches coded in MOPECO and AquaCrop
    models, respectively. The ETa/ETm ratio simulated for ND treatment by MOPECO was
    almost matched in the three seasons (≈1.0; Table 6), while AquaCrop failed to
    reach ratios higher than 0.85% because of the low simulated actual evaporation,
    since actual transpiration was close to the maximum (Table 6). - Runoff. The simulation
    of this variable by both models showed large differences, being between 76% and
    190% lower for AquaCrop. If the AquaCrop model considered the same water outtake
    by runoff as MOPECO, the ETa/ETm ratio simulated by both models would be reduced
    from 12% to 8% as the mean value, for the three seasons (Table 7). Table 7. Sensibility

    Kcb barley. Pereira et al. (2021b) updated the basal crop coefficient (Kcb) of
    field crops, such as grain legumes, oil crops and small grain cereals. In this
    case, Kcb for barley was determined as 1.00. Changing this value in the crop transpiration
    coefficient (KcTR = 1.10; Table 1), and simulating once again all treatments,
    the new mean differences in ETa/ETm ratio between the two models were around 8%
    (Table 7); attaining 4% mean difference when the same runoff value was considered
    (Table 7). This change in KcTR value did not generate a lower simulated yield
    for the different treatments, obtaining mean differences of around 1% (Table 7).
    Therefore, this sensitivity analysis on modifying KcTR for AquaCrop, would allow
    differences in ETa/ETm ratios between the two crop models to be reduced without
    significant effects on simulating crop yield and being close to the actual yield
    data. Table 6. Comparison of the evapotranspiration and runoff values simulated

    difference in %. Finally, Pohanková et al. (2018), testing the performance of
    several crop models with spring barley, simulated cumulative ETa from sowing to
    maturity with AquaCrop between 350 and 400 mm in three locations of Czech Republic.
    Although both climate conditions and the crop cycle lengths (given in days) are
    different to those in this research, the ETa simulated by these authors were similar
    to those shown in Table 6. In addition, they calculated the actual crop Transpiration
    (Ta) as 78% of ETa on average, being close to values found in the present paper
    (around 75% for AquaCrop). 4. Conclusions The AquaCrop and MOPECO models can be
    used to evaluate the effect of various irrigation schedules on crop yield and
    the water productivity response, given that, when both are well calibrated, they
    show no differences. The results obtained by the AquaCrop model allowed us to
    compare its performance with a larger number of measured barley growth variables
    (aboveground biomass, canopy cover and crop yield) than MOPECO (only crop yield).
    To generate these results, AquaCrop requires a large number of parameters, making
    its management somewhat more difficult than MOPECO. The range of simulations obtained
    by AquaCrop is higher than MOPECO, since, under semiarid conditions, it is able
    to simulate rainfed crop growth. Thus, when the accumulated ETa/ETm ratio is lower
    than 0.5 in one or more crop growth stages, MOPECO’s results may not be suitable.
    Although AquaCrop software has different options for building an automatic schedule
    irrigation, the optimized irrigation scheduling based on ORDI and ORDIL methodologies,
    provided by MOPECO, attained significant irrigation water productivity (IWP).
    Thus, considering the hypothesis of this research, the IWP simulated by MOPECO
    was between 8.0% and 28.0% higher than AquaCrop, with different irrigation water
    amounts applied to the crop. Therefore, if MOPECO is properly parameterized, this
    methodology can be of great help in establishing irrigation scheduling in areas
    with limited water resources to improve the IWP. Conversely, AquaCrop users must
    be sufficiently qualified to plan an irrigation strategy whose IWP levels can
    be similar than those reached by MOPECO, especially under deficit irrigation conditions.
    The effects of four irrigation strategies proposed by ORDIL methodology in both
    canopy cover and aboveground biomass evolution, as well as the final yield of
    barley crop during three-field seasons were appropriately simulated by AquaCrop.
    Therefore, the water deficit levels established by ORDIL for each crop barley
    development stage were in suitable ranges for simulating this crop with AquaCrop.
    Finally, we consider that a combination of both crop models may be especially
    interesting for analysis of the crop’s physiological behaviour in response to
    an optimized deficit irrigation strategy coded by MOPECO. Nevertheless, soil evaporation
    and crop transpiration data should be used with caution given the differences
    in findings between the crop models. Declaration of Competing interest The authors

    The olive (Olea europaea L.) tree has traditionally been cultivated in low-density
    orchards under rainfed conditions due to the drought tolerance capacity of this
    evergreen species [1]. However, growth and yield may be affected by the decrease
    in the photosynthetic rate of olive cultivars under rainfed conditions [2]. Since
    the 1970s there has been a steady increase in the land area occupied by irrigated
    olive orchards, which was accelerated by the appearance of super-high density
    plantations (SHD, 1500–2000 trees/ha) in the 1990s. The main advantage of highly
    mechanized SHD systems is the reduction in labor costs during pruning and harvesting.
    However, such systems require specific agronomic techniques and are very costly
    to set up [3]. Irrigation is very important in SHD olive groves to ensure high
    productivity, as the trees have a limited root volume, a high leaf area index
    and, in consequence, high water demands [4,5]. However, the application of excessive
    amounts of water can lead to uncontrolled vigor, the need for severe pruning to
    adapt the hedgerow to the operation of the mechanical harvester, and low lighting
    in the fruiting areas, producing an imbalance between growth and productivity
    [6]. Furthermore, water is a scarce resource [7]. According to the Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, agriculture is responsible for over
    70% of worldwide water consumption, and it is estimated that the amounts used
    for irrigation will rise by 14% in the next 10 years [8]. Therefore, to cope with
    water scarcity and to improve the profitability of SHD olive groves, water savings
    irrigation strategies must be used in order to control hedgerow vigor, as canopies
    with greater productive efficiency are key to increasing the viability of these
    systems [9]. RDI is a management strategy that imposes water deficits in phenological
    stages less sensitive to drought in order to restrain vegetative growth while
    not negatively impacting yield and fruit quality [10,11]. The phenological stage
    that is least sensitive to water deficit in the olive tree is the period from
    pit hardening to veraison [12,13]. Irrigation scheduling requires decision-making
    with respect to when and how much irrigation should be applied according to crop
    type, crop development and environmental conditions. The soil water balance (WB)
    method is widely used to determine the irrigation needs of a crop, where the water
    inputs to the soil-plant system must be balanced with the expected outputs. The
    most important component of the WB is the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) value,
    which is the crop water need that considers both evaporation from the soil and
    transpiration from the plants. The ETc is estimated as the product of the evapotranspiration
    of a reference crop (ETo) and a crop coefficient, Kc, in the form ETc = ETo ×
    Kc [14]. In this relationship, ETo represents the demand imposed by the meteorological
    conditions while Kc integrates the physical and biophysical differences between
    the reference crop and the crop which is to be estimated for evapotranspiration
    [14]. Irrigation scheduling based on WB presents the advantage of anticipating
    crop water requirements at certain times during the growing season and the possibility
    of planning irrigation accordingly [15]. However, this method presents the disadvantage
    that predicted ETc values could be inaccurate because of changes in annual weather
    patterns and differences in the production practices for which the Kc was developed
    [16]. An alternative to the WB-based method is to use soil moisture sensors to
    help plan irrigation scheduling. This method considers the soil as a water reserve
    for plant growth, and the idea is to ensure the reserve always has a sufficient
    amount of water available to the plant. Irrigation control is based on the monitoring
    and measurements of soil water content or water potential. Various types of these
    sensors have been used to determine soil water content [17]. In addition to the
    problem of having to weigh up the pros and cons of the different sensor types,
    the appropriate placement of sensors to accurately reflect the conditions experienced
    by the plant can be challenging [18]. Consideration needs to be given to the fact
    that soil water content patterns in the root zone are dynamic and influenced by
    soil hydraulic properties, spatial heterogeneity, crop characteristics and the
    irrigation system, among others. In drip irrigation, the local application of
    irrigation water results in even higher spatial variability in the soil water
    content patterns formed under the emitters [19]. In general, given the benefits
    and drawbacks of the WB-based and soil water content monitoring methods, combining
    both approaches seems the best way in the future to improve irrigation efficiency
    in agricultural systems: i.e., determine the irrigation dose from a WB model and
    then adapt that dosage through the use of sensors to the real situation of each
    plot. For this purpose, an interactive software-based decision support system
    (DSS) can be used to help decision-makers compile useful information from a combination
    of raw data, documents and personal knowledge. This information can then be deployed
    to identify and solve problems, and make optimized decisions. The simplest DSS
    designed to carry out automated irrigation consists of activating or deactivating
    irrigation when the sensor measurements are above or below predefined threshold
    values [15,20,21,22,23]. A more complex proposal is a DSS which combines the WB
    method with soil or plant sensors to readjust the ETc [24,25,26,27]. Millán et
    al. [28] used a DSS that executed a pre-established irrigation scheduling in which
    RDI was applied without human intervention in a plum crop. One aspect that complicates
    the efficient irrigation management of crops is plot heterogeneity, which depends
    on factors such as plot size, soil characteristics, orography, previous plot uses,
    etc. If the problem of soil spatial variability is not taken into account, an
    irrigation design may not be efficient [29]. Work on experimental plots rarely
    addresses these problems, which require the use of specialist tools to characterize
    spatial variability. Remote sensing and soil mapping are tools that can be used
    for agronomic crop management, allowing characterization of the development of
    the vegetation cover and the large-scale water status of the crop. Very interesting
    results have been obtained for olive groves with such tools [30]. Using data related
    to the electrical properties of the soil and multispectral images, easily available
    at high resolution, can be the best option to delineate different homogeneous
    zones. For instance, Pedrera-Parrilla et al. [31] and Moral et al. [32] used soil
    electrical data for zoning purposes, and Hall and Wilson [33] and Martínez-Casanovas
    et al. [34] utilized vegetation indices computed from multispectral images. The
    use of satellite data to evaluate changes in vegetation properties aimed at applications
    in precision agriculture has also been investigated [35,36]. Coarse resolution
    satellite images are useful tools to describe the phenology of the vegetation
    [37]. Crop monitoring offers direct information for the analysis of the spatial
    variability of the crop area. On the basis of such information management actions
    can be taken to improve production practices. The information can be used to adjust
    and direct fertilization, determine crop development, adapt irrigation to the
    needs of the crop, and schedule the harvest. One way to determine crop development
    is based on the use of reflectance measurements, which differ depending on the
    type of surface and, in the case of plants, the species, cultivar, and plant status
    [38]. From this information, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
    can be computed (ratio of the difference of the values of reflectance in the near
    infrared and red bands and their sum). It is known that NDVI is a good indicator
    of the state of development of vegetation and, in consequence, can be used to
    detect canopy differences within a field [39]. The objectives of this study were
    to test the technical feasibility and to evaluate the productive response of a
    heterogeneous plot in an SHD olive grove cv. ‘Arbequina’ when using a DSS to carry
    out a fully automated irrigation scheduling and implementing RDI strategies based
    on the information obtained through remote sensing and soil monitoring. 2. Materials
    and Methods 2.1. Site Description and Experimental Design This work was performed
    over the course of three years (2015–2017) in a 9.31 ha commercial hedgerow olive
    grove (Olea europaea L.) planted with cv. ‘Arbequina’. The farm is located in
    the municipality of Alvarado, about 16 km east of Badajoz in southwestern Spain
    (38°49′27.15″ N, 6°46′ 18.39″ W, datum WGS84). The trees were planted in autumn
    2007 at a density of 1.852 olive trees/ha (4 × 1.35 m), with a north-south orientation
    and trained to a central axis. The predominant soil in this field was classified
    as a Haplic Fluvisol according to the FAO (2006). Soil maintenance involved the
    practice of non-tillage and the application of herbicides to ensure it remained
    free of weeds. The climate of the area is Mediterranean with a mild Atlantic influence,
    with a dry season from June to September (summer) and a wet season from October
    to May (winter) in which 80% of total precipitation falls. Average ETo and precipitation
    p-values in the area were 1188.25 mm and 503.56 mm, respectively, for the 2007–2017
    period. For the same period, the average maximum and minimum air temperature values
    were 23.49 °C and 9.56 °C, respectively. The hottest months are July and August.
    Maximum temperatures of over 40 °C are recorded nearly every year, with peak values
    rarely over 45 °C. The coolest months are December and January. Temperatures below
    0 °C are recorded every year, with minimum values rarely below −5 °C. The meteorological
    information was obtained from a weather station located in the same study plot
    at a height of 3 m above ground level (in line with a tree row). Trees were irrigated
    daily using a drip system with a single lateral line per tree row located close
    to the base of the tree, with pressure-compensating drippers spaced at 0.67 m
    and with 1.6 L h−¹ discharge rates. The plot is described in more detail in Millán
    et al. [40]. 2.2. Characterization of Spatial Variability of the Plot, Selection
    of Control Points and Soil Analysis One very important aspect, which complicates
    the efficient irrigation management of crops, is plot heterogeneity. When establishing
    an automatic irrigation system it is, therefore, important to know the spatial
    variation in soil and crop development. A satellite image and a Dualem-1S non-contact
    sensor (Dualem, Inc., Milton, ON, Canada) were used to evaluate the heterogeneity
    of the plot. The NDVI measurement was provided by the Sentinel-2A (European Space
    Agency, ESA) satellite with an image taken in August of 2015 with no cloud cover.
    The image was processed and analyzed in QGIS 2.18 (https://www.qgis.org) using
    DOS1 atmospheric correction. The Dualem-1S sensor was used to measure apparent
    electrical conductivity (ECa) and was equipped with a global positioning system
    (GPS) antenna. The sensor comprised a transmitter operating at a frequency of
    9 kHz and two receivers with different orientations. There was a 1 m separation
    between the transmitter (Tx) and the two receivers (Rx). The ECa was measured
    at 0–0.50 m and 0–1.50 m depths. The sensor was introduced into a 3 m long polyvinyl
    chloride (PVC) structure which was transported by a pickup truck traveling at
    an average speed of 9 km h−¹. Due to the height of the vehicle, ECa readings were
    carried out of the 0–0.40 m and 0–1.40 m soil layers, assuming that the ECa of
    the air is zero. In this study, we used the ECa measurements of the top layer
    (0–0.40 m). The ECa measurements were taken in August 2015 along different parallel
    transects that were approximately 4 m apart. The Dualem-1S was programmed to register
    measurements each second, and a total of 3313 ECa measurements were obtained in
    the plot. Ordinary kriging was used to develop the ECa map. Figure 1a shows the
    soil ECa map and Figure 1b the NDVI map. ECa is related to different soil characteristics
    that directly or indirectly influence the availability of water for cultivation.
    The map was made in August when the water content was mostly from irrigation.
    These served as the basis for determining the control points in the study plot.
    As seen in Figure 1a, the values classified as low, medium and high (because the
    ECa values may change with different water contents in the plot) allowed identification
    of areas with different ECa values in the plot. The highest ECa values were found
    in the southwestern, northwestern and eastern areas of the experimental field,
    corresponding to a higher water retention capacity. Soil texture was one of variables
    considered in the geostatistical analysis for identifying the management zones
    in the plot [40]. Analysis of the satellite image (Figure 1b) allowed identification
    of the areas with highest and lowest canopy crop development. The NDVI showed
    the highest values to be in the northern and central areas of the field. These
    intra-field ECa and vigor differences are due to a complex interaction of biological,
    agronomic, edaphic, anthropogenic, topographic and climatic factors [32]. Figure
    1. (a) Map of soil apparent electrical conductivity (EC) measured with a Dualem-1S
    sensor. High EC values are between 15–20 (mS/m), medium values between 10–15 (mS/m)
    and low values between 5–10 (mS/m); (b) Normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI) map using a satellite image obtained from Sentinel-2A. High NDVI values
    are between 0.45–0.50, medium values between 0.40–0.45 and low values between
    0.35–0.40, and; (c) maps of the different zones established in the study area.
    Circles 1, 2, 3 and 4 indicate the locations of the sampling sites where irrigation
    was managed manually, and circles CR1, CR2, CR3 and CR4 sites where irrigation
    was applied automatically. With the information obtained from Figure 1a,b, a new
    map was generated (Figure 1c) using the map algebra tool (raster calculator) in
    QGIS 2.18. As can be seen in Figure 1c, three different zones were established:
    Zone 1 (T1): where the ECa and NDVI values were medium or high. The sampling points
    1 and 2 were found in this zone. Zone 2 (T2): where the ECa and NDVI values were
    low. The sampling points 3 and 4 were found in this zone. Zone 3 (CR): where the
    ECa values were low and the NDVI values were medium or high. The sampling control
    points CR1, CR2, CR3 and CR4 were found in this zone. The maps made during the
    first year served as a basis to establish in the following seasons in situ control
    areas. Each control area consisted of 3 rows of 6 trees each. The various measurements
    that were subsequently taken were made in the 4 central trees of each control
    area. The DSS-managed automatic irrigation system was established in Zone 3. This
    had the most unfavorable conditions for the hedgerow olive grove and corresponded
    to places with medium or high vigor and low ECa values. In this zone, three control
    points were selected CR1, CR2, CR3 (2016 and 2017) (Figure 1) and in 2017 one
    more control point, CR4 (Figure 1), was added to check the system in different
    soil and crop conditions Zones 1 and 2 were used to compare the irrigation scheduling
    carried out in Zone 3. These two first zones were irrigated according to the expert
    technical criteria. In both zones, two sampling points were selected, in Zone
    1 (T1) points 1 and 2, and in Zone 2 (T2) points 3 and 4 (Figure 1). At these
    points, irrigation volumes were recorded daily using digital water meters (CZ2000-3M,
    Contazara, Zaragoza, Spain). Table 1 shows the soil properties in the study area.
    Soil samples were collected on 15 November 2015 at the different control points
    whose coordinates were determined using a Mesa-Geode positioning system (Juniper
    Systems, Logan, UT, USA) at two depths: at 0.0–0.30 m and at 0.30–0.60 m. All
    soil samples were transported to the lab in plastic bags and were air-dried, ground,
    and passed through a 2 mm sieve. The soil was characterized in terms of texture,
    pH and organic matter (OM). Soil texture was determined by mechanical analysis
    with the hydrometer method [41], pH was measured in a 1:2.5 (soil: water) suspension
    using the potentiometric method [42] and OM was determined by dichromate oxidation
    [43]. Table 1. Soil analysis in the studied points. 2.3. Decision Support System
    (DSS) In order to carry out the automatic irrigation, the DSS comprised two components:
    (a) sensors installed in the field and (b) IRRIX, a web platform whose algorithm
    is based on a combination of the water balance with soil moisture sensor feedback
    adjustment mechanisms. (a) Sensors installed in the field: to monitor the soil
    moisture, 10 HS capacitive moisture sensors (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA,
    USA) were installed at different positions (position A and position B) (Figure
    2) in the different control points selected (CR1, CR2, CR3 and CR4). Two drippers
    were monitored at each control point. Four moisture sensors were placed under
    each dripper in the position A, two at a depth of 0.30 m and the others at a depth
    of 0.60 m. In addition, one measure sensor was situated between the two drippers
    in the position B at a depth of 0.30 m (Figure 2). These 5 moisture sensors were
    installed in each of the control points (CR1, CR2 and CR3) in 2016, making a total
    of 15 sensors. In 2017, the number of soil moisture sensors was increased from
    15 to 20, as a new control point was added (CR4). When an error was detected in
    any of the sensors that had been installed, that sensor was automatically replaced
    with another in the same position. Figure 2. Sensor location. A solenoid valve
    (Rain Bird Europe SCN, Aix-en-Provence, France) and pulse water meter (Lab-Ferrer
    S.L., Cervera, Lleida, Spain) were also installed at each control point to measure
    and monitor each irrigation event. An air temperature sensor (CS2015, Campbell
    Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA) was also installed in a central point of the
    zone. All sensors were connected to a datalogger (CR1000, Campbell Scientific
    Inc., Logan, UT, USA) via cables. In addition, a voltage regulator (BlueSolar
    PWM-Pro, Vitron Energy BluePower, The Netherlands) and a relay module (SMD-CD16AC,
    Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA) were also connected to the datalogger
    to control the opening and closing of the solenoid valves according to the programming
    established by the system. The program used in the datalogger was written in CR
    Basic (Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA) and implemented the functionalities
    of an irrigation automata. All data were stored each 5 min. The data was downloaded
    to an IRRIX server four times a day. The distance between the different control
    points for automatic irrigation was limited by the maximum possible cable distance
    to maintain the electrical signal with sufficient quality. With this limitation,
    it was decided to locate the control points in the same area, the most disadvantaged
    one, which required more precise control of the irrigation (sandier texture and
    more vigorous trees). (b) IRRIX is a cloud-hosted web platform that carries out
    the following daily tasks: Data collection of sensors installed in the field (Figure
    3). IRRIX downloads sensor data at periodic intervals throughout the day and at
    the user’s request. Analysis of all data and calculation of irrigation water volumes.
    Once a day, IRRIX analyses the set of data to determine the irrigation dose using
    the information provided by the moisture sensors. To achieve this, this tool integrates
    an algorithm which combines a WB-based estimation of crop water needs (feed-forward
    control) with readjustment based on sensor readings (feedback control). [25,28,44]
    Irrigation scheduling. IRRIX sends the updated irrigation doses to the datalogger.
    Then, this device orders the activation of the rest of the equipment (solenoid
    valve or pumps, etc.) to apply the required irrigation doses. Interaction with
    users. IRRIX is an autonomous system whose main objective is to free the user
    from work. The main function of the user is to check that the system has worked
    correctly. Logically, if there is any anomaly in the system it has to be resolved
    by the user. Figure 3. Tasks carried out by IRRIX. Before starting the irrigation
    campaign, the user must input to IRRIX a plan that provides a rough estimation
    of how the water will be distributed throughout the campaign. This seasonal plan
    is drawn up by an expert who determines the guidelines that the irrigation must
    follow, in this case taking into account the deficit periods. This plan represents
    the cumulative irrigation water amount throughout the campaign. In order to adapt
    to the conditions of each year, upper and lower limits are set to this baseline.
    For this, a set of curves has to be defined, with the automated control system
    positioned between those curves in such a way that the system must be between
    a maximum and a minimum cumulative irrigation value. 2.4. Irrigation Scheduling
    The irrigation carried out on the plot in the different years was the following:
    In 2015, all the plot zones were irrigated according to the criteria of the farmer.
    In 2016, all the plot zones were irrigated according to expert technical criteria
    [45]. In the T1 and T2 zones, the irrigation scheduling was under human control
    (non-automatic irrigation scheduling, NAIS). Irrigation was controlled by solenoid
    valves operated by a commercial automaton, Agronic 4000 (Sistemes Electrònics
    Progrés, Palau d’Anglesola, Lleida, Spain), which was programmed remotely, every
    Monday, using the desktop application provided by the manufacturer. The CR1, CR2
    and CR3 control points were irrigated automatically through the IRRIX system (automatic
    irrigation scheduling, AIS), without human intervention. The scheduled irrigation
    dose was independent at each control point. The irrigation criterion was the same
    in both cases: a light RDI to preserve oil yield. Irrigation scheduling was adjusted
    according to measurements of midday stem water potential (Ψstem) made in T1 and
    T2: ○ Phase I, from sprouting (early in March) until the beginning of the olive
    pit hardening stage (beginning of July) [45]. The threshold established for Phase
    I was −1.4 MPa [12], which means the implementation of only a slight water deficit.
    ○ Phase II, from the beginning of the hardening of olive pit until the beginning
    of veraison (mid-September) [45]. The threshold established for Phase II was −2.0
    MPa [12]. ○ Phase III, from the end of Phase II until harvest [45]. The threshold
    established for Phase III was −1.6 MPa [12]. For T1 and T2, the ETo was calculated
    according to the formula of Penman and Monteith [14], modified using the data
    obtained through an external meteorological network (REDAREX, http://redarexplus.gobex.es),
    and weekly Ψstem measurements were used to adjust irrigation. In the case of CR1,
    CR2 and CR3, the ETo was estimated daily from the air temperature sensor using
    the Hargreaves equation [46] and Ψstem values were not used to adjust irrigation.
    To carry out irrigation at these points through the DSS, the olive irrigation
    expert [45] provided a modified Kc (Kc mod.) that took into account the deficit
    irrigation strategy. This Kc mod., which has to be introduced into IRRIX at the
    beginning of the irrigation campaign (Figure 4) for the preparation of the seasonal
    plan, was established on the basis of technical experience in the same plot with
    a view to attaining the target Ψstem for each of the previously described phases.
    At the CR1, CR2 and CR3 points, irrigation scheduling was carried out independently
    and aimed to simulate the irrigation that was carried out in T1 and T2. Figure
    4. Crop coefficient (Kc) values according to the physiological state of the olive
    grove. Kc was adjusted to the crop conditions of Extremadura and was calculated
    with the Orgaz et al. [47] method using the 10-year average, and Kc mod. was adapted
    to the deficit irrigation strategy. In 2017, irrigation scheduling was similar
    to that of the previous year, but one more control point was added (CR4) where
    automatic irrigation was also carried out. As in the other CR points, the CR4
    irrigation scheduling was carried out independently. The CR1 and CR2 automatic
    irrigation scheduling was carried out in the DSS on the basis of the information
    provided by the sensors located in CR2. In accordance with the evolution of Ψstem,
    a series of adjustments were made in 2017 in relation to the seasonal plan (due
    to the fact that this year was unusually dry) and the soil comfort zone in relation
    to the sensor readings. This soil comfort zone specifies to the control system
    the acceptable range for the soil moisture sensor measurements and their pre-established
    boundaries were empirically readjusted to fit with the observed range. A summary
    of the irrigation scheduling followed in this study is shown in Table 2. Table
    2. Irrigation scheduling carried out in the different zones. 2.5. Physiological
    and Agronomic Measurements 2.5.1. Water Status and Canopy Volume The Ψstem was
    measured once a week with a pressure chamber (Model 3005, Soil Moisture Equipment
    Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). One shaded-leaf per tree was selected near the
    base of the trunk and covered with aluminum foil at least two hours before the
    measurements [48]. This selection was carried out between 12:00 and 13:00 h solar
    time. Determinations were made in four trees per control point. The average Ψstem
    value was used to calculate the irrigation correction in T1 and T2. This average
    was compared with the threshold value and the deviation was calculated. 2.5.2.
    Yield Data and Oil Content In 2015, yield measurements were made for the T1, T2,
    CR1, CR2 and CR3 sampling points. The yield control points were increased by one
    (CR4) in 2017. At each control point, 4 olive trees were hand harvested when the
    trees reached a maturity index (MI) of approximately 2.5. A weekly sampling was
    carried out in every control point from the beginning of veraison. On each occasion,
    a sample of one hundred olives was classified in eight color groups, and the MI
    was calculated according to the procedure described in [49]. The yield of each
    tree was weighed separately, and subsamples of 100 olive fruits from the total
    harvest of the four trees were collected to determine the average weight of the
    fruit and the number of fruits per tree. All subsamples were weighed fresh. Oil
    content was measured for a 1 kg sample of the four trees by Soxhlet extraction
    in accordance with EEC Regulation 2568/1991 [50]. For this, the sample was crushed
    and dried in a DryBig 250 oven (Borel Fours Industriels and Etuves, S.A., Neuchâtel,
    Switzerland) at 105 °C. In this study, the trees were harvested in late October
    and early November. 2.6. Statistical Analysis An analysis of variance (ANOVA)
    was used for the statistical analysis of the data. When significant differences
    were detected, a comparison of means was made applying Duncan’s test at p < 0.05.
    The statistical package IBM SPSS version 24.0 for Windows (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY,
    USA) was used. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Climatic Conditions Table 3 shows
    the mean temperature (Tmean) and mean relative humidity of the air (RHmean) for
    each of the three phases in the three study years as well as the annual mean values,
    and the cumulative rainfall, ETc and ETo (calculated using the Penman–Monteith
    (ETo-PM) and Hargreaves (ETo-H) methods) values for each of the three phases in
    the three study years as well as the annual cumulative values. The highest Tmean
    and lowest RHmean values were observed in 2017. The highest Tmean values were
    reached in Phase II (summer months) in all years, and the lowest in Phase III
    in 2015 and 2017 and in Phase I in 2016. Cumulative rainfall in the experimental
    period amounted to 181 mm in 2015, 152 mm in 2016 and 76 mm in 2017. Annual cumulative
    rainfall ranged from 475 mm (2016), the rainiest year, to 265 mm (2017), the driest
    year as well as the year with the highest annual ETo values. The annual ETo-PM
    was very similar in the three years of study, with higher values in Phase I. The
    ETo-H followed the same seasonal trend as ETo-PM, although with slightly higher
    values. The ETo-H overestimated the ETo-PM by 7% on average. The annual ETc was
    834 mm, 861 mm and 894 mm for 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Table 3. Mean
    temperature (Tmean), mean relative humidity (RHmean), cumulative rainfall and
    cumulative evapotranspiration (ETo) and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) for each
    year and each phase of the crop cycle. 3.2. Applied Water Table 4 shows the irrigation
    amounts supplied in each phase in the three study years. It should be noted that
    2017 was unusually dry, and so the amount of applied irrigation water was higher
    due to the low rainfall and high ETo. Comparing the different control points in
    each zone, it is possible to observe how in 2015 the irrigation applied was very
    similar in all cases for each Phase and in total. In 2016, the AIS zones received
    less water than T1 and T2, mainly in Phase II with 16% less, with a consequent
    total water saving of 24%. It should be noted that at sampling point 4 (in T2)
    there was an irrigation system failure during Phase II and, therefore, the water
    applied in that phase was lower than for points 1, 2 and 3 in T1 and T2. In 2017,
    AIS applied more water in Phase I in CR1, CR2 and CR3 points and less water in
    Phases II and III than the amounts applied at the T1, T2, T3 and T4 points. It
    is observed that the AIS emulates the expert scheduling and obtained a 6% reduction
    in applied water compared to the NAIS system. The DSS schedules irrigation independently
    at each of the points in accordance with the particular conditions that exist
    in each zone. Table 4. Irrigation supplied at each sampling point in the three
    study years. The ability of the automatic system to respond differently in each
    of the control points may, therefore, respond to differences in soil water reserves
    which depend on soil texture and crop water demand at each particular point. This
    information is provided continuously by the frequency domain reflectometry (FDR)
    sensors. However, the greater or lesser presence of roots in the area where the
    sensors are located also needs to be taken into account. In addition, it is important
    to consider the size of the roots as this can affect the readings of the FDR sensors,
    with an increase in root system size resulting in increasingly larger underestimations
    of the true volumetric water content, presumably because of the water in the roots
    [51]. With regard to the (rain + irrigation)/crop evapotranspiration relationship
    (Table 4), the crop received less water in relation to its needs in 2015, when
    irrigation was carried out at the farmer’s discretion. Figure 5 shows cumulative
    irrigation at the NASI and AIS points in 2016 and 2017. The irrigation amount
    was lower in 2016 than in 2017, as 2017 was a drier year. In 2016, the water applied
    until early July was very similar in all points but, after this date, more water
    began to be applied at T1 and less water at CR1. In 2017, the irrigation season
    started a month earlier and the initial irrigations differed at the different
    points until converging in August. From that date onwards, more water was applied
    at CR3 than the rest of the points until the end of the irrigation campaign. As
    water volumes were higher in 2017, the maximum and minimum limits are also higher
    as they were established as percentages of the campaign schedule. The irrigation
    pattern was different at each CR point, with the greatest differences observed
    in Phase II in the case of CR1, CR2 and CR3. In the case of CR4, the pattern was
    different from the rest: more water was applied in Phase II and less in Phase
    III. In summary, the water applied generally followed the same pattern in the
    different control points in 2016, while in 2017 there was a change in trend during
    Phase II. Figure 5. Cumulative irrigation in the different zones (a) 2016 and
    (b) 2017. max and min correspond respectively to the maximum and minimum limits
    set in the seasonal plan. 3.3. Soil Water Content With respect to soil water content,
    Table 5 specifies the high and low reference values of each of the moisture sensors
    during the years 2016 and 2017. IRRIX establishes two parameters for each sensor:
    a high reference (field capacity, FC) and a low reference (in deficit irrigation
    conditions). The high reference represents the value recorded by that sensor under
    soil FC conditions, and this value can be obtained out of season after rain. The
    low reference is determined for each sensor at the driest value recorded every
    day. A more detailed description can be found in Millán et al. [28] of how IRRIX
    determines the high and low reference for each sensor. These high and low reference
    values serve to reduce the variability between the sensors and to obtain homogeneous
    reference points for the different sensors. It can be seen in Table 6 that the
    high reference value of each sensor was higher in 2016 than in 2017, with the
    exception of sensors 1 (S1) and 3 (S3) located in CR1 and sensor 10 (S10) in CR2.
    As for the low reference, the values are lower in 2016 than in 2017 except for
    the sensors that are located in position A at 0.60 m in CR1 and CR2 and sensor
    12 (S12) in CR3. The references established for each sensor changed every year,
    as IRRIX is a dynamic system that adapts to the conditions of each campaign and
    even to changes during the campaign itself. Table 5. High and low reference values
    of each of the moisture sensors. Table 6. Mean values ± standard error of yield,
    number of fruits per tree, oil yield and water-use efficiency during the three
    study years. The temporal evolution of soil water content (SWC) is presented in
    Figure 6 for control point CR2 in 2017. With respect to the position under dripper
    (A) at 0.3 m depth (Figure 6a,b), the sensors followed the same overall pattern.
    These sensors are very sensitive to irrigation, responding quickly even to low
    volumes of rain or irrigation. Furthermore, these sensors had a very marked response
    amplitude between minimums before irrigation and maximums at the end of irrigation.
    It can be seen in Figure 6b that, in Phase II, sensor 8 (S8) presented a different
    behavior to sensor 6 (S6) (Figure 6a), as the S8 responded to applied irrigation
    during a certain period of time. This result may be attributable to the place
    where the emitter was located because of the spatial variability of the moisture
    distribution in the soil. Figure 6. Temporal trends of soil moisture measured
    by moisture sensors located in different positions: (a) A at 0.3 m depth, (b)
    A at 0.3 m depth, (c) A at 0.6 m depth, (d) A at 0.6 m depth and (e) B at 0.3
    m depth. Θw is the moisture content. All the probes were installed at CR2 for
    the automatic irrigation system. The brown line corresponds to the high reference
    value of the sensor and the red line to the low reference value. The period represented
    corresponds to the irrigation campaign in the year 2017. DOY is the day of the
    year. Probes located at 0.6 m depth (Figure 6c,d) showed less difference between
    the maximum and minimum and also responded quickly to small amounts of rain as
    did the probes located at 0.3 m. The two sensors (S7 and S9) showed different
    behavior throughout the study period. Normally, sensors installed in the same
    position follow the same pattern but, as sometimes these sensors show a totally
    different behavior, consideration needs to be given to sensor-to-sensor variability.
    This variability is greater in the case of localized irrigation, since wet bulbs
    are formed around the emitters while the rest of the soil may be only slightly
    affected or not at all by the irrigation. Due to the existence of spatial variability,
    sensor variability can be aggravated in the case of woody crops since the moisture
    sensors need to be installed in the area of the bulb where there may be more roots
    [25,28]. Kang et al. [51] indicated that the size of the root can affect the readings
    of FDR sensors. A careful interpretation is therefore required when FDR sensors
    are used to determine soil moisture content. Sensor variability can also be due
    to changes that occur in the dielectric properties of the soil [52] or other soil
    properties, especially bulk density and the existence of macropores. The sensors
    installed in position A at 0.3 m depth presented a range of very different measurements.
    For example, the S6 had maximum values of 0.447 m3/m3 with a measurement range
    (the measurement range is the sensor reading at the beginning and end of the irrigation
    season) of about 0.371 to 0.389 m3/m3 while the S8 presented maximum values of
    0.385 m3/m3 with a measurement range of 0.331 to 0.334 m3/m3. At 0.6 m depth,
    the measurement ranges between sensors located under the same position also varied
    considerably. The S7 had maximum values of 0.419 m3/m3 with a measurement range
    of about 0.309 to 0.338 m3/m3 and the S9 presented maximum values of 0.394 m3/m3
    with a measurement range of 0.213 to 0.307 m3/m3. It must be considered that as
    sensor depth increases the presence of water in the lower layers is greater, which
    may be due to the arrival of water from other points. In addition, soil moisture
    fluctuations decreased with depth. Mittelbach et al. [53] established that 10HS
    sensors do not capture the daily soil moisture content fluctuations for moist
    conditions and that soil moisture fluctuations are almost negligible at 0.25 m
    depth and below. In the position between drippers (B) at 0.30 m depth (Figure
    6e), the sensors responded to low applications of rain or irrigation. It can be
    seen how sensor 10 (S10) was sensitive to small irrigation amounts and showed
    a greater amplitude between the maximum and minimum during the study period. In
    the case of S10, the values of the measurements of the 10HS probes did not surpass
    0.371 m3/m3. This may mainly be due to the creation of preferential channels in
    the soil and, because of this, the water from one or more drippers moving to the
    place where the sensor is located. It should be noted that Phase I corresponds
    to a period of mild stress, and a slight decrease in the amount of water in the
    soil is observed in Figure 6a,c,d and a more pronounced decrease in Figure 6b.
    In Phase II there is a clear decrease in SWC in Figure 6a–d. In Phase III there
    is a delay in the response to the increase in irrigation that coincides with the
    onset of rainfall. 3.4. Crop Water Status and Productivity Figure 7 shows the
    Ψstem evolution in 2015 (Figure 7a), 2016 (Figure 7b) and 2017 (Figure 7c) for
    all control points. A declining trend of Ψstem can be seen in Phases I and II
    as the irrigation season advanced, followed by an increase in Phase III to the
    end of the irrigation campaign. In 2015 (Figure 7a), when all the areas were irrigated
    according to the farmer’s criteria, there was a marked difference in Ψstem at
    the different control points. At all points, Ψstem was above the reference threshold
    value in all three phases (shown by a horizontal dotted line in all the figures),
    except in zone T2 which fell below it on several days in Phase II. The highest
    values, recorded in Phase I at the beginning of spring, were around −0.66 MPa,
    −0.87 MPa, −0.79 MPa, −0.70 MPa and −0.57 MPa for T1, T2, CR1, CR2 and CR3, respectively.
    The minimum Ψstem was at mid-summer in Phase II with average values of −1.67,
    −2.43 MPa, −1.12 MPa, −1.22 MPa and −1.67 MPa in T1, T2, CR1, CR2 and CR3, respectively.
    Figure 7. Seasonal patterns of midday stem water potential (Ψstem) during the
    2015 (a), 2016 (b) and 2017 (c) seasons in representative trees at each control
    point. Each value is the mean of four measurements ± standard error. The vertical
    dashed line indicates the moment at which each phase ends. The horizontal dashed
    line indicates the threshold established for each crop phase. Different letters
    in the same column indicate statistically significant differences according to
    Duncan’s multiple range test (p < 0.05). Letters are not shown when no differences
    were found. DOY is the day of the year. In 2016 (Figure 7b), when introducing
    the expert criteria for irrigation scheduling, the differences in water status
    between the different control points throughout the entire irrigation season decreased,
    but especially in Phase II. Higher Ψstem values were obtained in CR1 and CR2 than
    the other control points throughout the irrigation season, while CR3 presented
    the lowest Ψstem values of around −2.36 and −2.69 MPa reaching the pre-established
    threshold in Phase II and Phase III, respectively. T1 and T2 also remained above
    the pre-established limits throughout the irrigation season, except for the days
    on which CR3 remained below the pre-established limits in Phase II and Phase III,
    because there was an irrigation failure. In 2017, the AIS achieved a greater adjustment
    at CR1 and CR2 to the Ψstem targets. CR4 had a similar evolution of Ψstem to the
    other control points. Greater homogeneity in crop water status between the different
    points was achieved in 2017 than in 2016. The Ψstem values where AIS was carried
    out followed the same pattern as the Ψstem values in T1 and T2 (NAIS) in 2016
    and 2017, despite the application of different irrigation volumes, due to dosage
    readjustment made by the IRRIX system with the information provided by the soil
    probes. The typical spring rainfall and the accumulation of water reserves in
    the soil during autumn and winter can make it difficult to induce water stress,
    and the Ψstem values can sometimes exceed the proposed thresholds during the irrigation
    season [13,54,55,56,57,58,59,60]. In addition, the algorithm used in the areas
    where irrigation was carried out automatically showed a good response to the RDI
    strategies. While some researchers have previously worked with a web platform
    whose algorithm results from a combination of the water balance with feedback
    from soil moisture sensors to perform automatic irrigation [24,25,26], this is
    the first time that the algorithms used to establish the automated irrigation
    have been shown to respond well to RDI in an olive grove, maintaining the water
    status of the plant. The results for yield, number of fruits per tree, oil yield
    and water productivity (WP) for olives and for oil are presented in Table 6. In
    2015, significant differences between different control points were found in yield,
    number of fruits per tree, oil yield and WP, with CR2 the least productive and
    with significant differences with T2. In 2016, CR1 and CR3 showed no significant
    differences in yield with respect to irrigation carried out with expert supervision.
    However, CR2 had lower yield, number of fruits per tree, oil yield, WP yield and
    WP oil yield than the other control points, which could be due to alternation
    in crop yield between more and less productive years as is common in this cultivar.
    With regard to 2017, yield increased in all control points, with CR2 the most
    productive. In addition, the WP yield and the WP oil yield also increased notably
    compared to the previous two years, with 52 kg of olives and about 8.5 kg of oil
    produced per cubic meter of water provided in CR2. This can be attributed to the
    lower crop load level in CR2 in 2015 and 2016. The number of fruits per tree also
    increased with respect to previous years, being significantly higher in CR1 and
    CR2. No statistically significant differences were found in oil yield at the different
    control points. Introducing the strategy recommended by the expert led to an increase
    in yield and a tendency to ploy homogenization in 2017, especially with respect
    to oil production which showed no statistically significant differences between
    the various control points. Moriana et al. [12] previously demonstrated that the
    RDI strategy used in this experiment and for this crop presented significant differences
    in yield or oil yield with respect to a control treatment in which the trees were
    irrigated with 100% ETc. The heterogeneity of a commercial plot irrigated with
    the same criteria causes differences between the various plants on the plot. By
    characterizing this variability and considering these differences for irrigation
    scheduling, the use of RDI strategies has been shown to lead to greater plot homogenization.
    This is of great importance for the use of automated irrigation systems where
    the selection of the control zone(s) that will govern decision making is important.
    Automatic irrigation has been shown to be capable of simulating expert judgement
    in the application of RDI strategies based on crop water status. The system improved
    its performance after the first year of adjustment. Recent studies have reported
    that RDI strategies can be advantageous in SHD olive orchards in terms of reducing
    water applications, decreasing excessive tree vigor, improving irradiance environments
    and increasing yield, oil quality and water-use efficiency [1,6,61,62,63]. The
    results of the present study provide evidence that an RDI strategy can be applied
    through a DSS in a plot of SHD olive orchards with no negative effects on yield,
    number of fruits per tree, oil yield, WP yield or WP oil yield, if there is prior
    spatial characterization and pre-established criteria for decision making. Characterization
    of the spatial variability of the plot is very important in the case of a hedgerow
    olive grove, since an area with greater vigor is not always related to higher
    productivity [40]. In addition, a better irrigation management in an area with
    lower water retention capacity (sandy soil) allows more balanced vegetative growth,
    which is necessary for hedgerow olive grove productivity [64]. Phase II is considered
    the most important for an automatic irrigation system, and adjustment of the deficit
    irrigation dosages determined by a field expert can be better controlled by an
    automatic system analyzing crop water needs and soil moisture. During this phase,
    plant water status can be better controlled in more unfavorable zones, enabling
    all field zones to enjoy the correct water status. 4. Conclusions This work aimed
    to evaluate and develop an automated irrigation protocol in a hedgerow olive orchard
    using the IRRIX platform. In this case, the device had to simulate a recommended
    irrigation strategy for this type of plantation that included the use of regulated
    deficit irrigation. The characterization of the spatial variability was useful
    to locate the control points. The automatic irrigation scheduling simulated the
    expert criterion, adapting to the specific conditions of the control point where
    the soil sensors were installed. The total amount of manually and automatically
    applied irrigation water was similar at the various control points, but not its
    distribution as the DSS estimated the water needs by combining the water balance
    method with a feedback mechanism based on the moisture sensor readings. In addition,
    the DSS was able to establish an RDI strategy which induced moderate-to-severe
    stress during Phase II of the crop in the parts of the plot with the most unfavorable
    conditions for the hedgerow (places with high vigor and low ECa). The adoption
    of an appropriate RDI strategy in an SHD olive grove enabled homogenization of
    plot yield, with a tendency to increase production. The automatic irrigation allowed
    irrigation management with minimum human intervention. The results obtained with
    the system improved in the third year, when adjustments were made based on the
    information collected in the previous year. The automated irrigation has proven
    to be able to adapt to the particular conditions of the place where it is installed
    and to the different growth stages of the crop, thus improving the key efficiency
    parameters. Automatic irrigation scheduling is of particular interest in the case
    of olive groves. In this crop, monitoring stem water potentials at commercial
    level for crop phase dosage readjustment is complicated by the strongly negative
    values that can be attained but which cannot be measured with a pump-up pressure
    chamber. Although the results were encouraging, further studies are required to
    improve certain aspects of the system, particularly relating to the integration
    of the NDVI and ECa measurements into the DSS. Author Contributions S.M. (≈45%):

  description: Agroecosystems provide food, energy, and essential services, while
    accounting for 80% of the world's total water use. Producing more food with limited
    water resources or improving water use efficiency (WUE) is an urgent task, especially
    in arid and semi-arid areas with fragile ecosystems and severe water shortages.
    This study integrated crop type distribution, irrigation data, remote sensing
    imagery, and meteorological factors to simulate the crop yield, water consumption,
    and WUE in the Heihe River Basin of China during 2007–2012. We found that variations
    in water consumption had little impact on crop yield because the value far exceeded
    the actual water requirement. From 2007 to 2012, the water consumption of corn
    increased by 11.24%, while its yield decreased by 0.63%. In contrast, the water
    consumptions of wheat, oilseed rape, and other crops decreased by 15.45%, 10.32%,
    and 4.61%, while their yields increased by 2.41%, 8.91%, and 1.13%, respectively.
    Consequently, the WUE of corn decreased by 10.68%, while that of oilseed rape,
    wheat, barley, and other crops increased by 21.44%, 21.13%, 4.96%, and 6.02%,
    respectively. The expansion of the area planted with corn led to a 3.36% increase
    in the WUE of the basin. However, this agricultural development is clearly unsustainable
    because it increased agricultural water consumption and decreased the ecological
    and domestic water supply. On-demand irrigation is therefore necessary to reduce
    water wastage and improve WUE. This would have reduced agricultural water consumption
    in 2007 and 2012 by 32.58% and 30.13%, and the WUEs would have increased by 48.33%
    and 43.12%, respectively. Sustainable water-efficient management should comprehensively
    consider the economic benefits and environmental burdens in crop structure adjustment,
    irrigation practices, and field management. Additionally, a knowledge-exchange
    system among experts, resource managers, and farmers is crucial for improving
    WUE strategies for sustainable agroecosystem development.

    and content Highlights • A modelling framework of crop-type-specific water use
    efficiency (WUE) is presented. • WUE heterogeneity varied with planting structure
    changes and climate variability. • Expansion of corn with a high WUE and water
    consumption was unsustainable. • On-demand irrigation can enhance WUE and reduce
    environmental burdens. • A knowledge-exchange system is the key to efficient water
    management. Abstract Agroecosystems provide food, energy, and essential services,

    system 1. Introduction Agroecosystems provide essential goods (e.g., food, fiber,
    and fuels) and services (e.g., carbon sequestration, climate regulation, water
    and soil conservation, and maintaining biodiversity) for the social-ecological
    systems (Liu et al., 2017). Water is critical to agroecosystem development, and
    agricultural water use accounts for 80% of the world’s total water consumption
    (Song et al., 2018). However, in an attempt to meet the growing human demand for
    food and bioenergy, the reclamation and high-intensity use of cropland (Song and
    Pijanowski, 2014, Song and Deng, 2017) has led to increased water consumption
    (Lang et al., 2018, Liu et al., 2017) and the degradation of natural ecosystems
    (Lang and Song, 2018). In addition, ongoing climate change has exacerbated the
    uneven spatial distribution of global water resources (MA, 2005; Lang et al.,
    2017), resulting in increasingly serious food and water shortages (Smajgl et al.,
    2016). Improvements in water use efficiency (WUE) are crucial for regional and
    global food, water, and ecological security (Deng et al., 2015). Therefore, large-scale,
    long-term, and reliable monitoring of WUE is urgently needed if sustainable agroecosystem
    development is to be achieved. Agroecosystem WUE is generally defined as the ratio
    of crop carbon gain (e.g., net primary production (NPP), net ecosystem production
    (NEP), gross primary production (GPP), or yield) to water consumption (e.g., evapotranspiration
    (ET), or actual water consumption) (Han et al., 2013, Lu et al., 2016; Wagle et
    al., 2016a). Water use efficiency is a key indicator of agroecosystem sustainability
    (Guo et al., 2010, Heydari, 2014, Mo et al., 2005), and links the coupled carbon
    and water cycles in the \"food-energy-water\" nexus (Smajgl et al., 2016). Increasing
    WUE will simultaneously lead to crop yield improvements and water consumption
    minimization (i.e., more crop per drop), which is important for adapting to the
    growing food demand and water scarcity in both irrigated and rainfed agroecosystems
    (Marris, 2008, Monaghan et al., 2013). Thus, a more accurate simulation of WUE
    would provide fundamental information that can greatly benefit WUE-improving management
    practices. Although field observations of WUE (Mo et al., 2005, Miriti et al.,
    2012, Wagle et al., 2016b) are generally more accurate than model simulations,
    it is difficult to determine the spatial heterogeneity of WUE at the macroscale.
    Conversely, remote sensing (RS)-derived NPP (e.g., MOD17A3) and ET (e.g. MOD16A3)
    products are commonly used to understand the large-scale spatiotemporal variations
    in WUE (Xia et al., 2015). However, these coarse-spatial-resolution (500 m) RS
    products cannot provide crop-specific WUE-improvement strategies because their
    simulations did not consider crop spatial distribution (Liu et al., 2016). Multi-temporal
    or time-series vegetation indices (e.g., the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference water index
    (NDWI), land surface water index (LSWI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation-Water
    Index (NDVWI)), which are based on the Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic
    Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors on Landsat, Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Huanjing (HJ) charge coupled device
    (CCD) or other RS images have proven to be effective in identifying crop distribution
    (Arvor et al., 2011, Hao et al., 2014, Dong et al., 2016). Previous WUE simulations
    have generally ignored the key anthropic factor of irrigation, due to the lack
    of spatial irrigation data (Zhu et al., 2006, Mo et al., 2009). Nevertheless,
    optimizing the crop distribution and irrigation system is essential to WUE improvement
    (Levidow et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2018). Therefore, it is critical to integrate
    the crop type and irrigation distribution to accurately simulate the spatiotemporal
    WUE of different crops. Accurate WUE information depends on crop yield and water
    consumption simulations. The models used for crop yield simulations are mainly
    empirical statistical, crop growth, and light use efficiency (LUE) models. Empirical
    statistical models (e.g., Miami (Lieth, 1972), Thornthwaite Memorial (Cramer et
    al., 1999), and Chikugo (Uchijima and Seino, 1985)) generally simulate crop yield
    based on its linear or nonlinear statistical relationships with climatic or biological
    factors (e.g., solar radiation (SOL), temperature, precipitation, NDVI, and leaf
    area index (LAI)) (Cramer et al., 1999, Becker-Reshef et al., 2010). These models
    are easy-to-use but have an unsatisfactory accuracy because they do not consider
    the biochemical processes of biomass accumulation and the concomitant feedbacks
    from environmental changes. Conversely, by introducing the processes and mechanisms
    of different growth periods into model frameworks (Liu et al., 1997), crop growth
    models (e.g., CENTURY (Parton et al., 1993), TEM (McGuire et al., 1997), BIOME-BGC
    (Han et al., 2016), CARAIB (Warnant et al., 1994), DLEM (Tian et al., 2010), and
    ORCHIDEE (Piao et al., 2012)) can perform more accurate crop yield simulations.
    However, uncertainties still remain in large-scale applications based on these
    models, mainly because matched spatiotemporal multi-parameters data is difficult
    to obtain. Because of the ability of RS to access real-time and accurate spatialized
    parameters, LUE models (e.g., CASA (Zhu et al., 2006), C-Fix (Yan et al., 2016),
    GLO-PEM (Prince and Goward, 1995), MODIS-PSN (Ruimy et al., 1994), and VPM (Xiao
    et al., 2004)) have been widely used for large-scale and long-term crop yield
    simulation (Potter et al., 2012). These LUE models take into account key processes
    (e.g., photosynthesis and respiration); however, previous studies have generally
    ignored crop type and irrigation distribution. The models used for crop water
    consumption (CWC) simulation include CROPWAT (Luo et al., 2015), AquaCrop (Pohankova
    et al., 2018), and PolyCrop (Tan and Zheng, 2017). However, these models cannot
    provide the spatiotemporal water consumption for different crops due to the lack
    of crop type distribution data (Liu et al., 2017). Using the same parameters as
    those used to simulate the yield, CWC and WUE of different crops will inevitably
    compromise model accuracy. Moreover, previous WUE studies have generally been
    performed at coarse-spatial-resolutions (250–8000 m), meaning they are unable
    to support decision making in fragmented agroecosystems. Due to the lack of crop-specific
    spatiotemporal WUE information, it is difficult to understand the underlying causes
    of WUE variations and develop scientific crop and irrigation optimization strategies.
    Therefore, there is an urgent need to incorporate crop type and irrigation distribution
    into the modelling of high-spatial-resolution crop-specific WUE to develop efficient
    water use strategies for sustainable agroecosystem management. Water and food
    shortages in arid and semi-arid areas are more serious than in wetter areas (Millennium
    Ecosystem Assessment MA, 2005). The Heihe River Basin (HRB) is an important grain
    base in the arid and semi-arid areas of China, and its irrigated oasis agriculture
    consumes over 85% of the total water consumption in the basin (Liu et al., 2017).
    Mainly due to the huge irrigation consumption in the middle reaches of HRB, the
    Juyan Lake and downstream rivers have dried up several times. The Chinese government
    has therefore initiated many studies and projects to ensure sustainable water
    use (Liu et al., 2017). Although the downstream rivers and lakes have been restored,
    the irrigation requirement in HRB has increased from 23.60 × 108 m3 in 2007 to
    26.93 × 108 m3 in 2012, due to agroecosystem expansion and structural changes
    in crop planting (Song and Zhang, 2015, Liu et al., 2017). Investigating the spatiotemporal
    patterns of crop-specific WUE is therefore critical to reduce agricultural water
    waste and develop efficient water management strategies (Wang et al., 2015). In
    this context, the aims of this study were to: (1) model the spatiotemporal NPP,
    yield, water consumption, and WUE of different crops in the HRB in 2007 and 2012;
    (2) analyze their spatiotemporal heterogeneity and variations; and (3) provide
    practical WUE-improvement policy recommendations for sustainable agroecosystem
    development. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The HRB is a continental
    river basin that extends across arid and semi-arid areas of northwestern China.
    It is located in the central part of the \"silk road economic belt\" and the Hexi
    Corridor (97°30′E−101°43′E, 37°55′N–40°00′N) (Fig. 1). The HRB has an area of
    12.80 × 106 ha, covering the 11 counties of Qilian, Sunan, Shandan, Minle, Ganzhou,
    Linze, Gaotai, Suzhou, Jiayuguan, Jinta, and Ejina. The HRB is one of the ten
    largest grain bases in China, with extensive solar-thermal resources and sufficient
    irrigation water. The main crops include corn, wheat, barley and oilseed rape,
    and they are mainly distributed in the oasis agroecosystem in the middle reaches
    of the river basin (Liu et al., 2016). The region has a temperate continental
    climate, with frequent droughts and a scarcity of rain. The average annual precipitation
    shows a gradually decreasing trend from upstream (350 mm) to midstream (200 mm)
    and downstream (45 mm). The average annual temperature, annual sunshine duration,
    annual total SOL, and annual potential ET are 6–8 °C, 3000 h, 6000 MJ/m2, and
    2700 mm, respectively (Liu et al., 2017). The water resources are mainly derived
    from melting ice and snow in the Qilianshan Mountains and rainfall, of which over
    85% is consumed by the agroecosystem. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    on crop yield and water consumption. The main data sources used for simulating
    crop yield and water consumption were the crop spatial distribution, monthly NDVI,
    monthly meteorological factors, monthly crop irrigation (CI), and a digital elevation
    model (DEM). These data were obtained for 2007 and 2012, with a spatial resolution
    of 30 m. The crop spatial distribution dataset identified five crop types (corn,
    wheat, barley, oilseed rape, and other crops), with an overall accuracy of 89.38%,
    using the multi-temporal NDVWI (Liu et al., 2016) based on 169 scenes from Landsat
    TM/ETM + images. The NDVWI combines the advantages of NDVI and NDWI by comprehensively
    considering the spectral characteristics of crops in the red, near infrared, and
    short-wave infrared bands, resulting in a better crop classification performance
    than the NDVI (Liu et al., 2016). Monthly NDVI data was obtained by the pan-sharpening
    fusion (Vivone et al., 2015) of MODIS NDVI (i.e., MOD13Q1) and TM/ETM + NDVI.
    MOD13Q1 time-series data (Didan, 2015), with a spatial resolution of 250 m and
    a temporal resolution of 16 d, was initially processed by the maximum value composites
    (MVC) method, and then used in the fusion. Monthly meteorological factors (precipitation;
    average, maximum, and minimum temperatures; relative humidity; wind speed; and
    pressure) were interpolated using the thin plate spline method in the ANUSPLIN
    software (Liu et al., 2017), based on the monitoring data from 20 meteorological
    sites in the HRB and its surroundings. Monthly CI data was obtained by integrating
    two datasets: a monthly irrigation dataset, with 30 s spatial resolution over
    the HRB (Zeng et al., 2016) and an irrigation ditch map for Zhangye City (Liu
    and Ma, 2011). The distance to an irrigation ditch was used as a covariate to
    assist in interpolating monthly irrigation from 30 s spatial resolution to 30
    m using the thin plate spline method. A DEM at 30 m spatial resolution was obtained
    from the aster global digital elevation model (ASTER GDEM) Version 2 dataset (Tachikawa
    et al., 2011), and was used for calculating total SOL. The data sources used for
    the verification of CWC, NPP, and yield in 2007 and 2012 were RS-based actual
    ET, the MODIS MOD17A3H product, and statistical yield data, respectively. An annual
    actual ET dataset, with 1000 m spatial resolution, was derived from multisource
    RS data using the ETWatch model (Wu et al., 2012). Actual ET was used as an approximate
    value for the assessment of CWC. The MOD17A3H version 6 product provides yearly
    NPP at 500 m spatial resolution, with values derived from the sum of 8-day net
    photosynthesis, i.e., the difference between GPP and maintenance respiration (Running
    et al., 2015). Statistical crop yield data at the county scale was obtained from
    multiple statistical yearbooks (ZBSC, 2007, 2012; GBSC, 2008, 2013). 2.3. Methods
    We initially used the CASA model to map crop NPP based on the crop spatial distribution,
    NDVI, meteorological factors, and CI (Fig. 2). Several process-based parameters
    were associated with NPP to simulate crop yield. We then calculated effective
    rainfall (ER) based on meteorological factors, and simulated CWC in combination
    with irrigation data. Finally, we simulated WUE based on the definition of crop
    yield per unit water consumption. Download : Download high-res image (287KB) Download

    2.3.1. CASA model for NPP mapping The CASA model is a representative LUE model
    that has been widely used for NPP simulation, and its reliability has been verified
    in both global and regional studies (Potter et al., 2003, Potter et al., 2012,
    Zhu et al., 2006). The CASA model-based NPP in month t (NPPt) was determined by
    the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APARt) and the actual efficiency
    of radiation use (εt) (Potter et al., 1993). Approximately half of the total SOL
    (with wavelengths of 0.4–0.7 μm) is available for most vegetation, and the radiation
    that is actually used by vegetation is determined by the fraction of photosynthetically
    active radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR). The FPAR is calculated from a
    linear function of the simple ratio (SR), and SR is determined by the NDVI (Potter
    et al., 1993, Zhu et al., 2006). The εt is restricted by the stress factors of
    high temperature (Tmax,t), low temperature (Tmin,t), and water (Wt) in month t.
    The maximum ε (εmax) value for agroecosystems in China is 0.542 gC·MJ−1 (Zhu et
    al., 2006). The formulas used to calculate Tmax,t, Tmin,t, and Wt have been documented
    previously (Potter et al., 1993). Tmax,t and Tmin,t were determined by the annual
    optimal growth temperature (Topt) and the mean temperature in month t (Tmean,t),
    and Wt was determined by the actual ET (ETa,t) and potential ET (ETo,t) in month
    t. The ETa,t was calculated by the advection-aridity approach (Brutsaert and Stricker,
    1979), and ETo,t was calculated by the FAO Penman-Monteith Formula (Allan et al.,
    2005). (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) where SRmin and SRmax are the
    minimum and maximum SR, respectively; FPARmin and FPARmax represent the FPARs
    with no vegetation coverage and full vegetation coverage, and had values of 0.001
    and 0.95, respectively; Rn is the crop surface net radiation (MJ*m−2*d−1); G is
    the soil heat flux (MJ*m−2*d−1); △ is the slope of the saturated water pressure
    curve (kPa/°C); γ is the psychrometer constant (kPa/°C); u2 is the wind speed
    at 2 m (m/s); Tmean is mean temperature (°C); es and ea are the saturated (kPa)
    and actual water pressure (kPa), respectively; and α is the Priestley-Taylor empirical
    coefficient, which varies with land cover and micro-meteorological conditions
    (Brutsaert and Stricker, 1979). In this study, the α value of the agroecosystem
    in the HRB was set at 1.10. 2.3.2. Process-based parameters for crop yield simulation
    The total biomass of crop i was determined by its NPP and the carbon-to-biomass
    coefficient (ai). For most crops, only a portion of the aboveground biomass is
    harvested. The yield of crop i (Yieldi) refers to its harvested aboveground biomass
    after drying. (11) (12) where HIi, pi, and wi represent the harvesting index,
    the ratio of aboveground biomass to total biomass, and the water content of crop
    i, respectively; and NPPi is the NPP of crop i, i.e., the accumulated NPP in its
    growth period, from sowing date (ts,i) to harvesting date (th,i). The values of
    these process-based parameters (Table 1) were determined based on the results
    of previous studies (Xie et al., 2011, Liu et al., 2017), statistical data (DCPMOAC,
    2007, 2012; ZBSC, 2007, 2012; GBSC, 2008, 2013), and our field survey. Table 1.

    2.3.3. Crop water consumption Crop water consumption includes ER and CI, where
    ER is the rainfall effectively used by crops, not including that lost through
    runoff and infiltration. The ER was calculated using the Soil Conservation Service
    method proposed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA-SCS Method)
    (Allan et al., 2005). (13) (14) where ERmonth and ARmonth are the monthly ER and
    actual rainfall, respectively. 2.3.4. Water use efficiency modelling Crop WUE
    in this study was defined as crop yield (Yield) per CWC (Mo et al., 2009). (15)
    2.3.5. Accuracy assessment method The modelling accuracy of CWC and NPP were assessed
    by RS-based actual ET and MOD17A3H using 1000 random samples, respectively. Crop
    yield was verified by statistical data at the county scale. The root mean square
    error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the reliability
    of modelling results. (16) (17) where Si and Vi represent the simulated and verified
    values of a sample i, respectively; and represent the mean simulated and verified
    values of all samples, respectively; and n is the number of samples. 3. Results
    3.1. Validation of CWC, NPP, and yield We evaluated the performance of CWC, NPP,
    and yield modelling using the actual ET, MOD17A3H NPP, and statistical yield (Fig.
    3). The relationship between our simulated CWC and the actual ET estimated by
    the ETWatch model was similar over time, with R2 and RMSE values of 0.5570 and
    130.68 mm in 2007, and 0.5561 and 129.87 mm in 2012, respectively (Fig. 3a and
    b). Most CWC values were greater than the actual ET, with the largest values found
    in corn. The simulated crop-type-specific NPP was generally greater than the MOD17A3H
    NPP, with R2 and RMSE values of 0.5676 and 34.12 gC/m2 in 2007, and 0.5890 and
    31.90 gC/m2 in 2012, respectively (Fig. 3c and d). However, despite our NPP being
    greater, our simulated yield was less than the statistical yield, with R2 and
    RMSE values of 0.7072 and 1940.61 kg/ha in 2007, and 0.7933 and 1802.19 kg/ha
    in 2012, respectively (Fig. 3e and f). Download : Download high-res image (786KB)

    and statistical yield in 2007 (e) and 2012 (f). 3.2. Spatiotemporal variations
    in crop NPP Crop NPP in 2007 and 2012 had significant spatial heterogeneity and
    varied among crop types (Fig. 4). Crops with a high NPP (>450 gC/m2) were mainly
    distributed in the piedmont plain (e.g., Ganzhou), while crops with a low NPP
    (>300 gC/m2) were located in the downstream area of the HRB where there are high
    evaporation rates and low rainfall (e.g., Ejina), and the high-altitude mountainous
    areas with low accumulated temperature (e.g., Minle and Shandan) (Fig. 4a,b,c).
    The NPP in the areas of Linze, Gaotai, Suzhou, Jinta, Shandan, and Minle where
    corn planting has expanded increased from 2007 to 2012 (Fig. 4d). The largest
    NPP in 2007 was found in Ganzhou, but it had declined by 2012. The NPP in the
    urbanized regions of Ganzhou and Linze decreased significantly. Moreover, the
    NPP increased in the corn-expansion and barley-to-wheat transfer areas of Shandan
    and Minle, while it decreased in southeastern Shandan, where corn planting contracted
    over the study period. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download

    oilseed rape, and other crops increased to different extents from 2007 to 2012
    (Table 2). The NPP of oilseed rape had the largest increase of 8.91% (34.97 gC/m2),
    while that of wheat and other crops increased by 2.41% and 1.13%, respectively.
    The NPPs of barley and corn decreased slightly by 2.97% (9.79 gC/m2) and 0.63%
    (2.87 gC/m2), respectively. Consequently, the average NPP of the HRB increased
    by 1.69% (6.71 gC/m2), from 397.38 to 404.09 gC/m2. Table 2. Average crop NPP

    variations in crop yield The corn yield increased over the study period, while
    the yields of wheat, barley, and oilseed rape plantations decreased (Fig. 5a,b,c).
    In 2007, the higher-crop-yield regions were mainly concentrated in Ganzhou, while
    Linze, Gaotai, Suzhou, Jiayuguan, and Jinta had medium yields. Lower yields were
    observed in Minle, Shandan, and Ejina (Fig. 5a). In 2012, the higher-crop-yield
    regions expanded to the higher-latitude regions of Linze and Jinta, and to the
    high-altitude regions of the southeastern border between Shandan and Minle (Fig.
    5b). The crop yield of Ganzhou in 2012 decreased compared with the yield in 2007
    (Fig. 5d). The low-crop-yield regions in Minle and Shandan decreased, while the
    low-crop-yield regions in Suzhou, Jiayuguan, and Jinta expanded to some extent.
    The crop yield of Ejina in the downstream area of the HRB was relatively low,
    and declined slightly over the study period. Download : Download high-res image

    in 2007–2012. Similarly to the changes of NPP, the yields of oilseed rape, wheat,
    and other crops increased by 8.91% (192.72 kg/ha), 2.41% (75.46 kg/ha), and 1.13%
    (40.25 kg/ha), respectively, from 2007 to 2012 (Table 2). In contrast, the yields
    of corn and barley decreased by 0.63% (39.49 kg/ha) and 2.97% (87.24 kg/ha), respectively.
    As a result, the average crop yield in the HRB increased by 133.70 kg/ha (3.40%),
    from 3932.75 to 4066.45 kg/ha. 3.4. Spatiotemporal variations in CWC From 2007
    to 2012, the average ER decreased from 203.81 to 154.33 mm in the HRB agroecosystem
    (Fig. 6a). Qilian and Sunan at higher altitudes had the largest decrease (>60
    mm). The ER decrease in most midstream areas of HRB was between 50 and 60 mm,
    and the lowest (<20 mm) decrease occurred in the arid region of Ejina in the downstream
    areas. The ERs of corn, wheat, barley, oilseed rape, and other crops decreased
    by 43.50, 22.79, 36.62, 48.53, and 51.17 mm, respectively (Table 3). Download

    202.04 505.50 707.54 150.87 524.07 674.94 The average CI in the HRB increased
    from 513.92 mm in 2007 to 561.80 mm in 2012 (Fig. 6b). Most regions experienced
    an increased CI, with values between 50 and 300 mm. Ganzhou and Linze had a CI
    increase greater than 300 mm. The CIs in the cropland-reclaimed and barley-to-wheat
    transfer areas increased. The CI decrease was highest in Gaotai, reaching above
    300 mm in some parts of the county. The CIs of corn and other crops increased
    by 139.14 and 18.75 mm, respectively, whereas the CIs of wheat, oilseed rape,
    and barley decreased by 72.99, 10.18, and 4.01 mm, respectively (Table 3). Because
    CI accounted for more than 70% of CWC (Table 3), the CWCs in 2007 and 2012 presented
    a spatial heterogeneity dominated by CI (Fig. 7). The CWCs in some high-CI regions
    of Ganzhou, Linze, and Ejina exceeded 2000 mm (Fig. 7a,b,c). Compared with 2007,
    the CWC in the higher-CWC regions of Ganzhou and Linze continuously increased
    in 2012, while the CI in Gaotai and Ejina decreased (Fig. 7d). The plain oasis
    areas in the middle reaches of the HRB had CWC values higher than 1000 mm. The
    CWC increased in most regions, with CWC values between 500 and 1000 mm. The regions
    with CWC values < 500 mm were mainly located in Minle, Shandan, central Ganzhou,
    and Jinta and generally presented a decreasing trend. Download : Download high-res

    (d) change in 2007–2012. The CWC of corn was the largest, while that of barley
    was the smallest (Table 3). From 2007 to 2012, the CWC of corn increased by 11.24%
    (95.64 mm), while that of wheat, oilseed rape, barley, and other crops decreased
    by 15.45% (95.78 mm), 10.32% (58.71 mm), 7.56% (40.63 mm), and 4.61% (32.60 mm),
    respectively. Thus, the average CWC in the HRB decreased slightly by 0.22%, from
    717.73 to 716.13 mm. 3.5. Spatiotemporal variations in crop WUE In 2007, 2012,
    the higher WUE values were mainly located in the lower-CWC regions, while the
    lower WUE values were mainly distributed in the higher-CWC regions (Fig. 8). The
    regions with a WUE higher than 1500 g/m3 were scattered throughout the corn plantation
    area (Fig. 8a,b,c), while the low-value regions, with WUE <200 g/m3 were mainly
    distributed in the corn plantation areas with a high CWC. The WUE in Ejina was
    relatively low due to the high CWC. The WUEs of the wheat, barley, and oilseed
    rape plantations in Minle and Shandan were generally between 500 and 1500 g/m3,
    and showed an increasing trend, with an increase of over 500 g/m3 in some regions
    (Fig. 8d). The CWC-surged areas showed a decreasing trend in WUE. The WUE in cropland
    expansion areas increased, while in areas of urban expansion it declined. Download

    in 2007–2012, (d) change in 2007–2012. Although the water consumption of corn
    was highest, its yield was almost twice that of the other major crops, resulting
    in the highest WUE for corn (Table 4). From 2007 to 2012, the WUE of corn decreased
    by 10.68% (78.58 g/m3), whereas the WUEs of wheat, oilseed rape, barley, and other
    crops increased by 21.13% (106.54 g/m3), 21.44% (81.54 g/m3), 4.96% (27.12 g/m3),
    and 6.02% (30.22 g/m3), respectively. As a consequence, the average WUE in the
    HRB agroecosystem increased by 3.36% (19.90 g/m3), from 547.94 to 567.84 g/m3.

    potential and WUE improvement Because the actual CWC was significantly higher
    than the crop water requirement, 32.58% (1619.24 × 106 m3) and 30.13% (1619.24
    × 106 m3) of the total CWC in the HRB was wasted in 2007 and 2012, respectively
    (Table 5). With constant crop yields, the WUEs in 2007 and 2012 could have increased
    by 48.33% (264.83 g/m3) and 43.12% (244.83 g/m3), respectively, if crop irrigation
    was performed according to the actual crop water requirement. Consequently, the
    WUE of corn in 2007 and 2012 could have increased by 71.80% (528.49 g/m3) and
    81.44% (535.51 g/m3), respectively. Table 5. Crop water requirement (CWR), crop

    4. Discussion 4.1. Spatial heterogeneity of WUE The spatial heterogeneity of WUE
    in the HRB was jointly affected by crop type distribution, climatic conditions,
    irrigation facilities, field management, and farmers’ perception. Although the
    plain oasis areas in the middle or lower reaches of the HRB have lower precipitation,
    the conditions are more conducive for irrigation and more agricultural water can
    be supplied than in the mountainous areas in the middle or upper reaches (Song
    et al., 2018). In addition, the plain oasis areas have a higher accumulated temperature
    than the mountainous areas. Thus, thermophilic and water-intensive corn was mainly
    distributed in the plain oasis areas, while hardy wheat, barley, and oilseed rape
    was mainly grown in mountainous areas (Liu et al., 2016). Accordingly, both the
    CWC and crop yield in plain oasis areas were higher than in mountainous areas.
    However, a high yield does not imply a high WUE, because farmers have an inadequate
    knowledge of crop water requirements, and tend to perform over-irrigation. Agricultural
    practices generally develop in pursuit of higher economic benefits; however, input-intensive
    farming is not always economical, and can degrade soil and water resources. For
    example, in the HRB, although CWC substantially exceeds the crop water requirement,
    crop yields have not increased significantly and have even decreased in some areas.
    Water-inefficient practices (e.g., flood irrigation) not only waste a substantial
    volume of water but also enhance the environmental burden of agriculture. Unfortunately,
    low irrigation costs and inadequate supervision have further aggravated over-irrigation,
    especially in the irrigation-conducive plain oasis areas. Thus, for the same crop
    type, its WUE in mountainous areas is generally higher than that in plain oasis
    areas. Moreover, differences in field management practices other than irrigation
    (e.g., fertilizing, breeding, and spraying pesticides) can also lead to the spatiotemporal
    heterogeneity of WUE (Lu and Fan, 2013); however, these factors were not investigated
    in this study. Crop structure adjustments and climate variability in the HRB have
    further altered the heterogeneity of WUE. From 2007 to 2012, mainly driven by
    economics, the number of corn and oilseed rape plantations increased, while the
    number of wheat and barley plantations decreased (Liu et al., 2016, Liu et al.,
    2017). Climate warming has expanded the area of corn plantation into the high-latitude
    or high-altitude areas; consequently, these areas have experienced an increase
    in WUE. However, the WUE in untransformed corn planting areas has decreased, due
    to the increased proportion of seed corn, which has a lower yield and higher water
    consumption than normal corn (Tan and Zheng, 2017). In addition, the increased
    temperature and reduced rainfall in the HRB from 2007 to 2012 has increased crop
    irrigation (Liu et al., 2017). In terms of crop type, farmers tend to irrigate
    more for water-intensive corn because it provides greater economic benefits. Consequently,
    the CWC of corn increased, while that of wheat, barley, oilseed rape, and other
    crops reduced. However, the yield of corn did not increase significantly, and
    the yields of the other four crops did not decrease but rather increased, due
    to their CWCs being far higher than their actual water requirements. Hence, the
    WUE of corn decreased and the WUEs of other crops increased. 4.2. Implications
    for improving WUE Water use efficiency can be improved by crop structure adjustments,
    water-pricing policies, administrative water allocations, on-demand irrigation
    systems, and effective field management. Although the replacement of other crops
    by corn has slightly increased the average WUE and farmers’ income in the HRB
    (Tan and Zheng, 2019), it has also sharply increased agricultural water consumption,
    and concomitantly reduced the ecological and domestic water supply (Song et al.,
    2018). Sustainable water-efficient management strategies should combine farmers’
    economic income with wider environmental benefits (Levidow et al., 2014), i.e.,
    integrate both the economic and environmental efficiencies of water use. Therefore,
    crop structure adjustments should aim to simultaneously improve WUE and ensure
    an ecological water supply in the basin. Specifically, it is crucial to ensure
    food-water-ecology security by transferring from water-intensive crops to water-saving
    and high-value crops, and importing high virtual water content (VWC) crops from
    other water-rich areas (Liu et al., 2016, Liu et al., 2017). Previous studies
    have confirmed that water-price increases can induce farmers to adopt water-conserving
    practices (Wu et al., 2018). However, raising water prices is often ineffective
    in reducing water demand because economic income is more of a priority for most
    farmers than saving water (Molden et al., 2010). Moreover, it will increase irrigation
    costs and reduce farmers’ incomes. Conversely, administrative water allocation
    has been proven to be an effective way to improve WUE, because an inelastic water
    supply generally leads to water-efficient agricultural practices (Molden et al.,
    2010). It is critical to allocate agricultural water on the basis of the crop
    area and natural conditions across multiple irrigated districts. However, it is
    difficult to meet the conflicting water demands from multiple self-interest-oriented
    stakeholders (e.g., agriculture, industry, urban residents, and ecosystems). Although
    ecological water use should be given a high priority to ensure sustainable development,
    few farmers voluntarily save water for ecological protection without compensation.
    Thus, effective ecological compensation measures should be developed to encourage
    farmers to improve WUE and earn extra-income from saving water. Additionally,
    it is essential to strengthen the supervision of water allocation and reallocation
    (Deng et al., 2015). Innovative irrigation practices and field management can
    enhance WUE and reduce environmental burdens. In arid and semi-arid areas, more
    than 50% of irrigation and rainfall evaporates into the atmosphere or infiltrates
    into the soil (Molden et al., 2010). Accordingly, reducing evaporation and infiltration,
    while increasing productive transpiration, is the key to improving WUE. On-demand
    irrigation scheduling is an effective way to reduce water wastage and improve
    yields (Xu et al., 2018). Drip and sprinkler irrigation systems have proven to
    be more efficient in reducing evaporation than flood irrigation (Liu and Shen,
    2018). Innovative irrigation technologies, such as supplemental irrigation and
    deficit irrigation, can achieve high water productivity (Molden et al., 2010).
    Moreover, water harvesting technologies (e.g., terracing farming, and drainage
    ditches) can increase the additional water available for crops, and prevent water
    and soil erosion. It is also crucial to reduce delivery losses by canal lining
    or pipe-delivery. Although individual farmers and farming organizations have already
    made significant investments in well-equipped irrigation systems, the potential
    for WUE improvements has not been fulfilled due to the lack of relevant knowledge
    among farmers. It is therefore critical to establish a knowledge-exchange system
    among experts, resource managers and farmers regarding crop water requirements,
    irrigation scheduling, and crop yield response to different irrigation practices
    (Levidow et al., 2014, Deng et al., 2015). In terms of WUE-improving field practices,
    effective breeding, mulching, and fertilizing can improve soil properties and
    water retention capacity, and close crop yield gaps (Lu and Fan, 2013). Crop breeding
    improves WUE by triggering biophysical vigor to increase the harvest index and
    enhance resistance to drought (Molden et al., 2010). Mulching with crop residues
    or plastic film can raise early-growth temperature, reduce soil evaporation, and
    increase water retention and productive transpiration (Waraich et al., 2011).
    Fertilizing with macronutrients (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) and micronutrients
    (e.g., zinc, copper, and iron) can reduce photo-oxidative damage, maintain osmotic
    potential, and enhance photosynthetic capacity (Liao et al., 2018, Liu et al.,
    2019). Most importantly, these effective field management strategies should also
    be incorporated into a knowledge-exchange system to enable farmers to improve
    WUE. 4.3. Comparisons with other studies Our crop-type-specific NPP had similar
    values and distributions to previous simulated and observed results in the HRB
    (Cui et al., 2016), but had higher values than MOD17A3H NPP (Running et al., 2015).
    The underestimation of MODIS NPP for agroecosystems can be attributed to the same
    LUE parameter and the coarse spatial distribution (MCD12Q1, 500 m) used for all
    crop types (Cui et al., 2016, Xiao et al., 2019). However, our simulated average
    yields were lower than the statistical (ZBSC, 2007, 2012; GBSC, 2008, 2013) or
    experimental yields (Yang et al., 2011). This was because statistical or experimental
    yields were generally estimated based on a few samples at the field-scale, ignoring
    the low-yield samples impacted by droughts, diseases, or pests. In contrast, our
    RS-based simulations, supported by fine resolution crop distributions, considered
    all crops in the HRB. Moreover, our simulated CWC was similar to that of previous
    studies in the HRB (Yang et al., 2011, Cui et al., 2016, Tan and Zheng, 2019).
    Consequently, our simulated WUE was slightly smaller than census-based (Tan and
    Zheng, 2019) or experiment-based WUEs (Yang et al., 2011). Similarly to previous
    studies, we found that an expansion in the area planted with corn increased the
    WUE in the HRB (Tan and Zheng, 2019). In general, most previous WUE studies in
    the HRB have been performed based on a limited number of samples from statistical
    data or field experiments, and few RS-based simulations have not been supported
    by fine resolution crop and irrigation distribution information. Future research
    should integrate multi-scale methods (e.g., field experiments, fixed-point observations,
    and RS) to more accurately simulate large-scale and long-term WUE for sustainable
    agroecosystem management. 5. Conclusions In summary, the present study provided
    high-spatial-resolution crop-type-specific WUE information and WUE-improvement
    strategies for sustainable agroecosystem management. We found that WUE varies
    with crop structure adjustments, irrigation, and climate variability. The CWC
    in the HRB far exceeded the crop water requirement, and its changes had a limited
    impact on crop yield but altered the spatial heterogeneity of WUE. Accordingly,
    the WUE of corn decreased and the WUEs of other crops increased. Because corn
    has the highest WUE, its expansion has led to a 3.36% increase in the average
    WUE of the HRB. However, this unsustainable increase in the WUE has resulted in
    a surge in agricultural water consumption and has concomitantly reduced the ecological
    and domestic water supply. Thus, by performing on-demand irrigation, the CWC could
    have been reduced by 32.58% and 30.13% in 2007 and 2012, and the WUE could have
    been increased by 48.33% and 43.12%, respectively. In order to achieve sustainable
    WUE-improving management, water-efficient practices (e.g., planting structure,
    irrigation systems, administrative water allocation, and field management) should
    comprehensively consider the economic benefits and environmental burdens. Most
    importantly, all of these WUE strategies should be incorporated into a knowledge-exchange
    system to enable farmers to improve their water use. Author contributions Conceptualization,

    that these methods are valid engines to develop automatic irrigation scheduling
    systems. Keywords: decision support systems; automatic irrigation scheduling;
    water optimization; machine learning 1. Introduction Water is a limiting factor
    in agricultural production. This fact is intensified in regions where water is
    scarce. In these regions, the importance of properly managing irrigation is a
    fundamental factor for sustainable production. There are agricultural techniques
    that have made it possible to optimize irrigation management, from the use of
    drip irrigation systems to regulated deficit irrigation strategies able to maintain
    yields with lower irrigation volumes [1,2]. Information and communication technologies
    (ICT) have contributed to the sustainable management of water in agriculture.
    The deployment of wireless sensor networks in crops using Internet of Things (IoT)
    technologies and the remote management of data with cloud computing have allowed
    massive monitoring of agricultural variables, which generate a large amount of
    information [3,4]. This information helps the agronomist to determine the water
    status of the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum and to make decisions about irrigation,
    and whether different deficit irrigation strategies adapted to phenology and physiology
    of the crop should be implemented [5]. In addition, the democratization of IoT
    technologies for monitoring soil and weather variables is allowing a wide diffusion
    of water saving tools in home contexts [6,7]. However, the continuous modernization
    of irrigation systems needs to implement equipment that allows an automated scheduling
    of irrigation. It must include sensors to provide different parameters [8,9].
    Traditionally, these parameters are related to environmental conditions and provide
    information about the full crop water requirements using weather stations [6]
    as well as the soil’s water status or volumetric content, which indicate the water
    availability for the plant. The most commonly used soil parameter sensors are
    those that use dielectric properties, since they are cheap and flexible [10,11],
    although its correct operation requires complex calibration, taking into account
    factors such as soil texture and structure, temperature, and water salinity [12,13,14]
    besides the spatial variability of the soil conditions [15]. Other sensors such
    as thermal and multispectral cameras, satellites, or infrared radiometers (IR)
    are used to estimate water crop needs [16,17,18,19]. Regarding irrigation automation,
    soil sensors have started to be used for this purpose, considering water matric
    potential [20] and volumetric water content [21], with thermal sensors [22] and,
    recently, their combination with wireless technologies for flexible implementation
    [9]. These systems use fixed or dynamic thresholds of the soil, and measure atmospheric
    or plant parameters for irrigation actuation [23,24]. However, irrigation management
    can take into account more variables, including the hydro-physical properties
    of certain soils, the parameters related to other crops, their stages of development,
    water quality [25,26], and factors related to productivity, fruit quality, and
    the implementation of deficit irrigation strategies [27], which prevent the proper
    functioning of irrigation thresholds. Systems based on machine learning (ML) techniques
    use the previous irrigation management experience of a human expert to train a
    system to reproduce that expert behavior. Fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks
    (ANNs), or regression procedures have been used recently for automatic irrigation
    management [28,29,30]. Decision support systems (DSSs) are ML applications that
    use the knowledge of an agronomist (human expert) to learn irrigation scheduling
    patterns and emulate human activities in decision-making. Additionally, DSSs permit
    a continuous learning process (while being used) and adapt their performance to
    context changes or different objectives [31]. Therefore, DSSs in agriculture are
    useful tools for optimal irrigation management and have demonstrated good behavior
    [32]. These systems have been defined and implemented over several years in the
    agricultural sector for a large range of applications, not only for developing
    irrigation management [33] but also crop growth models [34], and financial and
    agricultural management models [35]. In some applications for irrigation management,
    knowledge-based learning models have been developed using climate data provided
    by weather station networks [36]. Different algorithms are used for water needs
    estimations in automatic irrigation systems based on ML. ANN [37,38] and support
    vector regression (SVR) [33] algorithms are widely used for DSS development. In
    [39], k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithms were
    compared with an ANN for the estimation of potato water needs. The authors in
    [40] compared SVR with multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and M5
    model tree (M5Tree) in modeling reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Genetic algorithms
    (GAs) [41] and random forest regression (RFR) [42] have also been used for water
    needs estimation. This paper presents the development of an irrigation decision
    support system (IDSS) for irrigation management optimization in citrus trees.
    The system uses the following information obtained automatically by in-the-field
    sensors: (1) weather data, (2) the amount of applied water data from the previous
    week, and (3) soil water status and water quality data. We also considered aspects
    such as meteorological predictions, the type of crop, and the phenological stage
    on which the model performs the irrigation calculation. The system was trained
    using reports made by agronomists for determining the irrigation frequency and
    doses on a weekly basis. Three regression learning algorithms were compared for
    performance purposes: linear regression (LR), SVR, and RFR. The models were evaluated
    using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and random 90-10 shuffle cross-validation
    techniques. The irrigation amount estimated for an entire year by the IDSS was
    compared with the irrigation water applied by the agronomists, allowing us to
    compare the performance of different learning algorithms. Section 2 describes
    the material and methods used for the development of the IDSS. Section 3 summarizes
    the results obtained and a discussion. The conclusions are described in Section
    4. 2. Materials and Methods Figure 1 shows the process used by an agronomist (expert)
    to determine the amount of irrigation. Figure 1. Process used by the agronomist
    to determine irrigation dose and frequency. ETo (reference evapotranspiration)
    is obtained from meteorological variables and represents the effect of the weather
    on net crop water requirements, while Kc (crop coefficient) indicates the specific
    characteristics of the crop and its effect on water needs (the type of crop, the
    development and phenological stage, etc.). In a third stage, the quality of the
    irrigation water, the uniformity coefficient of the irrigation system, the field
    size, etc., allow for determining the real volumes of irrigation. This value gives
    an approximate idea of the amount of water needed to satisfy full crop water requirements.
    This value is modulated with the water status of the soil to obtain the volume
    of irrigation to contribute to the crop. The main goal of the IDSS is to calculate
    the irrigation doses that have to be applied to the crop. This decision is taken
    automatically based on the information provided by the sensors and the prediction
    of a machine learning system. The aim of this component, therefore, is to mimic
    a human expert (agronomist) in the decision-making process. The IDSS described
    in this paper was trained using different varieties of citrus trees (orange, mandarin,
    and lemon trees) and cultivated in different plots. For each one of them, weekly
    irrigation reports (carried out by the agronomist) were used to train the system.
    In the following paragraphs, the main parts used to develop the IDSS are described:
    (i) the integrated information platform that provides the soil and irrigation
    data, (ii) the crops and plots where the data and irrigation reports were obtained
    and where the IDSS was tested, and (iii) the architecture of the different machine
    learning algorithms implemented in the IDSS. 2.1. Data Collection Platform The
    information about the soil and weather conditions is provided by wireless devices
    called nodes, developed by Widhoc Smart Solutions (CEDIT, Fuente Álamo 30320,
    Spain). The wireless nodes collect and send data using Wi-Fi or GPRS links. A
    cloud server stores and indexes the data for further processing purposes. The
    nodes are powered by solar panels and rechargeable batteries. The main variables
    collected by the nodes are as follows: (1) soil matric potential measured by MPS-6
    sensors (Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163, USA) (Figure 2a); Figure 2.
    (a) Soil matric potential sensor MPS6. (b) Soil water content sensor 10HS. (c)
    Soil water content, temperature, and electrical conductivity (EC) sensor 5TE.
    (d) Water flow meter device JS04. (2) volumetric water content (VWC, soil moisture)
    measured by 10HS sensors (Decagon devices, Inc. Pullman, WA, USA) (Figure 2b);
    (3) volumetric water content, bulk electrical conductivity, and soil temperature
    measured by 5TE sensors (Decagon Devices, Inc. Pullman, WA, USA) (Figure 2c);
    (4) volume of water supplied during the previous week, measured with flowmeters
    (Apator POWOGAZ JS-04, Poland) (Figure 2d). Each node samples the variables every
    15 min and sends the information to a data server. This server establishes communication
    with the nodes and the integration of the databases (the information from customers
    and equipment is stored securely). The processed information is shown on a website-customizable
    front-end layer. Information about weather conditions is provided by the IMIDA
    (Instituto Murciano de Investigación y Desarrollo Agrario y Alimentario, 30150
    Murcia, Spain). This public research institution has deployed a network with 49
    climatic stations that cover the region of Murcia (SIAM) [43] (Figure 3). Figure
    3. Climatic stations belonging to SIAM placed in diverse locations in the region
    of Murcia. The network is widely used to determine the ETo, in addition to other
    variables such as temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), global radiation (GR),
    wind speed (WS), rainfall (RF), dew point (DP), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD).
    The weather information, belonging to the SIAM network, is automatically integrated
    into the cloud server to complement the soil and water data from the nodes. 2.2.
    Plot and Report Description The data were collected from nine commercial orchards
    of citrus trees located in the Southeast Spain, specifically in the region of
    Murcia. This is a semiarid zone where the water is very scarce and drip irrigation
    is commonly used. The irrigation criteria followed was to maximize the yield per
    unit area. Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the orchards and the numbers
    of reports used in the training process. Table 1. Crops and reports used in the
    training process. The weekly reports to train the system were generated by two
    different technicians. They used the information from the automatic weather stations
    closest to the orchard placement, including crop parameters and other data such
    as water quality and soil sensor information. They also needed the amount of water
    applied to the orchard during the previous week. The generated reports, as a final
    result, suggest the total amount of water for the following week. The total number
    of reports available is 484, for nine different citrus crops located in Southeast
    Spain. 2.3. Irrigation Decision Support System (IDSS) The proposed IDSS is a trained
    system that automatically predicts the amount of irrigation water needed for the
    orchard. A supervised training process was used. Irrigation reports performed
    by the agronomist in the orchard were used as the ground-truth. In order to cover
    the best options of automatic learning systems, regressive techniques were implemented.
    The regression methods that were used to predict the agricultural technician criteria
    are LR, RFR, and SVR. A detailed description of each method and their corresponding
    parameters selection are presented below. Two validation techniques (LOOCV and
    90-10 shuffle cross-validation) were used to test the goodness of every model,
    as suggested in [44]. The root-mean-square error (RMSE), given in Equation (1),
    was used to obtain the accuracy of the forecasting models: 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 =  ∑ 𝑡 = 1 𝑛 (
    𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 ) 2 𝑛 − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (1) where 𝑛 is the number of
    data, 𝑦 𝑖 is the actual output of the instance i, and 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 is the corresponding
    estimated output. It is a global and very standard error measure where lower values
    mean higher accuracy in the predictions. Note that the RMSE is measured on the
    same scale as the output variable, so a simple comparison among the RMSE of the
    forecasting methods is enough to evaluate their performance when the output variable
    is the same for all forecasting methods. 2.3.1. Description of the Output and
    Input Variables In this research, the same output and input variables were used
    for the three forecasting methods (LR, RFR, and SVR). The output (response variable)
    in all cases was the total amount of irrigation water for the next week suggested
    by the agronomists (given in their reports). Regarding the set of possible input
    variables, the selection was made according to the main information used by the
    agronomists when developing the irrigation reports, such as the total water needs
    (TWN), the soil water status, the amount of water applied previously, and the
    critical period of the crop: in the case of citrus trees, the main critical periods
    are flowering and fruit setting (Stage I), and a second period when fruit is growing
    fast (Stage II). However, there are more factors that might affect irrigation
    prediction (such as the weather prediction, the possible irrigation cutoff in
    the area, etc.), and those factors are not taken into account by the agronomist.
    This could be a limitation of this IDSS. The selection of a suitable set of features
    is crucial for good performances in the prediction models. In this sense, a selection
    procedure similar to that depicted in [36] was developed. The inputs that perform
    best in this new context were the following: daily average of the matric potential
    of the last 5 d (five inputs); the TWN (one input); the water applied (sensor
    measured) during the previous week (one input); a binary value indicating whether
    or not the crop is in a period where the fruit is gaining weight (one input).
    The daily average of the soil matric potential gives representative information
    about the conditions of the soil in the previous week. The TWN provides the theoretical
    irrigation volume for the crops in a specific area with specific weather conditions.
    The quantity of water for the last week is a hint of what the water requirement
    for the next week should be, as the water requirements of one week and the next
    are highly correlated. Finally, the period of the crop helps to finer tune the
    irrigation quantity: periods without fruit are less critical than those in which
    the fruit is present on the crop [27,45]. Due to the nature of the output (the
    amount of water for the next week), we selected the regression methods described
    below to obtain the predictions. 2.3.2. Linear Regression LR is a classical statistical
    method that explains a target variable 𝑌 (called a response variable) as a linear
    function of a set of features 𝑋 𝑗 controlled by the researcher (called regressors
    or predictors). In general, the multiple LR model can be expressed as follows:
    𝑌 𝑖 = 𝛽 0 + 𝛽 1 𝑥 𝑖,1 +…+ 𝛽 𝑘 𝑥 𝑖,𝑘 + 𝜖 𝑖       𝑖=1,2,…𝑛 (2) where n denotes the
    sample size. The 𝛽 𝑗 parameters of the model are estimated using the least squares
    criteria. In general, some of the proposed predictors by the researcher might
    be not significant (that is, irrelevant when the rest of the predictors are considered
    in the model), so it is important to provide simpler models when it is possible.
    There are different methods to achieve a simplified model, such as stepwise, forward,
    and backward selection methods. The results of the model selection depend on the
    data being analyzed. In the present research, the three selection methods were
    applied to the dataset before estimating the multiple LR model, and the same results
    were obtained. The main advantage of the LR method against other ML methods is
    the fast computation time in which the parameters of the model are estimated.
    Under a suitable theoretical framework, it allows inferences on the regression
    parameters and predictions. Although the LR method has shown good behavior in
    many contexts and fields, its efficiency is limited to linear relationships between
    the response variable and the predictors. However, real problems might present
    nonlinear and complex relationships between them. 2.3.3. Regression Trees: Bagging
    Regression and Random Forest Regression In the case of nonlinear and complex relationships
    between the features and the response, regression trees have shown better performance
    than classical approaches. In a regression tree, the feature space is divided
    into J non-overlapping “boxes,” and the prediction for a new observation is given
    by the mean of the response values of the training data belonging to the same
    “box” as the new observation. Let {( 𝑥 1 , 𝑦 1 ),( 𝑥 2 , 𝑦 2 ),…,( 𝑥 𝑛 , 𝑦 𝑛 )}
    be the training dataset, where each 𝑦 𝑖 denotes the i-th output (response variable)
    and 𝑥 𝑖  = ( 𝑥 𝑖,1 ,  𝑥 𝑖,2 ,…, 𝑥 𝑖,𝑘 ) the corresponding input of the s predictors
    (features) in the study. The objective in a regression tree is to find boxes 𝐵
    1 , 𝐵 2 ,…, 𝐵 𝑗 that minimize the RSS, given by Equation (3): ∑ 𝑗 = 1 𝐽 ∑ 𝑖∈ 𝐵
    𝑗 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝐵 𝑗 ) 2 (3) where 𝑦 ̂ 𝐵 𝑗 is the mean response for the training
    observations within the jth box. A desirable criterion could be to find the partition
    of the feature space that minimizes the residual sum of squares (RSS) for the
    training dataset, but this approach is usually computationally infeasible. Therefore,
    the way to obtain the partition of the feature space is by means of binary splitting:
    the algorithm chooses, at each step, the predictor ( 𝑋 𝑗 ) and cut-point (s) that
    minimize the RSS for the resulting tree. In general, the above optimization problem
    is not very computationally demanding, except when the number of features is too
    large. The process is repeated until a stopping criterion is reached, for instance,
    until all regions contain less than a determined number of observations. Regression
    trees have many advantages: they are easy to explain, computationally fast to
    obtain, and can handle missing data, outliers, and irrelevant features. However,
    they are very sensitive to the data and can overfit the training data (there are
    lots of small branches). A way to keep from overfitting is to prune the least
    important leaves of the tree. Therefore, using a good strategy for pruning the
    tree, a single regression tree can be used as a prediction method, but it is more
    efficient to use them as base learners in complex solutions. In random forest
    and bagging, the original training dataset is used to build N new subsets that
    only perform random sampling with replacement. For each new training dataset,
    the corresponding regression tree is developed. Given a new observation, the prediction
    of each single tree is computed, and the final prediction is obtained as the mean
    of the single predictions. The final prediction reduces the variance and improves
    accuracy [46]. The difference between bagging (bootstrap aggregating) and random
    forest is the number of predictors (features) considered at each split of the
    tree. In bagging, all the features are used, whereas in random forest only a random
    sample of mtry (predictors considered at each split of the regression tree) can
    be chosen each time. This last approach allows one to reduce the variance more
    efficiently. The main parameters to be tuned in random forest are N and mtry,
    whereas for bagging only N should be tuned because mtry = k (the total number
    of features) is determined. It is important to highlight that, for these methods,
    the fitting goodness increases (or at least does not decrease) with the number
    of trees, so we do not have to worry about choosing values for N that are greater
    than necessary. 2.3.4. Support Vector Regression Support vector machines (SVMs)
    are very popular in the field of classification problems. The adaptation of the
    SVM approach to regression problems has led to an effective tool in function estimation:
    SVR. In this section, the basis of the SVR technique is depicted together with
    suggestions for the parameter selection stage of the method. Firstly, the linear
    case is presented for simplicity, and the nonlinear case is introduced secondly.
    The objective of the linear support vector regression (LSVR) is to find a linear
    function of the following form that can fit the actual output vector y (response
    variable) while balancing model complexity and prediction error: 𝑓(𝒙)=𝒘,𝒙+𝑏= ∑
    𝑗=1 𝑘 𝑤 𝑗 𝑥 𝑗 +𝑏,  𝑏𝜖𝑅,𝒙,𝒘𝜖 𝑅 𝑘 (4) In Equation (4), 𝒙 denotes the vector of input
    features, k the number of features, 𝒘 the vector of parameters to be estimated,
    and b the position parameter to be estimated. The vector of parameters 𝒘 represents
    the flatness or simplicity of the function. SVM generalization to SVR is accomplished
    by introducing an ε-insensitive region around the function, called the ε-tube,
    in such a way that observations 𝑦 𝑖 , which lie inside the tube, lead to null
    errors. For the development of the method, it is necessary to set a tolerance
    margin ε (penalizing only the points placed outside the ε-tube [47]) and to select
    a loss function (that describes the way to measure the estimation errors). There
    are different types of loss functions (linear, quadratic, Huber, etc.), and we
    can distinguish between symmetrical and asymmetrical ones. In this paper, we will
    focus on the Vapnik’s ε-insensitive linear loss function given by 𝐿 𝜀 (r)={ 0
    |r|−𝜀 𝑖𝑓 |r|≤𝜀 𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 (5) Note that the loss function is only affected by the
    training samples that lie outside the ε-tube, which are called support vectors.
    Though many phenomena can be modeled by linear functions, there are many situations
    where the relationship between the output (response variable) and the input variables
    (features) is not linear. For nonlinear functions, the data can be mapped into
    a higher dimensional space by means of a nonlinear function 𝜙(𝒙):  𝑅 𝑘 → 𝑅 𝑀 ,
    𝑀>𝑘. Now the aim is to find a function of the following form that can fit the
    output vector y while balancing model complexity and prediction error: 𝑓(𝒘,𝑏)=〈𝒘,𝜙(𝒙)〉+𝑏
    (6) Next, the optimization problem can be written for the nonlinear case: as min
    𝒘,𝑏,𝜉, 𝜉 ∗ 𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝑡𝑜 1 2 ||𝒘|| 2 +𝐶 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 ( 𝜉 𝑖 + 𝜉 ∗ 𝑖 ) 𝑦 𝑖 −(〈𝒘,𝜙(𝒙)〉+𝑏)≤𝜀+
    𝜉 𝑖 (〈𝒘,𝜙(𝒙)〉+𝑏)− 𝑦 𝑖 ≤𝜀+ 𝜉 ∗ 𝑖 𝜉 𝑖 , 𝜉 ∗ 𝑖 ≥0,𝑖=1, 2,⋯, 𝑛 (7) where 𝜉 𝑖 , 𝜉 *  𝑖
    represent the upper and lower training errors (see Figure 4), and C is a regularization
    parameter that controls the model error and model simplicity trade-off. For example,
    large values of C give more weight to minimizing the model error. Figure 4. Nonlinear
    support vector regression (SVR) with Vapnik’s ε-insensitive loss function. Figure
    4 shows the behavior of a nonlinear SVM [23]. The selection of an appropriate
    transformation 𝜙(𝒙) is not an easy task. However, one advantage of SVR is that,
    in practice, the nonlinear function 𝜙(𝒙) does not need to be used. If we re-write
    the optimization problem of Equation (7) in its dual form, it can be seen that
    only the inner products 𝜙( 𝒙 𝑖 ),𝜙( 𝒙 𝑗 ) are needed. In this context, Vapnik
    [47] proposes the use of internal products through a “kernel trick”: 𝐾( 𝒙 𝑖 ,
    𝒙 𝑗 )=〈𝜙( 𝒙 𝑖 ),𝜙( 𝒙 𝑗 )〉 (8) where K(X,Y) is a function that verifies Mercer’s
    theorem [47]. Therefore, the SVR technique requires the selection of ε (margin
    of the tube), C (regularization parameter), and the kernel function. Some of the
    most used kernel functions in the context of SVR are the linear, polynomial, and
    sigmoid kernels. In this paper, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, given
    by Equation (9), was used, because of its good results in nonlinear relations
    [48]. 𝐾( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 )= 𝑒 (−𝛾 | 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 𝑗 | 2 ) (9) Recall that higher values of
    C provide more complex models and can produce overfitting of the training data.
    Smaller values of C result in a simpler model but low accuracy. For this paper,
    the value of this parameter was selected following the indications of Mattera
    and Haykin [49], who propose that C should be equal to the range of the output.
    The parameter ε also affects the smoothness or complexity of the model. In addition,
    the value of ε determines the number of support vectors. Smaller values of ε lead
    to higher numbers of support vectors and, therefore, a more complex learning machine.
    However, higher values of ε lead to a lower number of support vectors, so important
    information may be lost. In this work, the suggestions of Cherkassky and Ma [50]
    and Mattera and Haykin [49] were chosen. They propose a value of ε such that the
    percentage of support vectors in the regression model is around 50% of the number
    of samples. 3. Results and Discussion In this section, we show the results obtained
    after the training and testing stages of each regression method, and we provide
    different measures to compare their performances. Regarding the LR method, the
    final estimated model was the same using the three selection methods (stepwise,
    forward, and backward). As for the RFR method, a value of N = 500 (the total number
    of trees considered in the training stage) was selected, whereas mtry = 8 provided
    the best goodness-of-fit in the test dataset. Finally, the SVR model that performs
    best uses an RBF kernel, a penalty factor C of 100, and an epsilon of 8 (obtaining
    265 support vectors, which is slightly higher than 50% of the sample size). In
    order to analyze the performance of the different models, LOOCV and random 90-10
    shuffle cross-validation techniques were used to assure better evaluation. In
    both cases, the RMSE was selected as the error measure to evaluate the accuracy
    in the training and test datasets. Table 2 shows the results of the 90-10 shuffle
    cross-validation. The three regression models were compared with a dummy model
    that irrigates the crops based only on the TWN. This dummy model takes advantage
    of the fact that the maximum amount of water calculated by the agronomist is typically
    less than the TWN. Using the training data, the optimal percentage is calculated
    based on the phenological period of the crop. A value of 95% TWN is fixed in the
    more critical period (when the fruit is present), and 75% TWN when the fruit is
    not present. These values make sense according to the irrigation tips made by
    the agronomist. Table 2. Root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 90-10 shuffle cross-validation
    for the models (m3 ha−1 week−1). LR: linear regression; RFR: random forest regression;
    SVR: support vector regression. In the case of the shuffle cross-validation, the
    three regression models perform much better than this dummy method. Both SVR and
    RFR perform similarly with RMSEs of 17.13 and 16.83 m3 ha−1 in testing, respectively.
    LR performs worse than the other two models. It seems normal according to its
    linear nature that is not able to adapt well enough to more complex situations.
    Table 3 shows the results of the LOOCV for the four prediction models and each
    orchard separately. The first column represents the orchard number. In this case,
    for each selected orchard, we do not use the data of the orchard for training—only
    for testing. In other words, this approach proves the generalization capabilities
    of the model. Each row represents the training and test errors of the models when
    the selected orchard is left out. Table 3. RMSE of the (leave-one-out cross-validation
    (LOOCV) for the four models (m3 ha−1 week−1). In this case, RFR is still the model
    that performs best, with LR in second place and performing slightly better than
    SVR, with average RMSE values in testing of 18.01, 18.35, and 19.99 m3 ha−1 per
    week, respectively. All models performed better than the dummy model. Figure 5
    and Table 4 analyze the water requirement per month for the RFR model, the dummy
    model, the TWN, and the GT (ground-truth) during the year 2018 and for three of
    the orchards. Although all nine plots were used for the model training and error
    comparison phases, a comparative representation of the goodness of the models
    with respect to GT (agronomist reports) was made for those plots for which full
    years of data were available, Orchards 6, 7, and 9. In this case, the relative
    error (RE), given in Equation (10), was used to evaluate the monthly accuracy
    for each prediction method: 𝑅𝐸(𝑗) =      𝑦 𝑗 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑗 𝑦 𝑗      (10) where
    𝑦 𝑗 is the actual output for month j, and 𝑦 ̂ 𝑗 is the estimated output for month
    j. Note that this error measure is a dimensionless quantity (see Figure 6), and
    it does not make sense when the output variable can take null values. The mean
    relative error (MRE), computed as the mean of the monthly relative errors, provides
    a dimensionless global error measure (see Table 4): 𝑀𝑅𝐸 = ∑ 𝑚 𝑗 = 1 𝑅𝐸(𝑗) 𝑚 =
    ∑ 𝑚 𝑗 = 1 | 𝑦 𝑗 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑗 𝑦 𝑗 | 𝑚 (11) where m denotes the number of months considered;
    in our case, m = 12 because the methods were evaluated just for the year 2018.

    (b) Orchard 2; (c) Orchard 3. Figure 6. Relative error (RE) distribution for each
    of the monthly model predictions for the year 2018. Table 4. Estimated water requirement
    (m3 ha−1) during 2018 for each model and orchard. TWN: total water needs. Figure
    6 shows the distribution of the relative errors associated with each prediction
    model compared to the GT. We can notice that the RFR model has much less dispersion
    and fewer relative errors compared to the TWN and dummy methods. Irrespective
    of the magnitude of the residuals, it is important to verify if the prediction
    errors behave properly (ensuring no bias, low dispersion, and symmetry). In this
    sense, the quality of the errors was checked, analyzing, for each prediction method,
    the distribution of the net residuals by means of the box plots given in Figure
    7. It can be seen that the TWN and dummy methods provide higher bias, dispersion,
    and asymmetry than the RFR method. Figure 7. Distribution of the residuals (net
    errors) for the dummy, RFR, and TWN prediction methods. In Figure 8, we can see
    that the monthly and weekly RFR prediction follow quite precisely the tendency
    of the GT for all months and weeks in each one of the three orchards tested. Figure

    the one predicted by the RFR model for the year 2018: (a) Orchard 1; (b) Orchard

    of an automatic decision support system to manage irrigation in agriculture. The
    system was trained with climatic and soil data from nine different citric crops
    located in different zones of Southeast Spain. The aim of the IDSS is to mimic
    the irrigation recommendations of an agronomist, with the idea of creating a robust
    model (with good generalization capabilities) able to precisely predict the weekly
    water requirement of the crops with no previous information of the specific field.
    Three regression methods were tested to determine the one that best fits the agronomist
    criteria. RFR was the method that best emulated the agronomist. Despite the results
    obtained among the regression models tested, the number of reports is a critical
    factor that directly affects the performance of the methods. Regarding the water
    applied, we can conclude that considering only the TWN for irrigation wastes water
    (an increment of 282, 722, and 1049 m3 ha−1 per year for Orchards 6, 7, and 9,
    respectively) compared to the agronomist. In contrast, the dummy estimator tends
    to heavily underestimate the water requirements (with underestimates of 766, 404,
    and 393 m3 ha−1 for Orchards 6, 7, and 9, respectively). However, the RFR model
    performed much better than the others (408, 248, and 7 m3 ha−1) with errors below
    12% for all the orchards and weeks. In terms of performance, considering the water
    predicted by the IDSS versus the agronomist, the system has a weekly average error
    below 9% for the most critical periods (the ones when the fruit is growing), with
    a 10% error being considered acceptable in agriculture. It can be concluded that
    the IDSS is a viable predictor [51]. For future research, we aim to extend the
    dataset with more citrus plantations in order to analyze the performance in different
    regions and weather conditions. In addition, exporting this model to other plantations
    different from citrus and adding data only from VWC sensors would be a good way
    of evaluating the robustness of the model and decreasing the cost of the whole
    system. Another future improvement would be to migrate the system to daily instead
    of a weekly prediction. This change would vastly increase the potential of the
    model, as it would be able to adapt more quickly to changes in weather conditions
    and decrease the reaction time, which will result in water savings. Author Contributions

    The demand for irrigation water in agricultural systems is an important area of
    concern, especially given the growing scarcity of available water resources and
    the need to compete with other consumer sectors [1]. Appropriate and efficient
    irrigation water management and use practices are urgently required and should
    be aimed at ensuring both economic and environmental benefits [2]. Crop water
    needs vary spatially and temporally depending on meteorological conditions, crop
    type and crop growth stage [3]. Spatial variability may be associated to soil
    texture changes, topographic features, soil compaction, fertility differences,
    local pest distribution, and the characteristics of the irrigation system employed
    [4,5,6,7,8]. Consequently, irrigation management efficiency depends to a large
    extent on the ability to adapt water inputs to the variable needs of the plants.
    A wide range of sensors are available on the market today which are able to provide
    real time information about the plant and its surroundings. However, the correct
    use of such information for decision-making purposes can be highly complex because
    of the need for specialist know-how and a considerable dedication of time and
    effort. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) can contribute to resolving
    this problem by facilitating the capture, storage, processing, and dissemination
    of significant amounts of information [9]. Integrating such technologies with
    what is known about plant response to water inputs at the different growth stages
    of a crop is a major challenge which, if overcome, could lead to the development
    of intelligent systems able to emulate the expert decision-making process. Irrigation
    scheduling methods are classified in three major groups: water-balance-based methods,
    methods which focus on monitoring soil water content or potential, and methods
    which use measurement of the plant water status as reference [10,11]. Although
    the latter option may be the most attractive “a priori”, as it the plant itself
    which is giving information about its water needs, its practical application for
    irrigation management is still in a developmental stage [12]. The water balance
    method is the most commonly used strategy worldwide for irrigation scheduling.
    In this method, the soil-plant system water inputs must balance the expected outputs.
    The main water output, without considering the characteristics of the irrigation
    system, is through crop evapotranspiration (ETc) which, following the method proposed
    by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), is calculated
    as the product of the evapotranspiration of the reference crop (ETo) and the crop
    coefficient (Kc) [13]. This method has the advantage of establishing a direct
    correlation between crop water needs and climate conditions [3]. However, it has
    the drawback of not considering any possible deviations between estimated and
    actual consumption values caused by the particular conditions of the plot, interannual
    variations in crop growth patterns [14], the plant material, or the crop practices
    undertaken [3]. Such mismatching can result in a systematic error that could accumulate
    over the crop cycle. Interest in irrigation scheduling based on information provided
    by soil moisture sensors has been boosted by technological advances in sensorization
    and communications. These technological advances have led to commercial developments
    which are able to provide processed information with recommendations for the resetting
    of irrigation volumes. There are even more advanced options which offer full and
    complete system automation. However, the weaknesses of a control system based
    solely on sensors include the risk of sensor breakdown, measurement variability
    [15], and the difficulty of interpreting the sensor data, especially in the case
    of drip irrigation where soil water distribution is heterogenous [16]. There are
    a number of complementary benefits and drawbacks to scheduling irrigation on the
    basis of the water balance and the use of sensors. However, the automated combination
    of the two systems is a potential way of eliminating the drawbacks and enjoying
    the benefits of each. An optimized system could integrate the water balance calculations
    with meteorological data, together with a correction of the Kc value according
    to actual water consumption continuously assessed with soil sensors. This type
    of infrastructure would, in principle, be aimed at agricultural systems of high
    added value which require highly specialized management. This could be the case
    in the employment of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies in woody crops.
    An RDI strategy involves supplying an irrigation volume below the crop’s theoretical
    water requirements during specific periods of the crop cycle in phenological stages
    which are less sensitive to a water deficit [17]. The RDI strategies are based
    on the different seasonal or phenological sensitivity of some crops to water stress.
    They are used to save water resources and obtain agronomic benefits related to
    the control of plant vigor [18] and enhanced yield quality [19]. For Japanese
    plum, various RDI strategies have been proposed depending on the crop cycle [20,21].
    The simplest systems which have been used in automated irrigation with soil moisture
    sensors or tensiometers are centered on initiating/terminating the irrigation
    when the measurements provided by the sensors rise above or fall below preestablished
    thresholds [22,23,24,25,26]. Cárdenas et al. [27] developed a system using soil
    moisture sensors which allowed the operator to choose a threshold above which
    the scheduled irrigation events were not permitted. An interesting approach for
    the development of automated systems is to combine ETc estimation with feedback
    of the information provided by the soil sensors, as in the case of direct measurement
    of plant consumption. Some authors have carried out such an integration using
    software tools and web applications [3,11,28,29]. The use of feedback is fundamental
    for the establishment of an automated control system [10]. There are two types
    of control systems: (1) open loop systems, in which the output is generated depending
    on the input or, in other words, no information or feedback is received about
    the state of the variable. The main drawback of an open loop system is that it
    cannot react to changes that occur in the system. (2) Closed loop systems, in
    which the output depends on considerations and corrections made by the feedback
    system or, in other words, the system controllers receive information about the
    state of the variable and calculate what future actions need to be taken [10].
    With the second option, the sensors play an essential role in closing the cycle,
    as they obtain real time information about the plot. The primary aim of this study
    is the adjustment and evaluation in field conditions of a fully automated irrigation
    system which integrates the water balance method with continuous soil moisture
    measurements and expert know-how of crop response to water deficit in ‘Red Beaut’,
    an early-maturing Japanese plum cultivar. A novel aspect of this work is the fact
    that the irrigation scheduling considers, among other things, the application
    of an RDI strategy specifically adapted to this crop and cultivar. The secondary
    objectives of this study include (i) securing adequate information for a better
    system adjustment, and (ii) checking the yield response of the trees against the
    RDI strategy creating an automated system 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study
    Area and Irrigation System The study was carried out over the course of two crop
    seasons (2016–2017) in an early-maturing Japanese plum orchard of 1 ha (Prunus
    salicina Lindl. ‘Red Beaut’), located in “Finca La Orden”, an experimental farm
    in Badajoz, Spain (latitude 38°51′19.06″ N, longitude 6°40′18.90″ W, datum WGS84),
    run by the Scientific and Technological Research Centre of Extremadura (Regional
    Government of Extremadura). The trees were planted in the spring of 2005 with
    a 6 × 4 m spacing and in an east–west orientation. A Mediterranean climate prevails
    in this area, with a dry season from June to September (summer) and a wet season
    from October to May (winter) with 80% of total precipitation. Mean annual precipitation
    is 500 mm and mean annual temperature is 16.5 °C (1992–2017). Soil texture is
    loam, with an average 19.4% clay content, 40.2% lime content, and 40.4% sand content.
    The soil has a slightly acidic pH value, low organic material content and high
    apparent density, moderate to weak structure with normal P₂O₅ content (values
    above 40 ppm between soil depths of 0.4 and 0.6 m), low Na+ and K+ content, and
    low cation exchange capacity. A drip-irrigation system was used, with one irrigation
    tape per row of trees located close to the base of the tree, with 4 × 4 l/h self-compensating
    emitters spaced at 1 m intervals. 2.2. Automatic Irrigation System The automated
    irrigation system (Figure 1) was comprised of two fundamental components: (a)
    field equipment; and (b) the IRRIX software. Figure 1. Components of the automatic
    system. (a) Installation in the field of the following elements of the automated
    irrigation system: To monitor the soil moisture content in the experiment, fifteen
    10HS capacitance probes (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) were installed
    in three representative trees. Five probes were installed in each tree: two probes
    under the emitter at 0.3 m depth, two probes under the emitter at 0.6 m depth
    and one probe situated between emitters, approximately at a distance of 0.15 m
    horizontally under the dripper line. The IRRIX software evaluated every probe
    and established the reference levels. An air temperature sensor (CS2015, Campbell
    Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA) at a height of 3 m (in line with a tree row).
    Energy source: next to the temperature probe, a solar panel was installed with
    a 12V-7Ah lead battery and voltage regulator (BlueSolar PWM-Pro, Victron Energy
    Blue Power, De Paal, The Netherlands). Sensors for irrigation water application
    control: a 24V-50Hz solenoid valve (Rain Bird Europe SCN, Aix-en-Provence, France),
    a digital water meter (MTK, Zenner, Madrid, Spain) and a relay controller (SMD-CD16AC,
    Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA). Logger: all the above components were
    connected to a datalogger (CR1000, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA) which
    stored the data once every 5 min. (b) IRRIX software. IRRIX is a cloud-hosted
    web platform which, without the need for human intervention, carries out the following
    tasks: Captures data from the sensors installed in the field. The data were uploaded
    4 times a day via IPv4/IPv6 to the IRRIX server. Data processing and interpretation:
    IRRIX analyzes all the input data to detect anomalies or important events in the
    system (irrigation, rain). As an indicator of the evolution of the soil’s water
    status, IRRIX is set for each sensor at the driest value recorded every day, soil
    water content (SWC), daily driest SWC (SWCd). Then, to reduce the variability
    between sensors, IRRIX normalizes these values specifically for each sensor, such
    as: NSWCd = (SWCd − SWCWP)/(SWCFC − SWCWP) (1) where soil water content wilting
    point (SWCWP) and soil water content field capacity (SWCFC) correspond to the
    values that this sensor would take under conditions of wilting point and field
    capacity, respectively. In practice, SWCFC was taken at the beginning of the campaign
    from actual measurements of the system in field conditions, while SWCWP was assigned
    to the supposed value of SWC in wilting point for this type of soil. To add the
    different sensors installed in the same irrigation sector, the system performs
    a weighted average where the weight of each sensor is the product of its reliability
    and representativeness. The reliability of a sensor is related to the quality
    of the data that a sensor is recording, in other words, whether the sensor is
    operating correctly or not due to some unexpected anomaly. IRRIX automatically
    estimates sensor reliability on a daily basis with a scale of values ranging from
    0 to 1. All sensors have an initial value of 1, and each time an anomaly is detected
    the reliability value is decreased (multiplied by a value ranging between 0 and
    0.5) depending on the seriousness of the anomaly. If the sensor stops working,
    IRRIX automatically removes it from the system (value of 0) and does not take
    the data from the sensor into account in its estimations. The representativeness
    of each sensor refers to whether the information provided by the sensor is relevant
    or not for the decision-making process in the irrigation control system. The representativeness
    level is not set automatically by IRRIX but by the user according to his/her criteria.
    In practice, representativeness takes the value 1. Irrigation scheduling decision-making.
    IRRIX analyzes the dataset on a daily basis to determine and adjust the irrigation
    dose based on the information provided by the soil moisture sensors. IRRIX uses
    a control algorithm which combines a water-balance-based estimation of crop water
    needs (feed-forward control) with readjustment based on sensor readings (feedback
    control). The IRRIX control algorithms that were used are a development of the
    algorithm described in Casadesús et al. [3]. IRRIX calculates the ETc as follows:
    𝐸𝑇𝑐=𝐸𝑇𝑜 𝑥 (𝑓𝑘𝑐𝑏 𝑥 𝐾𝑐𝑏+𝑘𝑒) (2) where ETo is the evapotranspiration of a reference
    crop, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient [13], fKcb is an adjustment factor to
    personalize Kcb to the vigor of the plot, and Ke is a soil water evaporation coefficient
    [13] which is closely related to the wet soil fraction, and for the case of this
    particular plot was assigned a value of 0.2. The ETo was estimated daily based
    on the air temperature data and using the Hargreaves equation [30,31], previously
    calibrated with a historical series of 20 years of meteorological data obtained
    from a weather station located 200 m from the study plot. The daily irrigation
    dose scheduled (DIDs) is then calculated as follows: 𝐷𝐼𝐷𝑠=𝐸𝑇𝑐 𝑥 𝑓𝑘𝑐+𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔+𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙_𝑚𝑚
    (3) where fKc is a parameter which is adjusted according to the seasonal plan
    and the water balance, pending refers to mm of irrigation water from previous
    days which are pending application to the crop, and additional_mm refers to mm
    of irrigation water which may be applied in addition to the proposed DIDs to,
    for example, wash out salts. In the present study, additional_mm = 0. The daily
    water balance (WB) can then be calculated as follows: 𝑊𝐵=𝐷𝐼𝐷𝑚−𝐸𝑇𝑐 (4) where DIDm
    is the daily irrigation dose measured by IRRIX, which is normally the same as
    the DIDs provided there is no anomaly in the irrigation system. Irrigation scheduling:
    IRRIX sends the updated irrigation doses to the datalogger. Then, the order is
    given to activate the other devices (relay, valve, pumps, etc.) to apply the required
    irrigation dose. User interaction: IRRIX is an automated system whose main purpose
    is to allow the user to carry out other tasks. The main function of the user is
    to verify that the system has operated correctly and that the irrigation campaign
    has been implemented as planned. If there is any anomaly in the system, the user
    must resolve it. To facilitate this process, a simplified interactive display
    panel is available with warning alerts. For the purposes of this study, the system
    considers three additional aspects: Irrigation strategy: In this case, it was
    decided to use an RDI strategy recommended for this cultivar in accordance with
    previous studies in the same area [20]. This strategy consists of avoiding a situation
    of water stress during the preharvest period (100% ETc) and reducing irrigation
    inputs during the postharvest period to replace 40% of the ETc and thereby induce
    a moderate water deficit. Seasonal plan: This was based on a seasonal water consumption
    curve for the irrigation campaign determined on the basis of a calendar adjusted
    according to previous campaigns for the crop or plot, and in this case integrating
    the RDI strategy. Curves above and below this initial curve were established to
    determine the admissible bounds for the irrigation scheduling. These bounds were
    to ensure that irrigation inputs above those available for the campaign were not
    used and to ensure that a situation of sever water deficit did not arise. Soil
    comfort zone in relation to the dimensionless capacitive sensor readings: This
    soil comfort zone was used to determine the acceptable range for the soil moisture
    sensor measurements. The control system modulates the irrigation dose to maintain
    the soil moisture capacitive sensor measurements within this comfort zone. The
    system determines this comfort zone on an individual basis for each sensor and
    modifies it over the course of the season depending on the irrigation strategy
    employed. 2.3. Irrigation Treatments and Experimental Design Three irrigation
    treatments were used in this study: control (C), regulated deficit irrigation
    (RDI), and automatic (A). In treatment C, irrigation was scheduled to cover crop
    water needs throughout the crop cycle. The irrigation dose applied was ETc minus
    effective rainfall. The ETc was calculated following Allen et al. [13]. The RDI
    treatment applied the same irrigation until harvesting as in the C treatment,
    and in the postharvest period 40% of the water applied in treatment C until leaf
    fall. The scheduling of treatment A was performed by the IRRIX application, and
    the seasonal plan incorporated in IRRIX was the same as that used in the RDI treatment.
    The irrigation calculations and schedules were made in both the C and RDI treatments
    by an expert in the field. For the C and RDI treatments, the ETo was calculated
    using the modified Penman–Monteith equation [13], using the data obtained through
    an external meteorological network (REDAREX), and the Kc that was employed was
    adapted to the crop and orchard [20]. The experimental design of the plot was
    random blocks with four replicates per treatment. Each experimental plot consisted
    of four adjacent rows, with each row containing four trees (16 trees/block). Data
    collection was carried out for the four central trees, with the other trees acting
    as guard trees including the four corner trees which were of a different cultivar.
    2.4. Measurements 2.4.1. Applied Water and Water Status In each treatment, a digital
    water meter (MTK, Zenner, Madrid, Spain) was installed to record water volumes
    on a daily basis. Midday stem water potential (Ψstem) was measured with a pressure
    chamber (Model 3005, Soil Moisture Equipment, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) every seven
    days between 13:00 and 15:00. In four trees, two shaded leaves per tree were selected
    close to the base of the trunk and covered with aluminum foil at least 2 h before
    measurements started [32]. The mean Ψstem value was then calculated from the total
    of 32 Ψstem measurements that were made per treatment. 2.4.2. Trunk Cross-Sectional
    Area and Winter Pruning The trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) was determined by
    measuring the trunk perimeter at a height of 10 cm above ground level with a measuring
    tape. All measurements were made at the same point as marked at the start of the
    experiment. The increase in TCSA (ΔTCSA) is the difference in the values obtained
    for the following dates: 15 March 2016, 25 November 2016, and 04 October 2017.
    Winter pruning was carried out in January 2016 and December 2017. For each tree,
    new wood (one-year-old wood) was separated from the old wood (older than one year)
    and weighed separately. A subsample of each group of each experimental plot was
    dried to a constant weight at 65 °C in a forced air oven (DryBig 50, Borel Fours
    Industriels & Etuves, S.A., Neuchâtel, Switzerland). When the samples were completely
    dry, they were weighed again to determine the moisture content. Summer pruning
    was performed in both years in June following local agricultural practices. The
    total dry weight of the pruned material was also analogously determined. 2.4.3.
    Phenology and Yield The phenological stage (Table 1) of the crop was determined
    visually twice a week (Monday and Thursday) between 09:00 and 12:00, from bud
    burst to leaf fall using the Baggiolini scale [33]. All treatments had similar
    phenological dates, with no change observed due to any of the applied treatments.
    Table 1. Phenology of the crop for the different years of the study. Harvesting
    was carried out in two stages: in 2016 at the beginning of June (02 June 2016
    and 08 June 2016), in 2017 at the end of May (22 May 2017 and 29 May 2017) and
    in 2018 at the beginning of June (07 June 2018 and 11 June 2018). The fruit was
    harvested at commercial maturity. The fruits from each control tree (central trees
    of each experimental plot) were weighed together. A total of 10 fruits per tree
    were then selected randomly and weighed individually to determine average fruit
    weight. The number of fruits per tree was calculated by dividing the weight of
    the fruits of each tree by the average weight of the 10 selected fruits. 2.5.
    Statistical Analysis An ANOVA statistical analysis was performed. When significant
    differences were detected, a comparison of means was performed by applying Duncan’s
    test at p < 0.05. Data were analyzed using the statistical software package IBM
    SPSS version 24.0 for Windows (IBM Corp. Released 2016. IBM SPSS Statistics for
    Windows, Version 24.0. Armonk, NY, USA). 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Automatic
    Irrigation An IRRIX user interaction screenshot is shown in Figure 2. The screen
    shows information about the last seven days of irrigation. The traffic light system
    displays whether the irrigation system is operating correctly or if there has
    been a fault in a sensor, the irrigation system, seasonal plan, battery system,
    or communication system. The example in Figure 2 indicates a warning in the system
    due to a failure in the seasonal plan: on day one the full IRRIX-planned irrigation
    was not applied, and on day three an excess of irrigation water was applied. Figure
    2. Screenshot of the “synoptic” tab of IRRIX in the year 2017. Figure 3 shows
    the evolution of each soil moisture sensor in the experimental plot over the course
    of the 2017 irrigation campaign. It can be seen that all the sensors detected
    changes in water content during the campaign. However, the values and seasonal
    evolution were different for each sensor, even when occupying the same relative
    position in adjacent trees or when irrigated in the same manner. An analysis of
    sensor-to-sensor variability is therefore required. In zone 1 (Figure 3a), the
    sensors situated at a depth of 30 cm were very sensitive to the irrigation, responding
    rapidly to it and presenting a marked amplitude response between the minimum pre-irrigation
    values and the maximum values on terminating the irrigation. As for the sensors
    situated at a depth of 60 cm, the 60-1 sensor recorded weaker irrigation-related
    variations than the 60-2 sensor. The sensor situated between drippers (I-30-1)
    responded rapidly to low irrigation inputs, as did the sensors situated below
    the drippers, but with a comparatively delayed reaction and with a smaller amplitude
    between minimum and maximum values. In zone 2 (Figure 3b), the 30 cm deep sensors
    displayed a different behavior to those of zone 1. This may be because these sensors
    only detect water in a very limited surrounding soil volume of around 1 L, which
    may in practice be a poor representation of what is happening in the soil as a
    whole. This is aggravated with the use of drip irrigation, where water distribution
    in the bulb tends to be irregular and differs between drippers as soil is a heterogeneous
    medium. Such a situation is especially complex in the case of woody crop plants
    when the moisture sensor is placed in the wet bulb area where more root activity
    is expected, entailing a degree of spatial heterogeneity [3,34]. Other reasons
    for sensor variability include the variability that can take place in the dielectric
    properties of the soil water [35] or variations in soil properties, particularly
    in soil apparent density or the presence of macropores. In consequence, and although
    the sensors record a lot of data, their interpretation can be an onerous task
    for the irrigator, which is considerably eased by the automatic data analysis
    and interpretation performed by IRRIX. It can also be seen in Figure 3 how soil
    moisture content decreases in the postharvest period when irrigation is reduced.
    This decrease is detected early in zone 1 (Figure 3a) in the sensors closest to
    the tree. In zone 2 (Figure 3b), the information is less clear, but in zone 3
    (Figure 3c) all the sensors clearly respond to the fall in irrigation inputs,
    but later than in zone 1. Figure 3. Data logged from the 10HS sensors in the year
    2017 in the different zones: (a) zone 1, (b) zone 2, and (c) zone 3. Θw = soil
    water; 30-1,30-2,30-3,30-4,30-5,30-6 are sensors installed at 15 cm from the dripper
    and at a depth of 30 cm; 60-1,60-2,60-3,60-4,60-5,60-6 are sensors installed 15
    cm from the dripper and at a depth of 60 cm; I-30-1, I30-2, I-30-3 are sensors
    installed at a depth of 30 cm and located between drippers. Pre-harvest is the
    period from fruit set to harvest; postharvest is the period from harvest to onset
    of leaf fall. In our study, it is possible to observe sensor reliability in all
    the zones (Figure 3a–c), as when a sensor ceased to function due to some serious
    fault it was quickly replaced by another so that the system could calculate the
    weighted average of the 15 moisture sensors that were initially installed. Nonetheless,
    if any sensor ceased to operate and was not replaced, IRRIX would have automatically
    removed it from the system and would not have included it in its estimations.
    In our study, all sensors took a value of 1 with respect to representativeness.
    An IRRIX ‘control plan’ screenshot for the whole irrigation campaign of 2016 and
    2017 is shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively. The accumulated irrigation
    (continuous brown line) of treatment A is shown in Figure 4a and Figure 5a, with
    the corresponding upper and lower bounds (red and blue broken lines) that were
    established in the seasonal plan. It can be seen that, in both years, the A treatment
    followed the established plan over the course of the campaign, remaining within
    the pre-established bounds. Figure 4b and Figure 5b correspond to the water balance
    and represent the difference between the water inputs and outputs in the soil-crop
    system each day (mm/day). The continuous brown line corresponds to the water balance
    of treatment A, and the broken lines represent the permitted maximum and minimum
    values in the programmed irrigation schedule. Normally, an irrigation dose is
    applied which maintains a balance between the inputs (rainfall and irrigation)
    and outputs (mainly evapotranspiration), such that the soil water balance tends
    to fluctuate around zero mm. However, there may be some situations in which it
    may be of interest to intentionally induce deviations from zero, for example,
    to induce a negative water balance for the application of RDI. In Figure 4b, it
    can be seen that RDI began on 01 June 2016, with a transition period that terminated
    on 10 June 2017 when the RDI treatment was fully applied. In 2017 (Figure 5b),
    RDI began on 30 May 2017 and full RDI application on 15 June 2017. That is, the
    RDI transition period was longer in 2017. It should also be noted that there were
    greater fluctuations in the water balance in 2016 (Figure 4b) than in 2017 (Figure
    5b). This may be due to adjustments made to the system’s comfort zone after the
    first year. Figure 4. Screenshot of the ‘control plan’ tab of IRRIX in the year
    2016, (a) the accumulated irrigation of treatment A during the irrigation campaign
    and (b) the water balance of treatment A during the irrigation campaign. Figure
    5. Screenshot of the ‘control plan’ tab of IRRIX in the year 2017, (a) the accumulated
    irrigation of treatment A during the irrigation campaign and (b) the water balance
    of treatment A during the irrigation campaign. As is clear from Figure 4 and Figure
    5, it can be confirmed that the system was able to carry out an automated irrigation
    scheduling in accordance with the established criteria and in years with different
    meteorological characteristics. 3.2. Meteorological Conditions and Applied Water
    Table 2 shows the ETo calculated using the Penman–Monteith method (ETo-PM) and
    the Hargreaves method (ETo-H), accumulated rainfall, mean temperature, mean air
    relative humidity, and preharvest and postharvest applied water for each treatment.
    As can be seen, the annual ETo-PM was very similar in the two years of the study,
    with very high values in the months of June, July, and August in both years. The
    ETo-H values followed the same seasonal trend as ETo-PM, though with slightly
    higher values in 2016 and slightly lower values in 2017. Seasonal rainfall distribution
    ranged between the minimum values of the summer months and the maximum values
    in autumn and winter of 2016 and in spring and winter of 2017. Total rainfall
    in the test period was 184.97 mm in 2016 and 79.2 mm in 2017, while total rainfall
    for the full year varied from 283.6 mm in 2017 to 525.63 mm in 2016. The difference
    in ETo between the two years was 82 mm according to the Penman–Monteith method
    but was just 38 mm according to the Hargreaves method, with a higher ETo value
    in 2017 than in 2016. Table 2. Reference evapotranspiration (ETo), rainfall, mean
    temperature, mean air relative humidity, and total irrigation water applied in
    the three irrigation treatments. The amount of irrigation water was higher in
    2017 as a consequence of the lower rainfall and higher ETo (Table 2). In 2016,
    the applied water volume in the RDI treatment was 46% less than in the C treatment,
    with a similar difference between the A and C treatments (45%). In 2017, water
    savings amounted to 38% and 41%, for the RDI and A treatments, respectively. An
    analysis of the water volumes applied in the different periods in each treatment
    shows that in the preharvest period of 2016 all three treatments received similar
    amounts. These volumes were very low due to the high spring rainfall. In 2017,
    when much higher volumes were applied, there were clear differences between treatments,
    with a greater volume in C and a lower volume in A. According to the pre-established
    irrigation scheduling criteria, the C and RDI irrigation volumes should coincide
    in the preharvest stage but, as a result of a breakdown, the RDI treatment received
    37 mm less. However, the most significant reduction was in A, as the soil sensor
    feedback allowed adaptation of the irrigation doses to the available soil water
    content. Although in this study irrigation was initiated on the same date in all
    three treatments, a proposed improvement to the system would be to use the data
    from the sensors to determine automatically the start of the irrigation campaign.
    In the postharvest period, the RDI treatment received less water than the A treatment,
    though the difference was less in the second year as a result of the adjustments
    made after the first year. This water saving may also be due to the fact that
    the algorithm of Casadesús et al. [3] suggests that use of the water balance model
    allows a rapid response to changes that occur, while at the same time the feedback
    mechanism can adapt the amount of water to the requirements of each plot. The
    level of precision of the feedback mechanism is very important, and the soil water
    content sensors provide the precision that is required. Osroosh et al. [11] obtained
    similar results in water savings with respect to the control treatment. 3.3. Tree
    Water Status Figure 6 shows Ψstem values in 2016 (Figure 6a) and 2017 (Figure
    6b). It can be seen that Ψstem decreased as the irrigation campaign progressed,
    even in the C treatment, though the decrease was more pronounced in the deficit
    treatments in the postharvest period. In 2016 (Figure 6a), Ψstem for the C treatment
    fell from an initial value of −0.60 MPa to a final value of −0.91 MPa. With respect
    to the RDI and A treatments, Ψstem fell from initial values of −0.57 MPa and −0.59
    MPa, respectively, to minimum values of −1.27 MPa and −1.39 MPa, respectively,
    before recovering slightly before leaf fall. The A treatment had a better water
    status than the RDI treatment from the start of the campaign to day 208 (27 July
    2016), the two treatments were similar from day 208 to day 252 (09 September 2016),
    and finally treatment A had a lower water status than the RDI treatment until
    the end of the campaign. If we consider the recommendations of Samperio et al.
    [21] for a late-maturing Japanese plum crop (Prunus salicina Lindl. cv. Angeleno),
    Ψstem should be above –0.7 MPa in stage I, –0.8 MPa in stage II, and −1.1 MPa
    during stage III and in the postharvest period. In our study, the Ψstem values
    were above −0.7 MPa in the preharvest period in the RDI and A treatments. In the
    postharvest period, the Ψstem values in the A and RDI treatments were above −1.3
    MPa, supporting more severe stress levels but with no resulting loss in yield.
    Figure 6. Seasonal variations in midday stem water potential (Ψstem) of ‘Red Beaut’
    plum trees in response to different irrigation treatments during (a) 2016 and
    (b) 2017. Each value is the mean of 32 measurements ± standard error. Pre is the
    period from fruit set to harvest of the current year. Post is the period from
    harvest to the onset of leaf fall of the current year. The vertical dashed line
    indicates the moment of harvest. The horizontal dashed line indicates the threshold
    established for each crop phase. * Indicates significant differences according
    to Duncan’s multiple range test (p = 0.05). C is the control treatment and A is
    the automatic treatment. In 2017 (Figure 6b), Ψstem for the C treatment decreased
    from an initial value of −0.63 MPa to a final value of −1.05 MPa. In the RDI and
    A treatments, the initial value was −0.65 MPa and the final value −1.05 MPa. The
    minimum Ψstem values were −1.31 MPa and −1.47 MPa for the RDI and A treatments,
    respectively. In the preharvest period, significant differences can be seen between
    the C and RDI treatments, which may be due to the difference between the two treatments
    in applied water volume as a problem which occurred in the irrigation system of
    the RDI treatment. Differences are also observed between the C and A treatments
    in the preharvest period, with this worse water status possibly due to the brief
    reaction time in the readjustment process of the system despite the application
    of an appreciably lower water volume. The Ψstem range for treatment C (−0.65 MPa
    at the start of the campaign, −0.75 MPa before the harvest, and −1.10 MPa at the
    end of the campaign) is similar to the values published for well-irrigated peach
    [36], European plum [37], and Japanese plum [20,38,39]. 3.4. Vegetative and Reproductive
    Growth Table 3 shows the wood pruning results and trunk cross-sectional area increase
    for the different treatments. It can be seen that the results of winter pruning
    vary between years and type of pruned wood. The treatments which were subjected
    to water stress (RDI and A) have a significantly lower total pruned wood weight
    than the C treatment. With respect to new wood, there were significant differences
    between treatment C and the other treatments in both years. In 2016, and with
    respect to old wood, treatment A was the only one with significant differences
    to the other treatments. In 2017, there were no significant differences between
    treatments. As for summer pruning, less wood was removed in the RDI treatment
    than in the other treatments. Total pruned wood, considering all interventions
    and types of wood, was lower in the deficit treatments, with the lowest values
    found in the RDI treatment. It is notable that the A treatment summer pruning
    was similar to that of the C treatment even in the second year when less water
    was applied. Summer pruning could be related to tree water status (mainly after
    sprouting) and the reserves that the tree has of the previous year. A treatment
    had better water status during the preharvest of 2016 and similar Ψstem in 2017.
    Both aspects can explain the higher vegetative growing of A during the spring
    and early summer. Table 3. Effects of irrigation on annual winter pruning of new
    wood, winter pruning of old wood, summer pruning, total pruning, and increase
    in trunk cross-sectional area (ΔTCSA) for the two years of the study. Deficit
    irrigation decreased tree vigor (ΔTCSA) compared to the C treatment in both years.
    There was no difference between the impact of manual and automated application
    of irrigation on the ΔTCSA. The RDI strategies were initially proposed to control
    vigor in intensive peach orchards [40]. In this case, the efficacy of the system
    is verified, confirming the results of Samperio et al. [20] in this same variety.
    Treatment A had a similar effect to the RDI treatment in both years, despite the
    lower RDI postharvest Ψstem value in 2016 compared to the A treatment. According
    to Hsiao [41], vegetative growth is highly sensitive to slight stress levels,
    which explains the higher new wood production and ΔTCSA in 2017 which coincided
    with the year of higher fruit load. 3.5. Yield and Number of Fruit/Tree As can
    be seen in Table 4 the years 2016 and 2018 had remarkably higher yield than 2017.
    This alternation in the yield of more and less productive years is common in this
    cultivar and affected in a similar way to the three treatments. This natural trend
    in trees was accentuated in 2017 by adverse weather conditions for pollination.
    In 2016, there were no significant effects of irrigation on yield (Table 4). In
    2017 and 2018, the deficit treatments gave a higher yield than the C treatment.
    These differences were due to the higher number of fruits per tree in the RDI
    and A treatments, though the differences were only significant in 2017 between
    the C and A treatments. In 2018 although A showed some tendency towards higher
    productions, the differences with RDI did not become significant. The RDI strategy
    applied in this experiment and cultivation previously demonstrated, according
    to Samperio et al., that it tends to increase the number of fruits per tree and
    therefore the tree yield [20]. In 2016, the yield results only allowed an evaluation
    of the capacity of the A treatment to maintain a non-detrimental preharvest water
    status. Given that this was a year with high rainfall, the preharvest effect of
    the treatments was slight. These yield results were as expected when considering
    that this strategy was the fruit of five years of testing RDI strategies on this
    cultivar [20]. Other authors, including Johnson et al. [38], obtained similar
    results in early-maturing plum and peach [40], where in both cases of early-maturing
    cultivars no significant differences in yield were obtained in the four years
    of the study. Naor et al. [42] reported that the risk with these strategies lies
    in the impact on the following campaign, which in our study was not seen in either
    2017 or 2018. A second risk, described by Intrigliolo et al. [43] and Marsal et
    al. [44], is the accumulative effect that takes place when applying RDI strategies
    in several consecutive years. Intrigliolo et al. [43] detected a loss in yield
    in Japanese plum subjected to RDI strategies over a seven-year period, and Marsal.
    [44] found losses in fruit size compared to a control treatment after applying
    RDI for three consecutive years. In this respect, avoiding stress levels is a
    positive contribution, with the A treatment showing a greater ability to avoid
    severe stress levels than the RDI treatment in the second year of the study. Table
    4. Effects of irrigation on annual yield and number of fruits per tree in 2016,
    2017, and 2018. 4. Conclusions In this study, testing was undertaken using an
    IRRIX web platform-supported automated irrigation system. The system was evaluated
    for a Japanese plum crop, using a previously adapted and tested deficit irrigation
    strategy. The system was able to execute the pre-established irrigation schedule
    without human intervention. The information captured and logged by the system
    in the first crop season enabled adjustments for the second crop season, demonstrating
    the auto-learning capacity of the system. The automated system was able to establish
    an RDI strategy that avoided water stress during the more sensitive stages of
    the cultivar and induced moderate-to-severe stress in the less sensitive stages.
    The amount of manually (RDI treatment) and automatically (A treatment) applied
    irrigation water was similar, but not its distribution as the automated system
    adjusted dose amounts in accordance with the information it received from the
    soil moisture sensors. The yield and vigor control results obtained with the automated
    system were similar to those obtained by an expert in the field. Despite the good
    results obtained in this study, some aspects of the system can be further improved,
    including the automatic assessment of the representativeness of the soil moisture
    sensors and the integration of a sensor that automatically characterizes the water
    stress of the plant. Author Contributions S.M. (≈40%): literature review; planning

  description: 'Groundwater management in irrigation areas requires a comprehensive
    understanding of the interactions between agricultural management practices and
    the underlying groundwater resource. Unsaturated zone modelling can be used to
    predict rates of water and solute movement through the soil profile. By incorporating
    expert knowledge and measured data, it is possible to investigate the relative
    influence of management vs environmental factors on water and solute movement.
    The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) has been applied to simulate
    the impacts of both environmental factors and agricultural management factors
    on deep drainage and nitrate leaching in the Lower Burdekin, North Queensland,
    Australia. Based on the results of this modelling, predicted annual average deep
    drainage rates were found to be controlled primarily by soil properties, irrigation
    scheduling, and, to a lesser extent, annual rainfall. The key factors which were
    found to control nitrate leaching were: irrigation water quality, fertilizer application
    rates, soil type, crop management, and irrigation scheduling. However, increases
    in the concentrations of nitrate in irrigation water resulted in a 64-fold increase
    in predicted nitrate-leaching rates, compared with a 22-fold increase in predicted
    nitrate-leaching rates associated with increased fertilizer application rates.
    As significant quantities of nitrate are predicted to be leached below the root
    zone, the immediate priority should be to increase monitoring of groundwater quality
    with a focus on quantifying the transport of nutrients to sensitive receptors.'

    can be used to predict rates of water and solute movement through the soil profile.
    By incorporating expert knowledge and measured data, it is possible to investigate
    the relative influence of management vs environmental factors on water and solute
    movement. The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) has been applied
    to simulate the impacts of both environmental factors and agricultural management
    factors on deep drainage and nitrate leaching in the Lower Burdekin, North Queensland,
    Australia. Based on the results of this modelling, predicted annual average deep
    drainage rates were found to be controlled primarily by soil properties, irrigation
    scheduling, and, to a lesser extent, annual rainfall. The key factors which were
    found to control nitrate leaching were: irrigation water quality, fertilizer application
    rates, soil type, crop management, and irrigation scheduling. However, increases
    in the concentrations of nitrate in irrigation water resulted in a 64-fold increase
    in predicted nitrate-leaching rates, compared with a 22-fold increase in predicted
    nitrate-leaching rates associated with increased fertilizer application rates.
    As significant quantities of nitrate are predicted to be leached below the root
    zone, the immediate priority should be to increase monitoring of groundwater quality
    with a focus on quantifying the transport of nutrients to sensitive receptors.

    Management of groundwater in agricultural settings is challenging due to the complex
    interactions between groundwater systems and agricultural management practices.
    The challenges that are being faced internationally in these settings include
    rising water tables, due to high rates of water draining below the root zone,
    and deteriorating groundwater quality (Khan et al. 2006; Wichelns and Oster 2006).
    Developing appropriate management strategies, therefore, requires an accurate
    assessment of the impacts of agriculture on both groundwater levels and groundwater
    quality (Bohlke 2002; Wichelns and Oster 2006). Deteriorating groundwater quality
    beneath irrigation areas can include increases in salinity (Khan et al. 2006;
    Schoups et al. 2006), increases in nitrate concentrations (Spalding and Exner
    1993), and increases in pesticide concentrations (Köck-Schulmeyer et al. 2014).
    The consequences of deteriorating groundwater quality can include negative impacts
    on crop growth due to root zone salinization (Schoups et al. 2006) and/or negative
    impacts on sensitive environmental receptors (Slomp and Van Cappellen 2004). While
    monitoring is critical for assessing the occurrence of impacts on groundwater,
    including rising groundwater levels and deteriorating groundwater quality, monitoring
    is often combined with modelling approaches as a means of enhancing the environmental
    management outcomes (Parker et al. 2002). The modelling component of an integrated
    environmental assessment in an agricultural setting is essential for investigating
    the impacts of different agricultural management practices and making predictions
    about future impacts on groundwater under a range of agricultural management scenarios.
    One clear advantage of modelling approaches for improving environmental management
    is the flexibility to deal with a variety of environmental policy questions (van
    Ittersum et al. 2008). For predictions of the impacts of agriculture on groundwater
    at a regional scale, regional scale modelling is required. Some of the challenges
    associated with regional scale modelling include difficulties in parameterising
    models due to data gaps at the regional scale and difficulties in validating predictions
    (Nobre et al. 2007). In addition, for regional scale modelling of both water flow
    and solute transport, it is often difficult to capture the complexity of relevant
    natural and anthropogenic processes (Felisa et al. 2015). One approach that has
    been used previously to predict solute leaching to groundwater at a regional scale
    is the GIS based “groundwater vulnerability” approach using models such as DRASTIC
    (Nobre et al. 2007). Using this type of approach, the influence of environmental
    factors such as soil properties, topography, and depth to groundwater is considered.
    The major drawbacks of this approach are simplifications in the representation
    of the factors controlling solute leaching and the application of user-defined
    weightings which have a strong influence on predictions. In an assessment of the
    vulnerability of an aquifer in central Japan, DRASTIC modelling lead to the finding
    that land use was a key factor in predicting nitrate-leaching rates (Babiker et
    al. 2005). Where agriculture is the primary land use in a region, nitrate is often
    the primary focus and agricultural management practices have been found previously
    to be strong predictors of nitrate leaching (Di and Cameron 2002; Peralta and
    Stöckle 2001). Some modelling approaches have recognised the importance of land
    use practices, but have chosen to make simplifications to the modelling approach
    by applying constant rates of irrigation and fertilizer application for each crop
    type (Almasri and Kaluarachchi 2007). However, incorporation of complexities in
    environmental factors, including variability in soil properties, and agricultural
    management practices, including fertilizer application rates, in predicting the
    spatial variability in inputs across a region provides more meaningful model outputs.
    There are very few examples in the literature of applying complex agricultural
    systems models to simulating nitrate leaching to groundwater at the regional scale.
    For simulations at a regional scale, simplifications are often made either for
    the environmental factors (for example, the soil properties) (Carroll et al. 2012),
    or for the management factors (for example, fertilizer application rates) (Peralta
    and Stöckle 2001). However, in Denmark, where agriculture dominates many catchments,
    an empirical model was used to predict N leaching at the catchment scale based
    on N applications, crop histories, and soil types using detailed farm and field
    scale data from the Danish national agricultural databases (Hashemi et al. 2018).
    The predictions from this empirical modelling have been combined with information
    about groundwater and surface water nitrogen reduction potential to devise recommendations
    for targeted mitigation measures and proposed changes to agricultural management
    (Hashemi et al. 2018). This highlights the potential for incorporating complexity
    into simulation of nitrogen leaching and using the model outputs to inform management
    strategies. In the catchments that drain into the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon
    in Australia, nitrogen leaching beneath agricultural land is also of particular
    concern (Thorburn et al. 2013). An approach that has been used previously to simulate
    nitrate leaching at the paddock scale in these agricultural areas involves the
    application of the Agricultural Production Simulation Model (APSIM). This model
    has been validated extensively at the paddock scale including specific development
    for sugarcane simulations (Meier and Thorburn 2017; Stewart et al. 2006; Thorburn
    et al. 2011). In the Lower Burdekin Irrigation Area, which is adjacent to the
    GBR, there are concerns about rising water tables (Petharam et al. 2008) and deterioration
    of groundwater quality (Thayalakumaran et al. 2008) below intensively irrigated
    land. In this irrigation area, where sugarcane is the primary crop, there is substantial
    variation in the environmental factors, including soil types, and agricultural
    management factors, including irrigation management strategies. This area, therefore,
    provides a good case study area for investigating the influence of these factors
    on regional scale deep drainage and nitrate. In this study, the APSIM model, which
    has previously been tested for simulating nitrate dynamics under irrigated sugarcane
    at the paddock scale, was applied at a regional scale to assess the relative importance
    of natural environmental factors vs agricultural management factors in controlling
    deep drainage and nitrate leaching. This paper describes the key outcomes of this
    modelling which have included: a better understanding of the factors controlling
    deep drainage and nitrate leaching, the prediction of “nitrate-leaching hotspots”,
    and specific recommendations for strategies for reducing nitrate leaching. Finally,
    the limitations of the modelling approach are discussed and the challenges for
    ongoing research in the area are highlighted. Materials and methods The field
    site for this modelling study was the Lower Burdekin irrigation area in North
    Queensland, Australia (Fig. 1). The Lower Burdekin floodplains comprise Quaternary
    sequences of alluvial and deltaic sediments that have formed progressively by
    the combined accumulation of river sediment and the coastal deposition of marine
    sediment. The sediments comprise a combination of layered gravel, sand, silt,
    clay, and mud deposited throughout the formation of the delta by the actions of
    fluvial, tidal, and wave processes. The stratigraphic sequences are typically
    indicative of deltaic systems (Fielding et al. 2005) and more specifically as
    a fan delta system (Clark 2004). Fig. 1 Map showing the land use and management
    areas within the Lower Burdekin and location of the Lower Burdekin in Queensland,
    Australia Full size image The major water course in the Lower Burdekin is the
    Burdekin River. The Burdekin River drains an area of 129,500 km2 and has the largest
    mean annual runoff of any river on the east coast of Queensland, but experiences
    extreme variability that is both highly seasonal and erratic (Fielding et al.
    1996). The depth to groundwater throughout most of the Lower Burdekin is less
    than 5 m. The climate of the Lower Burdekin is characterised by a short summer
    wet season with heavy rainfall, a long winter dry season and moderate-to-high
    temperatures (Hubble and Thompson 1953). Mean annual rainfall in the Lower Burdekin
    ranges from 800 to 1150 mm. Mean annual evaporation rates exceed 2000 mm. The
    high incidence of summer rainfall in the Lower Burdekin coupled with high evaporation
    rates results in irrigation being necessary for year-round crop production. Sugarcane
    is the dominant crop grown in the Lower Burdekin and irrigation of sugarcane in
    the region occurs mostly via furrow irrigation (Qureshi et al. 2002). Fertilizer
    is typically applied, in the form of urea, to both the plant crop and the ratoon
    crops. In the Lower Burdekin, two vastly different approaches to groundwater management
    are being practiced within an irrigated area of 80,000 ha. In the western portion
    of the Lower Burdekin, in the “Burdekin Haughton Water Supply Scheme” (BHWSS),
    heavy clay soils which are often sodic predominate, conjunctive use is practiced
    and rising groundwater levels are an issue (Petharam et al. 2008). This differs
    significantly from the eastern area, the “Burdekin Delta”, the soils are typically
    sand rich, groundwater is used extensively for irrigation, and the risk of seawater
    intrusion needs to be managed (Petharam et al. 2008). An artificial recharge scheme,
    which has been operational since 1965, is used to help protect against seawater
    intrusion. This scheme consists of a system of recharge pits, diversion channels
    and creeks. In addition to the artificial recharge scheme, the practice of “water
    recycling”, whereby excess irrigation is applied to continue recharging the aquifer,
    is also used to help protect against seawater intrusion. Soils In the BHWSS, four
    broad soil groups have been defined and mapped at 1:25,000 scale, based on similar
    properties and management requirements (Donnollan 1991). The soil groups devised
    were cracking clays, sodic duplex soils, non-sodic duplex soils and gradational
    and uniform non-cracking soils. Out of these four soil groups, the dominant soils
    in the BHWSS are cracking clays and duplex soils, occupying approximately three
    quarters of the Lower Burdekin area. Cracking clays are soils which contain more
    than 35% clay throughout the profile and crack when dry and swell when wet. The
    texture of the topsoil typically ranges from light to medium clay and the texture
    of the subsoil ranges from medium to heavy clay. In the BHWSS, the clay fraction
    of these soils contains mainly kaolinite, minor amounts of illite or mica and
    smectite, and trace amounts of chlorite (Reading et al. 2012). Duplex soils are
    soils which have a distinct change in texture from the topsoil to the subsoil.
    Sodic soils have exchangeable sodium percentages (ESPs) greater than 6 in some
    part of the profile, based on the Australian definition (Northcote and Skene 1972)
    or greater than 15 based on the American definition (USDA 1954). The most detailed
    soils survey for the Burdekin Delta was conducted at a medium intensity (1:50,000)
    scale in 2000 to provide information for groundwater model development and irrigation
    practice guidelines. The dominant soils in the Delta were described as having
    a uniform texture profile, with the texture ranging from fine (clay) to coarse
    (sand). Outside of the irrigation areas, only broad-scale mapping from the ASRIS
    soils coverage database (http://www.asris.csiro.au) is available. The different
    scales of available soil maps were combined to create a soil map for the whole
    Lower Burdekin. To do this, soils were grouped based on the texture profiles,
    e.g., uniform, duplex, or gradational for a range of textures (fine, medium, and
    coarse). This enabled a consistent classification across the Lower Burdekin incorporating
    the soil types identified in previous soil surveys (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Map showing
    soil types in the Lower Burdekin Full size image Available soil data for particle
    size analysis, 1500 kPa soil moisture content and chemical properties was then
    collated for each of the soil groups in the Lower Burdekin (Table 1). These data
    were primarily sourced from the Queensland Government’s Soil and Land Information
    (SALI) database; however, additional soil sampling and analysis was also carried
    out to fill gaps in this dataset. These additional analyses were predominantly
    particle size analyses, using the hydrometer method (Thorburn and Shaw 1987) and
    1500 kPa water retention measurements (McIntyre 1974). Table 1 Measured soil properties
    averaged for each soil type Full size table Modelling approach To help address
    challenges associated with groundwater management in the Lower Burdekin and potential
    fluxes from groundwater to the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), a suite of models were
    developed, “the modelling tookit”. This toolkit included: unsaturated zone models,
    a regional groundwater flow model and a regional groundwater solute transport
    model. The unsaturated zone models that were considered to be potentially suitable
    were HYDRUS (Simunek et al. 2008), SWAP (Kroes et al. 2008), and APSIM (Holzworth
    et al. 2014; Keating et al. 2003). While all three of these models is capable
    of simulating water flow, solute transport, and transpiration, only APSIM allows
    dynamic representation of both crop growth and soil processes and is capable of
    simulating conditional management rules which can be adapted to specific local
    agricultural management practices (Holzworth et al. 2014). For these reasons,
    APSIM version 7.1 was selected for unsaturated zone modelling in the Lower Burdekin.
    APSIM was developed by the Agricultural Productions Systems Research Unit (APSRU),
    a collaborative group made up from CSIRO and Queensland State Government agencies
    (Holzworth et al. 2014). APSIM contains modules for simulating specific crops,
    including sugarcane. This is a significant advantage for the Lower Burdekin modelling
    toolkit, as sugarcane crops are prevalent in the Lower Burdekin. The capability
    to simulate sugarcane management practices, sugarcane growth, sugarcane water
    uptake, and sugarcane solute uptake is likely to improve predictions of deep drainage
    and solute transport beneath irrigated sugarcane. APSIM models including the sugarcane
    module have previously been developed for the Lower Burdekin (Stewart et al. 2006;
    Thorburn et al. 2011). These previous models were developed for a small number
    of individual sites rather than attempting to model deep drainage and nitrate
    leaching at a regional scale. The SoilWat module in APSIM is a cascading water
    balance model. In the SoilWat module, the water balance is calculated on a daily
    scale by simulating the following processes sequentially: runoff, saturated water
    flow, movement of solutes associated with saturated flow, soil evaporation, unsaturated
    water flow, movement of solutes associated with unsaturated flow, plant transpiration.
    Runoff from rainfall is calculated using the USDA-Soil Conservation Service curve
    number technique (Mockus 1972). Runoff response curves are used to represent the
    percentage of rainfall that becomes runoff, i.e., 0–100%. Runoff from irrigation
    was approximated using the “irrigation efficiency” parameter. Using this parameter,
    the maximum percentage of irrigation water that can become runoff was set at 30%.
    Soil evaporation is assumed to take place in two stages. In the first stage, the
    evaporation rate is at least equal to the potential evaporation rate. In the second
    stage, the soil water content has decreased below a threshold value and the rate
    of the supply from the soil is less than potential evaporation. The soil N module
    is used to simulate mineralisation of N, N supply to the crop from the soil and
    plant residues, and N leaching (Keating et al. 2003). In this module, soil C and
    N are subdivided into inert, humic, fresh organic matter and microbial biomass
    pools that have constant C:N ratios (Meier and Thorburn 2017). C flows between
    the pools is determined by fixed turnover rates for each pool with the corresponding
    flows of N between pools determined by the C:N ratio of the receiving pool (Meier
    and Thorburn 2017). Any release of N during the decomposition processes results
    in an increase in ammonium–N (Keating et al. 2003). Other processes that are dealt
    with in the Soil N module are nitrification, denitrification, and urea hydrolysis
    (Keating et al. 2003). Denitrification is calculated as a function of nitrate
    concentration, active carbon concentration, soil moisture, and soil temperature
    (Thorburn et al. 2010). To present the deep drainage and nitrate-leaching results
    from APSIM using maps and to assign the results to specific grid cells for inputs
    into a regional groundwater model, hydrologic response units (HRUs) were used.
    HRUs represent a unique combination of soil type (Fig. 2), crop type and rainfall
    zone (Fig. 2). The rainfall zones were created using rainfall isohyets from the
    Bureau of Meteorology and the crop type was assigned using available land use
    maps. Modelling parameters Soil parameters were determined for each of the eight
    soil types. Where measured data were available, these data were used for APSIM
    inputs (Table 1). In the absence of measured data, APSIM inputs were estimated
    based on expert recommendations and literature review (Tables 2, 3, 4, 5). The
    methods used to estimate the soil parameters are summarised in Table 2. Table
    2 Estimated APSIM input parameters Full size table Table 3 APSIM irrigation parameters
    Full size table Table 4 APSIM irrigation delays Full size table Table 5 Fertilizer
    application rates and ratoon management Full size table To derive the soil hydraulic
    parameters, two different pedotransfer functions were used. PAWCER (Littleboy
    1997) has been applied extensively in Australia and is suitable for estimating
    the “drained upper limit” and the “lower limit” based on soil texture and 1500
    kPa moisture content. However, PAWCER cannot be used to estimate Ksat so ROSETTA
    (Schaap et al. 2001) was used to estimate Ksat. Workshops were conducted to obtain
    expert information from local farmers and agronomists about local management practices.
    Information was obtained from these workshops on the following parameters: irrigation
    volume, irrigation frequency, fertilizer application rate, and sugarcane planting
    and harvesting dates. The irrigation volumes simulated were within the typical
    range expected for the Delta of 1000–3500 mm/crop (Charlesworth et al. 2002).
    The irrigation volumes simulated in the BHWSS were much lower, between 700 and
    1700 mm per crop for the dominant soils. These rates are similar to those reported
    previously in the BHWSS (Thorburn et al. 2011). To allow for a significant “model
    warm up” period, 120 year simulations were run to reduce initialisation bias.
    The simulation period was from 1889 to 2009. All of the simulations were run in
    continuous mode. Annual averages for the predicted deep drainage and nitrate-leaching
    rates were calculated for the period from 1901 to 2008. Management practices are
    known to have changed significantly during the simulation period, and the sugarcane
    management modules were modified to include time-varying management practices.
    In APSIM, the variations in management practices over time were represented by
    step changes in irrigation management, fertilizer application rates, and ratoon
    management (Tables 3, 4, 5). Fertilizer application rates and ratoon management
    were simulated as time variant inputs based on information provided by local stakeholders
    during workshops. The number of ratoon crops is simulated to gradually increase
    from one ratoon crop prior to 1950 to four ratoon crops post 1990. Fertilizer
    application rates to the ratoon crops are simulated to increase in 1970, based
    on information provided in stakeholder workshops. For the period from 1990 onwards,
    three different fertilizer rates were simulated, 200 t/ha, 250 t/ha, and 300 t/ha.
    These rates are comparable to those reported by Thorburn et al. (2011), where
    the fertilizer rates ranged from 219–227 t/ha for the ratoon crops in the Delta
    and 220–247 t/ha for the ratoon crops in the BHWSS. The proportion of paddocks
    for each of the three fertilizer rates was estimated based on information provided
    at the workshops and this information was used for creating weighted averages
    for nitrate leaching. In between the harvest of the final ratoon crop and the
    planting of the next sugarcane crop, a bare fallow period was simulated. While
    this does not represent all possible ratoon management practices, bare fallows
    represent common practice in the region (Thorburn et al. 2017). Similarly, the
    simulations all included burning of crop residues, as this is still common practice
    in the Lower Burdekin. Irrigation was simulated using sets of irrigation management
    rules. The irrigation management rules were developed to simulate the influence
    of: location (Delta or BHWSS), soil type, crop management, and rainfall on irrigation
    rates. The management rules selected included: a minimum of 7 days between irrigations
    and irrigation delays when there has been more than 30 mm of rainfall within the
    previous 3 days. The irrigation water quality parameters were based primarily
    on historical chloride and nitrate concentrations (Fig. 3) from the Queensland
    Government’s Groundwater Database. This was combined with information about the
    irrigation water source, i.e., groundwater, surface water, or conjunctive use,
    in different management areas. Fig. 3 Map of groundwater nitrate concentrations
    (1995–2005) Full size image Sodic soils are prevalent in the Lower Burdekin (Day
    et al. 1992; Ham et al. 1997). Soil sodicity is known to contribute to adverse
    soil properties including reduced permeability, water logging, poor infiltration,
    and deep drainage (Nelson and Ham 2001; Reading et al. 2010). Gypsum has been
    applied widely to improve the properties of sodic soils in the irrigated areas
    of the Lower Burdekin (Ham et al. 1997). Experiments on sodic clays from the Lower
    Burdekin have demonstrated that the saturated hydraulic conductivity can be increased
    significantly when gypsum is applied (Reading et al. 2012). Although a number
    of the management parameters including plant date, irrigation volumes, irrigation
    water quality, and fertilizer application rates are expected to vary spatially,
    the spatial distribution of these parameters was unknown. To account for the influence
    of these parameters on deep drainage and nitrate leaching, weighted averages were
    calculated for each combination of soil type, management area (BHWSS or Delta),
    and climate zone using the results for each management option (Fig. 4). The weighted
    averages were calculated based on the proportion of paddocks in each management
    area expected to implement particular agricultural management strategies (including
    planting dates and fertilizer application rates). These weighted averages were
    then used to produce inputs for a regional scale groundwater model. Fig. 4 Flowchart
    showing APSIM modelling scenarios Full size image The APSIM modelling results
    were subjected to a number of verification tests. These included comparisons with
    available field data such as measured water balance components (Stewart et al.
    2006; Thorburn et al. 2011) and historical sugarcane yield data which were sourced
    from annual sugarcane industry reports. In addition, sensitivity testing was used
    to identify the key input parameters that were controlling the APSIM modelling
    results. The primary focus for the sensitivity testing was to explore the influence
    of the soil parameters on deep drainage (DD) rates, using the APSIM model runs
    that were producing the highest DD rates (soil 2—gradational soil, rainfall station
    33069). To take into account the effects of sodicity on hydraulic conductivity,
    a range of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) values were used in APSIM for
    “cracking clay” and “sodic duplex” soil types (these soil types exhibited high
    sodicity levels prior to irrigation development). Based on the results of experiments
    by Reading et al. (2012), the Ksat values predicted by Rosetta (Schaap et al.
    2001), a pedotransfer function for estimating unsaturated hydraulic properties
    from surrogate soil data, for “cracking clay” and “sodic duplex” soil types were
    determined to be applicable for treated soils, i.e., where soil sodicity had been
    reduced and Ksat had been increased due to gypsum applications. To account for
    the full range of Ksat expected (due to reductions in sodicity levels over time
    with gypsum treatments), a range of Ksat were derived using the Ksat from Rosetta
    as the maximum Ksat. Due to the large number of parameters’ combinations for this
    regional modelling project (Fig. 4), more than 40,000 APSIM model cases were run
    in total. While the weighted results are useful for exploring the spatial variability
    in the results, using the individual results extracted from for the full set of
    model cases, it is possible to explore the influence of many different parameter
    combinations on the predicted deep drainage and nitrate-leaching rates. Results
    and discussion In this section, the weighted average APSIM model results for deep
    drainage and nitrate leaching are presented and discussed first, before the influence
    of individual management factors is described. Predicted deep drainage Predicted
    deep drainage rates were found to be controlled by soil type, rainfall volumes,
    and management practices. All of these factors vary geographically within the
    Lower Burdekin. In particular, there are significant differences in management
    practices between the Delta and the BHWSS. Influence of soil type For some soil
    types, for example, soils 2 and 3 (gradational and non-sodic duplex soils) predicted
    annual average deep drainage rates was very similar, within approximately 10%,
    for both the Delta and the BHWSS (Fig. 5). However, for other soils such as soils
    5 and 7, deep drainage rates were 2.7 times to 2.9 times higher for the Delta
    than for the BHWSS (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Predicted annual average deep drainage for
    the Lower Burdekin (1901–2008) Full size image In the Delta, the predicted deep
    drainage rates were relatively high for all soil types (Fig. 5), with the exception
    of soil 1 (cracking clay) which was higher for the BHWSS than for the Delta. The
    highest deep drainage rates (> 2000 mm/year) were predicted for soil 5 (uniform
    coarse) and the lowest deep drainage rates (< 1000 mm/year) were predicted for
    soil 1 (cracking clay). However, soil 5 (uniform coarse) and soil 1 (cracking
    clay) cover only 6% and 21% of the area of the Delta, respectively (Fig. 2). For
    the soils that are dominant in the Delta (soils 6 and 7—uniform fine and uniform
    medium), the predicted deep drainage rates were 1200–1500 mm/year (Figs. 5, 6).
    Fig. 6 Map showing predicted annual average deep drainage (1901–2008) Full size
    image In the BHWSS, the highest predicted deep drainage rates (1860–2100 mm/year)
    were for soils 2 and 3 (Fig. 5). These soils each cover only 3% of the BHWSS (Fig.
    2). For the dominant soils in the BHWSS (soils 1 and 4—cracking clay and sodic
    duplex), which cover 33% and 41% of the BHWSS, respectively, the predicted deep
    drainage rates were less than 1000 mm/year (Fig. 5). During the preliminary stages
    of APSIM modelling for the Lower Burdekin modelling toolkit, comparisons were
    made with the APSIM modelling results from the previous APSIM modelling in the
    Lower Burdekin (Stewart et al. 2006; Thorburn et al. 2011). For the same soil
    type simulated, each component of the water balance was compared with the previous
    APSIM modelling results. From these comparisons, it was determined that for the
    same soil types, the estimated water balance components were similar. For example,
    for the clay soil simulated at the Mulgrave site, the irrigation, runoff, and
    deep drainage were 1104, 542, and 368 mm, respectively, in 2007 in the Thorburn
    et al (2011)’s study. In our simulations, these water balance components were
    1250, 634, and 579 mm, respectively, for the same soil type, climate zone, and
    year. The slightly lower deep drainage rates predicted in the previous paddock
    scale APSIM simulations, compared with our simulations, were attributed to the
    higher efficiency in the irrigation practices simulated for selected sites in
    Thorburn et al. (2011) studies. From the results of the sensitivity testing, it
    was determined that the soil properties which had the most influence on deep drainage
    were Ksat, drained upper limit (DUL), the amount of water that a particular soil
    holds after drainage has practically ceased (Gardner et al. 1984) and SWCON, a
    saturated water flow parameter that controls saturated water movement, (see Table
    1 for information on how these parameters were estimated). For the parameter ranges
    tested for these soil properties, increasing Ksat resulted in a 30-fold increase
    in deep drainage, whereas changing SWCON or DUL resulted in a fairly small change
    in DD of ± 25% (Fig. 7). The primary reason for the high degree of sensitivity
    of DD to Ksat is due to the large range of possible values for the Ksat parameter,
    and thus, the large parameter range tested for Ksat. The range of Ksat values
    tested was from 5 mm/day, representing a sodic clay soil exhibiting a tenfold
    “hydraulic conductivity reduction due to chemistry” (Reading et al. 2012) to 3000
    mm/day (for a uniform sandy soil), whereas the full possible range for SWCON is
    0–1, so this was the range tested in the sensitivity testing. For DUL, the range
    tested was from 0.037%v, the estimated lower limit for soil moisture for this
    soil type to 0.373%v, and the estimated saturated water content for this soil
    type. The large range of possible Ksat values emphasizes the high variability
    between soils in the Lower Burdekin and the importance of determining representative
    values of Ksat when predicting deep drainage (Reading et al. 2015). Fig. 7 Sensitivity
    testing results for annual average deep drainage (1901–2008) Full size image As
    expected, the predicted deep drainage rates decreased with decreases in Ksat.
    However, predicted deep drainage rates were not strongly controlled by reducing
    Ksat until Ksat was reduced by at least 50%. When Ksat is low enough to reduce
    flow from layer 1 to layer 2, the water available to drain deeper in the profile
    is also reduced. This drainage between layers in APSIM is controlled by both Ksat
    and “SWCON”. Sensitivity testing also indicated that there was a low level of
    sensitivity of deep drainage rates to Ksat when Ksat was above 0.2 m/day. Influence
    of rainfall Two “climate zones” were simulated in the Delta area, represented
    by rainfall stations 33001 and 33033. Between rainfall stations 33001 and 33033,
    there was a 14% decrease in average annual rainfall. The reduction in deep drainage
    in response to this decrease in rainfall ranged from 6 to 16% (Fig. 5). In the
    BHWSS, there was a more significant difference in average annual rainfall between
    the two rainfall stations selected for simulations. As a result, a 7–30% reduction
    in deep drainage occurred between rainfall zones 33069 and 33073 in response to
    a 24% reduction in rainfall. The influence of decreasing rainfall was found to
    be dependant on soil type (Fig. 5). Influence of management practices The primary
    management practices that are expected to influence deep drainage are irrigation
    scheduling and crop management practices (including planting date, harvest date,
    and the number of ratoons). Due to the irrigation scheduling rules implemented,
    irrigation volumes and timing are controlled by rainfall, soil type, and management
    practices. The differences in deep drainage between soils are, therefore, partly
    controlled by the different irrigation volumes applied to the different soils.
    The influence of rainfall on irrigation volumes can be investigated by studying
    the differences in irrigation for different climate zones. When two climate zones
    were compared (BHWSS 33073 and BHWSS 33069), there were found to be differences
    in annual irrigation volumes (33069 > 33073). The differences in irrigation volumes
    between these two climate zones are the result of the simulated irrigation delays
    that occur when there is rainfall of greater than 30 mm in 1 day. While there
    was actually more days with rainfall greater than 30 mm for climate zone 33069,
    many of these high rainfall days were sequential. In climate zone 33073, there
    was commonly sufficient spacing between high rainfall days to cause regular delays
    to irrigation applications and as a result, the total annual irrigation was lower
    for climate zone 33073 than for climate zone 33069. The influence of rainfall
    and irrigation on deep drainage rate was compared using regression coefficients.
    For the dominant soil in the Delta, soil 7 (Uniform Medium), for climate zone
    33001, annual average deep drainage rates were poorly correlated with annual average
    rainfall rates (R2 = 0.07), whereas annual average deep drainage rates were highly
    correlated with annual average irrigation rates (R2 = 0.66). When annual average
    irrigation was combined with annual average rainfall, the correlation with average
    annual deep drainage was even stronger (R2 = 0.72). However, the impact of irrigation
    management on deep drainage is very soil specific. For the dominant soil in the
    BHWSS, soil 1 (cracking clay), in climate zone 33073, neither rainfall (R2 = 0.16),
    irrigation (R2 = 0.01), nor irrigation plus rainfall (R2 = 0.15) account for the
    variations in deep drainage. This occurs, because deep drainage in this soil type
    is restricted due to the low value for the SWCON parameter for this soil. The
    effect of this parameter in restricting deep drainage overrides the influences
    of rainfall and irrigation volumes. While both soil type and average annual rainfall
    volumes can be seen to influence deep drainage in the Delta and BHWSS (Figs. 5,
    6), these factors do not explain the significant differences in average annual
    deep drainage between the Delta and the BHWSS. Average annual deep drainage results
    for the Delta were significantly higher (410–3733 mm/year) than the average annual
    deep drainage results for the BHWSS (354–2029 mm/year). These differences occur
    as a direct result of differences between simulated management practices between
    the Delta and the BHWSS. In particular, the much higher volumes of irrigation
    water simulated for the Delta, compared with the BHWSS, has lead to much higher
    rates of deep drainage predicted for the Delta. Temporal dynamics in deep drainage
    The inter-annual variability in deep drainage rates was highest for the soil type
    with the highest predicted deep drainage rate and the lowest for the soil type
    with the lowest predicted deep drainage rate. This trend was observed for both
    the BHWSS and the Delta. In the Delta, there was a sudden increase in DD in 1970
    (Fig. 8a) which is directly related to the increase in irrigation frequency which
    was simulated in 1970. This temporal trend in deep drainage provides further evidence
    that irrigation is more important than rainfall in controlling DD. Fig. 8 Annual
    average deep drainage time series for soil 1 in a the Delta and b the BHWSS Full
    size image In the BHWSS, the opposite trend was observed with DD generally decreasing
    with time for soil 1 (cracking clay) (Fig. 8b). In the BHWSS, there was no change
    in the simulated irrigation management over time. Instead, predicted deep drainage
    is controlled by time-varying parameters, such as the number of ratoons which
    increases over time in a stepwise manner. It is expected that increases in the
    number of ratoons would influence deep drainage in a number of ways. When the
    number of ratoons is increased, the period of continuous cropping is increased
    from approximately 1 year to up to 4 years. As a result, there are less frequent
    opportunities for rainfall induced deep drainage to occur during time periods
    when crops are not transpiring. Ratoons tend to be more prone to soil moisture
    stress than plant crops (Singh et al. 2007) so if an increase in the number of
    ratoons leads to a reduction in deep drainage, this means that the combination
    of the additional soil moisture stress in the ratoons without an increase in irrigation
    volumes (just an increase in frequency earlier in the crop cycle) leads to more
    efficient irrigation and, therefore, lower DD. Singh et al. (2007) also found
    that the deep drainage can be higher in plant cane than in ratoon cane. Predicted
    nitrate leaching Higher nitrate-leaching rates were predicted for the Delta than
    for the BHWSS. There was also substantial variation in predicted nitrate-leaching
    rates between soil types. Influence of soil properties The higher deep drainage
    rates for the Delta, compared with the BHWSS, contributed to predictions of higher
    nitrate-leaching loads in the Delta (55–335 kg/ha) compared with the BHWSS (4–70
    kg/ha) (Figs. 9, 10). The study by Thorburn et al (2011) also found considerably
    higher nitrate-leaching loads predicted for the Delta (68–241 kg/ha) compared
    with the BHWSS (2–27 kg/ha). Yet, the maximum nitrate-leaching loads predicted
    in this study are greater than the maximum predicted in the Thorburn et al. (2011)
    study. These higher maximum nitrate-leaching loads can be explained in part by
    the higher maximum fertilizer rates simulated. Fig. 9 Predicted annual nitrate-leaching
    rates for the Lower Burdekin (1901–2008) Full size image Fig. 10 Map showing predicted
    annual average nitrate-leaching rates (1901–2008) Full size image For the Delta,
    the highest nitrate-leaching load occurred for soil type 5 and the lowest occurred
    for soil type 1 (Fig. 9). This trend is consistent with the annual average deep
    drainage trends for the Delta, where the highest DD occurred for soil type 5 and
    the lowest occurred for soil type 1. In the BHWSS, nitrate-leaching rates were
    also highest (average of 70 kg/ha) for the soil with the highest deep drainage
    rate (soil 2—gradational) and the lowest average of 4 kg/ha for the soil with
    the lowest deep drainage rate soil 4 (sodic duplex soil). These overall trends
    are not surprising and they support the previous studies highlighting the occurrence
    of high nitrate-leaching rates accompanying the occurrence of high deep drainage
    rates, for example, (Kurtzman et al. 2013). For both the BHWSS and the Delta,
    the soils with the highest average nitrate-leaching rates exhibited the highest
    inter-annual variability in nitrate-leaching rates and the soils with the lowest
    nitrate-leaching rates exhibited the lowest inter-annual variability in nitrate-leaching
    rates. The correlation between DD and nitrate leaching varies significantly between
    soils and between the Delta and the BHWSS. These differences occur due to the
    varying degree of influence of irrigation water quality on nitrate-leaching rates.
    Influence of irrigation water quality The key factor that influences simulated
    nitrate-leaching rates in the Lower Burdekin is the concentration of nitrate in
    the irrigation water. The simulated nitrate–N concentrations in irrigation water
    for the Delta were 5–15 mg/L, whereas the simulated nitrate–N concentrations in
    the irrigation water for the BHWSS were 0–2 mg/L. Concentrations of nitrogen in
    irrigation water are generally lower in the BHWSS than in the Delta, because surface
    water is mostly used for irrigation in the BHWSS, whereas groundwater is mostly
    used for irrigation in the Delta. For this reason, soil 8 (tidal flat) was found
    to produce the second highest nitrate-leaching load out of all of the soil types,
    even though it resulted in the second lowest DD rate. This soil type only covers
    4% of the Burdekin Delta and is not normally irrigated, so it was only included
    in the modelling to provide complete spatial coverage. The irrigation management
    parameters applied for this soil were the same as those applied for a more common
    soil in the Delta irrigation area (uniform coarse). The high nitrate-leaching
    rates for soil 8 (tidal flat), therefore, occurred in response to high irrigation
    volumes with significant concentrations of nitrate in the irrigation water. This
    demonstrates the importance of irrigation water nitrate concentrations in controlling
    nitrate leaching in APSIM, even for low permeability soils. The strong influence
    of irrigation water quality in controlling nitrate leaching in the Delta has also
    resulted in strong correlations between deep drainage and nitrate leaching for
    the soils with higher simulated irrigation rates. Therefore, for soil 5 (uniform
    coarse), the correlation between deep drainage and nitrate leaching had R2 of
    0.76 and for soil 8 (tidal flat), this correlation had R2 of 0.8. Whereas for
    soils with lower irrigation application rates, the correlation between deep drainage
    and nitrate leaching was much lower, e.g., R2 = 0.23 for soil 7 (uniform medium).
    One of the possible reasons for the poor correlations between annual nitrate leaching
    and annual deep drainage for some soils relates to differences in the timing of
    deep drainage events and nitrate-leaching events (Fig. 11). Deep drainage can
    be high due to rainfall in the wet season even when sugarcane is not growing,
    but nitrate leaching is only high when large volumes of irrigation water containing
    nitrate are applied and/or fertilizer applications occur. Therefore, there is
    sometimes a difference in the timing between years with high DD rates and years
    with high nitrate-leaching rates. Fig. 11 Nitrate-leaching time series for soil
    1, in the BHWSS Full size image In the BHWSS, the correlation between nitrate
    leaching and DD was very low (R2 ≤ 0.1) for all soils. This indicates that in
    the BHWSS, fertilizer applications are a more important control on nitrate leaching
    than irrigation water quality, and therefore, there is a low correlation between
    deep drainage, which mostly occurs in response to irrigation, and nitrate leaching.
    An investigation of the relative importance of key management parameters in controlling
    nitrate-leaching rates has demonstrated that increasing the concentration of nitrate
    in the irrigation water from 0 to 5 mg/L, equivalent to an increase from 0 to
    750 kg/ha of nitrate for each irrigation application, has more influence on nitrate-leaching
    rates than increasing fertilizer application rates from 150 to 250 kg/ha (Fig.
    12). While increasing the concentration of nitrate in the irrigation water from
    0 to 5 mg/L resulted in an increase in nitrate leaching from 4 to 94 kg/ha, increasing
    fertilizer rates from 150 to 250 kg/ha with 0 mg/L nitrate in the irrigation water
    caused an increase nitrate leaching from 4 to 86 kg/ha. Fig. 12 Influence of key
    management factors on nitrate-leaching rates Full size image When fertilizer rates
    were kept at the lowest rate, 150 kg/ha, but nitrate in irrigation water increased
    further, to 10 and 15 mg/L, equivalent to 1500 kg/ha and 2250 kg/ha of nitrate
    for each irrigation application, nitrate leaching increased to 150 kg/ha and 254
    kg/ha, respectively. In addition, in cases, where nitrate concentrations in irrigation
    water is 15 mg/L, application of irrigation at higher rates, e.g., 250 ML/ha,
    equivalent to 3750 kg/ha of nitrate for each irrigation application is predicted
    to result in up to 470 kg/ha of nitrate leaching. Therefore, the combination of
    nitrate in irrigation water with fertilizer application dramatically increases
    nitrate leaching. Temporal dynamics in nitrate leaching As the occurrence of nitrate
    leaching is partially controlled by the occurrence of deep drainage, the timing
    of nitrate-leaching events is expected to be influenced by the timing of deep
    drainage. However, a nitrate-leaching event does not occur with every DD event,
    and sometimes, there were a few consecutive days of deep drainage before nitrate
    leaching started to occur. The differences in timing between the timing of deep
    drainage events and nitrate-leaching events occur because nitrate is not a conservative
    solute and because nitrate concentrations in the soil are influenced my multiple
    factors including fertilizer applications and crop uptake. In a previous study
    in North Queensland (Rasiah et al. 2005), the processes controlling nitrate concentrations
    in groundwater were hypothesized to be the same processes that control groundwater
    dynamics, i.e., rainfall, soil type, topography, and well depth. However, this
    would imply that nitrate is a conservative species that is directly transported
    with any water that passes through the unsaturated zone without being influenced
    by other processes such as nutrient uptake and nitrogen transformations. The relative
    timing of planting dates, irrigation delays after planting, and fertilizer delays
    after planting is important in controlling the timing of nitrate leaching. In
    the APSIM simulations, fertilizer is applied 20 days after planting, yet irrigation
    does not begin until 50 days after planting. As a result, there is a time lag
    between fertilizer application and nitrate leaching. For the dominant soils in
    the BHWSS and the Delta, similar short-term temporal trends were observed in the
    nitrate-leaching results. When a new crop is planted, nitrate leaching is typically
    very low. The period of low nitrate leaching around the time that a new crop is
    planted is due to a combination of nitrate uptake by plants and nitrate accumulation
    in the soil. Nitrate-leaching rates remain low for more than 1 month before increasing
    significantly (Fig. 11). The significant increase in nitrate leaching occurs less
    than 2 weeks after irrigation applications commence. The higher nitrate-leaching
    rates then persist for 2–6 months before the nitrate-leaching rates decrease again
    to < 0.1 kgN/ha. A similar trend was also observed in the nitrate-leaching results
    simulated by Stewart et al. (2006). In the BHWSS, the nitrate-leaching events
    occurred much less frequently. Nitrate leaching only occurred following commencement
    of irrigation for the plant crop and no nitrate leaching occurred for ratoon crops.
    This differed from the Delta, where nitrate leaching mostly occurred following
    commencement of irrigation for the plant crop, but lower amounts of nitrate leaching
    also occurred for ratoon crops. There are a number of processes that control the
    quantity of nitrate available for leaching, including crop uptake, mineralisation,
    immobilization, and denitrification. The accuracy of the predicted nitrate-leaching
    rates in this study would be affected by our ability to accurately simulate each
    of these processes at the regional scale. Field measurements of soil nitrogen
    dynamics and sugarcane nitrogen uptake in Ingham, Queensland, found that mean
    mineral N concentrations were equal to 54.4 kg/ha prior to planting, but increased
    to between 92 and 247 kg/ha in subsequent months due to fertilization and mineralisation
    (Muchow et al. 1996). This was followed by a period of reduction in mineral N
    concentrations (Muchow et al. 1996). Our simulations also showed this general
    trend, with an increase in mineral N concentrations occurring following planting
    and fertilization, followed by a period of reduction in mineral N concentrations.
    Immobilization reactions can be difficult to predict, as they are controlled by
    physical and chemical properties of both crop residues and specific soils (Jensen
    1994) in addition to microbiological factors. The immobilization and mineralisation
    reactions in APSIM are partly controlled by C:N ratios as this parameter influence
    N movement between pools. The parameter is also used in other soil nutrient models,
    e.g., NCSOIL (Hadas et al. 2004), for the simulation of carbon and nitrogen cycling.
    For the Lower Burdekin modelling, the C:N ratios were based on a limited number
    of carbon and nitrogen analyses. Therefore, this may affect the accuracy of our
    predicted immobilization and mineralisation rates. Denitrification rates in the
    Lower Burdekin have been found to be significantly higher than in other irrigation
    areas in North Queensland (Thorburn et al. 2010, 2011). In a previous APSIM modelling
    study in the Lower Burdekin (Thorburn et al. 2011), large amounts of nitrogen
    were predicted to be lost via denitrification. This differs significantly from
    the APSIM modelling results in this study, where less than 5% of the added N was
    lost via denitrification. This discrepancy suggests a potential overestimation
    of nitrate leaching in this study due to an underestimation of denitrification
    and indicates that additional field and laboratory measurements are required to
    quantify the range and spatial variability of denitrification rates in the Lower
    Burdekin. In terms of the long-term trends in nitrate leaching, the APSIM results
    show a shift in nitrate leaching from a fairly cyclical pattern to more continuous
    nitrate leaching. This is partly due to the simulated increase in the number of
    ratoon crops which leads to a reduction in the period of time without sugarcane
    crops, and therefore, a reduction in the period of time with no fertilizer being
    added. Annual nitrate-leaching rates were generally found to increase over time
    in the Delta. For example, for soil 7 (uniform medium) in the Delta, average annual
    leaching rates increased from 93 kgN/year prior to 1970 to 190 kgN/year post 1970.
    This increase in nitrate leaching over time can mostly be attributed to the combination
    of increasing fertilizer rates over time and shorter periods without fertilizer
    applications. However, in the BHWSS, the average annual nitrate-leaching rates
    did not change significantly over time. The fertilizer application rates simulated
    were the same for the Delta and the BHWSS, so the difference in temporal nitrate-leaching
    rates is also a result of the nitrates contained in irrigation water in the Delta.
    In the Delta, the irrigation frequency increased in 1970 and this lead to more
    frequent nitrate leaching due to more frequent applications of irrigation water
    containing significant concentrations of nitrates. Comparison with groundwater
    nitrate concentrations The locations of high-predicted nitrate-leaching rates
    (Fig. 10) typically coincide with the areas where groundwater nitrate concentrations
    are already high (Fig. 3). This is partly due to the strong influence of irrigation
    water quality on predicted nitrate-leaching rates. However, there is potentially
    a long travel time in the unsaturated and saturated zones (Wang et al. 2013).
    The processes that are expected to contribute to the attenuation of nitrates within
    the unsaturated and saturated zones include denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate
    reduction to ammonium, and anion adsorption (Kurtzman et al. 2016; Rivett et al.
    2008). The groundwater in certain locations within the Lower Burdekin has previously
    been identified as having a high potential for denitrification and dissimilatory
    reduction to ammonium due to high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon,
    high concentrations of ferrous iron, and low dissolved oxygen concentrations (Thayalakumaran
    et al. 2008). Some of the locations identified as having a high potential for
    denitrification coincide with regions, where high nitrate-leaching rates have
    been predicted in the Delta region. However, there are still some locations where
    nitrate concentrations in groundwater are high, and yet, the potential for nitrate
    attenuation to occur before groundwater discharges to rivers and creeks has not
    been determined. For example, adjacent to the Burdekin River, close to the Clare
    Weir, groundwater nitrate concentrations are exceeding 100 mg/L. The groundwater
    discharge rate at this location has been estimated, using Radon activities, to
    equal 248,000 m3/day in May 2011 (Cook et al. 2011). Discharge of groundwater
    to the Burdekin River at this location would lead to approximately 24,800 kg nitrate/day,
    in the absence of nitrate attenuation. Therefore, further research to evaluate
    the occurrence of nitrate attenuation close to groundwater discharge locations
    is essential. Implications for agricultural water management The APSIM modelling
    results suggest that the soil type, crop management, and irrigation management
    are all important in controlling deep drainage and nitrate-leaching rates. The
    management factors that were found to be particularly important were irrigation
    volumes, irrigation frequency and the number of ratoons. The irrigation volumes
    simulated were fairly high and there is evidence that lower irrigation rates can
    be used without reducing cane yields (Robertson et al. 1999). One method of irrigation
    scheduling that has been recommended to growers in the Lower Burdekin is to monitor
    stalk extension rates and to apply irrigation when the relative stalk extension
    rate (RSER) declines to 0.5 (Holden 1998; Shannon et al. 1996). However, sugarcane
    may be able to tolerate more water stress than this recommendation (Inman-Bamber
    and Smith 2005). Robertson et al. (1999) found that, following an initial irrigation
    after planting, withholding irrigation for a period of almost 5 months (during
    winter) reduced leaf area index substantially (from 1.8 to 0.9), but cane and
    sucrose yield at harvest were unaffected. The predicted deep drainage rates in
    the Delta were significantly higher than the predicted deep drainage rates in
    the BHWSS. In the Delta, artificial recharge is practiced; therefore, high deep
    drainage rates have historically not been a cause for concern, as deep drainage
    can supplement artificial recharge practices, contribute to replenishment of the
    aquifer, and help protect against seawater intrusion. In contrast, in the BHWSS,
    deep drainage below irrigated land is a cause for concern, because in the BHWSS
    groundwater, tables are already rising to the extent that the crop root zone has
    been inundated with saline water in some locations and groundwater discharges
    to rivers have started to increase. In the BHWSS, the simulated deep drainage
    rates did not increase over time, but the deep drainage rates did become more
    consistent from year to year. The high predicted deep drainage rates in the Delta
    have contributed to high-predicted rates of nitrate leaching. The potential for
    groundwater quality deterioration is of particular concern in the Lower Burdekin
    due its close proximity to the GBR World Heritage area. There is potential for
    groundwater contaminants to be transported to the GBR through a number of pathways
    including discharges to rivers and streams (Thorburn et al. 2013) and submarine
    groundwater discharge (Stieglitz 2005). The occurrence of such high nitrate-leaching
    rates in the Lower Burdekin would lead to a deterioration of the quality of the
    groundwater and the potential for increased fluxes of nutrients from groundwater
    to surface water bodies and the GBR lagoon. However, according to the APSIM results,
    the concentration of nitrate in irrigation water is the most important factor-controlling
    nitrate-leaching rates, particularly in the Delta. The APSIM results indicate
    that continuing to apply fertilizer while irrigating with groundwater that already
    contains nitrate at concentrations above 5 mg/L leads to an excess of nitrate
    in the root zone and, ultimately, high nitrate-leaching rates. This issue has
    previously been identified in the area (Stewart et al. 2006), and consequently,
    a short-term monitoring project was recently implemented to help farmers to take
    account of the nitrate contained in irrigation water when calculating how much
    fertilizer to apply (BBIFMAC 2012). The results of the Lower Burdekin wide APSIM
    modelling carried out here highlight the need for irrigation management to be
    informed by ongoing water monitoring in this region. Irrigation management practices,
    i.e., irrigation rates and irrigation quality, are critically important in controlling
    nitrate leaching. Applying “excess” irrigation to “recycle” water and prevent
    seawater intrusion appears to be contributing to high nitrate-leaching rates and,
    therefore, potentially increasing the concentrations of nitrate in groundwater.
    If groundwater began to be used as a major source of irrigation water in the BHWSS,
    the same risks of overloading the aquifers with nitrate could potentially occur,
    particularly where soil permeability has been increased through ongoing applications
    of gypsum (Reading et al. 2012). Limitations of modelling approach Development
    of APSIM models to simulate deep drainage and nitrate leaching at a regional scale
    in the Lower Burdekin has highlighted a number of limitations related to the models
    and the model parameters. As the hydraulic conductivity of the sodic soils in
    the Lower Burdekin has previously been found to be dependant on soil treatments
    such as gypsum applications (Reading et al. 2012), an effort was made to simulate
    this process in a simplified manner in APSIM by increasing the saturated hydraulic
    conductivity of the sodic soils over time. However, the attempted simulation of
    the influence of gypsum in APSIM was unsuccessful, as deep drainage in APSIM was
    found to be relatively insensitive to the saturated hydraulic conductivity once
    this parameter was above 0.2 m/day, as deep drainage was also controlled by another
    parameter, SWCON. In a previous study on shrink–swell soils (Connolly et al. 1998),
    the APSIM–SWIM module was successfully used to simulate the influence of improvements
    of hydraulic conductivity on runoff rates. This module enables the representation
    of macropores to water-holding properties and hydraulic conductivity (Connolly
    et al. 1998). Therefore, it may be more appropriate to select the APSIM–SWIM module
    in the future instead of the APSIM–SoilWat module for simulating deep drainage
    through shrink–swell soils. To simulate deep drainage and nitrate leaching in
    APSIM, many input parameters are required. Some of these parameters relate to
    physical process such as soil physical and chemical factors, but other parameters
    relate to management factors. The soil hydraulic parameters used in these simulations
    were derived from pedotransfer functions based on soil texture. While this approach
    is necessary at a regional scale, these estimated hydraulic parameters have a
    significant influence the deep drainage and nitrate-leaching predictions from
    APSIM. The input parameters related to irrigation, fertilizer, and ratoon management
    were found to be particularly important in controlling the simulated deep drainage
    and nitrate-leaching rates. To have confidence in the modelling predictions, we,
    therefore, need to be confident that these parameters are an accurate representation
    of what is happening in the field. The workshops that were conducted to obtain
    local knowledge on management practices should ideally be supplemented with more
    rigorous methods of obtaining this data such as surveys and metering. This would
    also help to improve our knowledge of the spatial distribution of management parameters.
    Accurately simulating the processes involved in nitrate leaching relies on the
    suitability of the modelling package and accurate parameterisation. The paddock
    scale APSIM modelling by Stewart et al. (2006) involved extensive field experiments
    and laboratory testing to achieve accurate parameterisation at a local scale,
    and yet, Stewart et al. (2006) still stated that the nitrate-leaching estimates
    produced using APSIM are likely to be inaccurate. A more recent APSIM study in
    the region was able to achieve improved accuracy in nitrate-leaching predictions
    at a local scale (Thorburn et al. 2011). Therefore, it may be possible to accurately
    predict nitrate leaching at a local scale using APSIM in cases, where sufficient
    field measurements have been made. However, our ability to accurately simulate
    nitrate leaching at the regional scale using APSIM is hindered by the combination
    of extensive parameterization requirements and the inherent spatial variability
    of many of these parameters. Although the nitrate-leaching predictions in this
    study may represent a worse case scenario, the spatial trends predicted in nitrate
    leaching, i.e., the prediction of nitrate-leaching “hotspots”, are still useful
    for targeting management actions. There is currently interest in using regional
    scale models, such as the “modelling tookit” developed for the Lower Burdekin
    region, to assist with management of water pollution. The ultimate aim for modelling
    water and solute fluxes in the region would be to have a fully coupled land surface–groundwater
    model, so that feedback loops between groundwater extractions and irrigation return
    flows could be simulated; however, there are not currently sufficient data to
    support this type of modelling at a regional scale. Therefore, the immediate focus
    in the Lower Burdekin should be on conducting small-scale process-based modelling
    and supplementing this with increased water monitoring. In particular, as high
    groundwater nitrate concentrations have already been detected in parts of the
    Lower Burdekin, increased monitoring of groundwater nitrate concentrations in
    locations close to sensitive receptors is strongly recommended. Conclusions APSIM
    has been used to simulate deep drainage and nitrate leaching at a regional scale
    in the Lower Burdekin Irrigation Area. This modelling has provided some insights
    into the predominant controls on deep drainage and nitrate leaching in the Lower
    Burdekin. Irrigation management practices were determined to be important in controlling
    both deep drainage rates and nitrate-leaching rates. In addition, other management
    factors such as the sugarcane crop management and the timing of fertilizer applications
    influenced the temporal trends in nitrate leaching. Irrigation water quality was
    determined to be critically important in controlling nitrate leaching in the Delta
    region. Therefore, continued monitoring of irrigation water quality is recommended
    and fertilizer application rates need to be adjusted to take into account the
    nitrate loads of the irrigation water. The high nitrate-leaching rates predicted
    in the Delta region present a challenge for groundwater quality management, particularly
    where sensitive receptors are located close to contaminated groundwater. Further
    research is required into the nitrate attenuation processes that occur along groundwater
    flow paths towards sensitive receptors. Although modelling tools can be important
    for informing improvements in water management, there are some critical challenges
    associated with modelling water and reactive solute transport on a regional scale.
    One of these challenges relates to selecting a model that can capture the key
    processes, including the influence of management practices, but a greater challenge
    still remains and this relates to our ability to parameterise regional scale models
    accurately. References Almasri MN, Kaluarachchi JJ (2007) Modeling nitrate contamination

  description: The monitoring of water requirement in irrigation areas is mostly performed
    by on-farm methods like utilization of soil probes, tensiometers, or neutron probes.
    The probes are placed into the soil collected from different depths of the root
    zone of the crop. But such procedures are found to be time-consuming. As a result,
    non-portable capacitance-based probes were nowadays utilized for monitoring of
    soil moisture. However, the sensor-based non-portable system is expensive and
    out of reach of ordinary farmers. But an absence of on-time monitoring of soil
    moisture in the root zone of the soil often results in crop failure and incurs
    a substantial loss on the cultivators. In the present investigation, a real-time
    inexpensive water monitoring system was proposed to monitor soil moisture in the
    root zone of a crop such that both time and expenditure can be reduced. The present
    study is an attempt to develop a real-time monitoring process for crop water requirement
    (CWR) in protected farm irrigation systems as a function of the significant parameters
    such as soil porosity (SP), water availability, crop biomass equivalent (CBE),
    frequency of nutrient application, frequency of irrigation, and CWR. A systematic
    literature review was performed to identify parameters for CWR, which were then
    selected by a relevant group of experts on the field. A two-step methodology was
    followed to develop a function that can automatically estimate water requirement
    in the root zone of the crop. In the first step, a new probability optimization
    technique (POT) was proposed for the identification of the priority value of the
    selected parameters to generate an ideal scenario. In the second step, the index,
    developed from the parameters and respective priorities selected in the first
    step, was predicted recurring to polynomial neural network models. The implementation
    of the nonlinear transfer function in the development of the neural network framework
    ensures generation of a platform-independent model, which can be embedded to monitor
    watering requirement for crops cultivated in a protected farm concept. The data
    of SP and CBE were retrieved from two separate indices (index of soil porosity
    and biomass index) calculated from images captured from the root and surface areas
    of the crops. Here, the POT method was used followed by the z score of priority
    function of the selected parameters estimated by polynomial networks and was fed
    for the calculation of the water requirement index (WRI). The normalized relative
    difference of the WRI of two consecutive days provides the information about the
    necessity of watering and accordingly, the crops in the system are irrigated.
    The results from the decision-making method indicated that the most significant
    parameter among the compared factors is CWR. The peak pixel value of each column
    of the image, for retrieving information from captured images and to identify
    soil porosity and biomass, was found to be the most contributing factor. The polynomial
    neural network (PNN) model trained with the information from POT method was found
    to be the best predictive variant among all the considered configuration of the
    model having a mean absolute accuracy of 99.08% during the testing phase of the
    PNN model. This real-time system, when implemented in a real-life scenario, can
    conserve both water and energy expended in running the watering networks of protected
    farms.

    Citations Explore all metrics Abstract The monitoring of water requirement in
    irrigation areas is mostly performed by on-farm methods like utilization of soil
    probes, tensiometers, or neutron probes. The probes are placed into the soil collected
    from different depths of the root zone of the crop. But such procedures are found
    to be time-consuming. As a result, non-portable capacitance-based probes were
    nowadays utilized for monitoring of soil moisture. However, the sensor-based non-portable
    system is expensive and out of reach of ordinary farmers. But an absence of on-time
    monitoring of soil moisture in the root zone of the soil often results in crop
    failure and incurs a substantial loss on the cultivators. In the present investigation,
    a real-time inexpensive water monitoring system was proposed to monitor soil moisture
    in the root zone of a crop such that both time and expenditure can be reduced.
    The present study is an attempt to develop a real-time monitoring process for
    crop water requirement (CWR) in protected farm irrigation systems as a function
    of the significant parameters such as soil porosity (SP), water availability,
    crop biomass equivalent (CBE), frequency of nutrient application, frequency of
    irrigation, and CWR. A systematic literature review was performed to identify
    parameters for CWR, which were then selected by a relevant group of experts on
    the field. A two-step methodology was followed to develop a function that can
    automatically estimate water requirement in the root zone of the crop. In the
    first step, a new probability optimization technique (POT) was proposed for the
    identification of the priority value of the selected parameters to generate an
    ideal scenario. In the second step, the index, developed from the parameters and
    respective priorities selected in the first step, was predicted recurring to polynomial
    neural network models. The implementation of the nonlinear transfer function in
    the development of the neural network framework ensures generation of a platform-independent
    model, which can be embedded to monitor watering requirement for crops cultivated
    in a protected farm concept. The data of SP and CBE were retrieved from two separate
    indices (index of soil porosity and biomass index) calculated from images captured
    from the root and surface areas of the crops. Here, the POT method was used followed
    by the z score of priority function of the selected parameters estimated by polynomial
    networks and was fed for the calculation of the water requirement index (WRI).
    The normalized relative difference of the WRI of two consecutive days provides
    the information about the necessity of watering and accordingly, the crops in
    the system are irrigated. The results from the decision-making method indicated
    that the most significant parameter among the compared factors is CWR. The peak
    pixel value of each column of the image, for retrieving information from captured
    images and to identify soil porosity and biomass, was found to be the most contributing
    factor. The polynomial neural network (PNN) model trained with the information
    from POT method was found to be the best predictive variant among all the considered
    configuration of the model having a mean absolute accuracy of 99.08% during the
    testing phase of the PNN model. This real-time system, when implemented in a real-life
    scenario, can conserve both water and energy expended in running the watering
    networks of protected farms. Similar content being viewed by others Potential

    Due to limited water resources, the role of macroeconomic policies in agricultural
    water management is vital and undeniable. The increasing demand for food and utilization
    of irrigation systems for enhancing agricultural production greatly influence
    the pressure to find renewable water resources (Valipour 2017). Climate change
    may severely alter the risk of hydrological extremes over large regional scales,
    and human water consumption will put additional pressure on future water resources
    (Lehner et al. 2006). Drought is a creeping phenomenon that occurs both in high
    and low rainfall areas (Wilhite and Glantz 1985). Recurring drought events have
    drastic socioeconomic effects on the people worldwide. The impacts have been exacerbated
    by climate variability due to erratic and unpredictable nature of seasonal rainfall,
    floods, and cyclones. These natural events highly affect the farming system across
    southern Africa, especially rain-fed agricultural and low-lying areas (Gebre and
    Getahun 2016). Variations and trends in extreme climate events have only recently
    received much attention. Exponentially increasing economic losses, coupled with
    an increase in deaths due to these events, has resulted in more attention on the
    possibility of increasing frequency of these events (Easterling et al. 2000).
    Extreme flood and drought events can cause tremendous damage to economy and ecology,
    and in the worst case, these events bear enormous risks for life. They are phenomena
    that are not constrained by watershed or international boundaries, and they can
    grow to afflict large areas and many countries simultaneously (Lehner et al. 2006).
    Accurate forecasting of monthly rainfall is significantly important in water resource
    management and crop pattern design (Valipour 2016). Since the irrigation system
    requires a frequent and considerable amount of water withdrawal, there is a high
    demand for establishing renewable water resources in the agriculture sector. In
    developing countries, the percentage of agricultural water withdrawal has decreased
    due to the growth in industries and population, as well as the implementation
    of pressurized irrigation and management strategies to increase efficiency (Valipour
    2017). Moisture management throughout the growing season is a critical factor
    in the production of high-quality vegetables. Applying the proper amount of water
    at the correct time is critical for achieving the optimum yield from irrigation.
    Water allocation decisions must take account of the distribution of agricultural
    withdrawals, especially in the case of strongly seasonal irrigation (Valipour
    2016). Plant factors that affect the requirement of crop irrigation are crop species;
    canopy size and shape; leaf size, shape, and orientation; plant population; rooting
    depth; and growth and development stage of the crop (Stephen 2002). As correctly
    pointed out by Valipour (2016), irrigation is a significant contributor to variability
    in global crop yields. Regular patterns, which are found in both natural and man-modified
    environments, are strongly interwoven with free-surface flows (Viero and Valipour
    2017). Inflow reservoirs have a significant role in irrigation water management
    which ensure optimal crop yield. Accurate forecasting of the inflow water in irrigation
    reservoir ensures proper management and operation of the reservoir for sustainable
    crop production (Valipour et al. 2013). The design of horizontal and vertical
    drainage systems in terms of layout, depth, and spacing of the drains is often
    done using subsurface drainage equations with parameters like drain depth, depth
    of the water table, soil depth, hydraulic conductivity of the soil, and drain
    discharge (Valipour 2012). Evapotranspiration rate has a vital role in agricultural
    water management. Its computation under different weather conditions has been
    successfully studied using mass transfer-based models (Valipour 2014). The Box–Jenkins
    models are used for forecasting the reference potential evapotranspiration (Valipour
    2012). The model to estimate potential evapotranspiration should take climate
    change and magnitudes of extreme events into consideration (Valipour et al. 2017).
    Water transport over long distances is based on gravity. Recently, there is an
    increasing need to find methods for energizing irrigation solar photovoltaic-powered
    pumps so as to reduce the dependence on imported oil and electricity (Yannopoulos
    et al. 2015). There is a constant and frequent change in the 81 irrigation pattern
    due to the constrained posed by the scarcity of natural resources (Valipour 2015).
    In recent years, the scarcity of land availability (van Zanten et al. 2016; Lambin
    and Meyfroidt 2011) has enforced many cultivators to opt for protected irrigation
    (Nagle 2016). One of the major conditions for protected cultivation system is
    minimum crop water requirement (CWR). A high requirement of water will increase
    the total load of the system, which is not acceptable for a protected irrigation
    system. In hydroponic systems (Treftz and Omaye 2016), however, only the crops
    that can intake nutrients from water are selected. But in such systems, the load
    of the layers becomes considerably high, and due to the large water requirement
    (WR), the total cost of production also increases. The protected irrigation systems
    and hydroponic systems are associated with wastage of water, resulting in increased
    cost of production. Here, it should also be noted that water acts as a nutrient
    carrier. The energy utilized for supplying the required amount of water also gets
    increased, enlarging the amount of investment required for operation and maintenance
    of a protected farm. The protected irrigation schemes often utilize drip irrigation
    systems to irrigate the plants (Tran 2016) as such systems prevent wastage of
    water by applying water to the root zone of the plants. But most of the drip irrigation
    systems are not designed to recognize whether there is a requirement of watering.
    If the soil is saturated, any further irrigation will cause flooding. As dripping
    is done without monitoring, flooding takes place, which can increase the production
    cost for a protected irrigation scheme. However, this issue can be resolved by
    installing a monitoring system for observing soil saturation. This monitoring
    system can alert the cultivators when the soil is saturated, and at the time of
    saturation, real-time systems can block the passage of water to prevent soil irrigation.
    This type of system is expensive but can reduce the production cost by preventing
    the occurrence of flooding. 1.1 Charge-coupled device (CCD) camera A charge-coupled
    device (CCD) is an integrated circuit etched onto a silicon surface forming light-sensitive
    elements called pixels. Photons incident on this surface generate a charge that
    can be read by electronics and turned into a digital copy of the light patterns
    falling on the device (Anonymous 2013b). CCD camera has been used in real-time
    monitoring of soil information in agricultural fields in Khon Kaen, Thailand using
    Field server (Mizoguchi et al. 2008), debris flow monitoring system in Nantou,
    central Taiwan (Yin et al. 2011), study of root–soil interface in Potsdam, Germany
    (Rudolph-Mohr et al. 2014), Spatial Scale Gap Filling Using an Unmanned Aerial
    System: A Statistical Downscaling Method for Applications in Precision Agriculture
    (Hassan-Esfahani et al. 2017). The cost and simplicity of CCD as a sensor for
    retrieving optical data on site encourages the author to implement CCD camera
    for real-time data retrieval of soil moisture in the root zone. 1.2 Real-time
    monitoring system for drip irrigation Irrigation water management primarily aims
    to control the volume and frequency of irrigation water applied to crops, so as
    to meet crop needs while conserving water resources (MDA 2017). A real-time irrigation
    control system for greenhouses using soil moisture sensors, a hardware input/output
    interface (A/D card), a computer with a software interface, and actuators were
    developed in Department of Environmental Horticulture at the University of Florida
    showed that getting the reliable measurements of the substrate water tension using
    sensors presented was a major difficulty (Testezlaf et al. 1997). Real-time monitoring
    of soil water content of drip irrigation system was developed using central Anatolia,
    Turkey using soil moisture sensor, wireless modules and Omni-direction antenna
    (Dursun and Ozden 2011). The intrusive nature and the expenses involved in a sensor-based
    drip irrigation monitoring system discourage the cultivators from adopting these
    schemes. The cost of running and maintaining the monitoring system has often been
    found to be more than the cost of flooding (Kacira and Ling 2001). Hence, in the
    present investigation, the intrusive sensor-based system is replaced with simple
    charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras to capture images. A novel algorithm is also
    developed to process and collect relevant information for estimating the moisture
    content of the soil. The entire system works on the data retrieved from the images
    captured at regular intervals. The use of simple CCD camera, instead of expensive
    sensors, lowered the cost of implementation and maintenance of the system compared
    to the existing systems of monitoring soil moisture. The present study proposes
    to install a novel real-time monitoring system based on simple cameras, image
    processing algorithms, and an indicator to represent the soil saturation condition.
    This indicator was derived from various correlated factors that affect the soil
    moisture content. The present investigation also tried to estimate the CWR using
    a WR indicator, which is also developed from the information retrieved from the
    captured images about the input factors by the simple algorithm for estimation
    of the value of the indicator. 1.3 Indicators of crop watering requirement index
    Soil porosity (SP), water availability (WA), crop biomass equivalent (CBE), frequency
    of nutrient application (FNA), frequency of irrigation (FI), and CWR are the factors
    considered in the determination of crop watering requirement index (WRI). SP refers
    to that part of a soil volume that is not occupied by soil particles or organic
    matter. Pore spaces are filled with air, other gasses, or water. Large pores (macropores)
    allow the ready movement of air and the drainage of water (David 2014). WA is
    the difference between field capacity, which is the maximum amount of water the
    soil can hold, and the wilting point where the plant can no longer extract water
    from the soil (Sheppard and Hoyle 2016). CBE is a renewable energy resource of
    biological origin that can be used as combustible fuel and includes trees, crops,
    agricultural waste, and algae. Crop biomass is a subset of biomass that specifically
    relates to harvested crops and includes grasses and straw, as well as crops specifically
    planted to provide biomass energy. Grass crops such as switchgrass, big bluestem,
    and miscast are considered the go to grass species for use as biomass energy production
    since these crops have proven higher yields and short rotation, providing farmers
    the maximum return on their investment and their land (Anonymous 2013a). These
    crops mainly refer to plants or plant-based materials that are not used for food
    or feed. The FNA in sandy soils is necessary because sandy soils can hold less
    water than soils with a fine texture. Irrigation frequency is usually higher in
    sandy soils and, as a result, leaching of nutrients is stronger (SMART Fertilizer
    Management 2008). The FI is the interval that can be safely allowed between two
    successive irrigations. Alternatively, irrigation interval is defined as the ratio
    of allowable soil moisture depletion to the daily water use. It depends on the
    consumptive use of rate of a crop and the amount of available moisture in the
    crop root zone. It is a function of crop, soil, and climate. Sandy soils must
    be irrigated more often than fine-textured deep soils. A moisture use ratio varies
    with the kind of crop and climate conditions and increases as the crop grows larger
    and days become longer and hotter. In general, irrigation should start when about
    50%, and not over 60%, of the available moisture, has been used from the root
    zone in which most of the roots are concentrated. The stage of crop growth with
    reference to critical periods of growth is also kept in view while designing irrigation
    frequency (MAIB 2015). CWR is defined as the depth (or amount) of water needed
    to meet the water loss through evapotranspiration. In other words, it is the amount
    of water needed by the various crops to grow optimally (Brouwer and Heibloem 1986).
    1.4 Polynomial neural network The PNN algorithm is based on the Group Method of
    Data Handling (GMDH) and was originally proposed by Prof. A.G. Ivakhnenko. PNN
    correlates input and target variables using nonlinear regression. The important
    feature of the PNN International GMDH algorithm is its ability to identify both
    linear and nonlinear polynomial models using the same approach (Tetko et al. 2000).
    The PNN has been applied for enhancing performance of GPS in electric systems
    (Mosavi 2009), enhancing performance of GPS-based line fault location (Mosavi
    2008) modeling complex hydrological processes (Wang et al. 2005), exchange rate
    forecasting (Ghazali et al. 2008) to financial time series prediction (Ghazali
    et al. 2006), fault detection, isolation, estimation, and reconfigurable flight
    control (Barron et al. 1990), for estimating reference evapotranspiration in Gujarat,
    India (Vyas and Subbaiah 2016), for sustainable irrigation planning of the Jayakwadi
    irrigation project, Maharashtra, India (Raju et al. 2006). The capability of PNN
    in identification of optimal number of hidden layer which will be suitable for
    learning a problem given in the available data set based on a fitness function
    and the self-adaptation feature for selecting the best training algorithm from
    a set of programming techniques and subsequently the high level of accuracy retrieved
    in various studies which applied PNN for prediction purposes, encouraged the authors
    to use PNN model to estimate WRI. 1.5 Objective of the study The watering requirement
    for a crop is generally identified with the help of water available in the soil
    which can be utilized by the plant, i.e., soil moisture. The amount of soil moisture
    can be identified with the help of visual observation of the plant by experts,
    meteorological contributions, soil–plant–atmosphere continuum and many other on-farm
    methods. Among the on-farm methods, sample-based analysis and sensor-based monitoring
    methods are practiced. However, the former method requires a sufficient amount
    of time for results whereas the latter method involves significant amount of monetary
    requirements which is generally out of reach for the cultivators of the developing
    world. CWR not only depends on the soil moisture, it also depends on the type
    and growth stage (represented by the biomass content) of the plants, nutrient
    content of the soil, available irrigation infrastructure, and many other factors.
    That is the reason the present study aims to propose a new method for objective,
    cognitive, and real-time decision making regarding the requirement of watering
    the crops cultivated in a protected farm system. In this new method, the relevant
    factors which significantly contribute in the determination of watering requirement
    are used, as well as their respective importance, which was determined with multi-criteria
    decision-making (MCDM) techniques. Secondly, the information about the input factors
    are retrieved by processing the images captured by on-farm cameras which serve
    the purpose of sensors, however, do not require significant financial implications
    on the farmers as simple CCD camera is inexpensive which greatly reduce the cost
    of the system. The different significance of the parameters as represented by
    the MCDM method was incorporated in the decision making by the introduction of
    the indicator-based system. A new kind of MCDM technique is also proposed here
    where z score of the product function of all the input parameters are optimized
    to find the optimal point of decision at which the contribution of the parameter
    represented by the priority value or weight of significance (which is used as
    the design parameter) is identified. The polynomial neural network method was
    used as the optimization technique and for developing a platform-independent model
    to use in the real-time decision-making systems of watering requirement. The present
    investigation aims to estimate the priority of the parameters in such a way that
    ensures optimal results. In this aspect, the z score of product function of the
    relevant parameters was used for maximization. At the optimal point, the technique
    identifies the priorities of the parameters that can produce optimal results.
    In the second phase of model development, the entire procedure of estimation of
    the watering requirement is represented by the introduction of the WRI. This index
    is the standard normalized probability of the product function of the beneficiary
    and the inverse function of non-beneficiary parameters as per their significance
    as determined from the previous step. The unique method of model development generates
    a platform-independent model for real-time estimation of watering requirement.
    Here, the SP and biomass amount are also proposed to be identified by adopting
    an objective and a cognitive method similar to the method for estimation of WRI
    based on the information retrieved from processing the captured images from the
    root zone and surface area covered by the crop gives the index of soil porosity
    (ISP) and biomass index (BI), respectively, which are required for the calculation
    of WRI. In the second objective, a real-time monitoring system was developed to
    retrieve the information about the crop watering requirement from the surface
    of the soil in which the crops are cultivated. The system captured images at the
    regular interval, and the embedded algorithm, as described in the previous paragraph,
    process the captured image and feed the required information to the WRI so that
    it can estimate the watering requirement of the crop. Based on the index value,
    signals of watering are sent so that a real-time crop watering system can be developed.
    2 Materials and methods In the present investigation, the neural network was utilized
    to estimate the priority value (PV) of the parameters and predict the value of
    the indicators. The PNN is a new variant of the artificial neural network that
    automatically identifies a number of inputs and hidden layers for optimal predictions.
    This method can also utilize many training algorithms to find the ideal value
    of the weights of the connections, which in ordinary neural networks was determined
    by trial-and-error or complex search algorithms (Harpham et al. 2004). The present
    investigation was accomplished by following three major phases: selection of input
    parameters, development of the optimization problem and development of the predictive
    model. Sections 2.1–2.3 depict the methodology adopted to achieve these objectives.
    2.1 Selection of input parameters The input parameters were selected by systematic
    literature review followed by a selection procedure based on a voting analysis
    where a group of experts comprising engineers, stakeholders as well as scientists
    working in the relevant field. Different types of questions were discussed within
    the expert group to select the set of most important parameters responsible for
    the determination of watering requirement. During the selection of the features,
    it was assumed that the data collection for the parameters would be easy, flexible,
    and available in real time. All the parameters were quantitative in nature, coherent
    with the objective, and considered real positive numbers to depict a real scenario.
    The results from the procedure identified six parameters required to determine
    the watering requirement of the crop at a specific time. Not all the parameters
    were equally significant. So, the determination of the priorities of the selected
    parameters followed a clear and definite idea about the level of contribution
    from the selected variables in the determination of watering requirement. The
    prospective parameters were selected based on their citation frequency in the
    relevant literature. Based on the selection, the parameters like SP (Nimmo and
    Hillel 2004), WA (Haddeland et al. 2006), CBE (Steduto et al. 2012), FNA (Hochmuth
    1992), FI (Hanks 1983), and CWR (Allen et al. 1998a, b) were selected for the
    determination of WRI among which the index of soil porosity (ISP) (represents
    soil porosity), biomass index (BI) [represents crop biomass equivalent (CBE)],
    frequency of nutrient application (FNA), and crop water requirement (CWR) were
    found to increase the water requirement in the root zone and remaining two parameters
    were found to be responsible for reducing the requirement. The FI and WA were
    designated as the non-beneficiary, and the remaining four were considered as the
    beneficiary parameter when WRI was calculated. As the protected farm irrigation
    systems were placed indoors, no impact of the climatic parameters was considered.
    2.2 Development of the probability optimization technique The entire procedure
    of model development can be divided into two distinct steps. In the first step,
    the main objective was to separate the selected parameters based on their significance
    in the estimation of watering requirement. In this phase, the input from the expert
    will introduce human bias and may corrupt the neutrality of the decision. Hence,
    a method free of human interference was proposed to ensure that the selected options
    will produce optimal not normal results. Multi-criteria decision-making methods
    are widely used for objectively selecting the best option among the many choices
    available, but it does not consider the optimality of the decision. Although the
    selection was objective and free of human bias, the result of the decision does
    not guarantee optimality. Therefore, for the present objective, the value of priorities
    or importance or PV of each of the selected parameters was calculated with the
    help of a new method. In this new method, the priorities were used as design variables,
    and the z score of the product function of the beneficiary and non-beneficiary
    parameters among the selected features was taken as an objective function of the
    optimization problem that targets maximization of crop watering requirement so
    that a pronounced and definite decision would be taken regarding the watering
    of the crops. The constraints of the variables were fixed between 0 and 1. The
    bounded, nonlinear, cascaded, real number optimization problem was solved by the
    application of PNNs, which referred to the programming technique for maximization
    of the objective function. The PVs at the optimal condition or when the value
    of the objective function was maximum were used as the weight of importance or
    priority of the product function (W). Equation 1, Eq. 1.1, and Eq. 1.2 depict
    the calculation of the index value for identification of watering requirement
    and the probability optimization problem numerically: $${\\text{If}},\\;W \\,
    = \\, \\pi \\, \\left\\{ {\\left( {b_{\\text{i}} , \\, p_{\\text{i}} } \\right),

    q_{\\text{j}} \\in R$$ (1) (where R is a set of real and positive numbers) $${\\text{Then}},\\quad
    {\\text{WRI }} = \\, z\\;{\\text{score}}\\;{\\text{of}}\\;W = \\left( {W - \\mu
    } \\right)/\\sigma$$ (1.1) (where µ and σ is, respectively, the mean and standard
    deviation of all the W values calculated at regular interval of time) For the
    probability optimization technique (POT) method, $${\\text{Max}}\\;{\\text{WRI
    }} = {\\text{ Max}} \\cdot {W}$$ (1.2) Here WRI is the WRI, W{} is the weight
    function, ‘b’ and ‘nb’ are the normalized value of the factors that are directly
    and indirectly proportional to the product function, i and j are the number of
    the beneficiary and non-beneficiary parameters [varies in between 1 and 4 and
    1 and 2, respectively, for the beneficiary (i) and non-beneficiary (j) parameters],
    respectively, and ‘p’ and ‘q’ indicate the PV of the ‘b’ and ‘nb’ factors, respectively.
    The WRI is the z score of W (Eq. 1.1) and as per the definition of z score or
    standard normal distribution, a z score of 0 represents the W as equal to the
    mean of all Ws. A z score equal to 1 represents that W is 1 standard deviation
    greater than the mean. The value of WRI will be maximized when the difference
    of W from the mean will be maximized. The benefit of using the standard normal
    distribution of the W over the simple weight function or trigonometric or other
    nonlinear functions is that it removes the scale interference, does not constrain
    the value between specific domains, and gives the representation of one data with
    respect to the standard deviation of the entire dataset. After standardization
    by z score, the value of WRI was rescaled by the feature scaling method so that
    the value of indicator always lies in between 0 and 1. The PV determined in this
    step was compared with the output from the multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT),
    where the selected factors were used as alternative and the cost and efficiency
    of crop production were considered as criteria. It is to be noted that the relationship
    between the selected factors and the objective function is explicitly defined
    in the calculation of the PV of the parameters by the POT method. But, there is
    no scope to define this relationship in the case of the MAUT method. The output
    from the adopted methods for determination of PV value of the input parameters
    of WRI is depicted in Table 1. Table 1 The priority value (PV) as determined by
    the MAUT and POT method and the ranking achieved by the parameters ‘water requirement
    index (WRI)’ Full size table Similarly, the ISP and BI are calculated using Eqs.
    2–2.1 and 3–3.1, respectively, but following the same methodology adopted for
    the calculation of WRI. $${\\text{Index}}\\;{\\text{of}}\\;{\\text{soil}}\\;{\\text{porosity

    and M, V, and P denote the mean; variance and maximum DN value or peak pixel of
    single columns of the image captured from the root surface area of the crop. The
    ISP was calculated for each of the columns of the image and averaged to find the
    ISP of the total captured image. l, m, and n are the priority value or weight
    of significance of the parameters M, V, and P, respectively. Based on the difference
    between the ISP of ith hour and i − 3rd hours, SP was calculated. A reduced value
    of the ISP implies a reduction in saturation and vice versa. Now, pores filled
    up with water will reflect more light than when pores were unsaturated with water
    (Wang et al. 2005). Reflectance is directly proportional to the pixel values or
    DN values. Thus, if the ISP is increased compared to the previous image then it
    signifies that pores are filled with water and if not then it indicates that pores
    are not filled with water. In the latter case, there is a watering requirement
    if the pores are not saturated. BI is calculated using edge detection algorithm
    in which the edges of the stem of the crop or the total area covered by the crop
    are retrieved from the captured images. The obtained values are fed to the BI
    as given in Eq. 3 and Eq. 3.1: $${\\text{Biomass}}\\;{\\text{index }} = {\\text{BI}}

    ,y_{\\text{i}} \\in R$$ (3.1) Here R is a set of real and positive numbers; Mbi
    and Vbi indicate the mean and variance of the pixels in a single column, where
    i indicates the ith column and x and y specify the PV of the mean and variance,
    respectively. Once the BI of each column is calculated, a curve is drawn between
    the BI of columns and the column numbers. By observing the peak of the curve,
    the edge of the area encompassed by the plant is detected. Based on the difference
    between the peaks, the biomass amount is estimated and fed to the WRI. A schematic
    flowchart of the methodology adopted to develop the real-time WR monitoring system
    for protected agriculture is shown in Fig. 1. The PV determined by the MAUT and
    POT method and the ranking achieved by the parameters when sorted in a descending
    manner for ‘ISP’ are shown in Table 2. The PV as determined by the MAUT and POT
    method and the ranking achieved by the parameters when sorted in a descending
    manner for ‘BI’ are shown in Table 3. Fig. 1 A schematic flowchart of the methodology

    the parameters selected for the determination of WRI, ISP, and BI was estimated
    by the POT method, a predictive model was developed where all the factors were
    selected as input parameter and WRI as the output parameter. In total, six different
    configurations of the same PNN model were prepared with the same number of inputs
    and outputs but utilizing two different priority determination methods (POT and
    MAUT), linear (L) and nonlinear (NL) PNN functions, and one data transformation
    method by which the output data were converted into its arc tangent. For validation
    and coherency with the MAUT method, the result from POT was the antithesis to
    the former method. Data transformation was utilized to compare the impact of dimension
    and dimensionless data of the output on the accuracy of the developed model. Similarly,
    the influence of linear and nonlinear functions on the reliability of the model
    was also compared such that the most optimal configuration for the present problem
    can be identified and utilized in the estimation of WRI. Among the eight different
    configurations, the best configuration was selected with the help of performance
    metrics like root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation
    coefficient (CC). The metrics were calculated for training and testing phase.
    An equivalent accuracy index (EAI) was used to identify the model with higher
    accuracy and reliability among all the considered configurations is shown in Eq.
    4: $$\\begin{aligned} {\\text{EAI}} & = {\\text{Equivalent}}\\;{\\text{accuracy}}\\;{\\text{index
    }} = \\, 0.6 \\, \\times \\, \\left\\{ {{\\text{CC}}_{\\text{t}} + {\\text{ RMSE}}_{\\text{t}}

    \\left\\{ {{\\text{CC}}_{\\text{T}} + {\\text{RMSE}}_{\\text{T}} + {\\text{MAE}}_{\\text{T}}
    } \\right\\} \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where the subscript ‘t’ and ‘T’ indicates
    the metrics for the training and testing phase, respectively. 2.4 Development
    of the real-time monitoring (RTM) system The real-time monitoring system was developed
    with the help of the predictive model embedded into a control center. There were
    two paths of signal transmission. One path comes from the camera installed in
    the root zone of the plants, and another one comes from the tank where water was
    stored. In the former path, images of the soil surface were captured at an interval
    of three hours and sent to the control center. In the control center, the image
    was processed using image processing algorithms, and two indices were developed
    to represent ISP and BI. The values of the index were then sent to the predictive
    model used as the data for the input parameter SP and biomass. In the other signal
    transmission path, a water-level indicator sensor reads the level of water to
    calculate WA. The information was sent to the control center and the predictive
    model as a data of WA. The data of CWR will vary with the types of plant and entered
    manually to the control center. The FNA depends on manual inputs. But, the frequency
    of watering was determined from the data of the water-level indicator sensor,
    which can calculate the difference in water level to determine the number of times
    the crops were irrigated within the previous three hours. According to the value
    of the WRI and a threshold value of the index, a signal was generated when the
    predicted WRI crosses the threshold. This generated signal switch on the watering
    pump to initiate the dripping process. Again, based on the value of WRI, the pump
    was either stopped or remains running at the next time intervals until signals
    instructing to terminate the pump operation were generated. The threshold value
    of WRI was determined from the linear mean of the available sets of data. The
    implementation of the threshold value with the help of the present data induces
    a self-adaptive feature to the real-time monitoring system, which automatically
    detects the uncertainty and takes adequate measure to minimize the criticality
    of the situation. 2.5 Validation of the RTM: case study A prototype-protected
    farm with drip irrigation system was selected from the vicinity of the National
    Institute of Technology, Agartala (NITA) located in the state of Tripura in the
    northeastern part of India, India. The length and width of the crop area were
    12 and 9 m, respectively, and the crops were arranged in 2 columns and 4 rows.
    For the study, the potato was considered as the crop type, and sandy loam soil
    was selected due to its frequent crop watering requirement, which will be useful
    for depicting the capability of the indicator for representing CWR. Only organic
    nutrients and fertilizers were applied. The protected farm was monitored for 23
    days. At a regular interval of 3 h, images from the root surface area and crop
    surface area, which is the area of interest of the CCD camera, were captured and
    sent to the control center located beside the farm for processing and calculating
    the ISP and BI of each image. The data of WA (l/h) were automatically retrieved
    from the water-level indicator attached to a tank, which was used for watering
    the crops. The data of FNA (inmg/sq. m) and FI (l/h/sq. m) were fed manually at
    an interval of 3 h. The CWR of the crop can be estimated from the reference evapotranspiration
    and pan coefficient of the area (Allen et al. 1998a, b). Three-hourly evapotranspiration
    data were measured by the seven-parameter weather monitoring station, and the
    pan factor (0.5) is predetermined and fed at the initiation of the monitoring
    process to the control center. Fig. 2 depicts a schematic diagram of the arrangement.
    The system normalizes (according to the feature scaling method) the ISP, BI, and
    then WRI for each interval to, respectively, find the NISP, NBI, and NWRI. Now,
    the relative difference of NWRI at the nth day and (n − 1)th day was also calculated
    to determine the incremental WRI (IWRI), which is revealed in column 9 of Table
    7. The watering requirement was calculated from the threshold value, which was
    the linear mean of the data set of IWRI for all previous intervals. Fig. 2 Schematic
    diagram of the prototype irrigation field developed for the application of the
    RTM with the proposed model Full size image The CWR was also calculated with the
    help of the method of soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC) (Sprenger et al.
    2017), where the WR is calculated by Eq. 5. $${\\text{WR }} = \\, \\pi \\, \\left(
    {A, \\, B, \\, C, \\, D, \\, E} \\right)$$ (5) where A = open pan evaporation
    (mm/d), B = pan factor, C = spacing of plant (m2), D = crop factor, and E = wetted
    area for widely spaced crop. The result from this method (Eq. 5) is compared with
    the result from the proposed method for validation of the latter. In the case
    of SPAC method, the seven-parameter weather monitoring station from Xylem Inc.
    (Garel 2017) was used to retrieve the open pan evaporation (A) for the same 23
    days. The pan factor (B), crop factor (D), and wetted area (E) were assumed to
    be 0.5, 0.45, and 0.3, respectively. Here, the incremental WR was calculated in
    the same manner as the IWRI was calculated (Table 7 column 9). The raw agreement
    indices (Meade et al. 2001) were used to measure the agreement in the decision
    of watering requirement made by the proposed WRI method and SPAC method. 3 Result
    and discussion The main objective of the present study was to develop an RTM system
    which monitors the water requirement in irrigated area in real time. In respect
    to this objective, an index was prepared from selected parameters which mostly
    influence the amount of water required. Some selected parameters like soil porosity
    and crop biomass were further represented by two more indicators. The indicators
    were developed in such a manner that they are proportional to what they represent.
    That is why z score of a weighted average of the magnitudes of the parameters
    at any instant is taken as the indicator. The weights represent the significance
    of the parameters with respect to the objective of the indicators. To determine
    the weights, new method like the multi-criteria decision-making methods were developed.
    The results from the new method were validated with the results from the MAUT
    method. The results from the POT and MAUT were separately utilized to constitute
    the WRI, ISP, and BI, the three indicators developed for the present study. After
    the weights of the parameters were determined, a predictive model was developed
    in different configurations following the PNN architecture where all the selected
    parameters were designated as the input and the WRI as output. The introduction
    of PNN enables the calculation of WRI to be automatic and adaptive which is ideal
    to be used in an RTM. In some configuration, the weightage determined by POT was
    used for calculation of WRI, ISP, and BI and in the remaining configurations,
    the results from the MAUT was utilized. All the developed models were tasted with
    the help of standard performance metrics like RMSE (equation), MAE (equation),
    and correlation coefficient (equation), and the equivalent performance index (EPI)
    was determined with the help of EAI (equation). The best model as selected from
    the different configurations of PNN and based on their EPI was used for further
    validation with the SPAC method. After the selected PNN model was found to be
    better than the SPAC method, it was used in the RTM. A prototype field was developed,
    and results were retrieved at regular intervals. WRI is calculated as described
    in Sect. 2.2. The performance in the RTM further encourages the real-life application
    of this method. Tables 1, 2, and 3 indicate the features selected for the estimation
    of WRI, ISP, and BI. The PV of the parameters as calculated by the POT and MAUT
    methods was also depicted along with the priority rank achieved by the parameters
    based on the PVs. With a higher priority value, the parameter becomes more important
    in the determination of the WRI, ISP, or BI. Tables 4, 5, and 6 depict the performance
    metrics of the configuration for the predictive model developed to estimate WRI,
    ISP, and BI, respectively. Tables 7, 8, and 9 show the results from the RTM installed
    to monitor the CWR of the prototype harvester as shown in Fig. 2 and described
    in Sect. 2.5. Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 describe and discuss the parameter selection
    and the results from the methods explained in Sects. 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4, respectively.

    from POT and MAUT methods The POT method was used in the present study as a decision-making
    method which identifies the weightage of the significance of the selected parameters
    for the objective of the decision-making problem dealt in the present study. The
    parameters SP, CBE, FNA, and CWR increased and WA and FI decreased the requirement
    of watering to the root area of the crops. Hence, SP, CBE, FNA, and CWR were treated
    as beneficiary (b), and WA and FI were treated as non-beneficiary (nb) parameters.
    SP was characterized by ISP, whereas CBE was described by BI. It was found from
    Tables 1, 2, and 3 that for the WRI, crop water requirement is found to be the
    most significant parameter (MSP) followed by frequency of irrigation. In case
    of ISP and BI peak pixel of the image is found to be the MSP. The optimal result
    for the POT method was found at the 6000th iteration. 3.1.1 Comparison of the
    results from the POT and MAUT method When the PV estimated by the POT and MAUT
    methods was compared, it was found that CWR was the most important feature for
    both the methods while the least important parameters as denoted by the two methods
    were WA and SP, respectively. The same parameters were sorted to be 5th in MAUT
    and POT methods. FNA and FI were denoted as the second least important parameter
    by the POT and MAUT methods, respectively. However, the same parameters were ranked
    as 3rd by MAUT and 4th by the POT method. According to the results, the most important
    parameter of POT was also the most important parameter of POT, indicating that
    the POT method was the best option when the decision from MAUT was taken as reference.
    The advantage of using POT was that it imbibes a decision for the generation of
    an optimal scenario that was also in a dimensionless domain based on the explicit
    relationship of the parameters with the objective function, which was absent in
    the case of MAUT. Also, the priority given by the latter method may or may not
    generate the optimal scenario. This implies the selection of POT over the decision
    from the MAUT method. However, as the model developed by the neural network architecture
    was embedded in the control system and used for monitoring, the model with the
    highest accuracy index (Eq. 4) was ultimately selecting the equation for estimation
    of WRI. When the result for the ISP and BI priority parameters was analyzed (Tables
    2 and 3), it was found that the most prioritized parameter is peak pixel, as identified
    by both the methods (i.e., POT and MAUT). It should be noted that for both indexes,
    all the selected parameters were taken as beneficiary. However, the least significant
    parameter as determined by POT and MAUT for BI and ISP was found to be different.
    In case of POT, the least important parameter was found to be variance and for
    MAUT the factor with minimum significance was found to be mean. The reason for
    the dissimilarity can be attributed to the few number of options (three) used
    in the decision-making process. It is to be noted that for the POT method, all
    the models were iterated for 6000 times. The optimal value for WRI, ISP, and BI
    was identified on the Iteration No. 701, 592 and 594, respectively. It was possible
    to optimize the function by 101.94, 145.37, and 100.64% for WRI, ISP, and BI,
    respectively. The same GMDH model that was utilized for the estimation of the
    index values was used as the programming technique for the optimization problem.
    A similar method of finding priority at the optimal scenario was proposed in an
    accepted-for-publication paper (De and Majumder 2017) but the entire index was
    optimized instead of the z score. The benefit of using z score is that the maximization
    can be obtained under a dimensionless domain relative to the standard deviation
    of the iterated population. With the estimated PV, three different predictive
    models were developed having all the selected parameters as input and WRI, ISP,
    and BI as output. In total, six different configurations of the PNN were utilized,
    and the most accurate and reliable model was selected by the EAI. The EAI was
    developed as a direct function of CC, which indicates the relationship trend that
    exists between the actual and predicted values of the output parameter. It also
    presents the inverse function of RMSE and MAE, which refer to the root mean and
    the absolute mean difference between the actual and predicted values of the output
    parameter, respectively. The metrics and the EAI were calculated for each of the
    six configurations, and the better configuration was identified and utilized for
    the estimation of WRI after predicting ISP and BI. The MAUT method has a specific
    advantage of considering and incorporating the impact or consequence of the possible
    uncertainties into the output of the decision making. Another benefit of using
    MAUT is that the decision maker can assign a specific value of utility to each
    of the consequences of the uncertainty. However, both of these features are absent
    in the MCDM method (Velasquez and Hester 2013). As the MAUT method considers uncertainty
    and each of its consequences, it becomes data intensive and often subjective due
    to the incorporation of the opinion from different experts. The involvement of
    human preference makes the method bias and often the selection of options changes
    with the change in the decision maker. As a result, to overcome both of the weaknesses,
    the POT method was introduced, where the utility value of the consequences is
    determined by the result of an optimization process. The utility function or the
    z score of the product of all the input variables is treated as the objective
    function, and the utility value attached to the consequences is taken as the design
    variable. The constraints are identified within the possible values that the utility
    values can incorporate if they are normalized. Thus, the utility value varies
    between zero to one, indicating none and complete preference of the consequence.
    Here, the input variables are taken as the consequences. The advantage of the
    PNN-based GMDH algorithm was used as the optimization technique, which ensured
    fast convergence due to the self-adaptive characteristics of the algorithm for
    the selection of the network architecture and number of inputs. As the input parameters
    of the model, and not the available options for the decision of watering, are
    prioritized by the POT method, there will be no impact of the amount of sample
    data on the decision-making process, making it more robust. This also indicates
    that the present method is free of spatial, temporal, and situational constraints.
    The POT method can be used in any situation or for any domain that has finite
    features of decision making. The main benefit of this method is that it selects
    the best preference from the set of preferences so as to ensure an optimal result.
    This reliability is not ascertained in the other MCDM methods. The condition of
    superlative decision making in the POT method also ensures that the solution will
    have maximum dominance and efficiency compared to any other solution in the criteria
    space, which is one of the conditions for the MCDM methodology to be reliable
    (Yakowitz et al. 1993). 3.2 Results from the predictive model From the results
    of the predictive model (Tables 4, 5, and 6), it was observed that among the six
    different configurations considered to predict the output function. Models having
    nonlinear neuron function, data output transformed by arc tangent function, and
    with priority determination method as POT model has better performance metrics
    compared to other configurations. For the EAI values of the Model 6NLATOT for
    WRI, 3NLATOT for ISP and BI, and that of the second placed model, i.e., 6NLATMAUT
    for WRI and 3NLATMAUT for ISP and BI, there will be a relative difference of 19.130,
    85.888, and 16.432% for WRI, ISP, and BI, respectively, between the first and
    second placed configurations. The predicted model equation of WRI as developed
    by ANN (GMDH Algorithm) from priority value of parameters generated by POT and
    MAUT are expressed using Eq. 6 and Eq. 7, respectively, as shown: $${\\text{WRI}}_{\\text{POT}}
    = \\, 1.82024e - 06 \\, - {\\text{ N}}35*0.0586907 \\, + {\\text{ N}}2*1.05869$$
    (6) $${\\text{WRI}}_{\\text{MAUT}} = \\, 1.63547e - 06 \\, - {\\text{ N}}11*0.227832
    \\, + {\\text{ N}}2*1.22783$$ (7) where, the model neurons (N) of Eq. 4 and Eq.
    5 are shown in “Appendix 1” and “Appendix 2,” respectively. The selection of the
    better model among the six configurations is pronounced and indicates the superiority
    of the selected model. This result also depicts that the model will perform more
    accurately if the PVs are retrieved from the output of the POT model. In the present
    investigation, the PNN was used as an optimization technique to prioritize the
    selected features of the model as well as to create a platform-independent framework
    for the estimation of ISP, BI, and WRI. In both the cases, the model was trained
    based on situations rather than location or time-specific data set, which also
    ensured added flexibility of the method and decision-making process with respect
    to time and space. 3.3 Results from the RTM installed for the case study The watering
    requirement as identified by the present method, as well as the value of ISP and
    BI derived from the captured images of the area of interest in the prototype irrigation
    enclosure is depicted in Tables 7, 8, and 9. It is to be noted that the incremental
    values of ISP, which was retrieved from the relative difference of ISP/BI at nth
    and (n − 1)th time, were first calculated and then the incremental ISP/BI was
    normalized to provide a uniform scale for both the indices. The result of normalization
    can be depicted on the fourth column of Tables 8 and 9. The values from the normalized
    ISP and BI (NISP and NBI, respectively) were used as the values for SP and CBE.
    The watering requirement at each time of monitoring is depicted in column 10 of
    Table 7. The magnitude of the SP, WA, CBE, FN, FI, and CWR is shown in columns
    2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, respectively. The NWRI and IWRI are depicted in Tables
    8 and 9, respectively. Similarly, in Table 10, the WR as calculated from Eq. 5
    for the same time domain and with the same data for the common variables of the
    two medium (i.e., WRI and SPAC) is given in column 10. The magnitude of the variables
    A to E is shown in columns 2 to 6 of Table 10. The values of WR, normalized WR,
    and IWR are depicted in columns 7, 8, and 9, respectively, of Table 10. Table
    10 Watering requirement as derived from the SPAC method Full size table The raw
    agreement index (RAI) is depicted in Table 11, where the third column–third row
    and fourth column–fourth row show the number of times the result, i.e., the decision
    for watering in the field agrees with that taken by the two methods. This value
    yields the score of agreement between the two methods and is indicated as a measure
    of concurrency. The value of the agreement index between the two methods was found
    to be 61.905%, and anything more than 60% is agreeable. Table 11 Agreement matrix
    of the dichotomous decision used in the assessment of watering requirement by
    the WRI and SPAC Full size table The reason for 60% agreement lies in the fact
    that the positive agreement (both the method recommended affirmatively) is minimal
    compared to that of negative agreement (both the method recommended differently).
    The agreement percentage depicts concurrence, and the results were agreed for
    implementation. Since the data are dichotomous in nature, the required level of
    calculation is moderate, but it may become complex in the case of multi-categorical
    data. However, this complex case is possible only if multi-clustered data, instead
    of binary data, are used to express the decision. Block diagram of results found
    from the present investigation is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Block diagram of results
    found from the present investigation Full size image 4 Conclusions The present
    investigation is an attempt to develop a real-time monitoring method of water
    requirement (WR) in a protected farming irrigation system. In this regard, three
    separate indices were prepared, among which the WRI will represent the watering
    requirement and ISP and BI will depict the amount of porosity in the soil and
    biomass of the crop. The information from these two indices is fed to the WRI
    to find the irrigation requirement of the crop at a day’s interval. The information
    is collected based on a simple CCD camera and a water-level indicating sensor.
    The indices were developed with the help of z score of the weight function of
    priority and priority beneficial and non-beneficial parameters with respect to
    the objective function. The priority value (PV) is estimated by the new POT method
    and compared with the MAUT method. The POT method estimated the PV of the priority
    parameters for deciding the optimal output. The information from the decision-making
    models was utilized to develop predictive models for predicting the value of the
    indices automatically. Six different configurations were developed to select the
    better configuration for a predictive model. The priority determination method
    was changed, the neuron function was varied in between linear and nonlinearity,
    and the output data were either transformed by arc tangent function or kept unchanged.
    The performance metrics like RMSE, MAE, and CC were used to estimate the accuracy
    of the models. An accuracy of more than 99% was achieved. The indices were predicted
    using the chosen model for a data set captured from the prototype arrangement
    of a protected farm for 23 days at a 24-hour interval. The benefit of utilization
    of a POT method is that it provides an objective and cognitive method for the
    estimation of the importance of the parameters in a dimensionless search domain.
    The consideration of the significance of the parameters for an optimal scenario
    of crop watering ensures optimality and quick identification of the region of
    acceptance. The introduction of nonlinear PNNs to estimate the standardized probability
    of the weight function of the priority and priority parameters produces an adaptive
    equation for automatic and real-time estimation of WR. The process is completely
    free of human interference and flexible enough to be utilized in any protected
    farm systems. The experimental arrangement and implementation of the real-time
    system for monitoring WR depicts satisfactory performance and benefits like conservation
    of both water and energy, non-attentive monitoring of irrigation, and a decrease
    in the expenditure for running the system. The quality of the harvest will also
    become high due to the optimal watering pattern that was followed by the introduction
    of the automated system. Although this system was developed for protected crop
    cultivation, it is utilized in conventional cultivation practices also. However,
    there are some shortcomings of the system. The process of normalization, which
    was applied in this procedure to calculate WRI, is not entirely reliable as the
    complete transformation of information was not possible after normalization in
    many instances. At the time of implementation, only an equation will be embedded
    for the calculation of WRI, and the requirement of normalization at the time of
    operation will only take place when NWRI, NISP, and NBI are determined. The retrieval
    of data from the processing of captured images is also not free of errors. Some
    advance method may be derived in this aspect to minimize the deviation in data
    retrieved from the processing of images. References Allen, R. G., Pereira, L.

  description: Poor irrigation scheduling practices have been quoted as the major
    challenges for sustainability of small-scale irrigation schemes in Ethiopia due
    to complexity of scheduling techniques, cost and inaccessibility of soil-water
    monitoring tools, lack of various local climatic data and soil-water parameters.
    For local experts to easily schedule irrigation and to promote adoption by farmers,
    a cheap and simple computation procedure of irrigation scheduling is needed that
    considers local resources and opinions. So far, there is no such study in the
    context of Ethiopia. A simple irrigation scheduling method (Practical) was developed
    based on the FAO procedure (Brouwer et al., 1989), employing Hargreaves ET 0 equation
    and the opinions of local farmers and extension agents. Then, the method was validated
    on-farm through participatory and close observation of farmers by comparing with
    CropWat simulated (Sophisticated) and local (Traditional) scheduling practices
    for 2015and 2015/16 irrigation seasons considering maize as indicator crop. Data
    on irrigation depths, yield and yield components and soil salinity were collected
    and analysed. Furthermore, a farmers’ day was arranged to collect opinions on
    the crop stand and scheduling techniques. In both irrigation seasons, the practical
    irrigation schedule method resulted in higher grain yield while saving substantial
    amount of water and in significantly higher water productivity (WP) compared to
    the other methods. Maximum (0.68 kg m −3 in 2015) and minimum (0.47 kg m −3 in
    2015/16) WP were found in the practical and sophisticated approaches, respectively.
    The average root zone salinities among the alterative irrigation scheduling methods
    were not significantly different, in both irrigation seasons. Farmers’ and experts’
    opinions were in favour of the practical scheduling method. The practical irrigation
    scheduling method is thus recommended for maize, around Gumselassa area. Further,
    the presented procedure can be adopted for preparation of irrigation calendars
    of other cops and in other regions.

    and highly erratic rainfall, Ethiopia is characterized by food insecurity due
    to high risk of annual droughts as well as intraseasonal dry spells (CIA, 2018;
    FAO, 2014; WFP, 2016). In order to address the problem of water scarcity and food
    insecurity, promotion and development of small scale irrigation (SSI) has been
    a priority policy for the Ethiopian Government (FDRE, 2007; MoFED, 2010, 2006;
    MoWR, 2002). As a result of this policy the irrigated area of SSI increased from
    853,100 ha in 2009/10 to 1,853,100 ha in 2012/13 (MoFED, 2014). Despite the huge
    expansion, the performance of most SSI schemes in the country is far from satisfactory
    (Amede, 2015; Awulachew and Ayana, 2011; Carter and Danert, 2006; Cofie and Amede,
    2015; IFAD, 2005; MoA, 2011; Teshome, 2003; Yohannes et al., 2017). Poor irrigation
    water management has been among the major reasons quoted for underperformance
    of the schemes. Tigray is one of the most degraded and drought prone regions of
    Ethiopia. Similar to the other schemes in the country, poor water management practices,
    particularly improper irrigation scheduling is one of the factors for underperformances
    of most SSI schemes in the region (Eyasu, 2005; Libseka et al., 2015; Yohannes
    et al., 2017). Lack of simple and practical scheduling techniques, limited knowledge
    and inadequate practical skills of farmers and local extension agents on crop
    water needs, soil types and climatic conditions, in the country (Awulachew, 2010;
    Etissa et al., 2014; Haile and Kasa, 2015; MoA, 2011) and particularly in Tigray
    region (Eyasu, 2005; Yohannes et al., 2017) as well in many countries (Hill and
    Allen, 1996; ICID/FAO, 1995; Maheshwari et al., 2003) have been the major reason
    for poor on-farm water management practices. In Tigray region, irrigation scheduling
    is being decided by a local water committee and/or based on the farmer’s intuition,
    insufficiently accounting for soil, plant and weather conditions (Eyasu, 2005;
    Mintesinot, 2002; Mitiku et al., 2002). As a result, over or under irrigation
    of fields is common in the region (Eyasu, 2005) as well as in many irrigation
    schemes in the country (MoA, 2011). These poor on-farm water management practices
    have resulted in low production and water productivity, waterlogging, soil salinization,
    rise in groundwater levels and decrease in command area (Eyasu, 2005; Mintesinot,
    2002). Many studies (Alemayehu et al., 2006; Ayenew, 2007; Fanadzo et al., 2010;
    Haile and Kasa, 2015) also confirmed that inappropriate irrigation scheduling
    as among the major factors for poor performance of many irrigation schemes. Many
    advanced and novel scientific irrigation scheduling techniques have been developed
    in the past three decades. However, the adoption by farmers is low, especially
    in developing countries (Annandale et al., 2011; Fanadzo et al., 2010). The major
    reasons for low adoption are reported to be lack of soil water parameters and
    weather conditions (Torres, 1998), and complexity of the techniques such that
    farmers are confused by choice and do not understand the difference between the
    different scheduling techniques (Stirzaker, 2006), failure of the scientist to
    understand the situation of farmers and the constraints under which they operate
    (Pleban and Israeli, 1989; Vanclay, 2003). Much of the studies are focused on
    the exact science of irrigation scheduling rather than simple and practical measures
    that would improve farmers decision (Maheshwari et al., 2003). Although various
    researches and attempts were conducted on irrigation scheduling (Demelash, 2013;
    Kifle et al., 2017; Kifle and Gebretsadikan, 2016; Mintesinot et al., 2004; Muktar
    and Yigezu, 2016) using the CropWat model in Ethiopia, none of these involved
    the participation of local farmers and extension agents and consequently the outputs
    didn’t serve the end users. Besides, the sophisticated/conventional approach applied
    by researchers cannot be practiced by the local extension agents. Unavailability
    of climatic data and absence of simple implementation manuals for farmers were
    also among the major reasons for failure of the attempts. In addition to the need
    of reliable climatic data, the sophisticated method of irrigation scheduling requires
    computer access, trained professionals and soil-water monitoring tools which are
    rarely available in most parts of Ethiopia. The choice of the irrigation scheduling
    method should consider the technology level of the farm (ICID/FAO, 1995). Past
    research and practical experience emphasized that irrigation scheduling practices
    must be simple, useable and understandable by farmers in order for them to be
    adopted (Hargreaves and Samani, 1987; Hill and Allen, 1996). Though some simple
    methods of scheduling have been developed (Torres, 1998), the practicality and
    adoption is still low for several reasons. For example, simple irrigation scheduling
    calendars (Hill and Allen, 1996) were developed which demand professional and
    sufficient weather data to apply. To secure food security in drought-prone regions
    like Tigray, concrete efforts to improve on-farm water management is required
    (Hillel, 1997). Thus, improving irrigation scheduling by individual farmers in
    the region should be a matter of urgency. Not much has been done on development
    of simple and practical irrigation scheduling techniques that can be exercised
    by local extension agents and easily adopted by farmers. Innovations are required
    for current irrigation management and practices (Pereira et al., 2002) and there
    is a need to develop simple monitoring tools and conceptual frameworks that enable
    structured learning (Annandale et al., 2011). Considering the poor socioeconomic
    status of the farmers, very low technology level of the farms, inaccessibility
    of tools and lack of local climatic data and trained professional in Tigray as
    well as in most rural parts of the country, there is an urgent need to develop
    more simple and easy to apply irrigation scheduling techniques. The aim of the
    study is therefore to identify, test and validate practical irrigation scheduling
    that considers the local conditions, which can be easily practiced by the local
    extension agents and easily understood and applied by the farmers. A participatory
    procedure that included local farmers’ and extension agents’ opinions in combination
    with a method published by FAO (Brouwer et al., 1989) and Hargreaves equation
    (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) were used for this study. The FAO approach requires
    limited data and the procedures to be followed are easy for local extension agents.
    Hargreaves equation is a worldwide accepted simple and reliable method of estimating
    evapotranspiration that requires only temperature data (Allen, 1993; Hargreaves,
    1994; Hargreaves and Allen, 2003; Jensen et al., 1990). In most rural parts of
    Ethiopia, where computers are not accessible, the other advantage of the Hargreaves
    approach is that ET0 computation can be done manually using ordinary simple calculating
    machine. Local extension agents can benefit from the simple procedures in developing
    irrigation calendars for other irrigated crops. Finally, this study gives important
    lesson for local and regional decision makers, on their endeavour to increase
    the productivity of small scale irrigated agriculture. This paper is organized
    as follows: Section 2 describes the study area, practical irrigation schedule
    development method, alternative irrigation schedules and data collection and analysis
    methods. Section 3 presents the results. In this section results of the alternative
    irrigation schedules which included depth of the applied water, yield and yield
    components, soil salinity and local opinions are presented. Section 4 discusses
    the results. Section 5 draws conclusions on the main findings of the study and
    presents policy implications. 2. Methodology 2.1. Study area description On-farm
    experiments were conducted in Hintalo-Wojerat Woreda,1 Tigray region, Ethiopia,
    in 2015 and 2015/16 irrigation seasons, at the Gumselassa SSI scheme located between
    13°13′to 13°15′ N and 39°30′ to 39°33′ E (Fig.1). More than 60% of the study area
    is covered with black clayey soil (Mintesinot et al., 1999). Some physical properties
    of the soil in the study area are shown in Table 1. The rainfall in the study
    area is unimodal, and highly erratic in space and time. The annual average rainfall
    is 500 mm and agro-ecologically, the area is classified as typical semi-arid (Yohannes
    et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res image (540KB) Download : Download

    is an earthen micro-dam designed to irrigate 110 ha. Review of secondary (past
    studies) sources and discussions with the local office of Agriculture and Rural
    Development indicated poor on-farm water management practices as among the major
    causes for overall poor performance of the irrigation scheme, that resulted in
    low crop yields and development of soil salinization. 2.2. Farmers'' and extension
    agents'' participation 2.2.1. Participation during pre-implementation In the first-step,
    discussions with local extension agents, local leaders, irrigation committee (farmers''
    representatives) and elder farmers were done individually, regarding irrigation
    water management related problems, particularly on irrigation scheduling. Then,
    in the second-step, a meeting was arranged where 25 farmers including the irrigation
    committee and the Abomays (water distribution leaders) and 3 local extension agents
    were present. Intensive discussion was made on the problem and challenges of irrigation
    scheduling in the study area. In the second-step, further discussion was carried
    out on different techniques of irrigation scheduling. Then we proposed our initiatives
    on the development of simple and practical irrigation technique, on-farm test
    and comparison against their scheduling practices and sophisticated scheduling
    technique (using CropWat). Then intensive discussions were done on the participants''
    concern, suggestion and comment, regarding the alternative scheduling techniques.
    To suit local conditions and to facilitate further adoption, adjustments were
    done to our first proposed irrigation calendars, based on the vital inputs of
    the participants. The opinions and suggestions forwarded by the majority of the
    farmers were based on their local practices and experience, which focused on adjustments
    for easier understanding, follow up and comparisons of the new scheduling techniques.
    Beyond on-farm scheduling, they also shared the need of creating convenience for
    water allocators/distributors at scheme level. Moreover, the crop characteristics
    and the selection of the experiment plot (which could represent the majority of
    plots) in the irrigation scheme were determined based on their suggestion. To
    avoid repetition and for the purpose of clarity, the local inputs are described
    in relevant steps of the study. 2.2.2. Participation during the experimental period
    During the experiment period, more efforts were done to involve farmers from the
    inception till the end since they are the ultimate beneficiaries. They were participating
    in installation of Parshall flumes, diversion and distribution of water, cultivation,
    weeding, harvesting activities and guarding of the experimental plot. Moreover,
    informal field visits and discussions were common among the local farmers during
    several irrigation events. The premise was through participation and frequent
    field observation by which farmers’ would acquire practical knowledge on the performance
    and constraints of the alternative irrigation scheduling approaches. Besides facilitating
    and improving information feedback (between farmers and researchers), the farmers
    would be in a position to judge the different irrigation scheduling techniques
    from their own perspectives. 2.3. Development of irrigation schedule 2.3.1. Practical
    irrigation schedule The development of the practical irrigation schedule was based
    on procedures of the “Simple Calculation Method” in FAO training manual no. 4
    (Brouwer et al., 1989) in combination with the Hargreaves equation (Hargreaves
    and Samani, 1985) and local farmers’ and extension agents’ inputs. The FAO approach
    requires limited data and the procedures to be followed are easy. To suite the
    local conditions and to facilitate adoption, the local farmers’ and extension
    agents’ inputs were also used in the development process. The Hargreaves equation
    was used for estimation of the potential evapotranspiration (ET0). Then a predefined
    irrigation calendar was prepared following the steps indicated below. Step I.
    Estimation of Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) The Hargreaves equation (Hargreaves
    and Samani, 1985), shown below was used to estimate ET0. (1) Where: ET0 is reference
    evapotranspiration, in mm/day, RA is extraterrestrial radiation in equivalent
    mm of water evaporation T° C is mean monthly temperature [(Tmx + Tmi)/2], in degree
    Celsius TD is mean maximum minus mean minimum temperatures in degree Celsius The
    monthly mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures were computed (Table 2) from
    a 35 years temperature data of the nearest (about 43 km far) meteorological station.
    RA values were used from Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977). Table 2. Long term climatic

    of growth stages 20, 40, 40 and 35 days (Table 3) for the initial, development,
    mid and late seasons stages, respectively were used for maize from the local farmers
    and extension agents suggestion. Since there is no location specific crop factor
    (KC) in the country, the growth stages’ based KC values for maize were adopted
    from Brouwer and Heibloem (1986). As ETc had to be determined on a monthly basis,
    for months that do not correspond with the growth stages, the average weighted
    Kc values were computed to change the growth stages’ based Kc to monthly based
    Kc (Table 3) as indicated in Brouwer and Heibloem (1986). For ease of computation,
    30 numbers of days were considered for all months for the computations of the
    average monthly KC. Then, the monthly ETc (mm day−1) was computed using Eq. (2).

    seasons, in days. Then the monthly crop water need ETc (mm month−1) was obtained,
    by multiplying the monthly ETc (mm/day) by the respective number of days in each
    month, as shown in Table 3. Step III. Estimation of net and gross irrigation application
    depths The net irrigation depth (dnet) was adapted from Brouwer et al. (1989),
    that the net irrigation depth is estimated using only soil type (texture) and
    crop root depth as inputs. The maize crop (deep rooted) under clayey soil (in
    the case of the study area) requires dnet of 70 mm. Considering short (10 m),
    well graded and closed furrows (no runoff) and controlled discharge, 75% field
    application efficiency was considered. Then, using Eq. (3) the gross applied depth
    (dgross) of 93.3 mm was computed and rounded to the nearest 5 mm and obtained
    95 mm. (3) Where: dnet and dgoss, in mm ea = field application efficiency, in
    percent Step IV. Computation of irrigation water need (IN) over the total growing
    season. The irrigation water need IN (in mm) is calculated as (Table 4): (4) Where

    irrigation scheme. Step V. Computation of number of irrigation applications and
    irrigation interval The number of irrigation applications (Ina) was computed as:
    (5) Where: IN irrigation water need, in mm Then, the irrigation interval (Iint)
    was calculated as: (6) Where: Iint, in days LGS- length of growing season in days
    Step VI. Computation of monthly net irrigation depth (dmnet) The monthly net irrigation
    depths (dmnet) in the growing season of maize were calculated using Eq. (7). (7)
    Where: dmnet, in mm ND- number of days per month Step VII. Checking and adjusting
    for deficit in the months of peak season The monthly calculated dmnet were deducted
    from the estimated monthly IN as shown in Table 6. Positive and negative values
    of the differences indicate excess and deficit of water, respectively. To avoid
    crop water stress especially in the months of peak irrigation water need, it is
    important to refine the scheduling method. Based on the recalculated irrigation
    interval for the months of peak irrigation water need (Table 7), the dmnet values
    for the entire irrigation season were refined (Table 6) following the procedure
    indicated by Brouwer et al. (1989) through reiterations to avoid deficits especially
    in the peak months. Table 6. Monthly irrigation requirements, net application

    the planting dates and determined irrigation interval, a predefined irrigation
    calendar was prepared. Considering the shallow crop root depth (early stage) and
    the farmers’ and Woreda extension agents’ suggestions and local practices the
    net irrigation depths (dnet) for the first three irrigation events were reduced
    to 50 mm, to avoid excess water loss. Step VIII. Calendar validation The calendar
    was tested and validated on-farm against CropWat simulated- (Sophisticated) and
    farmers (Traditional) scheduling techniques for 2015 and 2015/16 irrigation seasons
    as shown in Table 9, Table 10. In the second irrigation season in 2015/16, due
    to insufficient rainfall the harvested water in the reservoir was very low. The
    size of irrigated area in the irrigation scheme is usually decided based on the
    amount of harvested water. Besides the low amount of harvested water, considering
    the amount of water that can be saved which otherwise would have been lost by
    seepage and evaporation from the reservoir, the irrigation committee shifted the
    irrigation calendar by more than a month earlier from January (2016) to the end
    of November (2015), so that more farmers could be accommodated. Thus, the practical
    and sophisticated irrigation calendars for the second season were updated accordingly.
    2.3.2. Sophisticated (CropWat simulated) irrigation scheduling The CropWat 8 computer
    software developed by FAO (Swennenhuis, 2009) was used for determination of the
    crop and irrigation water requirement and irrigation scheduling. This program
    helps to calculate the potential evapotranspiration (ET0) using various climatic
    data (temperature, humidity, wind speed and sunshine hours), based on Penman-Monteith
    method. Long term climatic data (Table 2) from the nearby (about 43 km far) station
    were used. The crop factor and length of growing season used were the same as
    in the practical approach. Using the CropWat model, several options such as variable
    irrigation interval and amount (irrigating at critical or fixed depletion), fixed
    interval per growing stage and variable depth were consulted with the farmers
    and extension agents. However, for ease of understanding and comparisons of the
    new scheduling techniques (practical and sophisticated) by the majority farmers,
    fixed irrigation interval for these two scheduling techniques were suggested by
    the group. The soil input data for CropWat considered were: • Texture- clay, •
    Total available soil moisture- 160 mm (Table 2), • Maximum rain infiltration rate-
    30 mm/day (adapted from CropWat for clay soil), • Initial moisture depletion-
    80%: The amounts of applied water for all treatments were accounted starting on
    the first irrigation event (day one) which was done immediately after sowing.
    80% depletion was considered based on feel and appearance approach, • Maximum
    rooting depth- 2 m. Then, based on \"the fixed irrigation interval\" and \"refilling
    to field capacity\" option the irrigation schedule was calculated. 2.3.3. Traditional
    irrigation schedule The traditional method of irrigation schedule represented
    the farmer’s existing scheduling practice and was considered as a control. The
    farmer was allowed to irrigate all the replications of the traditional treatment
    based on his experience without any interference of the researcher for the entire
    growth period. Yet, the amount of applied water during each irrigation event was
    simply recorded using a Parshall flume. 2.4. Experimental design Nationally developed
    maize variety “Melkassa-II” (Zea mays L.), which is popular in the study area,
    was used as indicator crop in this study. Three treatments (irrigation scheduling
    methods) namely “Traditional”, “Practical” and “Sophisticated (CropWat simulated)”
    were replicated three times in randomized block design on-farm in 2015 and 2015/16
    irrigation seasons. 2.5. Data collection and analysis 2.5.1. Soil samples From
    the experimental field, pre-treatment composite as well as undisturbed soil samples
    at 20 cm intervals down the profile up to 1 m were collected from three random
    locations in 2015. The soil texture, pH and organic matter were analysed from
    the composite soil samples in a laboratory following the standard procedures.
    Soil bulk density (BD), field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP)
    were analysed from the undisturbed soil samples. Further at planting and at harvest
    in both irrigation seasons, soil samples were collected at 20 cm interval up to
    1 m depth from all replications of each treatment and soil salinity of saturated
    extracts (ECe) were measured at laboratory following a validated procedure. 2.5.2.
    Irrigation water Pre-plant irrigation is common practice in the study area to
    soften the soil for ploughing. Since it was done for the entire farm before the
    experimental lay out, the amount was not included in our study. The irrigation
    amounts applied to each plot were monitored starting the sowing date. For the
    traditional scheduling treatment the farmer’s irrigation intervals were recorded
    and the amount of applied water was monitored using Parshall flume in each irrigation
    event. For the practical and sophisticated treatments, simple data sheets (displaying
    instant calculations of the depths of applied water) were prepared and the determined
    amounts of water were applied using Parshall flumes, at each irrigation events.
    The salinity (electrical conductivities; ECw) and pH of the irrigation water were
    monitored using portable and calibrated EC and pH meters. 2.5.3. Yield and yield
    components Grain yield and yield components (total fresh biomass, plant height,
    number of ears per plant, ear length, number of kernels per ear and 1000 kernels
    weight) were measured at harvest (physiological maturity). 2.5.4. Water productivity
    (WP) The ratio of crop yield to the amount of water applied was calculated using
    Eq. (8). (8) Where:WP, in kg m−3 Y – Grain yield of maize (kg ha−1) I – Total
    irrigation water applied (m3  ha−1) 2.5.5. Farmers'' and local experts'' opinion
    Farmers’ day was arranged at harvest of the maize crop in both irrigation seasons.
    In the farmers’ day four groups were formed. Three groups were “farmers’ group”
    consisting of six farmers each and the fourth group was “expert group” formed
    from four staff members of the Woreda (local) office of Agriculture and Rural
    Development, which constituted experts from extension, irrigation, crop and natural
    resources. Then, each group was allowed to rank the crop stand of the three treatments.
    Moreover, the farmers’ and the local experts’ opinions and suggestions regarding
    the conveniences and appropriateness of the different scheduling methods were
    collected through open discussions. 2.5.6. Statistical analysis Mean comparison
    on the effect of irrigation treatments on yield and yield components as well as
    the soil salinity were done using SPSS-20 statistical software, separately for
    each irrigation season. 3. Results 3.1. Potential evapotranspiration (ET0) and
    crop evapotranspiration (ETc) As depicted in Table 2, the estimated monthly ET0
    for the irrigation season of the study area were higher for Penman-Monteith as
    compared to the Hargeaves method, except in those three months from July to September,
    although the climatic data used for both methods were collected from the same
    station at about 43 km distance. In both irrigation seasons, lower crop water
    needs (ETc) were found in the Practical method as compared to the Sophisticated
    method. The determined ETc using the practical scheduling method were 508 mm and
    456 mm in the 1st (2015) and 2nd (2015/16) irrigation seasons, respectively (Table
    3). In the sophisticated method, these values were 756.8 mm and 708.9 mm for the

    and interval Following the practical method the first calculated number of irrigation
    events (7) and the irrigation intervals (19 days) were the same for both irrigation
    seasons (Table 5). However, for the 1st season experiment, the calculated dmnet
    (using 19 days interval) showed 33 mm and 32 mm water deficit in the months of
    March and April, respectively (Table 6). Similarly, for the 2nd season a deficit
    of about 36 mm and 2 mm were shown in the months of February and March, respectively.
    To avoid crop losses, refinement were done for the entire growing season based
    on the calculated deficit months Iint (15 days) as shown in Table 7. For clarity
    the refined (recalculated) dmnet is placed in Table 6 below 19 days interval column.
    Despite the difference in the planting dates of the irrigation seasons, the adjusted
    irrigation interval appeared to be the same for both irrigation seasons. In our
    calculation as shown in Table 6, both deficit months (Feb & Mar) were considered.
    Still, for both irrigation seasons, a small amount of monthly deficits are shown.
    These deficits would be smaller when partitioned in the two irrigation events;
    moreover, considering the higher application depth (95 mm) than the determined
    (93.3 mm), due to rounding, the deficits were ignored. For the sophisticated method
    discussed in section 2, the irrigation interval considered (15 days) and the determined
    irrigation events (9 times) were the same as for the practical method. The farmer’s
    (traditional) irrigation interval ranged from 13 to 17 days and from 14 to 21
    days for the 1st and 2nd season experiments, respectively (Table 10). The minimum
    intervals were recorded in the 2nd and the maximum in the 3rd, 4th and around
    the last irrigation events for both irrigation seasons. The same numbers of irrigation
    events (8) were recorded for the Traditional method for both irrigation seasons,
    which were lower than the other approaches (9). The total water applied by the
    Practical approach was 765 mm, which was the same for both irrigation seasons.
    However, the total applied water in the 1st season experiment were 898.4 mm and
    983.8 mm for the Traditional and Sophisticated methods, respectively and during
    the 2nd season 873.1 mm and 960.9 mm were applied by the former and later approaches,
    respectively. Higher depths of water were applied by the Sophisticated followed
    by the Traditional and then by the Practical methods in both irrigation seasons.
    The amount of water applied by the Traditional approach depends upon the farmers
    experience. In the first two irrigations the applied water were lower as compared
    to the rest of the irrigation events and showed almost an increasing trend except
    the last in both irrigation seasons. In the traditional scheduling, maximum depth
    (>120 mm) per applications were recorded in the 5th, 6th and 7th irrigation events.
    For the Sophisticated approach, higher application depths (>130 mm) were recorded
    during the 5th to 8th irrigation events. In both treatments, starting the 3rd
    (for traditional) and the 4th (for sophisticated) up to the last irrigation events,
    there were frequent ponding of water on the plots for a considerable time (3–8 h)
    after irrigation. During these irrigation events, wet soil surface for a couple
    of days were also observed especially in the sophisticated treatment plots. 3.3.
    Soil salinization The salinity (electrical conductivity) of the irrigation water
    varied across the growing seasons from 0.45 dS m−1 (pH-7.45) at the beginning
    of irrigation seasons to 0.68 dS m−1 (pH-7.6) at the end. The distribution of
    salts (ECe) at 20 cm interval down the soil profile up to 100 cm, at planting
    and at harvest for both irrigation seasons is depicted in Table 11. Table 11.

    * Note: Means followed by the same letters in column are not statistically different
    at P<0.05. In the 1st season (2015) experiment, the average root zone (100 cm)
    salinity (ECe) at planting were 1.69, 1.94 and 1.83 dS m−1for the sophisticated,
    traditional and practical treatments, respectively. Statistically, all were similar.
    In the same season, at harvest, higher surface (0–20 cm) salinity was found in
    the I2 (2.43 dS m−1) followed by I1 (2.34 dS m−1) and lower value was found in
    the I3 (2.03 dS m−1) treatment. In contrast, the ECe in the preceding profile
    (20–40 cm) was higher in the I3 (1.88 dS m−1) as compared to the other treatments.
    Lower soil salinity below 50 cm down the soil profile, was found in the I1 compared
    to the other treatments. In all treatments as shown in Table 11, starting the
    second layer (20–40 cm) the ECe showed an increasing trend downward of the soil
    profile, except the last profile in the I2. In 2015, although variations on the
    profile salt distributions were observed among the different treatments, statistically
    only the surface (0–20 cm) ECe was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the I2 as
    compared to the I3. In the same season the average ECe at harvest were 2.41, 2.57
    and 2.46 dS m−1 for the I1, I2 and I3, respectively. Although a significant increment
    in soil salinities were observed at harvest as compared to planting in all treatment,
    the average root zone salinities at harvest among all the treatments were not
    significantly different. In 2015/16 at harvest, the ECe of I1was higher (2.22 dS m−1)
    at the surface (0–20 cm) and lower at the preceding profiles as compared to the
    other treatments. In contrast, except in the surface (0–20 cm), higher ECe was
    found in all layers in the I3 compared to the other treatments. The average ECe
    across the entire profile were 2.04 dS m−1, 2.19 dS m−1 and 2.3 dS m−1 in the
    I1, I2 and I3, respectively. At harvest, the soil salinity only in the 60–80 cm
    depth were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in I3 (2.68 dS m−1) as compared to
    both I1 (2.12 dS m−1) and I3 (2.21 dS m−1). However, the average root zone salinities
    between all treatments were not significantly different. In both irrigation seasons,
    although the severity varied between irrigation events, after the soil dried,
    a white efflorescence appeared on the surfaces of all treatments. At harvest,
    in both irrigation seasons lowest surface ECe were found in the practical treatment
    and the lowest average root zone ECe was found in the Sophisticated treatment.
    3.4. Yield and yield components The effect of different irrigation scheduling
    treatments showed significant results of maize biomass in both irrigation seasons
    (Table 12). In 2015, the I3 (practical) treatment significantly increased (at
    P < 0.05) the biomass as compared to other treatments (I1 and I2). However, in
    2015/16 the results showed non-significant differences in biomass between the
    I3 and other treatments. Maximum and minimum biomass of 25.8 t ha−1 (2015) and
    20.4 t ha-1 (2015/16) were recorded in I3 and I1 treatments, respectively. In
    2015 the biomass in both the I1 and I2 treatments showed non-significant results,
    although significant differences were found in 2015/16. Table 12. Effect of irrigation
    schedule on yield and yield components and water productivity of maize. Irrigation

    0.66c Note: Means followed by the same letters in column are not statistically
    different at P<0.05. As shown in Table 12, the effect of different irrigation
    scheduling treatments showed non-significant results in grain yield among all
    treatments in 2015. However in 2015/16, the I3 treatment gave significantly higher
    grain yield than all treatments. In both irrigation seasons, the I2 and I3 treatments
    were, however, statistically not significant in grain yield. In 2015, average
    grain yield results were 4.78, 4.83 and 5.22 t ha−1 in I1, I2 and I3 treatments,
    respectively. The corresponding grain yield in 2015/16 was 4.5, 4.41 and 5.05 t
    ha−1, respectively. The plant height was significantly higher for I3 as compared
    to I1 in 2015. However, no significant differences on plant height were observed
    in 2015/16. The effect of irrigation scheduling on ear length showed no significant
    differences among all treatments in both irrigation seasons. The number of ears
    per plant and the number of kernels per ear in 2015/16 were significantly higher
    for I3 as compared to I1, though all the treatments failed to show any significant
    differences in 2015 in the number of ears per plant and the number of kernels
    per ear. In both years, the I3 treatment significantly enhanced 1000-kernel weight
    as compared to other treatments, though no significant differences in 1000-kernels
    weights were found between the I1 and I2 treatments in both years. 3.5. Water
    productivity (WP) The average water productivity of the different irrigation scheduling
    treatments is presented in Table 12. The WP was significantly influenced by the
    different irrigation schedules in both irrigation seasons. Maximum WP (0.68 kg
    m−3 in 2015 and 0.66 kg m−3 in 2015/16) was found in I3 in both irrigation seasons.
    The I1 treatment resulted in lower WP (0.49 kg m−3 in 2015 and 0.47 kg m−3 in
    2015/16) in both irrigation seasons. The I3 treatment significantly increased
    the WP as compared to the other (I1 and I2) treatments, in both irrigation seasons.
    The WP for both I1 and I2 were not statistically significant in 2015, though the
    WP for I2 in 2015/16 was significantly higher than I1. The simple linear regression
    between WP and yield (Fig. 2) showed that an increase in WP with yield increment
    and water decrement. Download : Download high-res image (187KB) Download : Download

    local experts''(extension agents'') opinion 3.6.1. Ranking of crop stand The farmers’
    and extension agents’ groups mean rank (according to their own criteria) of the
    treatments are depicted in Table 13. Each group was invited to present their ranking
    results as well as major justifications. Table 13. Farmers and expert group mean
    rank of crop stand. Irrigation season Treatment Farmer groups Expert group G-I
    G-II G-III Mean 2015 I1=Sophisticated 2.33a 2.67a 2.33a 2.44a 2.33a I2=Traditional

    1c 1b 1b 1b 1b Note: Means followed by the same letters in column are not statistically
    different at P<0.05. The smaller the number, the best the rank. In 2015, the I3
    treatment was ranked the best by all of the groups, although statistically similar
    as compared to I2 in the farmer group II. The treatment mean rank in I1 and I2
    were the same for farmers’ group I and III. Although, the mean rank of I1 was
    the least for the experts and the farmers group-II, compared to I2, it was significant
    only for the latter group. In the second season (2015/16) similarly, the I3 treatment
    was given the best rank by all except for farmers’ group-II, which they gave same
    rank as I2 treatment. The mean rank variation between I1 and I2 were significant
    for farmers group I and group II. In both irrigation seasons, the farmer groups’
    overall mean rank variation for I3 were significantly different (best) as compared
    to both I1 and I2. However, the overall mean rank between I1 and I2 were statistically
    similar for both irrigation season. From the groups’ presentation, the farmers
    major criterion of ranking of the crop stand were the expected grain yield and
    total biomass, which were judged from observation of the plant height, stem thickness
    (diameter) and number of ears. These criterions were similar for all groups except
    for the inclusion of visible surface salt (white salt efflorescence) by the experts’
    group. 3.6.2. Scheduling technique opinions All the participants appreciated the
    water saved by the I3 (practical technique). While comparing the irrigation intervals,
    most of the participants were in favor of the fixed irrigation interval (I1 and
    I3). The major reasons raised were its convenience and easiness for individual
    farmers and scheme water distributors in such a way that they both will know ahead
    whose turn is next. Important concern raised by the farmers was the capacity and
    skill of the Water Users Association (WUA), on providing fixed interval-based
    irrigation scheduling at scheme level. The second major point raised by the experts
    was on the technical feasibility of measuring water by individual farmer. Water
    is not metered on-farm in most irrigation scheme in Ethiopia. However, during
    the experimental seasons the farmers were surprisingly able to classify the irrigation
    scheduling techniques qualitatively in their own local language, based on their
    observation of the applied water to each treatment. “Ablek leck” means too much
    water for I1, “Limud” means usual for I2 and “Chebreck-chebreck” means little
    by little for I3. 4. Discussions 4.1. Effect of irrigation scheduling on potential
    evapotranspiration (ET0) and irrigation amount The determined crop water needs
    (ETc) using the practical scheduling method were, about 33% and 36% lower than
    that of the Sophisticated method for the 1st (2015) and 2nd (2015/16) irrigation
    seasons, respectively. The obtained results also showed that the gross amount
    of applied water by the sophisticated method was higher by 28.6% (2015) and 25.6%
    (2015/16) than the Practical method. Similarly, the gross applied depths by the
    Traditional method were higher by 17.4% and 14.1% as compared to the practical
    method, for the corresponding irrigation seasons. The big difference between the
    Practical and Sophisticated methods were entirely attributed to the methods used
    for estimating the potential evapotranspiration (ET0) by Hargreaves and the Penman-Monteith
    equations based on various climatic factors acquired from a meteorology station
    located at about 43 km distance, respectively. The Penman-Monteith (PM) estimated
    monthly ET0 were higher in all months except for the months of July to September,
    as compared to Hargreaves (Table 2). Frequent field observations confirmed surface
    water-pond and saturated soil for a significant time after irrigation, in both
    the Sophisticated and Traditional treatments. Regarding the traditional practices,
    this is in line with the finding of Yohannes et al. (2017), that reported qualitatively
    over-watering practices of the farmers in the same irrigation scheme, from their
    scheme level survey conducted in 2015/16. The Penman-Monteith is worldwide recommended
    methodology under availability of representative and accurate weather data gathered
    from large and well-watered area (Droogers and Allen, 2002). Although the station
    where the climatic data adopted and the study area have similar elevation, Ethiopia
    in general and the region in particular is characterized with a complex variation
    in local topography. Yet, Dinku et al. (2014) found strong dependence of temperature
    on elevation in Ethiopia. Another study conducted in the country by Boke (2017),
    generally indicated large errors in predicting or interpolating wind speed as
    compared to temperature, sunshine fraction and rainfall. Although further robust
    researches on local climate and ET0 are required, considering the irrigation depth
    applied by the alternative approaches versus field observations, the obtained
    crop performances and the observation by Dinku et al. (2014) and Boke (2017) the
    findings of this research indicates that the overestimation of the Penman-Monteith
    ET0 was probably due to poor representation of most of the climatic data acquired
    from 43 km far station. On the other hand, the better performance of the Hargreaves
    could be due to relatively better representation of temperature data. The higher
    ETc values in the 1st irrigation season as compared to the 2nd irrigation season,
    in both scheduling methods, were due to change in the irrigation calendar (start
    of irrigation) of the irrigation scheme, which was relatively cooler for the 2nd
    season experiment. 4.2. Effect of irrigation scheduling on crop performance and
    water productivity Higher grain yields were recorded in the Practical method in
    both irrigation seasons, although, it was significant only in 2015/16. A significant
    biomass increase was also obtained in 2015 for the practical as compared to the
    other treatments. Over all, the practical method resulted in better crop performance
    as compared to the other treatments. Since land preparation, fertilizer application
    and other agronomic practices were the same for all treatments, it can be concluded
    that, the combined effect of the applied amount of irrigation water and interval
    created a favorable soil water environment for production of a greater amount
    of grain yield and overall better crop performance. Besides to lower grain yields,
    the Sophisticated and Traditional methods resulted in applying more water than
    the Practical method. Especially in the sophisticated method, about 218 mm (in
    2015) and 196 mm (in 2015/16) in excess of the practical method were applied.
    The practical method significantly increased the water productivity in both irrigation
    seasons compared to the other methods (Table 12). The finding of this study showed
    that, higher water productivities are associated with higher grain yields (Fig.
    2a) as well as lower total irrigation depths (Fig. 2b) in both irrigation seasons.
    These also confirms that there were over-irrigation in both the sophisticated
    and traditional methods. The higher amounts of applied water (especially in I1
    treatment) were mainly responsible for lower photosynthetic performance, through
    creation of aeration problem and other nutritional factors. According to Sakamoto
    et al. (2011), peak development stage of the corn is more sensitive to over-irrigation.
    And, over-irrigation could essentially prevent the plants from retaining nutrition
    required for its development. In a research conducted to quantify the impact of
    over-irrigation on maize yield in Nebraska, United States (Irmak, 2008) over-irrigation
    of maize to 125 percent of ETc resulted in yield reduction as compared with fully
    irrigated (100 percent ETc). Another study conducted in Limpopo, South Africa
    reported excessive irrigation water is among the factors for poor maize yields
    on farmer’s fields (Machethe et al., 2004). 4.3. Effect of irrigation schedules
    on soil salinization In both irrigation seasons at harvest (Table 11), lower surface
    (0–20 cm) soil salinity and in the succeeding profile (20–40 cm) higher soil salinity
    was observed in the practical compared to the other treatments. During harvest
    the salinity values presented in Table 11, generally indicated capillary salinization
    dominates compared to any potential leaching in the upper soil profiles of all
    treatments except for the practical treatment in 2015/16. As discussed in section
    3, surface water ponds were common in both the sophisticated and traditional treatments
    due to the higher application depths (in most of the irrigation events) and poor
    internal drainage of the clayey soil (Table 1).Thus, evaporative concentration
    of salts at the surface and capillary movement from the succeeding soil profile
    are among the likely major reasons for relatively higher surface salt concentration
    in both the sophisticated and traditional treatments. Due to similar reasons,
    Akhand and Al Araj (2013) found higher salts in the upper (0–25 cm) relative to
    the lower (25–50 cm) depth, which is in line with the finding of this research.
    According to a survey conducted in 2015/16 (in similar seasons) in the study area,
    Yohannes et al. (2017), also revealed that, farmers believed over-irrigation as
    the major cause for soil salinization in the irrigation scheme. On the other hand,
    in both irrigation seasons, the average root zone salinity was slightly lower
    in the sophisticated treatment. This indicates that despite the clayey textured
    soil, leaching seem to be relatively better in the sophisticated treatment. At
    planting of both irrigation seasons, the salt concentrations were lower in all
    treatments. This indicates that the effect of the rainy season decreases the salt
    concentration. Difference in salt concentration was also found between the irrigation
    seasons, which was over all lower in the 2nd season. This is attributed to the
    change in the planting date of the 2nd (a month earlier) experiment, which reduced
    the capillary movement of soluble salts, owing to relatively colder periods. Although
    a wide salinity tolerance exist among different maize cultivars (genotypes), as
    a general indication the yield potential under increasing salinity of water (ECi)
    and soil (ECe) is: 100% at ECi = 1.1 dS m−1 and ECe = 1.7 dS m-1, 90% at ECi = 1.7 dS
    m-1 and ECe = 2.5 dS m-1, and so on. During harvest the average root zone salinity
    found in all treatments were lower than 2.5 dS m-1 (the threshold for 90% yield
    potential), except in 2015 where slightly higher (2.57 dS m-1) salinity was found
    in the traditional treatment. According to various literatures (Farooq et al.,
    2015; Maas et al., 1983; Maas and Hoffman, 1976), maize is more sensitive to salinity
    at early stage (emergence and vegetative) than later growth stages (development
    of grain yield and yield components). Considering the good quality (0.45-0.67 dS m−1)
    of the irrigation water utilized and the obtained average root zone salinities
    which were lower at planting and higher at harvest (which is expected to be the
    maximum during the growing period due to gradual buildup of salts), the average
    root zone salinity in all treatments, will not generally significantly decrease
    the yield of maize, in both irrigation seasons. 4.4. Farmers'' and experts'' opinion
    While conducting the field experiments, many farmers had followed the entire progress
    cautiously in both irrigation seasons. Allowing farmers participation in on-farm
    research encourages information feedback between farmers and researches. It helps
    in identification of the limitations and requirements by the farmers in the selection
    of appropriate irrigation scheduling methods. The local farmers and extension
    agents were in favor of the practical approach. This result is more or less in
    agreement with the obtained results in section 3. In addition to water saving
    and better crop performance advantages, the major reason for selection of the
    practical approach was its convenience for farmers and water distributors due
    to the fixed interval and constant application. Local extension agents need easy
    scheduling methodology while farmers also demand for simple, practical and convenient
    calendars to achieve improved irrigation management at farm level (Clyma, 1996).
    Under low technology situations ICID/FAO (1995), simple and operational rules
    with fixed interval and constant water application are recommended. Other main
    concerns raised by the farmers were, skill and capacity of the WUA to provide
    such schedule. The WUAs in many countries need capacity building in technical
    and institutional issues to improve the performance of irrigation schemes (Ghazouani
    et al., 2012; Kazbekov et al., 2009; Mutambara et al., 2016; Thiruchelvam, 2010;
    The World Bank, 2006).Thus, building institutional capacity and technical skill
    of the WUA should be considered to arrange and enforce predetermined scheduling
    calendars. Based on continuous field observation, the farmers'' classification
    of the alternative irrigation scheduling techniques qualitatively and in their
    own local language in this study indicated that they are more or less capable
    of applying the desired amount of water roughly if allowed or participated in
    scheduling practices. 5. Conclusions Despite the availability of various scientific
    irrigation scheduling techniques, the adoption by farmers is poor mainly due the
    complexity of techniques, inaccessibility of soil-water monitoring tools, lack
    of local climatic and soil water data and absence of stakeholders’ participation.
    Using Hargreaves equation (which requires only temperature data for estimation
    of ET0) and based on the simple procedures for irrigation scheduling in Brouwer
    et al. (1989) as well as the local farmers'' and extension agents'' inputs, a
    simple scheduling calendar (Practical) for maize was tested and validated on-farm
    against CropWat (Sophisticated) simulated and farmers (Traditional) scheduling
    methods for two years (2015 and 2015/16) at Gumselassa irrigation scheme, North
    Ethiopia. The result of the study showed that, the practical approach resulted
    in higher grain yield, substantial saving in irrigation water amount and subsequently
    in significant improvement in water productivity as compared to the other approaches
    in both years. Although most of the farmers in the study area are illiterate or
    completed an elementary school level, they were surprisingly able to classify
    the alternative irrigation scheduling approaches based on the amount of applied
    water, qualitatively in their own local language. This leads to the conclusion
    that, if allowed/participated in scheduling practices, farmers are more or less
    capable of applying the desired amount of water roughly based on their observations.
    Overall, from results of the crop-stand ranking and opinions of the alternative
    approaches, the local farmers and experts were in favor of the practical approach.
    This also gives important information that if the beneficiaries are allowed/participated,
    they can be equipped with practical facts to judge alternative technologies from
    their own perspectives. For successful implementation of such simple irrigation
    calendar in a community managed irrigation schemes like Gumselassa, technical
    support and capacity building of the Water Users Associations, is required urgently,
    especially on arranging and synchronizing schedules at scheme level. In most rural
    areas of Ethiopia as well as in other similar countries, where climatic data are
    lacking or unreliable and the technology level of the farm is low, this technique
    can significantly improve the irrigation water management practices. Furthermore,
    local extension agents can practice and easily prepare irrigation calendars for
    different crops and planting dates following based on the Practical procedure.
    Moreover, researchers should build on and rectify on such simple procedures in
    different agro-hydrological environments, for wider use. This study also recommended
    the need for local climate studies as well as observations facilities in the vicinity
    of irrigation schemes of the rural areas so that they can have their own representative
    meteorological data and accurate scheduling. Acknowledgment The research was funded

    algorithmIrrigation schedulingExpert systems 1. Introduction Factors such as climate
    change, world population growth or the competition for water resources make freshwater
    availability a large and complex global challenge, mainly in those regions where
    rainfall is scarce and irregular. This is the case of Spain which nowadays devotes
    73% of its national freshwater to irrigate 3.65 M ha (INE, 2016). The expansion
    of irrigated land coupled with tourism and urbanization has created significant
    water supply pitfalls (García-Ruiz et al., 2011). Therefore, improving water use
    efficiency is a key to maintaining the sustainability of the irrigated agriculture.
    Related to this, water demand forecasting could be one of the main tools to improve
    the management of the irrigation districts and help managers in the decision-making
    processes. Previous research works focused on the prediction of water demand at
    irrigation district level, using neuro-genetic algorithms (González Perea et al.,
    2015, Pulido-Calvo and Gutiérrez-Estrada, 2009). However, forecasting water demand
    at individual farmer level is an extremely complex task. Apparently, and mainly
    in on-demand irrigation networks where water is continuously available to farmers,
    water demand is highly variable and apparently follows a pure random process.
    However, it depends on climatic factors such as evapotranspiration, climate and
    on other social and economic factors like local farmers’ practices, crops value
    or energy prices. Due to the high number of factors that intervene in the irrigation
    scheduling, the prediction of water demand is complex and the water demand forecasting
    models must consider several variables at the same time. As irrigation scheduling
    is the process of deciding when and how much to irrigate. González Perea et al.
    (2018) developed a prediction model of applied irrigation depth at farm level.
    However, the prediction of the occurrence of irrigation events should be the first
    step to build a robust water demand-forecasting model. The prediction of the irrigation
    event occurrence gives information in advance to the district managers about the
    potential flows during the hydraulic network at daily scale. Thus, managers can
    stablish different strategies for the optimization of the pumping station and
    the energy efficiency of the entire irrigation district. Nowadays, the new telemetry
    and data acquisition systems provide new possibilities that were not available
    in the past. Usually the irrigation districts continuously collect lots of information
    aimed at billing and rarely for improving the decision-making processes. However,
    big-data and artificial intelligence techniques are the right tools to integrate
    all these datasets, and extract useful information for managers and give an additional
    value and usefulness to systems installed in the field. Decision Tree methods,
    DT, have been widely used in machine learning, expert systems, and multivariate
    analysis. These DT have been applied to several fields of agriculture (Loureiro
    et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2017), operating rules for reservoirs (Kumar et al.,
    2013) or urban water distribution systems (Loureiro et al., 2016) but no previous
    works have been developed in the field of irrigation forecasting. The main limitations
    of DTs are the determination of the best algorithm to find the best split of the
    predictive model, the best decision tree architecture, and the decision about
    the use of cross-validation process. In most works, these variables are determined
    by trial and error so the achievement of an optimal solution is not warrantied.
    Aiming at overcoming this limitation, in this work a Genetic Algorithm (GA) has
    been used to optimize the different parameters that make up the Decision Tree.
    Therefore, a new methodology combining Decision Tress and Genetic Algorithm has
    been developed to model farmer’s behaviour and forecast the occurrence of irrigation
    events. The non-sorting multi-objective genetic algorithm, NSGA-II (Deb et al.,
    2002) has been used as GA and the predictive model has been implemented in MATLAB
    (Pratap, 2010). This methodology has been applied to a real irrigation district
    in Spain. 2. Methodology 2.1. Study area and data source The predictive model
    was developed and tested in Canal del Zujar Irrigation District (CZID), located
    in southwest of Spain. CZID is made up of ten independent hydraulic sectors and
    convers a total irrigated area of 21,141 ha. Among the ten sectorial networks,
    Sector II was selected for this study. This sector covers an irrigated area of
    2691 ha being the main crops tomato, maize and rice (90% of the total irrigated
    area). Drip irrigation is the irrigation method used in tomato and maize crops
    while rice is flood irrigated. A telemetry system operates in Sector II of the
    CZID to record hourly water consumption by means of flowmeters installed at hydrant
    level. This information is transmitted to the central offices using mobile communication
    technology. The water consumption records were aggregated at daily level in each
    hydrant for the 2015 irrigation season. In addition, at each hydrant, information
    about the crop type and the farm size were also recorded. The daily climatic data
    of maximum and average temperature (°C), average relative humidity (%), precipitation
    event (this input takes a value of 1 when occurs an event of precipitation), were
    obtained from the agroclimatic station placed in the irrigation sector. Thus,
    daily irrigation and daily climatic date from 1st January 2015 until 31st December
    2015 were used in this work. Julian day, weekday and bank holidays were additional
    input recorded for the same period. 2.2. Problem approach The development of a
    farmer’s behaviour model that predicts one-day ahead the daily occurrence of irrigation
    events, the first step in the irrigation scheduling process, is addressed in this
    work by decision trees and genetic algorithms. The occurrence of irrigation events
    is a binary decision and so the prediction model is converted into a binary classification
    problem (irrigation or non irrigation events). On the other hand, the main parameters
    that make up the architecture and the training process of a decision trees which
    are generally fixed by trial and error. In this work, they are optimized by the
    multiobjective genetic algorithm NSGA-II. 2.2.1. Decision trees A decision tree
    is a tree structure composed of internal and external nodes connected by branches,
    which divides the input set into mutually exclusive regions (i.e. the Julian day
    may divide the decision trees into several branches). Each of these regions is
    assigned a label, a value, or an action that characterizes its data points. The
    internal nodes, known as decision-making unit, assess a decision function to determine
    which child node to visit next. The nodes, which are associated with the labels
    (e.g. irrigation or non irrigation events) that characterize the given data, are
    known as leaves or terminal nodes (external nodes) and they have no child. The
    classical structure of a typical decision tree is shown in Fig. 1. Download :
    Download high-res image (204KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Classical
    structure of a decision tree. There are two main types of decision trees: regression
    and classification. The terminal node labels in regression trees are constants
    or equations that specify the forecasted output value of a given input vector.
    However, the leaf nodes of the decision trees in classification trees contain
    a label that indicates the group or class (J) (e.g. irrigation or non irrigation
    events) to which a given feature vector belongs. The farmer’s decision about to
    irrigate or not is a classification problem with two classes (J = 2), so a classification
    tree is used in this work. Thus, initially the vector composed of several attributes
    (the inputs set such as daily average temperature, Julian day or precipitation
    occurrence in the day of the irrigation event prediction) is presented to the
    first node (root node) of the classification tree. Then, the branching pattern
    is defined according to the decision function used. The offshoot continues until
    a leaf node is reached and a label (irrigation or non irrigation) is assigned
    to the given input data. The split algorithm of the classification tree determines
    the ramification process. There are several algorithms with different search procedures
    to find the best split on a categorical prediction (classification) during the
    training process. In this work, the four most widely used split algorithms have
    been considered. The first one, known as Exact (Breiman et al., 1993), considers
    all 2CatLevel-1 – 1 combinations of tree splitting, being CatLevel the number
    of categories or levels of a classification tree. The second algorithm used is
    named Pull Left By Purity (‘PLbyPurity’) (Breiman et al., 1993). It starts with
    all CatLevel on the right branch. Then, the algorithm moves each category to the
    left branch to achieve the minimum measure of error for the J-classes among the
    remaining levels. Finally, from this sequence, the algorithm chooses the data
    division that has the lowest measure of error. Principal Component-Based Partitioning
    (PCA) (Coppersmith et al., 1999) is the third algorithm. This algorithm finds
    a close-to-optimal binary partition of the CatLevel levels by searching for a
    separating hyperplane that is perpendicular to the first principal component of
    the weighted covariance matrix of the centred class probability matrix. The last
    split algorithm considered is One Versus All By Class (OVAC) (Breiman et al.,
    1993). It starts with all CatLevel levels on the right branch and for each of
    the J-classes, the algorithm orders the categories based on the probability of
    each class. An optimization procedure, in this case a genetic algorithm, is required
    to choose the best split algorithm for each data set. The selected split algorithm
    will affect the accuracy of the classification tree that will be tested with new
    data set (test set) in the testing process. 2.2.2. Error measurement and decision
    tree improvement An error measure, E(t), that computes the performance of a node
    t in separating data from different classes is necessary to grow the classification
    tree. The error function is generally referred as the impurity function. This
    function tends to zero when all data belong to the same class. By contrast, the
    impurity function takes the maximum value when the data are uniformly distributed
    through all classes. In this work, the Gini diversity index, (Breiman et al.,
    1984) has been used as impurity function and it is defined for J-classes as follow:
    (1) where p1, …, pJ are the probability that a case or data in a node belongs
    to class j. The accuracy of the classification tree can be improved using cross
    validation. Cross validation randomly divides the training data into k parts.
    Then, k new trees are trained and the accuracy of the forecasting process is validated
    with the k-1 data set not included in each k training. Finally, the last training
    (kth) gives the trained classification tree. However, this optimization technique
    is quite time consuming. Therefore, a balance between training time and model
    accuracy should be reached. Thus, in this work, the use or not of cross validation
    is one of the variables included in the optimization process. 2.2.3. Control of
    the classification tree depth A balance between simplicity and forecasting power
    must be considered during the development of a classification tree. A classification
    tree with many leaves is often highly accurate during the training process. However,
    a deep tree (trees which are made up by high number of internal branches and nodes)
    tends to overfit in the training process and the model accuracy decreases significantly,
    when new data are presented (testing process). In contrast, shadow trees (trees
    which are made up by small number of internal branches and nodes) do not achieve
    the highest accuracy during the training process, which can be achieved in the
    testing process. To avoid overfitting during de training process, the depth of
    the classification trees must be controlled. There are four classification tree
    characteristics to control the classification tree depth. The first one is to
    fix the maximum number of branch node splits per tree (MaxBranch), which is high
    in deep trees. Another characteristic is the minimum number of observations (e.g.
    days in the cropping season) per leaf (MinObsLeaf). Thus, the lower MinObsLeaf
    value, the deeper tree. The third characteristic is the minimum number of observations
    per branch node (MinObsBranch). This number is inversely proportional to the depth
    of the classification tree. The last classification tree characteristic to control
    the tree depth is the maximum categories or levels of the classification tree
    (MaxCatLevel). A large value of MaxCatLevel may increase the computation time
    and memory overload. However, a small value can cause a poor model accuracy. All
    these characteristics are often set up by default by the computer model used or
    they are stablished by trial and error. However, these values could compromise
    the accuracy and robustness of the predictive model. In this work, these four
    characteristics are variables considered in the optimization process. 2.2.4. Classification
    tree optimization with GA Classification trees can stablish the different regions
    that the input space may be classified into according to the assigned labels.
    However, there are several tree’s characteristics that are often chosen by trial
    and error causing a loss of efficiency, robustness or precision of the predictive
    model. Here, these tree’s characteristics are automatically determined and optimized
    by the multiobjetive GA, NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002). Thus, the optimization of
    the classification tree has been raised as a two-objective optimization problem.
    The first objective function, F1 maximizes the farmer’s decisions properly classified
    according to the Eq. (2): (2) where Misclasstest,i equals 1 when the farmer’s
    decision i is misclassified with respect to the observed farmer’s decision within
    the test set and Numclasstest is the total number of observations of the test
    set, i.e., the total number of farmer’s decisions included in the test set. The
    second objective function, F2 (Eq. (3)), minimizes the number of nodes that make
    up the classification tree. Thus, both computing time and the depth of the tree
    are minimized to maximize the efficiency and accuracy of the predictive model.
    (3) where numNodes is the total number of nodes of the classification tree. Fig.
    2 shows the flow chart of the optimization process of the classification tree.
    NSGA-II algorithm starts the optimization process by the random generation of
    an initial population of nPop size. Each chromosome of the initial population
    is composed of 6 genes or decision variables (the split algorithm of the classification
    tree, the use or not of Cross Validation and the four parameters needed to control
    the tree depth). Once the initial population is created, a classification tree
    (Classification treeChr i) is generated and trained from each chromosome. After
    this, every Classification treeChr i is tested by the test set and the objective
    functions F1 and F2 are calculated. Download : Download high-res image (579KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Flow chart of the optimization process
    of the classification tree. Then, the chromosomes are modified (crossover and
    mutation) and the fittest nPop decision trees are selected based on their objective
    function values. The process is repeated several generations (nGEN). Finally,
    the set of nPop optimal chromosomes obtained in the last generation define the
    Pareto Front. Table 1 shows the decision variables and its position (Gene) within
    the chromosome (Chr) as well as the ranges of values associated to each decision
    variables. A brief description of each decision variable is also shown in Table
    1. Frequently, MaxBranch equals 5 but this parameter depends on the input data
    and so it is difficult to fix it in advance. Thus, in this work, MaxBranch varies
    within a wider range, from 5 to 20. Similarly, MinObsLeaf, MinObsBranch and MaxCatLevel
    ranged from 20 to 100. Table 1. Decision variables of the NSGA-II GA. Decision

    Sector II is 649. After data processing, 627 hydrants were selected to develop
    the model of the daily farmer’s behaviour model (those hydrants without relevant
    information were removed from the analysis). Information about daily hydrant operation
    (whether farmer irrigates (1) o not (0)) each day of 2015 (365 days) was stored.
    Thus, a total number of 228,855 observations (irrigation events) were used in
    the analysis. From this data set, 183,084 observations were randomly selected
    for the training process (80% of the total observations) and the remaining 20%
    (45771 observations) were considered as test set. 3.1. Model inputs 8 input variables
    (Table 2) have been considered to define farmers’ behaviour within the predictive
    model. These variables are related to the irrigation process in the study area.
    The farmer’s decision about when it is necessary to apply water is related to
    the crop type (I1) and the Julian day (I2) that determines the phenological state
    of the plant and therefore its sensibility to the water stress. Bank holidays
    (I3) and the weekday (I4) are factors linked to social aspects of the study region.
    Daily maximum temperature (I5), daily average temperature (I6) and daily average
    relative humidity (I7) are variables related to the farmer’s warming sensation
    that also condition his/her decision. Finally, precipitation events (I8) has also
    been taken into, taking a false value when the precipitation in a day is null
    and vice versa. These input variables were selected according to the farmers behaviour
    in of the study area by several interviews with the irrigation district manager.
    The input variables are one of the main factors in the development process of
    a predictive model and they are characteristics of each study area. Therefore,
    although the methodology developed in this work is applicable to any study area,
    the input variables must be defined for each study area. Table 2. Input variables

    trees’ structure was optimized using the multiobjetive NSGA-II. 100 individuals
    (chromosomes) made up the random initial population that evolved for 500 generations
    evaluating F1 and F2. 90% and 10% were the probabilities considered for crossover
    and mutation. The Pareto front (generation 500) obtained in the optimization process
    and the computing time requirements in the training process are shown in Fig.
    3a and b. The Pareto font shows that objectives F1 and F2 are clearly conflicting.
    Thus, the higher depth of the classification trees (higher number of nodes), the
    higher the accuracy of the predictive model but the higher computing time requirements
    (Fig. 3b). The fastest classification tree (CT3), the most accurate classification
    tree (CT1) and one with intermediate results (CT2) were selected to analyse the
    results. The (CT1) correctly predicted 100% of the irrigation events in the test
    set requiring 13% more of computing time than (CT3) that could correctly forecast
    99.16% of the irrigation events in the test set. The results obtained by CT2 ranged
    between CT1 and CT3. Download : Download high-res image (252KB) Download : Download

    requirements in training process. All individuals of the Pareto front were trained
    with cross validation. Thus, the optimization process confirms that cross validation
    is essential to achieve the best results. 3.3. Optimal classification trees The
    setting parameters (genes) and objective function values of the three selected
    configurations are shown in Table 3. PCA algorithm was used by CT1 as split algorithm
    in the training process while OVAC and PLbyPurity were the split algorithms for
    CT2 and CT3, respectively. The Exact algorithm, which was commonly used by other
    authors in this sort of analysis, was not selected in any classification tree.
    The configurations obtained in the Pareto front highlights that the optimum number
    of categorical levels of the classification tree is small. The variation range
    for MaxCatLevel was from 5 to 20 and the optimal MaxCatLevel for CT1 and CT2 was
    5 and CT3 had 9 maximum categorical levels. MaxBranch was similar for CT1 (36)
    and CT2 (35) and slightly lower for CT3 (21). The results obtained for both MinObsLeaf
    and MinObsBranch parameters show that a minimum number of observations are necessary
    either by leaf or by branch. When the minimum number of observations per leaf
    is low, the minimum number of observation per branch is high. Thus, the values
    of MinObsLeaf and MinObsBranch were 20 and 78, respectively, for CT1 while these
    parameters were 82 and 20, respectively, for CT2 and for CT3 they were 31 and
    41, respectively. Table 3. Setting parameters (genes) and objective function values

    of each classification tree, Table 4a–c shows the confusion matrix for CT1, CT2
    and CT3, respectively. Confusion matrix is a specific table layout where each
    column of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class while each
    row represents the instances in an actual class. Thus, CT1 was the most accurate
    model with the 100% of the successful irrigation events. Therefore, the number
    of false positive and false negative were 0. The global precision of CT2 was 99.61%.
    However, this index is sometime misleading and the dimensions of the classes should
    be analysed. The test set contained 9250 positive irrigation events, in other
    words, the farmer decided 9250 times to apply irrigation water. CT2 classified
    as no irrigation 2544 positive irrigation events (false negative) and 2689 negative
    irrigation events as positive irrigation events (false positive). Hence, although
    the global accuracy of the classification model was 99.61%, CT2 rightly classified
    the 73% of the positive irrigation events and the 93% of the total negative irrigation
    events. Similarly, CT3 classified the 32% of the positive irrigation events as
    false negative and only the 7% was classified as false positive. 80% of the total
    irrigation events were negative irrigation events in both training and test data
    sets, consequently, CT2 and CT3 learnt better to forecast negative than positive
    irrigation events. This limitation of the classification tree could be overcome
    adding more observations to the training set or limiting the training set to the
    days of the effective irrigation season (set days with positive irrigation events),
    avoiding days without irrigation. Table 4. Confusion matrix for CT1 (a), CT2 (b)

    and CT3 are shown in Fig. 4a, b and c, respectively. The highest tree depth was
    CT1 with the highest number of nodes. The three figures show that the input variables
    I3 (Bank holiday), I7 (daily average humidity) and I8 (Precipitation occurrence)
    were not included in the classification trees. Therefore, although the input variables
    in this work were previously discussed with farmers, the predictive model shows
    that these three variables are not significant to forecast the occurrence of daily
    irrigation events. Probably, the input variables I2 (Julian day) and the weekday
    (I4) implicitly include the input variable I3 (Bank holiday). Similarly, the maximum
    and average temperature are connected to the relative humidity and the classification
    tree found this relationship. Finally, although I8 should be important in irrigation
    scheduling, the classification tree did not link it with the irrigation decision.
    It may be explained by the lack of rainfall in the central months of the year
    (typical in the Mediterranean climate), when most of the irrigation events occur
    so this variable becomes irrelevant. Download : Download high-res image (271KB)

    strategies and tools to improve water use efficiency. Modelling farmers’ behaviour
    would help irrigation district managers to achieve an integrated management of
    the irrigation district based on the prediction of the occurrence of irrigation
    events, that will aid to set the optimum operational point of the pumping station
    as well as to hire the most convenient electrical tariff on futures markets. In
    this work, decision trees were successfully used as classification models to forecast
    when farmers irrigate. The use of optimal decision trees obtained from a multi-objective
    genetic algorithm provides successful predictions of when farmers irrigate when
    they are applied to a real case study. In the case study, the optimal classification
    models predicted properly between 99.16% and 100% of the given data test set.
    This global index of model accuracy can sometime be misleading and an assessment
    of the accuracy of each class should be analysed. The classification models predicted
    between 68% and 100% of the positive irrigation events and between 93% and 100%
    of the negative irrigation events. This work represents the first step in the
    prediction of the irrigation scheduling at farm level, defined by when, how much
    and for how long to irrigate. So, it focuses on the prediction of when irrigation
    events occur. By knowing the occurrence of the irrigation event one-day ahead,
    with the accuracy of the model developed in this work, it is possible to optimize
    the energy efficiency adjusting every day the pumping station operation. Thus,
    the energy cost of the entire irrigation district might be reduced maximizing
    the agricultural productivity, and sustainability of the irrigation district.
    This model also allows to know, one-day ahead, each operational zone of the irrigation
    network. Thus, managers might optimize the scheduling of the maintenance tasks
    with minimal impacts on the farms located in each working area. However, future
    research should be devoted to the development of models to fully predict the irrigation
    scheduling at farm level, including irrigation depths and timing. Acknowledgments

    IEEE Conference Location: Mumbai, India SECTION I. Introduction It is rightly
    said by researchers that Indian poverty rate can be decreased three times faster
    by investment in only one field i.e. agriculture rather than investing in IT,
    infrastructure, education etc.. It is estimated that by next 30 years, the agriculture
    with the help of Internet of Things will increase food production by seventy percent
    and will be able to feed up to 9.6 billion people. The challenges of rising climate
    change and extreme weather conditions has to be set against the demand for more
    food, with the natural impact affected by exhaustive farming practices. Thus appropriate
    water supply is a necessity in agriculture; crops can be either soiled by either
    water surplus or scarcity. Proposed system has capability to save over 189 billion
    liters of fresh water in a year. There are intelligent pest Management and Control
    systems that can monitor pests remotely. This would propose farmers what type
    of pesticide to be used and in exact quantity. The farmers can now seek the fruits
    of his yields and protect his fields with no worrying about precision. Sometimes
    farmers are not even aware of how much pesticide to be used, which will result
    in over usage of chemicals and hence making it toxic for human utilization. Farmers
    can now use pest control sensors such as acoustic sensor to predict pest behavior.
    Proposed architecture will be helpful in controlling the damage done by pests
    on a large scale by the use of acoustic sensor. Impact of Misuse of agricultural
    fertilizers on the environment needs to be minimized which has have undoubtedly
    occurred. It is an inevitable to understand fertilizer and its essential role
    in high-yielding crops. Crop fertilizer Management can boost crop productivity,
    which will be a major move and a benefit for farmers. Exact amount and type of
    fertilizer can be provided to individual plant according to its personal need.
    Microwave ovens, train systems, robots, appliances, and many other applications
    are currently using fuzzy logic controllers. Technology such as Internet of Things
    combined with agriculture is one such sector, which if collaborated with can result
    into low-priced yet efficient methods for agriculture, which in turn will give
    rise to higher quality produce. Proposed approach to agriculture is still underdevelopment
    and unknown; hence it is high time to take a get into this direction. Proposed
    algorithm considers all the former factors and guarantees irrigation at critical
    depletion. Hence, no water stress occurs. Proposed System uses best possible set
    of sensors to compute the prediction and recommendation. Water wastage will never
    take place also opening and closing water gates in an effective manner through
    farmer''s smart phones apps will be a better solution. With the help of sensors
    attached on the water sluice gates, farmers can able to do a trend comparison
    analysis. SECTION II. Literature Review Wireless sensor network has been used
    in agriculture with the fuzzy logic to support irrigation management at North
    Italy for vineyard was proposed by F. Viani, M Bertonni and A. Polo considering
    soil potential water scarcity and rain level parameter[1]. Smart water irrigation

    exact estimation of amount of water usage by Pushkar Singh and Sanghamitra Sikia[8].
    Author Navin Srivastava, Gautam Chopra and Prateek Jain has used acoustic Device
    wireless sensor to acknowledge pest predicted frequency and suitable action can
    be taken by farmer once frequency crosses a threshold level[2]. Decision support

    and control techniques using wireless sensor network was served by Saeed Azfar
    and Adnan Nadeem [6] based on their effectiveness and cost. Richard W. Mankin,
    Clayton W. McCoy and Kathy L. Flanders have mentioned Methods using Acoustic sensor
    for detection of populations of pest through the sounds or vibrations. This method
    detect insect pests lying underground [7]. Arduino-is used for smart irrigation
    having sensors like ESP8266 WiFi module, soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor
    and water flow sensor is proposed by Pushkar Singh and Sanghamitra Sikia in paper[8].
    Sarika Datir and Sanjeev Wagh, has proposed method in monitoring and detection
    of agricultural disease using Wireless Sensor Network published in International
    Journal of Computer Applications [9]. IOT Based Automatic Drip Irrigation System
    using various sensor is implemented and discussed by Ameya Bhale, Suryakant Sawant
    and Surya Durbha at IIT Bombay [10]. SECTION III. Proposed System Monitoring plant,
    soil conditions and weather state together can give attractive returns on investment
    for farmers utilizing sensing technology. Various sensor usage for capturing soil
    moisture and nutrimental values, optimal plant growth by controlling water usage,
    fertilizer necessities for current crop and finally determining custom fertilizer
    profiles based on soil chemistry are the key feature of proposed model. Symphony
    Link i.e. Star topologies are an perfect match to place sensors in field, reason
    being one access point can communicate to a number of sensors 20–100 square kilometers
    away. DSS with IOT design for water monitoring, fertilizer and pesticide recommendation
    approach which supports internet based real time data (environmental factors)
    collection to formulate, estimate and automate individual crop watering and nutrition
    requirement considering human expert opinion learning through feedback provided.
    A. Proposed Architecture Proposed system architecture is shown in Figure1. with
    two main modules preprocessing and prediction. Data collection phase collects
    data from sensor about crop, soil and weather. In preprocessing various soil and
    weather parameters are used for further complex computation. Prediction phase
    involves algorithm for prediction of three main components for plant growth i.e.
    fertilizer, water and pesticide. Fig. 1. System architcture. Show All 1) Preprosessing
    Collected data is preprocessed using computational maodel before sending it to
    decision support system. a) Estimtion of Evapotranspiration ET is a critical parameter
    which determines the quantity of water to be provided through irrigation. Various
    climatologically parameters should be considered when evaluating reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo),[] which are: air temperature, sunlight and heat index. Thomthwaite''s Method
    equation is considered as a standard method for determining evapotranspiration
    shown in equation [1]. ET=1.6La(10T/I)2 (1) View Source Where, ET = Evapotranspiration
    L a = Number of Hours of Sunlight and days in a month T = Mean monthly air Temperature
    in degree Celsius I = Total of 12 monthly values of heat index i. b) Soil Classifier
    Estimation of the soil water content is a complex task since the Properties of
    the soil are highly variable in space and a large set of experiments are required
    to properly characterize the soil response to rain and irrigation. In this sense,
    a finite set of predefined soils already characterized in the state of the art
    have been considered as a-priori information of a soil classifier using USDA soil
    classification used to estimate the soil water quantity [1]. c) Water Retention
    Ratio Dielectric sensor woks superb in very homogeneous soil media like sand or
    rock wool. However, mostly they require a soil specific calibration and are inclined
    to soil heterogeneity. Excess or gravitational water drains quickly from the soil
    after a heavy rain because of gravitational forces (saturation point to field
    capacity). Crop mostly use very little amounts of this water before it moves out
    of the root zone. After the excess water has drained, available water is preserved
    in the soil (this is known as field capacity to wilting point). This water is
    the highly important for crop production. Plants can use almost 50 percent from
    it without having stress. Unavailable water is soil moisture which is seized so
    tightly by the soil that it cannot be extracted by the plant. Water availability
    is illustrated in the figure 2 by water levels in three different soil types.
    Fig. 2. Water retention ratio claculation Show All d) Nutritional Deficiency Predictior
    The nutrients present in the soil will change over a period of time thereby reducing
    the yield/crop. NPK sensor can calculate Nitrogen, Potassium and Phosphorus level
    in the soil. Soil PH, NPK level, crop growth can be considered to decide nutritional
    deficiency of soil which will further help in decide water soluble customized
    fertilizer recommending. 2) Decision Support System Human experience is utilized
    in designing the system model is made possible by the use of fuzzy logic, which
    is used to frame the solution to a problem in easily understandable manner. Parameters
    from preprocessing values will act as membership values which will be applied
    to membership function to get the alpha-cut set. Neuro Fuzzy Rule base will be
    fired to get output rule. Output rule is then cut by alpha cut-set to get several
    trapezoidal shapes. The defuzzification is done using Mamdani Suzeno 3Center of
    Gravity over the area to decide is there need to irrigate. Mamdani Suzeno model
    can be used due to its suitability to optimization, adaptive techniques, and mathematical
    analysis. It is given by the formula in equation [2]: Y= Σ n i=0 (Wi∗Zi) Σ n i=0
    Wi (2) View Source Where Wi is the output membership value of every rule, Zi is
    a weight coupled with every rule, N is total number of rules in rule base, and
    Y is the defuzzified output. If irrigation is required then exact quantity will
    be predicted by fuzzy controller. 3) Irrigation Planner After deciding exact quantity
    of water for irrigation, entire water quantity can be watered at one stretch.
    Irrigation planner decides the schedule for watering the decided quantity. Schedule
    consists of interval for irrigation and quantity based on the knowledge of irrigation
    strategy and equipments used i.e.drip irrigation or sprinkler irrigation. Output
    of irrigation planner is then given to relays to control solenoid valve positions.
    Figure 3 elaborates the irrigation planner working using Neuro Fuzzy Controller
    shown in Figure 3. Fig. 3. Irrigition interval planner. Show All 4) Dieases Prediction
    and Recommendation Pests can be monitored remotely by intelligent monitoring systems.
    These systems are capable enough to propose farmers what type of pesticide to
    be used and in exact quantity. The farmers can now seek the fruits of his yields
    and protect his fields with no worrying about precision. Sometimes farmers are
    not even aware of how much pesticide to be used, which will result in over usage
    of chemicals and hence making it toxic for human utilization. Farmers can now
    use pest control sensors such as acoustic sensor to predict pest behavior. Proposed
    architecture will be helpful in controlling the damage done by pests on a large
    scale by the use of acoustic sensor. The input membership function to identify
    particular pest is by its frequency spectral template, time of occurrences and
    geographic distribution. a) Pest Training Pest generally generate specific sount
    for 2 to 300ms to communicate with each other. They make noise when they make
    movement or while feeding.100 to 200 such sounds can be averaged to find sound
    frequency spectral template of each pest or insect. Other parameter for pest prediction
    training is genration of probability distribution function for time of occurance
    of pest. The probability of detecting a sound by a specific species of insects
    and at a precise time of a day is recorded in Probability distribution function
    which is an array denoting these values. The sound frequency of insects can be
    recorded by acaustic. Third membership function is the geographic distribution
    of the species of interest. This data can be collected from historical records,
    from relevant literature or simply from field technicians or biologists. b) Pest
    Detection Algorithm In real time recorded signal from acaustic sensor is acting
    as a input to pset detection algorithm. Use a 0.01 sec long sliding window on
    amplified recorded input real time signal. If the fundamental frequency is within
    the range then save the occurrence time of the current window. Remove noise present
    in the interested part of recording. Extract truncated frequency spectrum. Move
    the sliding 0.1 sec forward. Repeat the procedure till you reach the end of recorded
    signal. Given the geographic location where the insect sound was intercepted,
    compute the probability of observing an insect from class at that specific location
    using the graphic distribution of species shown in Figure 4. Fig. 4. Irrigition
    interval planner. Show All c) Insect Classification Use the fuzzy Controller to
    classify an unknown insect. use FL based Classification that classifies an object
    to its most probable class.firstly identifing Time of occurances time of insect
    sound. This can be achieved by obtaining the occurrence time of each sound from
    the detection results. The probability of detecting a sound by a specific species
    of insects and at a precise time of a day is recorded in Probability distribution
    function which is an array denoting these values. So once a time is given, one
    can simply check the array to get the probability. Insect Geographic Distribution
    by identifying Spread of Diease on various geographical Location of Diease. And
    then defuzzifying the values to get the correct insect classification. SECTION
    IV. Result and Discurssion Input membership function for water need prediction
    is temperature, soil moisture and humidity. Input membership function for pest
    prediction is recorded sound frequency, geographic location and occurrence of
    time. In the same way Input membership function for custom fertilizer prediction
    is soil NPK value, crop type and soil PH value. Few examples of membership function
    are in Figure 5 which shows input membership function for calibration of weather
    temperature. Fig. 5. Input membership function(temprature) Show All Fig. 6 Input
    membership function(soil moisture) Show All Figure 6 shows input membership function
    for soil Moisture. Figure 7 demonstrates output membership function for duration
    for watering through fuzzy inference engine. Fig. 7. Output membership function(watering
    duration) Show All Figure 8 shows the graphical user interface of Agro-Vendor
    Application in farmers smart phone which would help in increasing the probability
    of getting good deal for their product. Also the weather and soil data at regular
    interval will be send on cloud to made it available for further research and survey
    purpose. Farmer and vendor will be users of this application interface Farmer
    can register, send product data, upload real time soil data, see vendor quotation
    and select the best deal. Agro-Vendor can get notification from various farmer
    about their product. After analyzing it with market survey he can send quotations
    to farmers. Fig. 8 Agro farmer vender app(features) Show All SECTION IV. Conclusion
    Recommendation of water soluble pesticide, fertilizer and water need prediction
    for individual plant. Efficient water management is innovative method. Proposed
    system is easy to use comparatively low cost, automated water sector -flow rate
    measuring and encourage water conservation. Proposed system is scalable with input
    membership functions. Propose system can be expanded further for bill generation

  description: Soil serves a medium for plants growth. One factor that affects soil
    moisture is drought. Drought has been a major cause of agricultural disaster.
    Agricultural drought is said to occur when soil moisture is insufficient to meet
    crop water requirements, resulting in yield losses. In this research, it aimed
    to characterize soil moisture level for Rice and Maize Crops using Arduino and
    applying fuzzy logic. System architecture for soil moisture sensor and water pump
    were the basis in developing the equipment. The data gathered was characterized
    by applying fuzzy logic. Based on the results, applying fuzzy logic in validating
    the characterization of soil moisture level for Rice and Maize crops is accurate
    as attested by the experts. This will help the farmers in monitoring the soil
    moisture level of the Rice and Maize crops.

  description: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of improved fuzzy comprehensive
    method in the evaluation of regulated deficit drip irrigation scheduling in solar
    greenhouse. An experiment was conducted in a solar greenhouse from March to July,
    2015 and 2016 at Xinxiang Comprehensive Experimental Station, Chinese Academy
    of Agriculture Sciences (35°09' N, 113°05' E and altitude 78.7 m). The experimental
    soil was loam at 0-80 cm and sandy loam at 80-100 cm. The solar greenhouse frame
    had a steel frame, covering an area of 510 m2 (60 m by 8.5 m). The roof of solar
    greenhouse was covered with 2.5-cm thick cotton wadding and the heat-insulating
    materials were embedded in the wall to maintain the interior temperature. Irrigation
    scheduling was determined based on the accumulated evaporation in a standard pan
    in the diameter of 20 cm. The experiment was designed with full irrigation (0.9
    times of the accumulated pan evaporation), mild water deficit (0.7 times of the
    accumulated pan evaporation) and moderate water deficit (0.5 times of the accumulated
    pan evaporation) in the flowering and fruit setting stage and the mature picking
    stage. There were 18 plots, and the plot area was 8.8 m2 (8.0 m by 1.1 m). The
    crop growth index, yield index, water consumption index and quality index of drip-irrigated
    tomato were evaluated by using the improved fuzzy comprehensive method. The weight
    was obtained by 10 expert's scores. The results showed that the crop growth index,
    yield index and water consumption index of tomato increased with the irrigation
    amount without considering the water deficit at different stages, but the quality
    index was decreased. Effect of the mild water deficit on quality index was weak,
    and the comprehensive evaluation index of growth index and yield index in the
    mature picking stage was higher than that in the flowering and fruit setting stage,
    while the crop evapotranspiration and irrigation amount over the whole growth
    stage of the former was lower. For the mild deficit irrigation for both growing
    stages, the quality comprehensive evaluation index was similar (0.135 and 0.138,
    and 0.125 and 0.124). For the moderate water deficit, the comprehensive evaluation
    index of growth index, yield index and quality index in the flowering and fruit
    setting stage was similar to that in the mature picking stage, but the crop evapotranspiration
    over the whole growth stage of the latter was lower. Therefore, for the drip-irrigated
    tomato in solar greenhouse, the mild water deficit in the mature picking stage
    should be recommended to the region with abundant water resource, while for the
    region with limited water resource, the moderate water deficit in the flowering
    and fruit setting stage should be applied. The improved fuzzy comprehensive evaluation
    method was recommended as a basis for evaluating regulated deficit irrigation
    system of drip-irrigated tomato in solar greenhouse.

    cm标准蒸发皿的累积蒸发量，分别在开花坐果期和成熟采摘期进行充分灌溉、轻度亏缺和中度亏缺，采用改进的模糊综合评判模型，对调亏灌溉制度温室番茄的生长指标、产量指标、耗水指标和品质指标进行综合评价。结果表明：不考虑阶段水分亏缺条件下，番茄的生长指标、产量指标和蒸发蒸腾量指标均随灌水量的增大而增大，品质指标则相反。轻度亏缺对番茄品质指标的影响较小（两者的品质综合评判指数为0.135和0.138，0.125和0.124），采摘期轻度亏缺的生长指标和产量指标的综合评判指数高于花果期轻度亏缺处理，且全生育期蒸发蒸腾量较低；花果期中度亏缺的产量指标和品质指标的综合评判指数与采摘期中度亏缺相近，但前者的总蒸发蒸腾量低于后者。因此，推荐水资源充足地区可采用在成熟采摘期轻度亏缺的灌溉模式，而水资源短缺地区采用在开花坐果期中度亏缺的灌溉模式。研究可为温室调亏滴灌制度的优化提供参考。   关键词:

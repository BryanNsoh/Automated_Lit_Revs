    \ \n1. Introduction\nSmart farming, also known as precision agriculture, is an\
    \ innovative approach to agricultural practices that leverages \nadvanced technologies\
    \ to optimize efficiency, productivity, and sustainability in farming operations\
    \ [1]-[4]. As shown \nin Fig. 1, it involves the integration of various technologies,\
    \ such as Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), \ndata analytics,\
    \ robotics, and remote sensing, to make informed decisions and automate processes\
    \ in agricultural \nsystems. The primary goal of smart farming is to enhance crop\
    \ production, minimize resource waste, reduce \nenvironmental impact, and improve\
    \ overall profitability. By utilizing a network of interconnected devices and\
    \ sensors \n[5], farmers can collect real-time data on various factors such as\
    \ soil moisture levels, weather conditions, crop health, \nand pest infestations.\
    \ This data is then analyzed to provide actionable insights, allowing farmers\
    \ to make data-driven \ndecisions and implement precise interventions [6]-[8].\
    \ \nOne of the key components of smart farming is the use of IoT devices and sensors.\
    \ These devices are deployed \nthroughout the farmland to monitor and control\
    \ different variables [8]-[11]. For instance, soil moisture sensors can \nprovide\
    \ information about the water requirements of crops, enabling farmers to apply\
    \ water precisely where and when \nit is needed, reducing water wastage. Similarly,\
    \ weather stations and satellite imagery can offer accurate and localized \nweather\
    \ data, helping farmers optimize planting schedules and manage crop diseases.\
    \ \nAccording to [12], artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in smart farming\
    \ by analyzing the collected data and \nproviding intelligent recommendations.\
    \ Machine learning algorithms can identify patterns and correlations in the data,\
    \ \nenabling predictive models for crop growth, pest outbreaks, and yield estimation\
    \ [13]-[16]. This information assists \nfarmers in making informed decisions regarding\
    \ the optimal use of fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs, leading to \n\
    improved resource management and reduced environmental impact. As explained in\
    \ [17], robots and drones can be \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews,\
    \ 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1208 \nutilized in smart farming to automate labor-intensive\
    \ tasks. Robots can perform activities like seeding, weeding, and \nharvesting\
    \ with precision and efficiency, reducing the need for manual labor and increasing\
    \ productivity [18]-[20]. As \nshown in Fig.2, drones equipped with cameras and\
    \ sensors [21] can gather high-resolution images and collect data over \nlarge\
    \ areas, helping farmers monitor crop health, detect early signs of diseases or\
    \ nutrient deficiencies, and identify \nareas requiring attention. \n \nFigure\
    \ 1 Typical smart agriculture scenario \n \nFigure 2 Drones in smart agriculture\
    \ \nResearchers in [22] point out that smart agriculture relies on various sensors\
    \ to collect real-time data about \nenvironmental conditions, crop health, soil\
    \ characteristics, and livestock parameters. These sensors provide critical \n\
    insights that enable farmers to make informed decisions and optimize farming practices.\
    \ As shown in Fig. 3, examples \nof sensors commonly used in smart agriculture\
    \ include weather sensors, soil moisture sensors, soil pH sensors, nutrient \n\
    sensors, crop health sensors, light sensors, livestock monitoring sensors, water\
    \ quality sensors, gas sensors and insect \ntraps sensors. Here, weather sensors\
    \ measure atmospheric conditions such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind\
    \ \nspeed, and solar radiation [23]–[26]. They help farmers understand weather\
    \ patterns, predict storms, and optimize \nirrigation schedules based on evapo-transpiration\
    \ rates. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors measure the water \ncontent\
    \ in the soil, allowing farmers to monitor [27] soil moisture levels and determine\
    \ irrigation needs. These sensors \nhelp prevent overwatering or underwatering,\
    \ optimize water usage, and prevent water stress in crops. However, soil \npH\
    \ sensors measure the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. By monitoring soil pH,\
    \ farmers can determine the soil's nutrient \navailability and adjust soil amendments\
    \ accordingly [28]. Maintaining optimal pH levels is crucial for healthy plant\
    \ \ngrowth and nutrient uptake. As explained in [29], nutrient sensors measure\
    \ the concentration of essential nutrients in \nthe soil, such as nitrogen, phosphorus,\
    \ and potassium. These sensors provide valuable data for precise fertilizer \n\
    application, ensuring that crops receive the right amount of nutrients for optimal\
    \ growth and yield. On the other hand, \ncrop health sensors detect indicators\
    \ of plant stress, diseases, and pests [30]. They can measure parameters such\
    \ as leaf \ntemperature, chlorophyll content, and vegetation indices to assess\
    \ crop health and detect early signs of disease or pest \ninfestation. This data\
    \ helps farmers take timely preventive measures and implement targeted pest management\
    \ \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n\
    1209 \nstrategies. On their part, light sensors measure the intensity and quality\
    \ of light in the crop canopy [31]. They provide \ninformation about photosynthetic\
    \ activity, plant growth stages, and light requirements. This data helps optimize\
    \ \nlighting conditions in controlled environment agriculture (CEA) systems, such\
    \ as greenhouses or vertical farms. On the \nother hand, livestock monitoring\
    \ sensors are used to track parameters related to animal health and well-being\
    \ [32]. For \nexample, temperature sensors [33] can monitor body temperature,\
    \ activity sensors can track animal movement, and \nrumen pH sensors can assess\
    \ digestive health in ruminant animals. Livestock sensors enable early detection\
    \ of health \nissues and support proactive animal management. \n \nFigure 3 Smart\
    \ agriculture \nWater quality sensors measure parameters such as pH, dissolved\
    \ oxygen, conductivity, and turbidity in irrigation water \nsources or aquaculture\
    \ systems [34]. Monitoring water quality ensures that crops or aquatic organisms\
    \ receive clean \nand suitable water, preventing adverse effects on plant health\
    \ or aquatic ecosystems. However, gas sensors detect and \nmeasure the concentration\
    \ of gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or ethylene, which are important indicators\
    \ of plant \nrespiration and ripening processes [35]. Gas sensors can be used\
    \ to optimize storage conditions and shelf life of \nharvested crops. On their\
    \ part, insect traps equipped with sensors and lures capture and monitor insect\
    \ populations \n[36]. These sensors help farmers assess pest infestation levels,\
    \ identify specific pest species, and implement targeted \npest management strategies.\
    \ These sensors, among others, provide critical data points that enable farmers\
    \ to monitor \nand manage agricultural systems effectively. Integrating sensor\
    \ data with advanced analytics and decision support \nsystems empowers farmers\
    \ to optimize resource allocation, improve crop yields, and make informed decisions\
    \ for \nsustainable and efficient farming practices. \nIn a nutshell, smart farming\
    \ holds great promise for transforming agriculture into a more sustainable and\
    \ productive \nindustry. By harnessing the power of technology and data, farmers\
    \ can optimize their operations, improve crop yields, \nconserve resources, minimize\
    \ environmental impact, and contribute to global food security in a rapidly evolving\
    \ world.  \nIn this paper, an extensive review of the current status of smart\
    \ agriculture technologies and their security posture is \ngiven. Towards the\
    \ end of this paper, some research gaps are identified which needs to be filled\
    \ by future researches.  \n2. Need for smart agriculture \nSmart agriculture,\
    \ or precision agriculture, is increasingly becoming a necessity due to several\
    \ pressing challenges and \nneeds in the agricultural sector. Table 1 discusses\
    \ some key reasons why smart agriculture is crucial. \n \n \nWorld Journal of\
    \ Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1210 \nTable 1 Necessity\
    \ of smart agriculture \nNecessity \nDiscussion \nResource Scarcity \nResources\
    \ such as water, land, and energy are limited and face increasing pressure due\
    \ to \npopulation growth and climate change [37]. Smart agriculture enables precise\
    \ resource \nmanagement, minimizing waste and maximizing the efficient [38] use\
    \ of inputs like water, \nfertilizers, and energy. \nCost Optimization \nTraditional\
    \ farming practices often involve overuse or misuse of inputs, leading to higher\
    \ \ncosts [39]. Smart agriculture allows farmers to make data-driven decisions,\
    \ optimizing the \nuse of fertilizers, pesticides, and water, thereby reducing\
    \ costs and increasing profitability \n[40]. \nLabor Efficiency and \nSafety \n\
    Farm labor shortages are a significant challenge in many regions. Smart agriculture\
    \ \nintroduces automation and robotics, reducing the reliance on manual labor\
    \ for tasks such \nas planting, weeding, and harvesting. This not only improves\
    \ efficiency [43] but also \nenhances worker safety by minimizing exposure to\
    \ hazardous conditions. \nClimate Change and \nEnvironmental \nSustainability\
    \ \nClimate change impacts agriculture through extreme weather events, changing\
    \ rainfall \npatterns, and the spread of pests and diseases. Smart agriculture\
    \ helps farmers adapt to \nclimate change by providing real-time data on weather\
    \ conditions, enabling timely \ninterventions, and reducing environmental impact\
    \ through optimized resource usage [44], \n[45]. \nTraceability \nand \nQuality\
    \ Assurance \nConsumers are increasingly concerned about the origin and quality\
    \ of the food they \nconsume [46], [47]. Smart agriculture technologies enable\
    \ improved traceability [48], \nallowing farmers to track the entire supply chain,\
    \ ensure food safety, and provide \ntransparent information to consumers. \nData-Driven\
    \ Decision \nMaking \nSmart agriculture generates vast amounts of data through\
    \ sensors, drones, and satellite \nimagery [49], [50]. Analyzing this data using\
    \ AI and data analytics helps farmers gain \nvaluable insights, make informed\
    \ decisions, and optimize farming practices for better \noutcomes [51]. \nPopulation\
    \ \nGrowth \nand Food Demand \nThe global population is projected to reach 9.7\
    \ billion by 2050, which will significantly \nincrease the demand for food. Smart\
    \ agriculture offers a way to increase agricultural \nproductivity and efficiency\
    \ to meet this growing demand [52]. \nCrop Monitoring and \nManagement \nSmart\
    \ agriculture technologies enable continuous monitoring [53] of crops, including\
    \ \nfactors like soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels. This data-driven\
    \ approach helps \nfarmers detect crop stress, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies\
    \ early on, allowing timely \ninterventions and reducing crop losses [54], [55].\
    \ \n \nBasically, the need for smart agriculture arises from the need to address\
    \ challenges such as population growth, resource \nscarcity, climate change, cost\
    \ optimization, and labor efficiency. By integrating advanced technologies, smart\
    \ agriculture \noffers the potential to transform traditional farming practices\
    \ into more sustainable, productive, and environmentally \nfriendly systems. \n\
    2.1. Technologies driving smart agriculture \nSmart agriculture is driven by various\
    \ technologies that enable advanced monitoring, automation, and decision-making\
    \ \nin agricultural practices. These technologies play a crucial role in optimizing\
    \ resource management, improving crop \nyields, and enhancing overall efficiency\
    \ in farming operations. Some of the prominent key driving technologies in smart\
    \ \nagriculture are presented in Fig. 4 and are discussed in the sub-sections\
    \ below. \n2.1.1. Internet of Things (IoT) \nIoT technology forms the backbone\
    \ of smart agriculture by connecting physical devices and sensors to the internet,\
    \ \nenabling data collection and remote monitoring [56]-[58]. IoT devices such\
    \ as weather stations, soil moisture sensors, \nand crop health sensors provide\
    \ real-time data on environmental conditions, plant growth, and livestock health.\
    \ This \ndata enables farmers to make data-driven decisions and optimize resource\
    \ allocation [59]. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03),\
    \ 1207–1231 \n1211 \n \nFigure 4 Key technological drivers for smart agriculture\
    \ \n2.1.2. Remote Sensing and Satellite Imaging \nRemote sensing technologies,\
    \ including satellite imaging and aerial drones, provide valuable insights into\
    \ crop health, \nwater stress, and pest infestation [60]-[62]. These technologies\
    \ capture high-resolution images and multispectral data, \nallowing farmers to\
    \ monitor large agricultural areas and detect anomalies or crop stress indicators.\
    \ Remote sensing \nhelps in early pest detection, disease prevention, and precision\
    \ agriculture practices. \n2.1.3. Big Data Analytics \nThe ability to process\
    \ and analyze large volumes of data is vital in smart agriculture. Big data analytics\
    \ techniques \nextract meaningful insights from various data sources, including\
    \ weather data, soil data, sensor data, and historical crop \nrecords [63]-[67].\
    \ By analyzing this data, farmers can gain valuable insights into crop performance,\
    \ predict yield \noutcomes, optimize irrigation and fertilization, and identify\
    \ trends for better decision-making. \n2.1.4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and\
    \ Machine Learning (ML) \nAI and ML technologies are instrumental in smart agriculture\
    \ applications. AI-powered algorithms and ML models can \nanalyze vast amounts\
    \ of data and generate predictive models for disease outbreak detection, crop\
    \ yield forecasting, and \npest management [68]-[71]. These technologies enable\
    \ automated decision-making, real-time monitoring, and \nautonomous operations\
    \ in smart agriculture systems. \n2.1.5. Robotics and Automation \nRobotics and\
    \ automation technologies are transforming traditional farming practices [72].\
    \ Autonomous robots and \ndrones equipped with sensors and cameras can perform\
    \ tasks like seeding, spraying, and harvesting with precision and \nefficiency\
    \ [73]-[76]. Robotic systems can also assist in weed detection and removal, reducing\
    \ the need for manual labor \nand minimizing the use of chemical herbicides. \n\
    2.1.6. Precision Agriculture and Variable Rate Technology (VRT) \nPrecision agriculture\
    \ utilizes technology to optimize resource application based on specific field\
    \ conditions [77]. VRT \nsystems analyze data from sensors [78] and mapping tools\
    \ to precisely deliver inputs such as water, fertilizers, and \npesticides. This\
    \ technology ensures that resources are used efficiently, minimizing waste and\
    \ environmental impact \nwhile maximizing crop productivity. \n2.1.7. Cloud Computing\
    \ and Edge Computing \nCloud computing enables the storage, processing, and analysis\
    \ of agricultural data on remote servers, providing \nscalability and accessibility\
    \ [79]-[83]. Edge computing, on the other hand, brings computing capabilities\
    \ closer to the \ndata source, reducing latency and enabling real-time decision-making\
    \ at the field level. Both cloud and edge computing \nsupport the seamless integration\
    \ of data from various sources and enable efficient data management and analysis\
    \ in \nsmart agriculture. \n2.1.8. Agricultural Robotics and Sensing \nAdvanced\
    \ robotic systems equipped with sophisticated sensors and actuators have the potential\
    \ to revolutionize \nagricultural practices [84], [85]. These systems can perform\
    \ tasks such as selective harvesting, precision spraying, and \nWorld Journal\
    \ of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1212 \nsoil sampling\
    \ with high accuracy and efficiency. Sensing technologies, including hyperspectral\
    \ imaging and \nmultispectral cameras, enable detailed crop analysis and monitoring.\
    \ \nIt is important to note that these  technologies are continuously evolving\
    \ and becoming more sophisticated, enabling \nfarmers to make data-driven decisions,\
    \ optimize resource allocation, and improve overall agricultural productivity.\
    \ As \nthese technologies continue to advance, they hold immense potential to\
    \ address the global challenges of food security, \nsustainable agriculture, and\
    \ environmental conservation. \n3. General challenges in smart agriculture \n\
    Although smart agriculture brings numerous benefits, there are several challenges\
    \ that need to be addressed for its \nwidespread adoption and successful implementation.\
    \ Some of the general challenges in smart agriculture are described \nin the sub-sections\
    \ below. \n3.1.1.  High Initial Investment \nThe upfront costs of implementing\
    \ smart agriculture technologies can be a significant barrier for many farmers,\
    \ \nespecially small-scale and resource-constrained operations. The cost of purchasing\
    \ and installing sensors, IoT devices, \ndrones, robotics, and data management\
    \ systems can be prohibitive [86], [87]. Governments, organizations, and \nstakeholders\
    \ need to provide financial support, incentives, and subsidies to make these technologies\
    \ more accessible. \n3.1.2. Limited Technical Expertise \nSmart agriculture requires\
    \ a certain level of technical expertise in areas such as data analytics, AI,\
    \ and IoT [88]-[91]. \nHowever, many farmers may lack the necessary knowledge\
    \ and skills to effectively implement and utilize these \ntechnologies. Training\
    \ programs, workshops, and educational initiatives are crucial to bridge this\
    \ knowledge gap and \nempower farmers to leverage smart agriculture solutions\
    \ effectively. \n3.1.3. Connectivity and Infrastructure \nSmart agriculture heavily\
    \ relies on reliable and high-speed internet connectivity, especially in rural\
    \ areas [92]. However, \nin some regions, internet infrastructure is inadequate\
    \ or nonexistent. Poor connectivity can hinder real-time data \ncollection, remote\
    \ monitoring [93], and the seamless operation of IoT devices [94], [95]. Governments\
    \ and private \nstakeholders must invest in improving rural connectivity to ensure\
    \ widespread adoption of smart agriculture. \n3.1.4. Data Privacy and Security\
    \ \nSmart agriculture involves the collection, storage, and analysis of vast amounts\
    \ of data, including sensitive information \nabout crops, farms, and farmers [96]-[99].\
    \ Ensuring data privacy and security is paramount to protect farmers' and \nconsumers'\
    \ interests. Strong data encryption, secure cloud storage, and robust cybersecurity\
    \ measures must be \nimplemented to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches,\
    \ and misuse of information. \n3.1.5. Data Interoperability and Integration \n\
    Smart agriculture systems often involve multiple technologies and platforms, which\
    \ may use different data formats and \nprotocols [100]-[104]. Ensuring seamless\
    \ data interoperability and integration across various systems can be \nchallenging.\
    \ Standardization of data formats, open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces),\
    \ and data-sharing \nprotocols are essential for efficient data exchange and collaboration\
    \ between different smart agriculture solutions. \n3.1.6. Adoption and User Acceptance\
    \ \nFarmers may be resistant to change or skeptical about adopting new technologies.\
    \ Lack of awareness, concerns about \ntechnology reliability, and the perceived\
    \ complexity of smart agriculture solutions can hinder adoption rates [105]-\n\
    [109]. Demonstrating the tangible benefits, providing training and support, and\
    \ showcasing successful case studies are \ncrucial to building trust and encouraging\
    \ widespread adoption. \n3.1.7. Data Management and Analysis \nSmart agriculture\
    \ generates large volumes of data, and effectively managing, analyzing, and interpreting\
    \ this data can \nbe overwhelming [110]-[114]. Farmers need user-friendly data\
    \ management tools and analytics platforms that can \nprocess and present data\
    \ in a meaningful way, providing actionable insights. Simplified data visualization,\
    \ user-friendly \ninterfaces, and user training can help farmers effectively utilize\
    \ the data generated. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023,\
    \ 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1213 \n3.1.8. Regulatory and Policy Frameworks \nAs smart\
    \ agriculture involves the use of new technologies, regulatory frameworks need\
    \ to keep pace with these \nadvancements. Issues related to data ownership, data\
    \ sharing, privacy regulations, and standardization should be \naddressed through\
    \ appropriate policies [115]-[117]. Governments need to establish clear guidelines\
    \ and regulations to \nensure ethical and responsible use of smart agriculture\
    \ technologies. \nBy addressing these challenges, stakeholders can promote the\
    \ adoption of smart agriculture and leverage its potential \nto revolutionize\
    \ the agricultural sector, improve productivity, and achieve sustainable and efficient\
    \ food production. \n3.2. Security issues in smart agriculture \nSmart agriculture,\
    \ like any other technological system, is susceptible to various security issues\
    \ that need to be addressed \nto ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability\
    \ of data and operations [118], [119]. Fig. 5 shows the various \nlayers of the\
    \ smart agriculture environment. \n \nFigure 5 Smart agriculture environment layers\
    \ \nAccording to [120], some of these security issues specific to smart agriculture\
    \ include unauthorized access, data privacy \nand confidentiality, data integrity,\
    \ network security, device security, physical security, supply chain security,\
    \ as well as \nawareness and training. Fig. 6 shows the layered depiction of these\
    \ smart agriculture security challenges. Unauthorized \nindividuals gaining access\
    \ to smart agriculture systems can disrupt operations, manipulate data, or even\
    \ cause physical \ndamage [122]-[123]. It is crucial to implement strong access\
    \ controls, such as secure authentication mechanisms, to \nprevent unauthorized\
    \ access to devices, networks, and data [124]. On the other hand, authors in [125]\
    \ explain that \nsmart agriculture involves the collection and storage of sensitive\
    \ data, including farm management information, crop \nyields, and farmer details.\
    \ Ensuring data privacy and confidentiality is essential to protect farmers' and\
    \ consumers' \ninterests. Robust encryption techniques, secure storage, and proper\
    \ data access controls should be implemented to \nsafeguard sensitive information\
    \ [126]-[129]. In addition, maintaining the integrity of data is crucial in smart\
    \ agriculture \nsystems. This is because any unauthorized modification, tampering,\
    \ or corruption of data can lead to incorrect decisions \nand impact the overall\
    \ farming operations. Implementing data validation mechanisms, digital signatures,\
    \ and secure \ncommunication channels can help ensure data integrity [130]-[134].\
    \ As explained in [135], smart agriculture systems \nrely on networks and communication\
    \ channels for data transmission. These networks are vulnerable to various threats\
    \ \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n\
    1214 \nsuch as eavesdropping, data interception, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks\
    \ [136]-[139]. Implementing secure \nnetwork protocols, firewalls, intrusion detection\
    \ systems, and regular network monitoring are essential to protect \nagainst network-based\
    \ attacks. \n \nFigure 6 Layered security challenges in smart agriculture \nIoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and actuators play a significant role in smart agriculture\
    \ [140]-[144]. However, these devices can \nbe potential entry points for attackers.\
    \ Ensuring the security of these devices through measures like strong \nauthentication,\
    \ regular firmware updates, and secure configurations is crucial to prevent unauthorized\
    \ access and \ncompromise of the entire system. Researchers in [145] discuss that\
    \ smart agriculture systems may include physical \ninfrastructure like weather\
    \ stations, drones, and robots. Securing these physical assets from theft, vandalism,\
    \ or \nphysical tampering is vital. Implementing access controls, surveillance\
    \ systems, and physical barriers can help protect \nthe physical components of\
    \ smart agriculture. On their part, the authors in [146] argue that smart agriculture\
    \ systems \nrely on various vendors and suppliers for hardware, software, and\
    \ services. Ensuring the security of the entire supply \nchain is crucial to prevent\
    \ the introduction of compromised or malicious components [147], [148]. Conducting\
    \ thorough \nvendor assessments, implementing secure development practices, and\
    \ performing regular security audits are important \nfor maintaining a secure\
    \ supply chain. In addition, human error and lack of awareness can contribute\
    \ to security \nvulnerabilities [149]. Farmers and operators should receive proper\
    \ training and awareness programs to understand \nsecurity best practices, identify\
    \ potential threats, and respond to security incidents promptly. \nAddressing\
    \ these security issues requires a multi-layered approach that combines technical\
    \ controls, policies, training, \nand regular security assessments. Collaboration\
    \ between farmers, technology providers, and cybersecurity experts is \ncrucial\
    \ to identify and mitigate security risks, ensuring the safe and secure implementation\
    \ of smart agriculture systems. \n4. Ways of securing smart agriculture \nSecuring\
    \ smart agriculture systems involves implementing various techniques and best\
    \ practices to protect data, \ndevices, and infrastructure. Table 2 describes\
    \ some techniques for securing smart agriculture. \nTable 2 Techniques for securing\
    \ smart agriculture \nTechnique \nDescription \nStrong Authentication \nand Access\
    \ Controls \nImplement robust authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor\
    \ authentication, to \nensure that only authorized individuals can access the\
    \ smart agriculture system [150]-\n[154]. Additionally, enforce strict access\
    \ controls to limit privileges and restrict access to \nsensitive data and critical\
    \ functionalities. \nRegular Patching and \nUpdates \nKeep all software, firmware,\
    \ and operating systems up to date with the latest security \npatches [155]-[158].\
    \ Regularly update IoT devices, sensors, and other components to \naddress any\
    \ known vulnerabilities [159] and ensure that they are running on the most \n\
    secure versions. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03),\
    \ 1207–1231 \n1215 \nNetwork Segmentation \nSegment the smart agriculture network\
    \ into different zones or subnets to separate critical \ncomponents, such as IoT\
    \ devices, sensors, and data storage systems [160]-[163]. This helps \ncontain\
    \ security breaches and limits unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the network.\
    \ \nSecure Communication \nChannels \n \nUse secure protocols and encryption techniques\
    \ (e.g., SSL/TLS) to ensure the \nconfidentiality and integrity of data transmitted\
    \ between devices, sensors, and the central \nsystem [164]-[168]. Secure communication\
    \ channels prevent eavesdropping, data \ninterception, and tampering during data\
    \ transmission. \nPhysical \nSecurity \nMeasures \nSecure physical components\
    \ of smart agriculture systems, including weather stations, \ndrones, and robots,\
    \ to prevent theft, tampering, or unauthorized access [169]. Implement \nphysical\
    \ barriers, surveillance systems, and access controls to protect physical assets\
    \ \n[170]-[173]. \nEmployee Training and \nAwareness \nProvide comprehensive training\
    \ programs to farmers, operators, and other stakeholders \nto raise awareness\
    \ about security best practices, social engineering threats, and safe \nhandling\
    \ of data and devices. Educate users about potential risks and how to identify\
    \ and \nreport security incidents [174]. \nSecurity \nMonitoring \nand Incident\
    \ Response \nImplement robust monitoring tools and techniques to continuously\
    \ monitor the smart \nagriculture system for potential security incidents [175].\
    \ Establish an incident response \nplan to handle security breaches, including\
    \ procedures for investigation, containment, \neradication, and recovery [176]-[178].\
    \ \nIntrusion \nDetection \nand \nPrevention \nSystems \nDeploy intrusion detection\
    \ and prevention systems (IDPS) to monitor network traffic, \ndetect suspicious\
    \ activities, and prevent potential attacks [179], [180]. IDPS can identify \n\
    and respond to malicious behavior, such as unauthorized access [181] attempts\
    \ or \nabnormal data patterns. \nData Encryption and \nPrivacy \n \nImplement\
    \ strong encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data both at rest and in \n\
    transit. Encrypt data stored on devices, databases, and cloud storage to prevent\
    \ \nunauthorized access [182]-[186]. Also, ensure compliance with privacy regulations\
    \ and \nestablish clear policies on data handling and sharing. \nRegular \nSecurity\
    \ \nAssessments \nConduct regular security assessments, penetration testing, and\
    \ vulnerability scanning to \nidentify and address any potential weaknesses in\
    \ the smart agriculture system [187]-[191]. \nRegular assessments help ensure\
    \ that security measures are up to date and effective in \nprotecting against\
    \ emerging threats. \n \nBy implementing these techniques, smart agriculture systems\
    \ can significantly enhance their security posture and \nprotect against potential\
    \ threats, ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data and\
    \ operations. \n5. Issues with current smart agriculture protection techniques\
    \ \nThere are several protection techniques available for securing smart agriculture\
    \ systems. However, there are still some \nissues and challenges associated with\
    \ their implementation. The following sub-sections discuss some common issues\
    \ \nwith current smart agriculture protection techniques. \n5.1 Lack of Standardization\
    \ \nThe smart agriculture industry lacks standardized security protocols and frameworks,\
    \ making it challenging to ensure \nconsistent and interoperable security measures\
    \ across different systems and devices [192], [193]. The absence of \nwidely accepted\
    \ standards hinders seamless integration and can lead to compatibility issues\
    \ when implementing \nsecurity solutions. \n5.2 Limited Security Awareness and\
    \ Expertise \nMany farmers and agricultural professionals may have limited knowledge\
    \ and awareness of cybersecurity risks and \nbest practices. The lack of security\
    \ expertise among end-users can result in improper implementation of security\
    \ \nmeasures, such as weak passwords, misconfigurations, or failure to update\
    \ software/firmware promptly [194], [195]. \nWorld Journal of Advanced Research\
    \ and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1216 \n5.3 Vulnerabilities in IoT Devices\
    \ \nIoT devices used in smart agriculture systems may have inherent security vulnerabilities\
    \ [196]. These vulnerabilities \ncan be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized\
    \ access, manipulate data, or disrupt operations [196]-[199]. The rapid \nproliferation\
    \ of IoT devices and their diverse manufacturers make it challenging to ensure\
    \ consistent security standards \nacross all devices. \n5.4 Complexity and Cost\
    \ \nImplementing comprehensive security measures can be complex and expensive\
    \ for farmers, particularly small-scale \noperations with limited budgets. The\
    \ costs associated with purchasing, deploying, and maintaining security solutions\
    \ \ncan be prohibitive, deterring widespread adoption of robust security measures\
    \ [200], [201]. \n5.5 Legacy Systems and Infrastructure \nMany agricultural systems\
    \ still rely on legacy equipment and infrastructure that may not have built-in\
    \ security features \nor support modern security protocols [202], [203]. Integrating\
    \ security solutions with existing legacy systems can be \nchallenging and may\
    \ require additional investments in upgrading or replacing outdated components\
    \ [204]. \n5.6 Lack of Security Updates and Support \nSome smart agriculture solutions\
    \ may lack regular security updates and ongoing support from vendors [205]-[207].\
    \ \nThis can leave systems vulnerable to emerging threats, as security patches\
    \ and updates are essential for addressing \nnewly discovered vulnerabilities\
    \ and ensuring the long-term security of the system. \n5.7 Physical Security Risks\
    \ \nWhile digital security is crucial, physical security risks in smart agriculture\
    \ systems cannot be overlooked [209], [210]. \nComponents such as sensors, drones,\
    \ or weather stations are vulnerable to physical tampering, theft, or damage.\
    \ \nEnsuring adequate physical security measures, such as access controls and\
    \ surveillance, is essential but can be \nchallenging in remote or expansive farming\
    \ environments. \n5.8 Integration and Compatibility Challenges \nSmart agriculture\
    \ systems often involve the integration of various technologies, platforms, and\
    \ third-party solutions. \nEnsuring seamless integration and compatibility between\
    \ different components can be complex, as they may have \ndifferent security requirements,\
    \ protocols, or interfaces [211]-[214]. Incompatibility issues can create security\
    \ gaps and \nincrease the risk of vulnerabilities. \nAddressing these issues requires\
    \ collaborative efforts between technology providers, agricultural stakeholders,\
    \ and \npolicymakers. It involves promoting security standards and best practices,\
    \ providing security training and awareness \nprograms, encouraging security-by-design\
    \ principles in IoT device manufacturing, and fostering partnerships to \ndevelop\
    \ cost-effective security solutions tailored for the agricultural sector [215]-[219].\
    \ \n6. Future research scope \nBased on the shortcomings of the current smart\
    \ agriculture defense mechanisms, future research can explore several \nareas\
    \ to enhance the protection of agricultural systems and address emerging challenges.\
    \ Some potential research \nscopes include the following: \n6.1 Threat Modeling\

    \ Develop intelligent decision support \nsystems that consider security risks\
    \ and constraints while optimizing farming operations, resource allocation, and\
    \ risk \nmanagement [265], [266]. \n6.11 Social and Ethical Considerations \n\
    Study the social, ethical, and legal implications of smart agriculture security\
    \ [267]. Investigate the impact of security \nbreaches on farmers, consumers,\
    \ and the environment [268]. Address ethical concerns related to data ownership,\
    \ \nprivacy, and responsible use of technology in agriculture. \nThese research\
    \ scopes aim to advance the field of smart agriculture security, addressing the\
    \ evolving security challenges \nand developing innovative solutions to protect\
    \ agricultural systems, data, and stakeholders. \n7 Conclusion \nSecurity issues\
    \ in smart agriculture pose significant challenges that need to be addressed to\
    \ ensure the integrity, \nconfidentiality, and availability of data and operations.\
    \ The protection of smart agriculture systems is crucial to prevent \nunauthorized\
    \ access, data breaches, tampering, and disruption of farming operations. This\
    \ paper has highlighted several \nfactors that contribute to the complexity and\
    \ vulnerability of these systems. For example, lack of standardized security \n\
    World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews, 2023, 18(03), 1207–1231 \n1218\
    \ \nprotocols and frameworks, limited security awareness and expertise among farmers,\
    \ and vulnerabilities in IoT devices \nhave been shown to be major concerns. Additionally,\
    \ the complexity and cost associated with implementing \ncomprehensive security\
    \ measures, legacy systems and infrastructure, and the need for regular security\
    \ updates and \nsupport pose additional challenges. Physical security risks and\
    \ integration and compatibility issues further compound \nthe security landscape\
    \ of smart agriculture. To overcome these challenges, future research and development\
    \ efforts \nshould focus on threat modeling, risk assessment, blockchain technology,\
    \ secure data analytics, intrusion detection \nsystems, machine learning for anomaly\
    \ detection, security-aware IoT device design, secure communication protocols,\
    \ \nSIEM for agriculture, privacy and data protection, security-aware farm management\
    \ systems, and social and ethical \nconsiderations. It has been shown that addressing\
    \ security issues in smart agriculture requires collaborative efforts \nbetween\
    \ technology providers, agricultural stakeholders, researchers, and policymakers.\
    \ It is crucial to develop and \nimplement robust security measures, promote security\
    \ standards and best practices, provide security training and \nawareness programs,\
    \ and foster partnerships to develop cost-effective security solutions tailored\
    \ for the agricultural \nsector. By addressing these security issues comprehensively,\
    \ we can ensure the trustworthiness, resilience, and \nsustainability of smart\
    \ agriculture systems, thereby unlocking their full potential to revolutionize\
    \ the agricultural \nindustry, improve productivity, and contribute to global\
    \ food security. \nCompliance with ethical standards \nAcknowledgments \nAll the\

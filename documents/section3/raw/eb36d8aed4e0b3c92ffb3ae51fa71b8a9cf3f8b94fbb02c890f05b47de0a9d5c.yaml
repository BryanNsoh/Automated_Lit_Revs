    1 Introduction Wireless sensor network is a fast growing research area which has
    seen a tremendous technological advancement with the latest development in low-cost
    sensor devices equipped with wireless network interfaces. The creation of sensor
    network with the large number of sensor nodes has many technical challenges and
    also it has many application possibilities. Sensor networks find their application
    in different areas and it includes domain such as process management, health care
    monitoring, environment monitoring, industrial monitoring and military surveillance.
    A typical sensor network may have sensor node from a few to few hundreds or few
    thousands. The key technical challenges in wireless sensor network is the design
    of energy-efficient protocols, design of protocol that deals with the scalability
    of network to large number of nodes, design of data handling technique and development
    of exciting new application that exploit the potential of wireless sensor networks.
    Precision agriculture or precision farming is site-based agriculture method which
    uses new advance method of observation and measurement for the improvement of
    the agriculture. It employs advanced technical help for better utilization of
    resource. Water is one of the important resource constraints in agriculture. Wireless
    sensor network can be used for remotely monitoring the farm. From the farm, different
    types of data can be sensed using sensor which can be used for improvising the
    yield from the agriculture land. The sensor network will be energy efficient if
    the node placement and networks data routing protocol are selected in the best
    suited way for communication for the given application. There are some standard
    routing protocols already in sensor network, which are suited in different application
    scenarios. Sometimes routing protocol should be slightly modified to get the desired
    result. Standard ad hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol and
    Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol are compared in this work. Gutiérrez et
    al. in 2014 [1] developed automatic irrigation system using wireless sensor network
    and GPRS module, which was cost-effective and feasible for water optimizing in
    agriculture. Keshtgary and Deljoo [2] has simulated the wireless sensor network
    for grid topologies and compared with the performance metric like throughput,
    load and delay. An efficient wireless sensor network grid topology and random
    topology are implemented in Wi-fi network [3]. There are many simulation tools
    which can be used for simulating like NS-2, NS-3, OMNET++, NetSim, Opnet, etc.
    In this paper, the simulation is done using Opnet for comparing the topology and
    to study the routing protocol. In this paper, Sect. 2 deals with node placement
    and Sect. 3 deals with the routing protocol. Section 4 concludes this paper. 2
    Node Placement In wireless sensor network, node deployment pattern makes a good
    impact on its working of nodes. Sensor node can be randomly deployed or placed
    in precise location based on the application scenario. For application like remote
    monitoring of agriculture, sensor node can be placed directly by the human on
    the field. Depending on the data to be sensed the sensor node can be placed. If
    the sensor nodes in wireless sensor network are densely deployed, then a single
    sensor node will be having many neighbours to which direct communication would
    be possible when using sufficient transmission power. But this will not be beneficial,
    because long-range transmission would consume more power and more number of neighbours
    will add the burden to the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol. The routing protocol
    will suffer from volatility in the network if the node positions are changing
    and frequently creating and breaking many links. To overcome this problem, topology
    control should be applied. In topology control main idea is to control the set
    of nodes that are considered neighbours to a node. In some case, topology control
    can be done by manually placing the set of nodes to be considered as neighbours.
    Topology control can also be done by controlling the transmission power, by creating
    hierarchies in network or cluster formation, etc. Some of the network topologies
    which are used are star topology, mesh topology, ring topology, bus topology.
    Depending on the communication technology used and requirement of the system network,
    topology is considered. Sometimes a hybrid topology will be best option in some
    of the scenarios. 2.1 Methodology Case study for node deployment in precision
    farming land with dimension 100 m × 100 m is considered. Twenty nodes have been
    used as sensing node and one node has been used as a gateway node. The sensor
    nodes are assumed to be nodes which sense moisture content of soil. When the moisture
    content of soil is below the threshold limit set for a crop the sensing node should
    transmit the information to the gateway node. The gateway node has to pass the
    information to irrigation valve controlling system. The information which is to
    be passed to the controlling station will be data about soil’s moisture content
    or temperature, etc. Since the data bandwidth requirement is less it is better
    to go for low power low-cost wireless standard to form the personal area network.
    A standard way of node deployment cannot be possible in all practical scenarios
    because the entire farmer will not be having agriculture land in standard shape
    and size. So depending on the agriculture land the wireless sensor network suited
    will differ. Using OPNET simulation tool the Personal Area Network (PAN) can be
    created. The low power PAN has been created using Zigbee which uses IEEE 802.15.4
    standard for the medium access control layer. The star topology with WLAN (Wireless
    Local Area Network) is considered for the comparison of the AODV and DSR routing
    protocols. Using the performance metrics route discovery time, the routing protocol
    is compared. 2.2 System Model In wireless sensor network a variety of topology
    have been developed and each scenario has its own advantages and disadvantages.
    In this paper OPNET simulation tool is used to study four topologies. Four topologies
    are random, cluster, star with gateway outside and star topology with centred
    gateway. Figure 1 shows the node deployment pattern of the four topologies mentioned.
    Fig. 1 Network topologies. a Random, b cluster head topology, c star topology
    with gateway outside, d star topology with gateway at centre Full size image In
    the scenarios considered, there are 20 sensing nodes and a gateway node is placed
    in the area of 1 Hectare. Figure 2 shows the node placed in a random way. In random
    topology the sensor node senses the information from the environment, and if it
    detects the event then the information has to be transmitted to the gateway node.
    The sensor node can send the information to any neighbour node which is in range.
    Finally, the information should reach to the gateway node. Fig. 2 Random topology
    implemented in OPNET Full size image Second scenario cluster topology considered
    is shown in Fig. 3. In this, there are four clusters formed in the same farm,
    each cluster group is of five sensor node with the cluster head as the centre
    node among the group. In the figure shown, the node 3, node 8, node 13, node 18
    are cluster heads and these heads will collect the information from the four sensor
    nodes of corresponding cluster and then transmit to the gateway node. Fig. 3 Cluster
    topology implemented in OPNET Full size image Third scenario considered is a star
    topology with gateway outside as shown in Fig. 4. In this case, all sensor nodes
    are directly connected to the gateway node. These entire sensor nodes are placed
    in approximately equal distance from each other. Fig. 4 Star topology with gateway
    outside implemented in OPNET Full size image Fourth topology considered is star
    topology with the gateway node in the centre of the field as shown in Fig. 5.
    In this network also all the sensor nodes have to directly communicate to the
    gateway node. Fig. 5 Star topology with gateway at centre implemented in OPNET
    Full size image The node placement for routing protocol comparison is done as
    explained for the star topology with gateway outside. In this network the route
    discovery and route maintenance from source to destination is done by the corresponding
    routing protocol. In the same topology, the route discovery time for both scenarios
    are compared. 2.3 Simulation Results of Topology Comparison The simulation results
    are shown for all four topologies. The topologies are compared using a set of
    performance metrics like MAC throughput, MAC load and application end-to-end delay.
    Many other performance metrics can be compared using the OPNET software. The definition
    of the performance metrics used for the comparison of the topologies are: MAC
    throughput: Represents the total number of bits (in bits/s) forwarded from 802.15.4
    MAC to higher layer in all WPAN nodes of the network. MAC load: Represents the
    total load (in bits/s) submitted to 802.15.4 by all higher layer to all WPAN nodes
    of the network. Application end-to-end delay: Total delay between creation and
    reception of an application packet. MAC load for all the four topologies has been
    shown in Fig. 6. From the figure it is found that load for both star topologies
    are less than the load of cluster topology and random topology. Random topology
    has the highest load among all four topologies. Fig. 6 MAC load Full size image
    MAC throughput remains same as that of MAC load for star topologies as shown in
    Fig. 7. The throughput random topology and cluster topology are more than the
    throughput of the star topologies. Fig. 7 MAC throughput Full size image Application
    end-to-end delay for the four topologies is shown in Fig. 8. From the figure it
    is clear that the star topology with gateway node placed in the centre of the
    sensor node has the lowest application end-to-end delay. The star topology with
    gateway outside has slightly more delay than star topology with centred gateway.
    The average values of performance metrics of topologies are listed in Table 1.
    Fig. 8 Application end-to-end delay Full size image Table 1 Performance metrics
    of topologies compared Full size table In the simulation graph drawn green coloured
    denoted by 1 is representing random topology, red coloured line denoted with 2
    is for clustered topology, light blue denoted with 3 is for star topology with
    gateway outside and blue coloured graph line denoted with 4 represent star topology
    with gateway at the centre. The simulation time is 60 min. Data packet size of
    1024 bits was generated using constant distribution with mean value of 1 s as
    the packet inter-arrival time. In the simulation, all the sensor nodes of the
    four topologies were assigned same distribution for event generation and inter-arrival
    time. 3 Routing Protocol The star topology with gateway outside is considered
    for the routing protocol study. DSR and AODV are demand-driven protocol. In demand-driven
    routing protocols the route discovery is used to find the active routes between
    sender and receiver. Route discovery is done by flooding the network with route
    request and receiving route response. DSR uses route discovery and route maintenance
    process. AODV uses route discovery and route maintenance from the DSR and hop-by-hop
    routing, periodic addressing, and sequence numbering from the Destination Sequenced
    Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocol. In the scenarios where the nodes are
    less mobile, the DSR performance is better than the AODV as route to the destination
    is found quickly in DSR. If the nodes are mobile, then AODV would give better
    performance than the DSR. DSR has less routing overhead than AODV. In the agriculture
    monitoring application the nodes are less mobile, so it will be better to use
    DSR routing protocol than the AODV standard. In most of the low power agricultural
    monitoring wireless sensor network, Zigbee has been used for communication. Zigbee
    has Zigbee stack over IEEE 802.15.4, and in Zigbee stack AODV protocol is used.
    3.1 Simulation Result of Routing Protocols Route discovery time The time to discover
    a route to a specific destination is the time when a route request was sent out
    to discover a route to that destination until the time a route reply is received
    with a route to that destination. This statistic represents the time to discover
    a route to a specific destination. The route discovery time taken by AODV and
    DSR protocols are shown in Fig. 9. In simulation graph blue coloured line shown
    with 1 is showing the route discovery time of AODV protocol and red coloured line
    shown with 2 is showing the route discovery time of DSR. From the figure it is
    proved that for sensor network with fixed nodes DSR protocol will perform better
    than AODV. Fig. 9 Route discovery time for AODV and DSR Full size image 4 Conclusions
    The paper has highlighted the use of Zigbee wireless technology in four different
    topologies for farm monitoring. In this paper low-cost, low power consuming Zigbee
    standard/IEEE 802.15.4 has been used for the simulation. The sensor node has been
    placed in different topologies like random, cluster, star with gateway outside
    and star with gateway inside to form wireless sensor network. When application
    end-to-end delay is used, both star topologies are providing better performance
    than other two topologies. Star topologies are maintaining approximately same
    MAC load and MAC throughput for the simulated duration. But random topology and
    cluster topology give better MAC load and MAC throughput value than star topologies.
    Depending on the size of the field, the vegetation type, the agronomist can be
    consulted for knowing the idea of placement of the sensor in the farm. Then the
    network topology can selected depending on the requirements from the wireless
    sensor network deployed. The two protocol implemented in the work are DSR and
    AODV protocol. Since DSR protocol has less routing overhead than AODV, implementing
    DSR protocol stack over the IEEE 802.15.4 standard will reduce the energy consumption
    of the sensor network for this type of application. The hardware implementations
    of DSR protocol over the IEEE 802.15.4 standard are being carried out for wireless
    sensor network application. References Gutiérrez J, Villa-Medina JF, Nieto-Garibay

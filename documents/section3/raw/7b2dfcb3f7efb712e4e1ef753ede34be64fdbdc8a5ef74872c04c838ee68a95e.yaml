    Leaching fraction, Vegetation indices, Tissue nitrogen concentration (TN), Tissue
    moisture content (TM) Remote sensing technology was tested as a non-destructive
    tool to assess the nitrogen (N) and water status of hybrid bermudagrass ''Tifway''
    [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy]. Ten combinations of
    water (based on leaching fraction: LF) and N treatments including cyclic and steady
    treatments were imposed on 20 plots (6.1 6.1 m) from October 2001 to October 2002
    and January 2003 to June 2003. Each plot contained a non-weighing lysimeter which
    was used to assess the weekly water balance. Leaf xylem water potential, canopy
    temperature, tissue moisture content (TM), chlorophyll meter index, visual color
    ratings, and tissue nitrogen concentration (TN) were assessed twice per month.
    Canopy spectral reflectance measurements were also acquired twice per month using
    a portable spectroradiometer mounted on a movable cart. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
    showed that spectral reflectance at individual wavelengths, vegetation indices,
    and soil-plant parameters separated based on N, LF and/or N LF interaction (P
    < 0.05). Prediction equations for individual wavelengths and vegetation indices
    were generated from plant and soil parameters that included TN (Nitrogen Content
    index (NC): R2 = 0.73), TM (R555 : R2 = 0.66), or TM TN (Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) : R2 = 0.71). Multiple regression analysis also produced
    significant predictive models for four plant variables based on a selected number
    of wavelengths (between 3 and 9): canopy color (R2 = 0.48), TN (R2 = 0.56), TM
    TN (R2 = 0.43), and chlorophyll meter index (R2 = 0.78). Normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) showed a strong threshold relationship with canopy color
    rating (R2 = 0.64, P < 0.001, n = 194) and a consistent positive curvilinear relationship
    with the chlorophyll meter index (R2 = 0.75, P < 0.001, n = 200). The Water Band
    Index (WBI) significantly correlated with TM (R2 = 0.76, P < 0.001) and N content
    index (NC) correlated with TN (R2 = 0.45, P < 0.001) for single day measurements,
    but not for the larger data sets. Results from this experiment demonstrate that
    canopy reflectance measured with a ground-based spectroradiometer has potential
    for improving turfgrass N and irrigation management under field conditions, which
    could lead to significant N and water savings on large turfgrass areas such as
    golf courses and sports fields. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 17 Share

    Get rights and content Highlights • Technological recent advances promote new
    reliable UAVs for precision agriculture. • UAVs can improve temporal and spatial
    sensing resolutions for water stress management. • Multi-spectral and thermal
    images from UAVs reflect water stress in several crop. • Easy and low-cost retrieving
    chlorophyll fluorescence from UAVs is an important challenge. Abstract Unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) present an exciting opportunity to monitor crop fields
    with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing capable of improving
    water stress management in agriculture. In this study, we reviewed the application
    of different types of UAVs using different remote sensors and compared their performance
    with ground-truth plant data. Several reflectance indices, such as NDVI, TCARI/OSAVI
    and PRInorm obtained from UAVs have shown positive correlations related to water
    stress indicators such as water potential (Ψ) and stomatal conductance (gs). Nevertheless,
    they have performed differently in diverse crops; thus, their uses and applications
    are also discussed in this study. Thermal imagery is also a common remote sensing
    technology used to assess water stress in plants, via thermal indices (calculated
    using artificial surfaces as references), estimates of the difference between
    canopy and air temperature, and even canopy conductance estimates derived from
    leaf energy balance models. These indices have shown a great potential to determine
    field stress heterogeneity using unmanned aerial platforms. It has also been proposed
    that chlorophyll fluorescence could be an even better indicator of plant photosynthesis
    and water use efficiency under water stress. Therefore, developing systems and
    methodologies to easily retrieve fluorescence from UAVs should be a priority for
    the near future. After a decade of work with UAVs, recently emerging technologies
    have developed more user-friendly aerial platforms, such as the multi-copters,
    which offer industry, science, and society new opportunities. Their use as high-throughput
    phenotyping platforms for real field conditions and also for water stress management
    increasing temporal and resolution scales could improve our capacity to determine
    important crop traits such as yield or stress tolerance for breeding purposes.

    stressPrecision agricultureMulticoptersThermography 1. Introduction In general
    terms, agriculture consumes most of the world''s water resources (70%) (Gilbert,
    2012). At the same time, other industries are also increasing their water consumption
    and thus competing with food production. Current climate change predictions indicate
    increases in the frequency and intensity of drought periods in Mediterranean and
    semi-arid areas (Stocker et al., 2013). Globally, it is important to note that
    45% of the world''s food supply is produced on irrigated lands covering only 18%
    of cultivated areas (Döll and Siebert, 2002). This means that irrigation management
    is of crucial importance to optimize water use. Moreover, the predicted global
    food demand for 2050 indicates that crop production must double (Tilman et al.,
    2011). Increased crop production was strongly encouraged after World War II, resulting
    in the “Green Revolution” of the 60s. Now, a claim for a “Blue Revolution” seems
    to be occurring, focusing on agriculture''s environmental impacts and especially
    on optimizing water management to obtain the desired idea of “more crop per drop”
    (Beer et al., 2009). Thus, water efficiency is becoming more and more important
    for society. For example, the European Parliament recently introduced the requirement
    to sustainably “produce more with less” in agreement with the new EU research
    program “Horizon 2020” (Geoghegan-Quin, 2013). In this sense, precision agriculture
    appears to be a multidisciplinary approach capable of responding to the previous
    objectives. The American National Research Council defined this type of agriculture
    as “a management strategy that uses information technology to bring data from
    multiple sources to bear on decisions associated with crop production.” In fact,
    it involves all of the techniques and methods available in the new ICT (Information
    and Communications Technology) era, which can be used to retrieve useful information
    for managing crops while accounting for landscape heterogeneity and variability
    within and between fields (Lelong et al., 2008, Anderson and Gaston, 2013). However,
    interdisciplinary approaches will not be so easily realized; multi-disciplinary
    teams (experimental and computational scientists) will be required to integrate
    diverse data from multiple plant levels. Thus, a plant systems biology view will
    have to be used to scale this data up to an agricultural level (Fernie, 2012).
    For instance, most of the measurements used to characterize plant status are developed
    at the leaf level, while the improvement of agricultural management requires an
    up-scaling of this information to the canopy/field level. The characterization
    of one single plant is a time consuming, costly process; to carry out these types
    of characterizations for complete agricultural fields would be even more so (Berni
    et al., 2009a, Berni et al., 2009b, González-Dugo et al., 2012). Traditional remote
    sensing approaches place remote sensors on towers over crop fields (thermal imagery,
    multi and hyper-spectral cameras, fluorometers, etc.) where the main limitation
    is the fixed position from which data is collected. Another traditional remote
    sensing technique is the use of aircrafts or satellites where the temporal and
    spatial resolution significantly limits their usefulness for agricultural assessments
    (it is important to consider the highly dynamic changes in vegetation in relation
    to the environment) (Moya et al., 2004, Louis et al., 2005, Berni et al., 2009a,
    Anderson and Gaston, 2013, Jones, 2014). In this context, UAVs (unmanned aerial
    vehicles) and remote sensing come into play as useful tools because they are able
    to fill this important gap, coupled with aerial imagery and adequate computational
    efforts. Some studies have also been developed using different ground manned vehicles
    equipped with remote sensors at affordable costs, but these also present constraints
    since transporting the equipment to the monitoring areas reduces the swath mapping
    capability, and in some cases, their use is only available during crop harvesting
    (Lelong et al., 2008). In recent years, the use of UAVs for civilian purposes
    has begun to increase thanks to technological advances, cost reductions and the
    size of sensors related to the Global Position System (GPS), pre-programmed flights,
    IMUs (inertial movement units) and auto-pilots. In this sense, UAV technology
    can fill the gap of knowledge between the leaf and the canopy by improving both
    the spatial and the temporal resolution of the most common current remote sensing
    systems. Thirty years ago, a fleet of airborne imagery thermal scanners was envisioned
    to map thermal stress for water management purposes (Jackson et al., 1977, Berni
    et al., 2009b); now it seems like we are finally achieving this idea thanks to
    the emergence of UAV technologies. This review considers the latest remote sensing
    experiences obtained from different types of UAVs applied to agriculture and their
    potential ability to assess plant water status at the crop-scale. Additionally,
    it highlights the different remote sensing indices obtained from UAV technology
    and their ability to estimate plant physiological parameters. Finally, the future
    perspectives and potentials of UAVs are addressed. 2. UAVs applied to precision
    agriculture UAVs have historically been used principally for military purposes.
    After World War II they began to be used as targets or weapon reconnaissance platforms.
    Recently, other civilian purposes, such as agricultural management, have created
    an increased interest in them. In Table 1 we compiled all of the agronomy studies
    that have been published up until now which employed UAVs and remote sensing technologies
    compared with plant-truth data measurements. Types of UAVs and flight characteristics
    are also briefly mentioned (Table 1). Previously, the pioneering works of Herwitz
    et al., 2002a, Herwitz et al., 2002b, Herwitz et al., 2004 described the usefulness
    of UAVs to detect irrigation and fertilization abnormalities and fruit maturation
    of crops in agricultural fields. These NASA-funded projects used UAVs like the
    solar-powered Pathfinder-Plus (with a wing span of 36.3 m and a weight of 318
    kg), with a flying capacity of several hours, equipped with visible and multi-spectral
    cameras to acquire images (0.5 and 1 m/pixel, respectively) of a coffee plantation
    in Hawaii at 6400 m altitude. Another example of large fixed wing UAVs is the
    RCATS/APV-3 (also developed by NASA), which has been used to study vineyards in
    California (Johnson et al., 2003) (Table 1). In the last decade, technological
    advances have led to the development of micro-UAVs (less than 5 kg) mostly due
    to the reduction in weight and size of the sensors, and considerable increases
    in precision, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and the auto-pilots using
    GPS (Global Positioning Systems) (Berni et al., 2009a, Turner et al., 2012). Table

    plant level are shown. d Vegetation index focused into the identification of HGB
    bacteria infected citrus trees. Mainly two types of UAVs have been employed for
    agricultural management: helicopters and fixed wing airplanes (Sugiura et al.,
    2005, Berni et al., 2009a, Berni et al., 2009b, Xiang and Tian, 2011, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013a) (Table 1). Both aerial platforms have
    several advantages and limitations. While unmanned helicopters have more complex
    flight systems, they offer lower flight altitudes and hover capacities (ability
    to maintain a stable position in flight) or low-speed flights. However, they are
    also able to cruise in any direction in the field and have no special requirements
    for take-off and landing, which could be critical in standard agricultural fields.
    Recently, it was published that the Pheno-copter UAV, a gas-based helicopter with
    a payload of 1.5 kg can fly for 30 min considerably improving the number of remote
    sensors able to equip at the same time and the length of the area studied (Chapman
    et al., 2014). The fixed-wing aircrafts offer more simple flight systems and longer
    durations, increasing their capacity to cover wider areas. However, their flight
    altitude is higher, thus reducing the image resolution. They are also not able
    to hover and require specific runways (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2013a). To meet the advanced requirements, in recent years a new aircraft
    platform appeared, the multi-copter (Table 1), whose flight characteristics are
    similar to the helicopters previously mentioned (Turner et al., 2012, Primicerio
    et al., 2012, Gago et al., 2013). Multi-copters were first designed as universal
    aerial platforms mainly dedicated to aerial film/photography with great stability
    and maneuverability and no take-off or landing runway requirements (Fig. 1A).
    However, compared to helicopters, these types of platforms have proved to be more
    user-friendly than the previous ones, allowing for an increase in the number of
    possible users as can be seen in the emergent market for professional and non-professional
    applications of the multi-copter (AR.Drone Parrot®, Mikrokopter®, MeCamAlwaysInnovating®,
    Amazon®). This could be an additional benefit because their prices are coming
    down and they could be operated by the farmers themselves to obtain data almost
    immediately, diagnose crop status, and then apply adapted water management as
    needed. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. (A) UAV-AirSci carbon fiber

    of the dry and wet artificial leaf references that can be observed in bright and
    dark colors, respectively. Usually, multi-copters are built out of light, resistant
    materials (such as carbon fiber, aluminum, glass fiber and kevlar) developed with
    couples of brushless motors running clockwise and counter-clockwise, respectively
    (4, 6 or 8 engines depending on the payload requirement). They are powered with
    lithium ion polymer batteries, and each motor can handle high amperes, for example
    ca. 20 A which promotes thrusts greater than 2200 g (Turner et al., 2011, Gago
    et al., 2013, García-Ruiz et al., 2013) (Fig. 1A). This power supports considerable
    payloads in these aircrafts (a six engine multi-copter can carry more than 1 kg),
    however, the flight time is, unfortunately, drastically reduced to 4–5 min, so
    multiple flights may be necessary to cover wider areas (Turner et al., 2012, Chapman
    et al., 2014). The type of UAV required will, thus, depend on the goal of the
    study or the end-product desired (Fig. 2, “Experimental design”). Download : Download

    be considered for the use of UAVs in precision agriculture. This scheme is divided
    into 4 general tasks: experimental design (blue), data acquisition (green), data
    processing (red) and results/end products (yellow). (For interpretation of the
    references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
    of this article.) The different types of UAVs currently have several different
    advantages and limitations. Nevertheless, this technology could potentially revolutionize
    temporal and spatial agriculture and ecophysiology at a close range compared to
    the other more traditional methodologies (Anderson and Gaston, 2013), such as
    satellite imagery and manned flights (whose availability is limited by weather
    conditions, re-visit times and significant costs) (Turner et al., 2012). 3. Remote
    sensing of plant physiology from UAVs There is currently great interest in remote
    sensing technologies able to provide information about plant biophysical parameters
    and physiological status (Jones and Vaughan, 2010). However, the reliability of
    aerial remote sensing approaches must be assessed with plant-truth data (Fig.
    2, “Data acquisition”), e.g. with measurements related to plant growth and vigor
    (leaf area index (LAI), biomass, chlorophyll/carotene contents, plant water status
    (stomatal conductance (gs), and leaf water potential (Ψ)), (Lelong et al., 2008,
    Berni et al., 2009b, González-Dugo et al., 2012, González-Dugo et al., 2013, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012, Gago et al., 2013). Imagery remote sensing technologies are mainly
    based on particular leaves and canopies’ wavelength reflectances in the visible
    range of the spectrum (RGB, red, green and blue), non-visible as IR (Infra-red)
    and the emission of far-IR (thermal). Also, several recent efforts have been conducted
    regarding sensing the fluorescence of chlorophylls as a more dynamic proxy of
    the electron transport rate (ETR) and gross primary production than previous reflectance
    indices (Jones and Vaughan, 2010, Frankenberg et al., 2011, Araus and Cairns,
    2014, Guanter et al., 2014). Another field of increased interest is related to
    the phenotyping of varieties and cultivars with improved capabilities. A plant''s
    phenotype is the interaction between its genetic background and the environment.
    In the recent years, important efforts have been made to develop facilities, sensing
    technologies and methodologies to obtain high-throughput phenotyping platforms
    to help plant breeders analyze the final results of their work (Araus and Cairns,
    2014). Also, it is important to bear in mind that it could be difficult to extrapolate
    results obtained under growth chamber conditions to real field culture conditions
    (Araus and Cairns, 2014); thus, phenotyping at field conditions is highly desirable.
    Nevertheless, the environment is highly heterogeneous, which probably will complicate
    the interpretation of the results even using all the new emergent technologies
    and platforms. It is expected that, in the near future, field phenotyping paired
    with biotechnological advances will result in high throughput data collection
    and analysis of relevant biophysical plant traits at the crop scale (Deery et
    al., 2014, Araus and Cairns, 2014). 3.1. Indices based on leaf/canopy reflectance
    Leaf reflectance can be used as an indicator of plant function because the light
    reflected depends directly on a leaf''s pigment composition (e.g. chlorophylls
    and xanthophyll), which can indeed reflect plants’ physiological status (Jones
    and Vaughan, 2010). Typically, vegetation indices are derived from reflectance
    bands based on RGB (red, green, blue) and IR and other narrow-wavelengths of the
    spectra (Fig. 3). The remote monitoring of these specific reflectances are commonly
    measured using visible, multi-spectral and hyper-spectral cameras (Table 1) (Jones
    and Vaughan, 2010, Baluja et al., 2012, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2013a, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013b). The most employed index is most likely
    the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI): where IR (infrared) is the
    reflectance in the near-infrared band (ca. 800 nm) and (R) in the red band (ca.
    680 nm), originally based on the satellite LandSat sensor bands for red and infrared.
    This index has commonly been used to detect plants and “greenness”, due to the
    elevated IR reflectance of chlorophylls, which are typically related to plant
    structural traits (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). Several studies have described
    the utility of UAVs equipped with multi-spectral cameras to examine the LAI through
    the NDVI index in herbaceous and woody crops such as wheat, corn and olive trees
    (Lelong et al., 2008, Berni et al., 2009a). Other indices have also recently been
    tested to obtain information related to plant physiological stress detection.
    Drought is still one of the most studied stress impulses since its potential implication
    for irrigation efficiency and scheduling is of utmost importance (Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012 and references therein). In the last 4 years, several works have
    appeared, mainly driven by Dr. Zarco-Tejada''s research group, focused on checking
    the different VIs (vegetation indices) acquired from the UAVs, and then comparing
    them to field collected plant physiological measurements. The optimized index
    transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index/optimized soil-adjusted
    vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI) was proposed as a more sensitive VIs to chlorophyll
    content and insensitive to other factors that could affect canopy reflectance,
    such as the reflectance from the soil, solar zenith angle and the vigor of the
    plant (using the leaf area index (LAI) as proxy) (Haboudane et al., 2002). This
    composite index is a ratio between the TCARI, which is highly sensitive to chlorophyll
    concentrations, but still affected by noise from the soil background, mostly at
    low chlorophyll concentrations, (Haboudane et al., 2002): Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Leaf spectral reflectance plus thermal band of the electromagnetic
    spectrum for the different bands employed in the generation of the vegetation
    indices NDVI (6 and 3 and 4), TCARI/OSAVI (1, 4, 5 and 6), PRI (1 and 2) and PRInorm
    (1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) and thermal indices as CWSI or IG (7). Center and bandwidth
    wavelength of the bands can differ depending of the equipment employed. The OSAVI
    was designed to avoid soil reflectance without previous knowledge about the moisture
    status and physical soil properties (Haboudane et al., 2002): Several studies
    also showed the performance of a narrow band index named PRI (photochemical reflectance
    index, R550 − R531/R550 + R531) related to the energy dissipation through the
    epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments (Gamon et al., 1992). Recently,
    in vineyards Zarco-Tejada et al. (2013b) showed an improvement of the PRI index
    (photochemical reflectance index, R550 − R531/R550 + R531), the PRInorm, in relation
    to gs and Ψ for a daily course. The PRInorm = PRI/[RDVI·R700/R670], not only considers
    xanthophyll changes in concentration due to water stress (PRI), but also generates
    a normalization considering the chlorophyll content (thanks to the red edge index
    (R700/R670) that is sensitive to chlorophyll content) and canopy leaf area reduction
    (the RDVI, renormalized difference vegetation index, ) is sensitive to canopy
    structure) induced by stress (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013b). Table 1 shows the vegetation
    indices obtained from UAVs and compares them to plant-truth data collected at
    the plant level in the fields. NDVI and TCARI/OSAVI were clearly related to the
    stem water potential (Ψstem) (R2 = 0.68) and gs (R2 = 0.84) in vineyards cv. Tempranillo
    (Baluja et al., 2012). However, in Citrus orchards NDVI and TCARI/OSAVI were less
    correlated with gs (R2 = 0.32 and 0.45) and Ψ (R2 = 0.24 and 0.51) (Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012). Indeed, “greenness” indices such as the NDVI are more related to
    plant vigor than the plant dynamic physiological status. This index might correlate
    well in crops where the biomass proportionally increases in parallel to photosynthesis,
    however, in other groups, such as the case of evergreen crop species, results
    were not so satisfactory (Peñuelas and Filella, 1998, Peng et al., 2011, Garbulsky
    et al., 2011, Marino et al., 2014). Other vegetation indices have also been tested
    (see Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012 for a complete description), showing higher correlations
    when narrow-band indices were associated with the xanthophyll cycle (PRI515) (R2
    = 0.59; p < 0.01 and 0.38; p < 0.001 for gs and Ψ, respectively). The blue/green
    index (R400/R550 bands) contrasted with both gs (R2 = 0.62; p < 0.001) and Ψ (R2
    = 0.49; p < 0.001, respectively). In grapevines, narrow-band reflectance indices
    such as the R515/R570 and the TCARI/OSAVI also showed correlation with xantophylls
    and the carotenoid content (R2 = 0.48; p < 0.01 and 0.51; p < 0.001, respectively)
    (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013a) (Table 1). This is most likely due to their photoprotective
    roles in thermal dissipation and their ROS (reactive oxygen species) neutralization
    under stress conditions (Evain et al., 2004, Garbulsky et al., 2011). The previous
    mentioned new index, the PRInorm, showed an improved capacity for water stress
    detection (correlated with leaf gs and Ψ) in comparison with other greenness and
    structural indices (commonly are more insensitive to dynamic changes in vegetation);
    PRInorm obtained correlations coefficients similar to those obtained indices with
    thermography (Table 1, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013b). Clearly, the interest in reflectance
    indices is to use them to scale-up to satellite imagery since the use of thermal
    imagery is constrained because of its poor resolution (100 m/pixel) which obtains
    mixed information from the plant and the background. 3.2. Indices based on leaf/canopy
    temperature Currently, one of the main assessments of plant stress via UAVs is
    naturally focused on plant water status, thus requiring the estimation of gs and
    Ψ at the leaf level since they are useful physiological water stress indicators
    (Medrano et al., 2002, González-Dugo et al., 2013). Thermal images are highly
    employed by UAVs to detect water stress in several crops, since drought promotes
    stomatal closure, reducing transpiration and evaporative cooling, while increasing
    leaf temperature. The development of miniature uncooled thermal sensors (with
    a spectral band range of 7–14 μm) has now been installed on small aircrafts to
    estimate crops’ surface temperature (Berni et al., 2009b, Gago et al., 2013).
    Thermal normalized indices (CWSI, IG and I3) were developed in the 70s and 80s
    to avoid the variability produced by environmental parameters affecting the relationship
    between stress and plant temperature (for detailed information Jones, 1999, Leinonen
    et al., 2006). As examples, the CWSI (crop water stress index) ranges from 0 to
    1 (values close to 1 are related to high levels of stress) (Idso et al., 1981),
    the IG directly increases with stomatal conductance and the I3 positively correlates
    with stomatal resistance (Jones, 1999, Leinonen et al., 2006), taking into account
    surface temperatures under wet and dry conditions as follows: (1) (2) (3) where
    Tcanopy is the surface temperature of the canopy and Twet and Tdry are reference
    surfaces that are completely wet or dry to simulate maximum and minimal leaf transpiration
    under the exposed environmental conditions. For more details about thermal indices,
    see Jones (1999) and Jones and Vaughan (2010). One of the main problems of thermal
    cameras is the reduced resolution provided by the microbolometer sensors (image
    resolution ranging from 320 × 240 to 640 × 480 pixels), increasing the problem
    of the “mixed-pixel value” where part of the temperature of the pixel comes from
    the background and not from the pure canopy, considerably reducing the quality
    of the data (Jones and Sirault, 2014). Another important consideration is the
    use of thermal cameras that integrate their own radiometric calibration system
    (Gago et al., 2013) or allow the radiometric calibration of the camera to be performed
    in the laboratory using blackbodies varying target and ambient temperature for
    the development of calibration algorithms (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). When meteorological
    data from the experimental site is available, gs can be estimated from aerial
    thermal images using the leaf energy balance (Monteith and Unsworth, 1990, Jones,
    1999). Alternative methodologies were published combining this model with dry
    and wet reference surfaces, highly useful to reduce the meteorological parameters
    required (Leinonen et al., 2006). The basic leaf energy balance equation (Eq.
    (4)) is: (4) where Tl and Ta are the canopy and air temperature (°C), rHR is the
    parallel resistance to heat and radiative transfer (s m−1), raw is the boundary
    layer resistance to water vapor (s m−1), rs is the stomatal resistance to water
    vapor (this resistance is assumed to be dominated mainly by stomata exchange),
    γ is the psychrometric constant (Pa K−1), Rni is the net isothermal radiation
    (Leinonen et al., 2006), p is the air density (kg m−3), cp is the air''s specific
    heat capacity (J kg−1 K−1), D is the vapor pressure deficit (Pa) and s is the
    slope of the curve of water vapor pressure related to the temperature (Pa C−1).
    Stomatal conductance, gs (gs = 1/rs), can be calculated by rearranging Eq. (5):
    (5) Combining leaf energy balance with thermal imagery to estimate the plant conductance
    (gc, canopy conductance considering the whole canopy instead of a leaf) can considerably
    improve crops water stress monitoring because it precisely defines plant water
    status (Flexas et al., 2002). This procedure avoids problems associated with thermal
    indices, such as the requirement of reference surfaces and normalization procedures
    necessary to calculate the vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which is site dependent
    and affects the CWSI estimation (Berni et al., 2009a). However, precise meteorological
    information is required (Leinonen et al., 2006) from different study sites. Several
    flight campaigns collected thermal indices of woody crops such as grapevines,
    olives, almonds, peaches, apricots, oranges and lemons in order to estimate plant
    physiological parameters (Berni et al., 2009a, Baluja et al., 2012, González-Dugo
    et al., 2012, González-Dugo et al., 2013, Gago et al., 2013) (Table 1). The CWSI
    showed a clear correlation with gs and Ψ for most of the studied crops, such as
    olives (R2 = 0.91 and 0.82; p < 0.001 respectively), grapevines (R2 = 0.86–0.68
    and 0.5), almonds (R2 = 0.67; p < 0.001 for Ψ), peaches and apricots (R2 = 0.92
    and 0.64; p < 0.001 for Ψ respectively). Meanwhile, no correlations were observed
    in orange and lemon orchards. In fact, only the difference between canopy temperature
    and air temperature (Tc − Ta) showed high correlations with Ψ in several woody
    crops, such as grapevines, almonds, peaches, lemons and apricots (R2 = 0.27–0.92)
    (González-Dugo et al., 2012, González-Dugo et al., 2013). Another study demonstrated
    that canopy conductance estimated using the leaf energy balance model (Jones,
    1999) in olive orchards, using the Tcanopy obtained from the UAV combined with
    other meteorological parameters obtained good correlation with leaf measured gs.
    Overall, UAVs applied to precision agriculture allow for the generation of spatially
    explicit crop-canopy map conductances (Berni et al., 2009a). 3.3. The challenge
    of measuring leaf chlorophyll fluorescence with UAVs Under determined conditions,
    NDVI and other vegetation indices reflect mostly the biomass and “greenness” of
    plants, even considering the fact that their sensitivity becomes weaker with increasing
    values of LAI beyond a threshold value (Carlson and Ripley, 1997). Other indices
    can track more dynamic traits and give us valuable information about the physiological
    status. Among these, the so-called photochemical reflectance index (PRI) reflects
    xanthophyll-dependent thermal dissipation of excess energy (Gamon et al., 1990,
    Evain et al., 2004). While this parameter can inform us on the efficiency of photosynthetic
    activity (Garbulsky et al., 2011), it is in fact an indirect proxy (actually,
    it reflects precisely the importance of the fraction of absorbed energy which
    is not used in photosynthesis, but rather dissipated). Therefore, some authors
    have proposed to re-name it back to its original descriptor, Physiological (not
    photochemical) reflectance index (Evain et al., 2004)). Instead, chlorophyll fluorescence
    has proven to be a more direct indicator of photosynthesis (Flexas et al., 2000,
    Moya et al., 2004). Since some types of UAVs can be highly maneuverable, they
    can fly extremely close to leaves, presenting one of the most exciting opportunities
    that has recently emerged in the remote sensing field, the measurement of leaf
    chlorophyll a fluorescence. First, this dynamic physiological phenomenon can be
    used to estimate several parameters that may serve as diagnostic tools to assess
    the light energy partitioning at the photosystem II level during water stress
    (Flexas et al., 2002). For instance, ETR can be linearly related to photosynthesis
    in C3 plants after a suitable calibration (considering photorespiration) (McAusland
    et al., 2013). A down-regulation of ETR caused by water stress can be remotely
    sensed using suitable instruments like laser-based fluorometers (Flexas et al.,
    2000, Moya et al., 2004). This occurs precisely when water stress intensifies
    to the extent that further stomatal closure results in decreased rather than increased
    water use efficiency (Flexas et al., 2002, Medrano et al., 2002). However, compared
    to optical reflectance studies, data using this methodology is still scarce (Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012), probably because of a need for better
    engineering efforts to improve technological characteristics such as miniaturization
    of the sensors, battery capabilities, etc. Hence, an exciting challenge for the
    future will be the development of this technology coupled with thermal imagery,
    which could lead to measurements of water use efficiency (WUE) using images of
    field conditions. Recently, McAusland et al. (2013) developed a system combining
    fluorescence and thermal imagery to estimate WUE in Arabidopsis grown under controlled
    conditions. Perhaps a limitation to implement this technique for remote sensing
    studies on broader areas, like those achievable with UAVs, is the fact that the
    retrieval of most chlorophyll parameters requires a light-saturating photosystem
    II, for which an intense and focalized beam is necessary. Using laser sources
    to develop this beam may allow for an increase in the measuring distance, but
    at the expense of increasing danger. Therefore, there is a limit for the so-called
    active fluorosensing in terms of remote sensing. However, Flexas et al. (2002)
    showed that a simple fluorescence parameter, the steady state chl. fluorescence
    (Fs), which does not require saturating pulses for its measurement, strongly and
    consistently correlated with net CO2 assimilation and accurately tracked the water
    stress-induced declines of photosynthesis provided that some conditions were fixed
    (e.g. under saturating light). Field studies describing the retrieval of solar
    induced chlorophyll fluorescence from UAVs are now available, although they are
    very scarce and limited to few crops, using a micro-hyperspectral imager (Micro-Hyperspec
    VNIR model, Headwall Photonics, USA) and the 760 nm O2-A band in-filling method
    (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). Still, there is a lack
    of information on this topic, probably due to the scarcity and exclusivity of
    instruments and all the modeling required to fulfill this purpose. Combining this
    technology with thermal cameras for the estimation of canopy conductance could
    be an exciting challenge for phenotyping cultivars that are drought resistant
    and/or more efficient in their water use. On the other hand, solar induced chlorophyll
    fluorescence has recently been globally mapped using satellite-based sensors (Frankenberg
    et al., 2011, Joiner et al., 2013), demonstrating the usefulness of this approach
    to track changes in crop productivity (Guanter et al., 2014). However, the problem
    of satellite-based measurements is obviously their large pixel size, which makes
    them ineffective to monitor most types of field crops. Demonstration of their
    feasibility and their correspondence with ground-based estimates of photosynthesis
    and primary productivity strongly encourage the need to develop equivalent measuring
    systems mountable on UAVs. This would allow for adjustments to almost any requirement
    in terms of precision and pixel size, which would constitute an outstanding achievement
    and versatile tool for monitoring and managing crops under water limited conditions.
    4. UAVs aerial imagery UAVs greatest advantage is the reduced altitude of their
    flight compared to other aerial platforms, which greatly improves the image''s
    resolution. However, their disadvantage is that they require more flights to cover
    large areas due to their reduced flight time. As Turner et al. (2012) explained,
    a micro-UAV flying 50 m high with a camera under a standard configuration will
    acquire terrain images of 50 m × 40 m, thus, more than 150 images are needed to
    cover 2 ha. As for the multi-copters, to increase the area covered, several flights
    are required and their batteries must be changed. One of the main constraints
    of UAVs aerial imaging technology is the usual problem of the lack of the proper
    camera location information needed to correct aerial images. In addition, the
    manual management of a large number of images is very time consuming and data
    processing can be highly complex (Fig. 2, “Data processing”). To solve this bottleneck,
    several authors have used the structure from motion (SfM) combined with ground
    control points (GCPs) to generate precise digital terrain models (DTM) (Turner
    et al., 2012, Westoby et al., 2012, Fonstad et al., 2013). For instance, Turner
    et al. (2012) proposed an automated methodology to geometrically rectify and mosaic
    the large volume of images obtained from Antarctic moss beds using a multi-copter
    based on SfM geo-referencing with GCPs. This process generates arbitrary three
    dimensional point clouds that can be transformed into real world coordinates using
    the GCPs, which creates a digital terrain model DTM with accuracies of ca. 10–15
    cm. Recently, other authors suggested the use of SfM combined with GCPs mostly
    using low-cost or open-source software (Photosynth-SynthExport®, MeshLab®, JAG3D®)
    to produce digital elevation models with horizontal and vertical precision in
    centimetrical ranges which could almost compare to airborne LiDAR models, but
    with reduced economic, labor and expertise costs (Westoby et al., 2012, Fonstad
    et al., 2013). 5. Future perspectives and concluding remarks More efforts are
    required to make these technologies more user-friendly and available for all types
    of end-users, covering different interests for a precise crop assessment. Interestingly,
    the industry is reacting to the increased interest in this field, and sharing
    this vision of user friendly tools for all types of end-users in agriculture.
    For example, three clear examples of this new business trend could include DroneMapper
    Aerial Imagery Processing, GIS Services (http://www.dronemapper.com/), an on-line
    web service specialized in the generation of geo-referenced ortho-mosaics and
    DEMs from aerial images, and the PulsePod project (http://pulsepod.io), a low-cost,
    long-term hardware for real time environmental measurements to obtain in-field
    data to improve decision assessment that could be combined with UAVs information.
    Compared to conventional platforms (such as manned aircrafts and satellites),
    UAVs present several advantages: they fly at lower altitudes, increasing images’
    spatial resolution and they cost less, allowing for higher monitoring frequencies.
    Thus, UAVs can fill the gap between other more traditional remote sensing aerial
    platforms. These characteristics will most likely improve the capabilities of
    precision agriculture, in terms of crop''s development and biotic and abiotic
    stress management, converting them into an important tool for precision agriculture
    (Fig. 2, “Results/end products”). Remote sensing indices are currently being tested
    and improved to propose proxies that reflect crops’ physiological status under
    changing environmental conditions. These remote-sensing physiological estimations,
    coupled with UAVs flying capacity could allow for a more user-friendly tool for
    plant diagnostics. Indeed, as previously stated, they can be used to determine
    plant water status for several crop species. An exciting scientific-technical
    challenge will be to combine this technology with an approach that would allow
    us to estimate the chlorophyll a fluorescence as a proxy for WUE at the crop-scale.
    UAVs can also be used to identify or compare physiological parameters of several
    varieties or transgenic lines. Thus, UAVs capacity for phenotyping could identify
    promising events, which could later determine, through physiology and molecular
    techniques, improved breeds of crops to ensure future global food security (Araus
    and Cairns, 2014). Finally, UAVs equipped with remote sensors appear to be a very
    cost-efficient approach, taking into account the high performance of the sensors,
    data acquisition and their high flexibility (Lelong et al., 2008). Moreover, considerable
    cost reductions in UAVs multi-copter technology and remote sensing can be expected
    in the coming years thanks to the open source electronic community. UAVs are clearly
    highly useful and adapted tools for precision agriculture and water irrigation
    management (Turner et al., 2011, Gago et al., 2013). Increases in monitoring could
    allow for further crop management, perhaps, even in combination with ground sensors
    or smartphone Apps, not only for crop productivity, but also for crop quality.

    \ Precision irrigation management is based on the accuracy and feasibility of\
    \ sensor data\nassessing the plant water status. Multispectral and thermal infrared\
    \ images acquired from an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were analyzed to evaluate\
    \ the applicability of the data in the\nassessment of variants of subsurface irrigation\
    \ conﬁgurations. The study was carried out in a\nCabernet Sauvignon orchard located\
    \ near Benton City, Washington. Plants were subsurface irrigated\nat a 30, 60,\
    \ and 90 cm depth, with 15%, 30%, and 60% irrigation of the standard irrigation\
    \ level as\ndetermined by the grower in commercial production management. Half\
    \ of the plots were irrigated\nusing pulse irrigation and the other half using\
    \ continuous irrigation techniques. The treatments\nwere compared to the control\
    \ plots that received standard surface irrigation at a continuous rate.\nThe results\
    \ showed differences in fruit yield when the control was compared to deﬁcit irrigated\n\
    treatments (15%, 30%, 60% of standard irrigation), while no differences were found\
    \ for comparisons\nof the techniques (pulse, continuous) or depths of irrigation\
    \ (30, 60, 90 cm). Leaf stomatal conductance\nof control and 60% irrigation treatments\
    \ were statistically different compared to treatments receiving\n30% and 15% irrigation.\
    \ The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized\ndifference\
    \ vegetation index (GNDVI), and canopy temperature were correlated to fruit yield\
    \ and\nleaf stomatal conductance. Signiﬁcant correlations (p < 0.01) were observed\
    \ between NDVI, GNDVI,\nand canopy temperature with fruit yield (Pearson’s correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient, r = 0.68, 0.73, and −0.83,\nrespectively), and with leaf stomatal\
    \ conductance (r = 0.56, 0.65, and −0.63, respectively) at 44 days\nbefore harvest.\
    \ This study demonstrates the potential of using low-altitude multispectral and\

    \ in the wine industry. Grapevine water status can\naffect berry parameters critical\
    \ to production of premium quality red wines such as the phenolic\ncomposition\
    \ [1]. In the grape wine industry, deﬁcit irrigation is often used to stress vines\
    \ in order\nRemote Sens. 2017, 9, 961; doi:10.3390/rs9090961\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2017, 9, 961\n2 of 15\nto produce high quality berries. However,\
    \ this plant stress should be regulated to preserve grape\nquality and production.\
    \ Emerging precision agriculture techniques can be utilized for both, in order\n\
    to maintain a crop need-based irrigation schedule while avoiding the adverse effects\
    \ of typical\nirrigation management.\nPrecision agriculture techniques rely on\
    \ temporal and spatial crop responses in order to develop\nproduction management\
    \ practices [2]. The application of crop and environmental sensing techniques\n\
    is often utilized to achieve this goal. Remote sensing techniques can be applied\
    \ to measure visible-near\ninfrared spectral changes associated with plant physiological\
    \ conditions. Such plant changes can be\nattributed to biotic or abiotic stress.\
    \ In agriculture, the remote and proximal sensing systems have\nbeen used for\
    \ multiple purposes such as crop disease detection [3], crop water status estimations\
    \ [4],\ncrop nutrient content determination [5], or weed identiﬁcation [6]. Such\
    \ information can be applied to\ndevelop crop and site-speciﬁc management decisions.\n\
    Baluja et al. [4] used a multispectral sensor integrated with an unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicle (UAV)\nto assess the spatial variability of water status in Tempranillo\
    \ vineyards. The results showed the\nnormalized difference vegetation index (NDVI),\
    \ and the ratio between the transformed chlorophyll\nabsorption in reﬂectance\
    \ (TCARI) and the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) as indices\n\
    highly correlated to stomatal conductance (gs, R2 = 0.84, p < 0.05) and stem water\
    \ potential (Ψstem,\nR2 = 0.68, p < 0.05). A signiﬁcant correlation was also found\
    \ between thermal images and the\naforementioned physiological parameters (R2\
    \ = 0.68, p < 0.01 for gs and R2 = 0.50, p < 0.05 for Ψstem).\nMeanwhile, thermal\
    \ data was identiﬁed as a good short-term indicator of water stress; while, NDVI\n\
    and TCARI/OSAVI were identiﬁed as good long-term water stress indicators [4].\
    \ Rodríguez et al. [7]\nmeasured reﬂectance using a spectrometer to determine\
    \ the water status of a Pinot noir vineyard. The\nresults showed that water stressed\
    \ plants were more easily detected at 970 nm. Most of the vegetation\nindices\
    \ (VIs) tested showed correlations with plant water stress levels. The study proposed\
    \ the use of\nthe water index (WI) to assess the plant hydric condition in a vineyard.\
    \ Similarly, canopy temperature\ninformation has been used in vineyards to characterize\
    \ grapevine water status. In this regard, several\nauthors have calculated the\
    \ crop water stress index (CWSI) [4,8,9]. The index normalizes the canopy\ntemperature\
    \ data based on the atmospheric conditions [10]. Bellvert et al. [8] assessed\
    \ the spatial\nvariability in water stress Pinot Noir grape vines using CWSI.\
    \ This index was highly correlated to leaf\nwater potential (ΨL) where leaf-level\
    \ temperature data was acquired using an infrared thermometer\n(R2 = 0.83, p <\
    \ 0.0001) and a thermal infrared sensor integrated with a small UAV (R2 = 0.71,\
    \ p < 0.0001).\nSimilarly, Möller et al. [9] investigated the use of a thermal\
    \ infrared sensor to monitor the effects of\nwater deﬁcit in grape vines. The\
    \ obtained results showed a high correlation between CWSI and gs\n(R2 = 0.91,\
    \ p < 0.0001).\nThe use of optical sensors mounted on UAVs allows data collection\
    \ with high temporal and\nspatial resolution to evaluate the crop water status.\
    \ In this sense, different studies have been carried\nout in grapevines for water\
    \ status characterization [4,8,9]. Nevertheless, the local conditions, vine\n\
    cultivar, irrigation technique, and management practices can greatly inﬂuence\
    \ the applicability of\nsensing systems for water status evaluations. Therefore,\
    \ in this study, a UAV integrated sensing\nsystem was tested to assess the grapevine\
    \ responses under different subsurface irrigation regimes and\nsensing (multispectral\
    \ and thermal infrared sensors) data was compared with crop responses (stomatal\n\
    conductance and fruit yield).\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Site Location and\

    \ used to collect high resolution multispectral and thermal images\nof the ﬁeld\
    \ site. The UAV (ARF OktoXL 6S12, HiSystems GmbH, Moormerland, Germany) is a remote\n\
    controlled and unmanned small-size octocopter with a total payload of up to 4\
    \ kg and ﬂight time of\nup to 36 min. The UAV system was powered with a 6500 mAh\
    \ Lithium-ion polymer battery pack.\nA radio transmitter (MX20 Hott, Graupner,\
    \ Stuttgart, Germany) with a range of up to 4 km was used to\nremotely control\
    \ the UAV. A thermal infrared camera (Tau 2 640, FLIR® Systems, Wilsonville, OR,\
    \ USA)\nand a modiﬁed multispectral digital camera (NiteCanon ELPH110, LDP LLC,\
    \ Carlstadt, NJ, USA)\nwith red (R), green (G), and near infrared (NIR, 800–900\
    \ nm) bands were used for aerial imaging. The\nsensors were mounted onto a gimbal\
    \ underneath the UAV that is capable of automatically adjusting\nthe pitch and\
    \ roll shifts to the pre-set level during the ﬂight. Sensor ﬁrmware was enabled\
    \ to acquire\ngeo-referenced interval imaging every 5 s. In case of the thermal\
    \ infrared sensor, 8-bit JPG images\nwith 32,000 pixels (640 × 512) per image\
    \ were acquired. The captured multispectral images were\nof 16.1 megapixels (4608\
    \ × 3456) resolution. The spatial resolution was 9.0 and 2.6 cm/pixel for the\n\
    thermal infrared and multispectral images collected in this study, respectively.\
    \ A reference panel\n(CSTM-SRT-99-100, Spectralon Reﬂectance Target, Spectra Vista\
    \ Cooperation, New York, NY, USA)\nwas used for radiometric calibration. Images\
    \ were stored on an on-board the secure digital card.\nMultispectral and thermal\
    \ infrared images were acquired at 80 and 44 days before harvest (DBH),\nrepresenting\
    \ two critical growth stages in grapevine production, i.e. bunch closure and seven-days\n\
    post-veraison (onset of ripening). In addition, data was acquired at 100 DBH that\
    \ conﬁrmed the\nabsence of treatment effects at the start of the season.\n2.3.\
    \ Response Variables\nStomatal conductance was measured using a leaf porometer\
    \ (SC-1, Decagon devices, Pullman,\nWA, USA). Mature and sun exposed leaves were\
    \ selected for data collection from reference vines\nin each plot at both 80 and\
    \ 44 DBH. All measurements were collected between 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.,\na period\
    \ known for stable stomatal conductance in vines [8]. Moreover, fruits from each\
    \ reference vine\nwithin a treatment plot were harvested and weighed at commercial\
    \ maturity. This data was used as a\nproduction variable.\n2.4. Image Processing\
    \ and Statistical Analysis\nMultispectral and thermal infrared images covering\
    \ the entire treatment plots were selected\nfor image processing and analysis\
    \ (Figure 2). Each of the thermal infrared images was saved as a\ndata ﬁle to\
    \ retain the raw temperature of each pixel within the image. Distortion correction\
    \ was\nperformed in multispectral images using ImageJ® software [14]. Thermal\
    \ and multispectral images\nwere individually analyzed using algorithms developed\
    \ in Matlab® using Image Processing Toolbox\n(version: R 2015b, Mathworks, Natick,\
    \ MA, USA). Selected multispectral images were radiometrically\ncalibrated with\
    \ a white reﬂectance reference panel. Regions of interest (ROI) were extracted\
    \ manually\nfrom images covering the treatment plot. The average temperature,\
    \ normalized difference vegetation\nindex (NDVI), and green normalized difference\
    \ vegetation index (GNDVI) were extracted from selected\nROI (Equations 1 and\
    \ 2). In the case of the multispectral images, the indexes were determined from\n\
    the calculated digital numbers in the image after radiometric calibration.\nNDVI\

    \ has been well documented in previous grapevine studies under the surface or\

    \ deficit irrigation \nexperiment in grapevines and found yield reduction by 25%\

    \ there was a 40% reduction in the yield when grapevines were irrigated at 15%\
    \ ETc \nfrom the fruit set to harvest. These results are in agreement with this\
    \ study. The reduction in yield \ncan be associated with the low leaf area of\
    \ plants growing under water stress conditions [20]. \nSimilarly, water stress\
    \ induces a decrease in CO2 assimilation and stomatal conductance [21,22]. It\
    \ \nresults in reduced photosynthesis and can translate to lower production. \
    \ \nStomatal conductance is indicative of water stress as it represents the carbon\

    \ The reduction in yield can be associated with\nthe low leaf area of plants growing\

    3.5. Correlations between Thermal Infrared Data and Response Variables\nA negative\
    \ correlation (p < 0.01) was observed when canopy temperature was compared to\n\
    normalized stomatal conductance at 80 and 44 DBH, with a correlation coefﬁcient\
    \ of −0.68 and −0.63,\nrespectively (Figure 11). Baluja et al. [4] found a correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient of −0.82 in rainfed grapes using\na thermal camera mounted in an\
    \ UAV. Similarly, Zarco-Tejada et al. [30] in a citrus orchard under a\ndeﬁcit\
    \ irrigation experiment obtained a correlation coefﬁcient of −0.88 between stomatal\
    \ conductance\nand canopy temperature with UAV-based thermal imaging. Stomatal\
    \ conductance-canopy temperature\ncorrelation coefﬁcients obtained in this study\
    \ were higher than those obtained with NDVI or GNDVI\nestimates at 80 DBH. Consequently,\
    \ analysis of thermal images appears to be useful for a better\nassessment of\
    \ the short term water condition in a vineyard compared to the NDVI or GNDVI data.\n\
    Baluja et al. [4] reported similar results with thermal and vegetation indices\
    \ data in rainfed vineyards.\nThe results could potentially be used to estimate\
    \ stomatal conductance from thermal images obtained\nfrom UAVs. The method is\
    \ also high-throughput and more representative of the spatial variability to\n\
    record vineyard water status.\nRemote Sens. 2017, 9, 961\n12 of 15\nRemote Sens.\

    \ (TIR) multi-/hyperspectral and sun-induced ﬂuorescence (SIF) approaches\ntogether\
    \ with classic solar-reﬂective (visible, near-, and shortwave infrared reﬂectance\
    \ (VNIR)/SWIR)\nhyperspectral remote sensing form the latest state-of-the-art\
    \ techniques for the detection of crop\nwater stress. Each of these three domains\
    \ requires dedicated sensor technology currently in place\nfor ground and airborne\
    \ applications and either have satellite concepts under development (e.g.,\nHySPIRI/SBG\
    \ (Surface Biology and Geology), Sentinel-8, HiTeSEM in the TIR) or are subject\
    \ to\nsatellite missions recently launched or scheduled within the next years\
    \ (i.e., EnMAP and PRISMA\n(PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa,\
    \ launched on March 2019) in the VNIR/SWIR,\nFluorescence Explorer (FLEX) in the\
    \ SIF). Identiﬁcation of plant water stress or drought is of utmost\nimportance\
    \ to guarantee global water and food supply. Therefore, knowledge of crop water\
    \ status\nover large farmland areas bears large potential for optimizing agricultural\
    \ water use. As plant\nresponses to water stress are numerous and complex, their\
    \ physiological consequences aﬀect the\nelectromagnetic signal in diﬀerent spectral\
    \ domains. This review paper summarizes the importance of\nwater stress-related\
    \ applications and the plant responses to water stress, followed by a concise\
    \ review\nof water-stress detection through remote sensing, focusing on TIR without\
    \ neglecting the comparison\nto other spectral domains (i.e., VNIR/SWIR and SIF)\
    \ and multi-sensor approaches. Current and\nplanned sensors at ground, airborne,\
    \ and satellite level for the TIR as well as a selection of commonly\nused indices\
    \ and approaches for water-stress detection using the main multi-/hyperspectral\
    \ remote\nsensing imaging techniques are reviewed. Several important challenges\
    \ are discussed that occur\nwhen using spectral emissivity, temperature-based\
    \ indices, and physically-based approaches for\nwater-stress detection in the\
    \ TIR spectral domain. Furthermore, challenges with data processing\nand the perspectives\
    \ for future satellite missions in the TIR are critically examined. In conclusion,\n\
    information from multi-/hyperspectral TIR together with those from VNIR/SWIR and\
    \ SIF sensors\nwithin a multi-sensor approach can provide profound insights to\
    \ actual plant (water) status and the\nrationale of physiological and biochemical\
    \ changes. Synergistic sensor use will open new avenues\nfor scientists to study\
    \ plant functioning and the response to environmental stress in a wide range\n\
    of ecosystems.\nKeywords: remote sensing; thermal infrared (TIR); water stress;\

    Water-deﬁcit stress, usually shortened to water or drought stress, describes the\
    \ plant physiological\nresponses induced by a lack of available water due to either\
    \ soil water deﬁcit or high evaporative\ndemand of the atmosphere. Water stress\
    \ induces dehydration in the plant and prevents plant cells\nfrom keeping water\
    \ concentrations at an acceptable and healthy level [1,2]. Therefore, water stress\
    \ is\none of the most critical abiotic stressors limiting plant growth, crop yield\
    \ and quality concerning food\nproduction [3,4].\nSince the global population\
    \ is projected to grow by about 2.3 billion people between 2015 and 2050\nand\
    \ societies are changing from low to medium per capita income, global food demand\
    \ is expected\nto double within the same time [5–7]. Therefore, one of the most\
    \ challenging tasks of our generation\nis to meet the second Sustainable Development\
    \ Goal as deﬁned in the 2030 agenda for sustainable\ndevelopment by the United\
    \ Nations: “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and\npromote\
    \ sustainable agriculture” [8]. In this respect, agricultural processes need to\
    \ be optimized and\ninnovative farming methods must be developed to guarantee\
    \ global food supply, as arable land and\nenvironmental resources have almost\
    \ reached the limits of sustainability.\nWater is the most valuable resource of\
    \ our planet. Presently, agriculture consumes 80–90% of the\nfreshwater used by\
    \ humans worldwide and about two thirds of this freshwater is required for crop\n\
    irrigation [9]. Therefore, the ultimate goal must be a reduction in the amount\
    \ of water used per unit\nyield [10].\nIn addition, anthropogenic climate change\
    \ is predicted to cause an increase of 1.0–2.5 ◦C in the\nannual mean global temperature\
    \ over the next 50 years with a tremendous impact on agriculture [11].\nConsequently,\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET) rates will increase and thus, the demand of water for\
    \ crop\nirrigation will further rise. At the same time, extreme weather events\
    \ such as droughts will appear\nmore frequently and be more severe. These facts\
    \ add some extra pressure to increasing global water\nscarcity and the need for\
    \ saving water.\nHence, it is desired to reduce the amount of water used per unit\
    \ yield by reducing yield loss\nand by reducing the amount of water used for irrigation.\
    \ To achieve this goal, early detection and\nmonitoring of plant responses to\
    \ water stress in agricultural crops are mandatory. Remote sensing\noﬀers the\
    \ opportunity to acquire high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution data as\
    \ input for\nprecision agriculture [12]. Precision agriculture promises great\
    \ potential to close the yield gap by\noptimizing food production using the right\
    \ management practice at the right place and the right time\nwhile keeping the\
    \ consumption of resources at an environmentally sustainable level [13].\n2. Plant\
    \ Responses to Water Stress\nPlant responses to water stress are numerous and\
    \ complex (see [4,14–16] for comprehensive\nreviews). They appear synergistically\
    \ or antagonistically and are modiﬁed by co-occurring plant\nstresses under ﬁeld\
    \ conditions (Figure 1) [4,17,18].\nTherefore, it remains diﬃcult to detect and\n\
    monitor plant water deﬁcit based on a single plant response [19]. In general,\
    \ water deﬁcit causes\nphysiological and biochemical changes which induce a reduction\
    \ in photosynthesis and thus plant\ngrowth [16]. However, the timing, intensity,\
    \ and duration of water stress are crucial to determine the\nplant physiological\
    \ responses and their impact on plant metabolism [20]. For example, under mild\n\
    water-stress conditions, plant regulation of water loss and uptake still allows\
    \ the plant to maintain\nrelative leaf water content with no or only little change\
    \ in photosynthetic capacity. In contrast, severe\nwater deﬁcit induces serious\
    \ physiological and biochemical changes, which lead to eﬀects ranging\nfrom inhibition\
    \ of photosynthesis and growth to leaf wilting and the loss of key pigments such\
    \ as\nchlorophyll and thus to irreversible damages to the photosynthetic machinery\
    \ [15–17]. Hence, plants\nhave developed multiple mechanisms to prevent severe\
    \ damage through water stress [21].\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n3 of 24\nRemote\

    93 \nThe first plant response to water stress is stomatal closure, which prevents\
    \ transpirational water \n94 \nloss (e.g., [4,15,17]). In particular, stomatal\
    \ closure is the response to either a deficit in soil water sup-\n95 \nply or\
    \ to low-humidity atmosphere with high evaporative demand. It is commonly assumed\
    \ that \n96 \nstomatal response is rather linked to soil water content than to\
    \ leaf water content. This suggests that \n97 \nstomata are most likely triggered\
    \ by chemical signals, such as the accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) \n98 \n\
    in dehydrated roots rather than by a reduced cell turgor [4]. However, under severe\
    \ and/or prolonged \n99 \nwater stress, cell turgor, and leaf water content is\
    \ also reduced [15]. As a consequence, the exchange \n100 \nof water vapor between\
    \ plants and atmosphere is reduced by stomatal closure and thus, the evapo-\n\
    101 \nrative cooling effect is decreased resulting in an overall increase of plant\
    \ surface temperature com-\n102 \npared to a plant which does not suffer from\
    \ water stress [14,18,22].  \n103 \nHowever, the stomata not only control plant\
    \ transpiration but also plant respiration which in-\n104 \nhibits CO2 uptake\
    \ and fixation. As a result of stomatal closure, the photosynthetic rate is reduced,\
    \ \n105 \nwhich causes a reduction in cell division and thus slows down leaf growth\
    \ and reduces the rate of \n106 \nleaf surface area expansion. A persistent water\
    \ deficit will further damage the photosynthetic ma-\n107 \nchinery through loss\
    \ of chlorophyll, which finally introduces changes in leaf color and wilting \n\
    108 \n[15,16,20]. Another plant response to water stress is the change in sun-induced\
    \ fluorescence (SIF). \n109 \nWhile the photosynthetic rate is reduced by a decreased\
    \ CO2 uptake due to stomatal closure, irradi-\n110 \nance and absorbed photosynthetically\
    \ active radiation (fAPAR) remain constant. In general, energy \n111 \nabsorbed\
    \ by plant pigments (i.e., the chlorophylls and carotenoids) is dissipated by\
    \ three competitive \n112 \nprocesses (i.e., photosynthesis, SIF, and heat emission).\
    \ Consequently, a reduced photochemistry as \n113 \ninduced by water stress results\
    \ in several physiological mechanisms to protect the plant against pho-\n114 \n\
    toinhibition. These mechanisms foster non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and reduce\
    \ SIF [23,24].  \n115 \nBesides these plant responses to water stress, osmotic\
    \ adjustment is a further strategy to prevent \n116 \nirreversible damage. Osmotic\
    \ adjustment describes the process of the accumulation of solutes such \n117 \n\
    as carbohydrates and proteins to maintain the cell turgor at osmotic equilibrium\
    \ [25]. \n118 \nIn summary, plant responses to water stress can be recognized\
    \ as a sequence of physiological \n119 \nand biochemical changes depending on\
    \ the severity and duration of plant water deficit. Hence, the \n120 \ndetection\
    \ of water-stress symptoms is a function of time and depends on the plant responses\

    \ plant responses,\nand the multi-/hyperspectral remote sensing techniques for\
    \ the detection of environmental stresses\n(modiﬁed after Jones and Vaughan [19]).\n\
    The ﬁrst plant response to water stress is stomatal closure, which prevents transpirational\
    \ water\nloss (e.g., [4,15,17]). In particular, stomatal closure is the response\
    \ to either a deﬁcit in soil water\nsupply or to low-humidity atmosphere with\
    \ high evaporative demand. It is commonly assumed that\nstomatal response is rather\
    \ linked to soil water content than to leaf water content. This suggests that\n\
    stomata are most likely triggered by chemical signals, such as the accumulation\
    \ of abscisic acid (ABA)\nin dehydrated roots rather than by a reduced cell turgor\
    \ [4]. However, under severe and/or prolonged\nwater stress, cell turgor, and\
    \ leaf water content is also reduced [15]. As a consequence, the exchange of\n\
    water vapor between plants and atmosphere is reduced by stomatal closure and thus,\
    \ the evaporative\ncooling eﬀect is decreased resulting in an overall increase\
    \ of plant surface temperature compared to a\nplant which does not suﬀer from\
    \ water stress [14,18,22].\nHowever, the stomata not only control plant transpiration\
    \ but also plant respiration which inhibits\nCO2 uptake and ﬁxation. As a result\
    \ of stomatal closure, the photosynthetic rate is reduced, which\ncauses a reduction\
    \ in cell division and thus slows down leaf growth and reduces the rate of leaf\n\
    surface area expansion. A persistent water deﬁcit will further damage the photosynthetic\
    \ machinery\nthrough loss of chlorophyll, which ﬁnally introduces changes in leaf\
    \ color and wilting [15,16,20].\nAnother plant response to water stress is the\
    \ change in sun-induced ﬂuorescence (SIF). While the\nphotosynthetic rate is reduced\
    \ by a decreased CO2 uptake due to stomatal closure, irradiance and\nabsorbed\
    \ photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) remain constant. In general, energy\
    \ absorbed by\nplant pigments (i.e., the chlorophylls and carotenoids) is dissipated\
    \ by three competitive processes (i.e.,\nphotosynthesis, SIF, and heat emission).\
    \ Consequently, a reduced photochemistry as induced by water\nstress results in\
    \ several physiological mechanisms to protect the plant against photoinhibition.\
    \ These\nmechanisms foster non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and reduce SIF [23,24].\n\
    Besides these plant responses to water stress, osmotic adjustment is a further\
    \ strategy to prevent\nirreversible damage. Osmotic adjustment describes the process\
    \ of the accumulation of solutes such as\ncarbohydrates and proteins to maintain\
    \ the cell turgor at osmotic equilibrium [25].\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n\
    4 of 24\nIn summary, plant responses to water stress can be recognized as a sequence\
    \ of physiological\nand biochemical changes depending on the severity and duration\
    \ of plant water deﬁcit. Hence, the\ndetection of water-stress symptoms is a function\
    \ of time and depends on the plant responses to water\ndeﬁcit and their corresponding\
    \ physiological changes, which may be sensitive to diﬀerent remote\nsensing techniques.\n\
    3. Remote Sensing of Water Stress\nRemote sensing is one of the key technologies\
    \ in precision agriculture, which has an enormous\ndemand for geospatial information\
    \ [12,13]. Besides the information needs for soil properties, crop\nnutrients,\
    \ crop biomass, and diseases, farmers and decision makers have a major interest\
    \ in the\ndetection of plant responses to environmental and water stresses [26–30].\
    \ In general, remote sensing\nprovides a fast, cost-eﬃcient, non-destructive,\
    \ and spatio-temporal measure of numerous physiological,\nbiochemical and structural\
    \ crop characteristics at diﬀerent scales (ground, airborne, and satellite).\n\
    Plants can be irreversibly aﬀected before visible symptoms of water stress appear\
    \ [15–17]. Therefore, a\npre-symptomatic or pre-visual detection of plant physiological\
    \ changes can essentially contribute to\navoiding severe crop damages [31]. Hyperspectral\
    \ imagery, with its continuous spectral data, has the\npotential to provide further\
    \ insights into the relationship between the spectral features and associated\n\
    plant conditions [32]. Focusing on the detection of plant responses to environmental\
    \ stresses, the main\nmulti-/hyperspectral remote sensing techniques are thermal\
    \ imaging (TIR; 8–14 µm), visible, near- and\nshortwave infrared reﬂectance (VNIR/SWIR;\
    \ 0.4–2.5 µm), and sun-induced ﬂuorescence (SIF 0.685 and\n0.74 µm).\n3.1. Thermal\
    \ Infrared Domain\nSince the 1970s TIR remote sensing (8–14 µm) has been recognized\
    \ as a potential tool for early\nplant water-stress detection. In general, emitted\
    \ radiance in the TIR contains two intrinsic kinds of\ninformation: (i) surface\
    \ temperature (i.e., “directional radiometric surface temperature” as deﬁned\n\
    by [33]) of the object of interest and (ii) its spectral emissivity.\n3.1.1. Temperature\
    \ and Emissivity Separation (TES)\nTo derive both accurate surfaces temperatures\
    \ and emissivity spectra, from hyperspectral TIR\ndata, two fundamental problems\
    \ have to be solved (e.g., [34–36]). First, atmospheric correction is\nneeded,\
    \ hence, the spectral radiance measured at sensor consists not only of the radiance\
    \ emitted by the\nobject of interest itself but also includes thermal radiation\
    \ emitted by surroundings and reﬂected from\nthe surface of the object (down-welling\
    \ radiance (DWR)). It is further inﬂuenced by the intervening\natmosphere in terms\
    \ of absorption, emission, and scattering (upwelling radiance and transmittance\n\
    (τ) of the atmosphere). In the past, upwelling path and τ were mostly neglected\
    \ for short distance\nﬁeld measurements. However, it has been shown by MIDAC (Model\
    \ M4401-F; MIDAC Corporation,\nCA, USA) measurements over agricultural site’s\
    \ in Barrax (Spain) that atmospheric correction is\nrequired (and possible) for\
    \ such short distance measurements [37]. For airborne or satellite imagery\nthe\
    \ correction of atmospheric distortions is essential. Second, a solution to the\
    \ so-called TES-problem\nis required. The measured spectral radiance is, regarding\
    \ Planck’s law, a function of the absolute\ntemperature and the spectral emissivity\
    \ of the observed object. Thus, if the radiance is measured in n\nbands, there\
    \ will be n + 1 unknowns, n emissivities values, plus the surface temperature.\
    \ Therefore, to\nretrieve accurate surface temperatures, the spectral emissivity\
    \ must be known and vice versa.\nWhile in theory, the TES represents an ill-posed\
    \ problem, hyperspectral data in comparison\nto multispectral data allows a good\
    \ ﬁt to Planck’s radiance curve for a speciﬁc temperature [38].\nPresently, a\
    \ variety of algorithms exist which diﬀer in the underlying assumptions and the\
    \ data\nbasis.\nA comprehensive review is given by Li et al. [39].\nIn general,\
    \ it must be distinguished\nbetween short (indoor and outdoor measurement with\
    \ 1–3 m) and large (ﬁeld or air- and spaceborne\nmeasurements) sensor–target distances.\
    \ For short distance ﬁeld measurements, the new approach\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11,\
    \ 1240\n5 of 24\nby Timmermans et al. [37] oﬀers an auto-correction for atmospheric\
    \ eﬀects in TIR by: (i) calculating\ntransmissivity from hot and cold blackbody\
    \ measurements, (ii) using a simple atmospheric radiative\ntransfer model based\
    \ on MODTRAN for the retrieval of the atmospheric gas-constituents (i.e., H2O\n\
    and CO2). Besides, the Spectral Smoothness method introduced by Horton et al.\
    \ [40] is a widely used\nand accurate TES-approach for short distance ﬁeld measurements.\
    \ This is because the smoothness\napproach requires no a priori knowledge, neither\
    \ the maximum value of the emissivity nor the\ncorresponding wavenumber. The atmospheric\
    \ emission lines (i.e., H2O) are negatively oriented if\nthe sample temperature\
    \ is overestimated and vice versa. Using this atmospheric characteristic, the\n\
    target emissivity spectrum can be accurately retrieved by iteratively changing\
    \ the target temperature.\nHowever, this approach is only suitable for outside\
    \ measurements in the presence of atmospheric\nwater vapor lines. Because atmospheric\
    \ features are not present or much lower in closed rooms, the\nReference Channel\
    \ or the Blackbody Fit should be used alternatively for indoor measurements [41].\n\
    Concerning measurements from a greater distance (ﬁeld, airborne or satellite),\
    \ atmospheric upwelling\npath and τ cannot be neglected. The Automatic Retrieval\
    \ of Temperature and Emissivity using Spectral\nSmoothness (ARTEMISS) by Borel\
    \ [42] is a hybrid approach, combining atmospheric correction and\nTES. First,\
    \ the required atmospheric parameters (DWR, upwelling radiance, τ) are determined\
    \ using a\nMODTRAN (MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission) look-up-table\
    \ (LUT). To this end, a\npre-selection of potential atmospheric parameters is\
    \ completed by using the In-Scene Atmospheric\nCompensation (ISAC) approach by\
    \ Young et al. [43]. Finally, spectral emissivity is retrieved using a\nspectral\
    \ smoothness approach called ISSTES (Iterative Spectrally Smooth Temperature and\
    \ Emissivity\nSeparation, [44]). In comparison to other in-scene atmospheric correction\
    \ approaches, such as ISAC\nor AAC (Autonomous Atmospheric Compensation, [45]),\
    \ ARTEMISS does not require any a priori\nknowledge and considers DWR. Therefore,\
    \ ARTEMISS can be considered the state-of-the-art algorithm\nfor hyperspectral\
    \ TIR airborne data.\n3.1.2. Temperature-Based Approach\nMeasuring leaf or canopy\
    \ temperature for the detection of plant responses to water-deﬁcit stress\nis\
    \ based on the idea of Tanner [46]. It is well established from the leaf energy\
    \ balance equation that leaf\ntemperature varies with (evapo-) transpiration rates\
    \ of the leaves and hence is a function of stomatal\nconductance [46–48]. The\
    \ transpiration rate is inversely correlated with leaf temperature [49]. The\n\
    underlying principle is that if plant water status decreases, leaf transpiration\
    \ is reduced as a result\nof active regulation of stomatal aperture [31]. Consequently,\
    \ the inhibited evaporative cooling eﬀect\nleads to higher leaf and canopy temperatures\
    \ in comparison to a well-watered plant (see Section 2\nof this review). Normally,\
    \ the leaf temperature of a fully transpiring plant is about 2–5 K below the\n\
    ambient air temperature [50]. Thus, leaf or canopy temperature depends substantially\
    \ on the stomatal\nconductance [22]. Accordingly, as stomatal closure is the initial\
    \ plant response to water deﬁcit, TIR\nremote sensing of leaf and/or canopy temperature\
    \ has become an established technique to detect\npre-visual water stress (e.g.,\
    \ [22,51–55]).\nThe major limitation of the temperature-based approach is that\
    \ the use of leaf or canopy temperature\nvalues alone cannot directly estimate\
    \ the physiological status of crop plants [49]. This is because\nleaf temperatures\
    \ measured under natural ﬁeld conditions are very sensitive to highly ﬂuctuating\n\
    environmental factors such as air temperature, humidity, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ (VPD), wind speed,\nand incident radiation. Therefore, a variety of crop water-stress\
    \ index approaches have been developed\nin the past with the aim of estimating\
    \ plant water stress more quantitatively by normalizing radiatively\nmeasured\
    \ leaf temperatures to actual environmental conditions. Following, a concise overview\
    \ of\nthe most important approaches of TIR sensing for water-stress detection\
    \ is given (see [22,51,55] for\ncomprehensive reviews).\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11,\
    \ 1240\n6 of 24\nThe ﬁrst development was the normalization of plant temperatures\
    \ against air temperature\nformulated in the Stress Degree Day (SDD) by Jackson\
    \ et al. [56] and Idso et al. [57]. This approach\nis based on the diﬀerence between\
    \ leaf and air temperature (Tleaf − Tair) measured 1–1.5 h after solar\nnoon.\
    \ The appearance of water stress is assumed as soon as Tleaf − Tair rises above\
    \ 0 K. A further\nimprovement of SDD was the commonly established and mostly used\
    \ index for remotely sensed\nwater-stress detection, the Crop Water Stress Index\
    \ (CWSI, see Table 1 [52,53]):\nCWSI = (Tleaf − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ Tleaf is the measured leaf temperature, Twet is the lower boundary for canopy\
    \ temperature,\nassuming a leaf with stomata fully open and a maximum potential\
    \ transpiration rate, and Tdry is the\nupper boundary represented by a non-transpiring\
    \ leaf with stomata completely closed. The greatest\nadvantage of CWSI, in comparison\
    \ to the simple approach of SDD, is the inclusion of current leaf\ntemperature\
    \ (Tleaf) and their extreme limits (i.e., Twet and Tdry). By deﬁning these potential\
    \ boundaries,\nCWSI also implicitly accounts for eﬀects of free convection on\
    \ the plant water stress, and thus indirectly\nconsiders not only current air\
    \ temperature but also other environmental factors (i.e., wind, radiation,\nVPD,\
    \ etc.). Therefore, CWSI should be adaptable to any crop under any meteorological\
    \ condition.\nA variety of approaches have been developed to estimate Twet and\
    \ Tdry as the input of CWSI\ncalculation. While the analytical CWSI is a combination\
    \ of leaf temperature measurements and actual\nmicro-meteorological data (e.g.,\
    \ wind, air temperature, VPD), the empirical approach only accounts for\nleaf\
    \ temperature, air temperature, VPD and two empirically determined calibration\
    \ variables [55].\nDespite CWSI performing reasonably well in dry and hot climates\
    \ with high VPD, its performance\nis limited in humid climates with low VPD and\
    \ high variability in wind speed, cloud cover, and thus\nincident radiation [22].\
    \ Therefore, the most powerful approach to overcome these problems is the\nuse\
    \ of artiﬁcial reference surfaces. This approach allows simultaneous measurement\
    \ of reference\nand leaf temperature. The main advantage of using artiﬁcial reference\
    \ surfaces is that no additional\nmeteorological measurements are required and\
    \ all the needed values can be measured within the\nsame image even for the spatial\
    \ scale implementation (e.g., [22,55,58]). However, the use of artiﬁcial\nreference\
    \ surfaces presents some problems regarding the choice of material and its handling\
    \ in the\nﬁeld. In principle, it should have the same aerodynamic and optical\
    \ properties as the real leaves.\nFurthermore, its spectral emissivity must be\
    \ close or similar to the emissivity of the observed leaves to\nprevent errors\
    \ in temperature estimation [22]. At the airborne and satellite scale, the application\
    \ of\nartiﬁcial reference surfaces seems to be diﬃcult [59] and could be replaced\
    \ by larger wet references as\nsuggested by Meron et al. [60].\nRemote Sens. 2019,\

    \ derivatives of the CWSI are the Water Deﬁcit Index (WDI, [61]) and the thermal\

    \ soil pixels within a ﬁeld. Based on some rearrangement\nof the leaf energy balance\
    \ equation, IG has the advantage over CWSI that it is directly linearly related\n\
    to stomatal conductance [55].\nBecause of the enormous potential of temperature-based\

    \ to bridge\nthe gap between low-resolution satellite images and small-scale in\

    \ majority of studies uses broadband TIR sensors to estimate temperature-based\
    \ indices for\nthe detection of plant responses to water stress [59,97–100]. Broadband\
    \ TIR imagers (i.e., one spectral\nband in the wavebands of 7–14 µm) are based\
    \ on the assumption of a constant emissivity (e.g., 0.97\nfor vegetation), which\
    \ does not exist in nature [101]. Thus, neglecting the spectral emissivity of\
    \ the\nleaves themselves limits the accuracy of temperature estimation. For example,\
    \ an error in the assumed\nemissivity of 1% results in absolute temperature errors\
    \ of about 1 K [22]. However, new hyperspectral\nTIR imagers provide innovative\
    \ techniques to overcome this limitation by many narrowband measures,\nwhich allow\
    \ precise spectral emissivity retrieval and hence better surface temperature estimation\n\
    compared to broadband thermal cameras (for more details see Section 3.1.4 in this\
    \ review).\n3.1.3. Emissivity-Based Approach\nDespite a variety of geological\
    \ applications using TIR spectroscopy (e.g., [102,103]), up to now,\nhyperspectral\
    \ TIR remote sensing of plant properties has received little attention.\nThe general\n\
    assumption that vegetation does not provide suitable spectral features in the\
    \ TIR to study plant\nphysiological traits depends on several issues as summarized\
    \ by Ribeiro da Luz and Crowley [104]:\n(i) general lack of hyperspectral instruments\
    \ for remote sensing (most available setups are based on\nlaboratory equipment),\
    \ (ii) very low and complex spectral emissivity variations are originating from\n\
    complex plant physiological and biochemical processes, (iii) low signal-to-noise-ratio\
    \ (SNR) as well as\nlow spatial and spectral resolution of airborne or satellite\
    \ remote sensing TIR sensors fail to detect\nminor variations in plants TIR spectral\
    \ ﬁngerprint, (iv) proper atmospheric correction and advanced\nTES methods are\
    \ needed to retrieve accurate emissivity spectra.\nOnly a few researchers have\
    \ studied vegetation spectra in TIR thus far. Salisbury [105] was\nthe ﬁrst who\
    \ recognized detectable spectral variations in fresh leaves of 13 diﬀerent tree\
    \ species\nusing Directional Hemispherical Reﬂectance (DHR) measurements at the\
    \ laboratory level. In 2007,\nRibeiro da Luz and Crowley [104] associated vegetation\
    \ spectral features to leaf chemical compounds\nsuch as cellulose, xylan, lignin,\
    \ cutin, and silica. Furthermore, they were the ﬁrst who carried out\nsuitable\
    \ ﬁeld, canopy and airborne measurements of vegetation spectra in the TIR domain\
    \ [106]. These\nﬁndings, together with recent advances in sensor technology and\
    \ the availability of hyperspectral\nTIR imagers (see Table 2; e.g., Telops HyperCam-LW,\
    \ Speciem AisaOWL, Itres TASI-600, SEBASS\n(Spatially Enhanced Broadband Array\
    \ Spectrograph System), HyTES) facilitate new possibilities to\ndetect environmental\
    \ stresses based on spectral emissivity. The main underlying advantage of TIR\n\
    spectral information in comparison to the VNIR/SWIR domain is that TIR spectral\
    \ features originate\nfrom primary absorption bands of biochemical leaf compounds\
    \ (e.g., cellulose) and should thus\nexhibit higher spectral contrast as VNIR/SWIR\
    \ spectra which are mainly dominated by overtones and\ncombination modes of fundamental\
    \ vibrations originating from the interactions between solar radiation\nand leaf\
    \ contents (e.g., leaf pigments) [107]. Therefore, changes in the compositions\
    \ of leaf constituents\ninduced by water stress should be accompanied by changes\
    \ in the emissivity spectra (e.g., [108]).\nHowever, only little eﬀort has been\
    \ directed to the detection of plant responses to environmental\nstresses based\
    \ on spectral emissivity. Buitrago et al. [62] showed the ability of spectral\
    \ emissivity to\ndetect water and cold stress on both European beech (Fagus sylvatica)\
    \ and rhododendron (Rhododendron\ncf. catawbiense) leaves using DHR laboratory\
    \ measurements. Gerhards et al. [63] conducted further\nsuccessful research on\
    \ the utility to use spectral emissivity for the detection of water stress on\
    \ potato\nplants (Solanum tuberosum L. Cilena).\n3.1.4. Physically-Based Approach\n\
    Since the temperature-based indices only provide the relative measures of plant\
    \ stress, the\nphysically-based modeling of evapotranspiration (ET) could oﬀer\
    \ an alternative approach not only for\nthe detection of plant responses to water\
    \ deﬁcit, but, also to gain further insights into the interaction\nof plants with\
    \ the intervening pedosphere and atmosphere under environmental stress conditions.\n\
    Intrinsic water use by crops is principally determined by transpiration (T), thus,\
    \ accurately quantifying\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n10 of 24\ncrop T and its\
    \ spatial variability is a key metric to account for the crop consumptive water\
    \ use and\ncontribute to water resource management needed in both ecology and\
    \ agriculture.\nAmong the ranges of techniques used to measure ET (e.g., lysimetric,\
    \ Bowen-ratio energy balance\nand the eddy covariance) [109–111], eddy covariance\
    \ (EC) is the most promising for continuous\nmonitoring of ET. However, it is\
    \ hindered by several technical, economic, and environmental factors,\nand sometimes\
    \ suﬀers due to extended periods of non-operation [112]. EC does not provide spatially\n\
    explicit ET, and thus is not ideally suited for the research purposes of water-stress\
    \ detection. However,\nTIR remote sensing provides the ability of synoptic, spatially\
    \ continuous, and frequent observations of\nET at varying spatial and temporal\
    \ scales.\nEstimation of ET through TIR remote sensing is based on surface energy\
    \ balance (SEB)\nmodeling [113–117]. In state-of-the-art SEB models, λE (evaporation\
    \ as latent heat ﬂux) is derived\neither as a residual of the SEB or through partitioning\
    \ of the net available energy (ϕ) (i.e., net radiation,\nRN-soil heat ﬂux, G).\
    \ The principal assumption of using land-surface temperature (LST) in a SEB model\n\
    is, TIR remote sensing can give direct information of the land-surface moisture\
    \ status inﬂuencing the\nsurface energy ﬂuxes and their partitioning [113,118].\
    \ This LST is directly integrated into physical SEB\nmodels [115] which describes\
    \ the heat ﬂux between the surface and atmosphere by an electrical analog\nwhich\
    \ is driven by a diﬀerence in temperature (as a potential) with the rate controlled\
    \ by aerodynamic (or\nboundary layer) conductance (gA). Examples are: the one-source\
    \ approach that treats the soil-vegetation\nsystem as a single unit and derive\
    \ lumped evaporation [116,119]; or the two-source approach treating\nthe soil-vegetation\
    \ system separately, thereby decomposing LST into soil and vegetation temperatures,\n\
    so that evaporation and transpiration can be retrieved individually [113,120,121].\
    \ Both approaches\nfollow a bottom-up scaling approach and combine LST with radiation,\
    \ meteorological and VI data to\nsolve for sensible heat ﬂux (H) and estimate\
    \ ET as a residual in the SEB equation. However, solving\nthis aerodynamic approach\
    \ causes additional problems, particularly in relation to the speciﬁcation\nof\
    \ gA which is generally not measurable at scales in which TIR remote sensing is\
    \ applied. So far, the\nadoption of some empirical models to determine this conductance\
    \ is the state-of-the-art which makes\nET estimates prone to signiﬁcant uncertainties\
    \ [122,123].\nTo circumvent such problem, a non-parametric and calibration-free\
    \ ET estimation approach has\nbeen developed: the STIC model (Surface Temperature\
    \ Initiated Closure, [124–128]) for simultaneously\nestimating ET, H, gA and canopy-surface\
    \ conductance (gS), surface moisture status, and ET components\n(evaporation,\
    \ E, and transpiration, T) from the data itself. The STIC formulation is based\
    \ on physical\nintegration of LST into the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation to ﬁnd\
    \ analytical solutions to gA, gS, and the\naerodynamic temperature (T0) thereby\
    \ obtaining a “closure” of the SEB. This approach simultaneously\ncaptures the\
    \ critical feedbacks between gA, gS, T0, and VPD surrounding the evaporating surface.\
    \ The\nestimates of conductances, ET, and associated surface ﬂux components obtained\
    \ through STIC are\nindependent of any land-surface parameterization [128,129],\
    \ thus having the potential to overcome\nsome of the major stumbling blocks of\
    \ the currently available thermal ET algorithms.\nBeyond ET, water stress is an\
    \ important factor for inferring the surface and root zone water\nstatus [130].\
    \ Based on the ratio of ET to potential evaporation, Anderson et al. [114] developed\
    \ the\nevaporative stress index (ESI) for continental-scale water-stress mapping.\
    \ Water stress is generally\nobtained by combining simulated ET and the theoretical\
    \ upper limit of ET under unstressed surface\nconditions. While a recent study\
    \ of Delogu et al. [131] assessed the performance of a two-source Soil\nPlant\
    \ Atmosphere and Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration (SPARSE) model for predictions\
    \ of water\nstress from the ET components of soil and canopy; Yang et al. [132]\
    \ used ESI to capture crop stress and\nimpacts on regional yield variability in\
    \ water-limited agricultural regions. Apart from that, ESI is also\nused in the\
    \ U.S. [133,134], Brazil [135], and the Czech Republic [136] to demonstrate the\
    \ importance of\nET-based water stress to explain regional yield variability in\
    \ water-limited agroecosystems.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n11 of 24\n3.2. Comparison\
    \ to Other Spectral Domains\nOver the past four decades, remote sensing of vegetation\
    \ has focused on the solar- or\noptical-reﬂective domain of the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum (0.4–2.5 µm; VNIR/SWIR) with a large number\nof available multi- and\
    \ hyperspectral sensors at ground- (e.g., ASD FieldSpec, SpectralEvolution PSR+),\n\
    airborne- (e.g., AVIRIS, HyMap, HySpex, Aisa FENIX), and spaceborne-level (e.g.,\
    \ Landsat, SPOT,\nMODIS, IKONOS; HYPERION). Optical-reﬂective remote sensing is\
    \ based on the spectral reﬂectance\nproperties of mainly the leaves, the canopy\
    \ and the underlying soil [32,137]. Especially hyperspectral\ndata opened the\
    \ opportunity for the development of narrowband vegetation indices (VIs), simplifying\n\
    the interpretation of complex vegetation reﬂectance signatures based on their\
    \ indirect relationships\nto plant physiological and structural parameters [138]\
    \ such as canopy water content (e.g., MSI; [69]),\ngreenness or fractional vegetation\
    \ cover (NDVI; [66]), or photosynthetic activity (PRI; [64]). All of these\nVIs\
    \ are somehow sensitive to the current plant water status (e.g., chlorophyll and\
    \ water content, as well\nas photosynthetic rate and leaf or canopy structure\
    \ change under water-stress condition [15,16,20])\nand thus can be used as indicators\
    \ for the detection of plant water stress [73,100,139]. However, VIs\nrelated\
    \ to chlorophyll or leaf water content are related to late plant responses which\
    \ tend to arise\nwith visible symptoms (i.e., changing leaf color, leaf rolling,\
    \ or wilting). Thus, it can be assumed that\ntheir usage for pre-visual water-stress\
    \ detection in crops is limited. On the contrary, PRI is directly\nlinked to the\
    \ photosynthetic process due to short-term changes in xanthophyll pigments under\
    \ stress\nconditions. Therefore, PRI is considered a pre-visual index for water-stress\
    \ detection. For instance,\nSuárez et al. [140] and Panigada et al. [73] illustrated\
    \ the feasibility of PRI as a pre-visual water-stress\nindicator at airborne level.\
    \ Suárez et al. [140] observed robust relationships with canopy temperatures\n\
    for various crops (e.g., r2 = 0.8 for peach trees, r2 = 0.65 for olive trees,\
    \ r2 = 0.72 for maize). Additionally,\nPanigada et al. [73] found that PRI is\
    \ more sensitive to an early plant water-stress stadium than\ntraditional VIs\
    \ (e.g., NDVI). However, the ability of the PRI to be used for water-stress detection\
    \ is not\nconclusive [63,73,139].\nIn contrast, remote sensing of SIF, the passive\
    \ measurement of chlorophyll ﬂuorescence emission\npeaks centered at 685 nm and\
    \ 740 nm, is considered a direct indicator of photosynthetic eﬃciency [72] and\n\
    has become more and more prominent over the last decade (see Meroni et al. [71]\
    \ for a comprehensive\nreview). Simpliﬁed, the rationale for remote sensing of\
    \ SIF is based on the competitive interactions of\nhow radiative energy absorbed\
    \ by leaf chlorophyll is processed within the plant: (i) most of the energy\n\
    is used for the photochemical conversion to sugars through photosynthesis, (ii)\
    \ the non-used energy is\nrapidly re-emitted through chlorophyll ﬂuorescence or\
    \ (iii) heat dissipation [23]. Since CO2 uptake\nis reduced under water-stress\
    \ conditions and thus energy used by photosynthesis is also decreased,\nmeanwhile\
    \ the amount of radiative energy remains constant, SIF and/or heat dissipation\
    \ would\nconsequently also change. Therefore, changes in SIF might be highly correlated\
    \ with photosynthetic\neﬃciency and it can thus be assumed to be a proxy for early\
    \ detection of plant responses to water\nstress [72,141,142]. Many ground-based\
    \ studies have been undertaken to demonstrate the feasibilities\nof ﬂuorescence\
    \ sensing to detect and monitor plant stresses. Additionally, current advances\
    \ in sensor\ntechnology have opened new opportunities to focus on SIF imaging\
    \ from airborne and even spaceborne\nplatforms. Since the ﬂuorescence signal is\
    \ considerably lower (about 1–2% of the total energy reﬂected\nand emitted by\
    \ plants) than the plant reﬂectance used by optical sensor systems, a sensor for\
    \ SIF\nsensing requires an extremely high SNR which traditionally limits other\
    \ sensor abilities (i.e., spectral\nand/or spatial resolution). Apart from this\
    \ limitation, the ﬂuorescence emission peaks appear in\nsuper-narrow spectral\
    \ windows within the spectral range from 650 to 800 nm, requiring extremely high\n\
    spectral resolution in the range of nanometers. Notwithstanding, the major potential\
    \ of SIF remote\nsensing could be presumed from the FLEX (Fluorescence Explorer)\
    \ satellite mission supported by the\nEuropean Space Agency (ESA). Although recent\
    \ experiments based on airborne data demonstrated\nthe utility of SIF for quantitative\
    \ plant stress detection [139,142], further multi-sensor airborne studies\n(e.g.,\
    \ comparative research of SIF, VNIR/SWIR and TIR) are needed to establish a consistent\
    \ basis for a\nrobust assessment.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n12 of 24\nSince\
    \ diﬀerent plant stresses co-occurring under ﬁeld conditions cause various plant\
    \ responses,\na multi-sensor approach not only provides useful information about\
    \ current plant status but also\non the causes of biophysical, physiological,\
    \ and photochemical changes. Several airborne studies\nexamined the relationship\
    \ between diﬀerent remote sensing approaches for water-stress detection,\nranging\
    \ from optical indices over SIF to temperature-based indices. For example, Panigada\
    \ et al. [73]\nperformed a comparative analysis on airborne level. They found\
    \ that temperature-based indices\nperformed best in comparison to SIF and optical\
    \ indices (e.g., PRI) in cereal crops under diﬀerent\nirrigation levels. Similar\
    \ results were obtained by Gerhards et al. at ground [63] and airborne\nlevel\
    \ [143]. However, a hyperspectral multi-sensor airborne approach with its high\
    \ spatial, spectral,\nand temporal resolution has great potential to bridge the\
    \ gap between in situ and satellite observation.\nFurthermore, such concepts provide\
    \ profound insights into the actual plant status and the rationale\nof physiological\
    \ and biochemical changes. Thus, integrated use of thermal and narrowband optical\n\
    imagery to accurately retrieve stress-related plant responses as an input for\
    \ agricultural applications\n(e.g., irrigation scheduling, phenological growth\
    \ stage assessment, agricultural species detection) is\nhighly recommended.\n\
    4. Challenges and Future Perspectives\n4.1. Relationship between Spectral Emissivity\
    \ Features and Leaf Traits\nCurrent advances in sensor technology have opened\
    \ the opportunity for imaging hyperspectral\nremote sensing of vegetation in the\
    \ TIR spectral domain and thus to use spectral emissivity for the\ndetection of\
    \ environmental stresses. However, only a few studies have been conducted that\
    \ examine\nspectral emissivity in remote sensing of vegetation. For example, Ullah\
    \ et al. [144] and Rock et al. [145]\ndemonstrated that speciﬁc spectral features\
    \ in the TIR signature are related to various plant species.\nFurthermore, for\
    \ the ﬁrst time, water stress was detected through changes in spectral emissivity\
    \ as\nmeasured by imaging TIR spectroscopy at ground level [63]. Additional studies\
    \ by Buitrago et al. [62]\nand Buitrago Acevedo et al. [146] provided promising\
    \ results on the relation between leaf structural or\nbiochemical characteristics\
    \ and leaf emissivity spectra.\nHowever, the utility of spectral emissivity for\
    \ the detection of plant responses to environmental\nstresses is limited. For\
    \ example, it is still unknown which physiological and biochemical processes\n\
    cause changes in the spectral emissivity and how they are related. Furthermore,\
    \ the major challenge\nof emissivity-based applications of TIR remote sensing\
    \ is the upscaling from ground to airborne\nand satellite level. Ribeiro da Luz\
    \ and Crowley [106] and [147] were able to discriminate diﬀerent\ntree species\
    \ based on their airborne emissivity features but most of the spectral information\
    \ of plant\nemissivity spectra is lost through scaling eﬀects (e.g., mixed pixel,\
    \ cavity eﬀects), which are still largely\nunknown. Furthermore, current TIR satellites\
    \ do not accomplish the requirements (i.e., high SNR, high\nspectral and spatial\
    \ resolution) to measure the low spectral contrast emissivity features of vegetation\n\
    from space. Consequently, the upscaling of emissivity-based approaches for water-stress\
    \ detection\nfrom space is very limited yet. Therefore, further fundamental research\
    \ is absolutely needed to better\nunderstand the relations between the spectral\
    \ emissivity features and changes in leaf traits under\nenvironmental stress conditions\
    \ at diﬀerent remote sensing scales.\n4.2. Thresholds for Temperature-Based Indices\n\
    In comparison to VNIR/SWIR indices, temperature-based indices provide an appropriate\
    \ pre-visual\nproxy for the detection of plant responses to water stress, which\
    \ already has been demonstrated earlier\nby Zarco-Tejada et al. [100] and Panigada\
    \ et al. [73]. Therefore, TIR indices have an enormous potential\nto be applied\
    \ in precision agriculture and especially in irrigation management to determine\
    \ the right\ntime, the right place and the right amount of water to apply to reduce\
    \ the amount of water used per\nunit yield. However, it is still unclear when\
    \ to irrigate the ﬁelds and how much water the crops need.\nCWSI is pointed out\
    \ to be applicable for the detection of crop water stress in diﬀerent crop types,\n\
    Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n13 of 24\nseasonal growing stages, and even various\
    \ climates. Notwithstanding, further research is needed to\nestablish generally\
    \ accepted calculations of CWSI to determine thresholds for irrigation scheduling.\
    \ In\nparticular, CWSI can be estimated following various approaches from the\
    \ analytical CWSI to the use of\nartiﬁcial reference surfaces for the calculation\
    \ of Twet and Tdry. In addition, crop-speciﬁc thresholds of\nCWSI are needed to\
    \ consider plant-speciﬁc strategies to environmental stresses such as various\
    \ leaf\nstructural architectures (e.g., hypo- or amphistomatous leaves, cuticle\
    \ thickness, trichomes). Since the\ntemperature diﬀerences between stressed and\
    \ non-stressed plants are low in cold and humid climates\ndue to the low VPD,\
    \ further care must be taken when applying thresholds of CWSI in more temperate\n\
    climate zones [48,51].\n4.3. ET Modeling\nThe uncertainties and challenges of\
    \ TIR remote sensing to derive ET are mainly categorized\ninto three generic classes,\
    \ namely (i) calibration, parameterization uncertainty and spatial scaling\nuncertainty,\
    \ (ii) representative spatial and temporal resolution uncertainty, (iii) ET partitioning\n\
    water-stress characterization uncertainty.\nSome of the fundamental challenges\
    \ in ET mapping through SEB models have evolved due to, (i)\nthe inequality between\
    \ LST and the aerodynamic temperature (T0), which is essentially responsible\n\
    for the exchanges of H [124,125,148,149]; (ii) a non-unique relationship between\
    \ T0 and LST due to\ndiﬀerences between the roughness lengths (i.e., eﬀective\
    \ source/sink heights) for momentum (z0M) and\nheat (z0H) within vegetation canopy\
    \ and substrate complex [124,150–152]; (iii) the unavailability of a\nuniversally\
    \ agreed model to estimate spatially explicit T0 [125,153]; (iv) the lack of a\
    \ physical-based\nor analytical gA model as a true representative for spatial\
    \ application [124,125]; (v) complexities in\ngA parameterization to accommodate\
    \ the diﬀerences between the scalar roughness lengths of heat\n(z0H) and momentum\
    \ (z0M) transfer. Such parameterizations are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by land-surface\n\
    heterogeneity and could cause the ET severely overestimated in the semi-arid or\
    \ arid ecosystems.\nField-scale ET mapping demands both high temporal and spatial\
    \ resolution images. Therefore,\ndedicated exploitation of both thermal infra-red\
    \ (IR) and shortwave infrared bands could be helpful to\ndirectly constrain the\
    \ elements of the SEB and ﬁeld-scale water status [154]. Another major challenge\
    \ in\nSEB-based ET estimates using polar orbiting sensors is associated with integration\
    \ of one-time-of-day\nET estimates to daily ET. In the water-unlimited ecosystems,\
    \ the diurnal course of ET closely follows\nsinusoidal pattern of net radiation\
    \ [155]. Therefore, sinusoidal integration is generally followed to\nextrapolate\
    \ the instantaneous ET to daily ET, with the assumption of self-preservation of\
    \ evaporative\nfraction. However, in the water-stressed ecosystems, morning rise\
    \ in LST leads to rapid decline of the\ntopsoil moisture and diurnal ET is substantially\
    \ lagged behind the net available energy from 11 a.m.\nThus, the assumption of\
    \ diurnal conservation of evaporative fraction is violated in such ecosystems\n\
    and sinusoidal integration could lead to overestimation of daily ET.\nET is an\
    \ absolute, physical quantity, but it also needs to be translated into quantitative\
    \ water-stress\ninformation for inferring the surface water status and the root\
    \ zone soil moisture by partitioning of\nET into evaporation (E) and transpiration\
    \ (T) [130,156]. Contemporary ET partitioning frameworks\nuse single soil-vegetation\
    \ composite surface skin temperature (i.e., LST). The two-source SEB model\nproposes\
    \ an arguable underlying assumption to down-regulate transpiration from its potential\
    \ upper\nlimit to actual [113], the model assumes suﬃcient accessibility of water\
    \ in the root zone to transpire\nat a potential rate. Thus, the modeled potential\
    \ transpiration rate is a valid ﬁrst guess estimate for\nT under water-unlimited\
    \ conditions. However, if vegetation stress is ignored in the ﬁrst guess, the\n\
    resulting evaporation will decrease to unrealistic levels (negative ﬂuxes) to\
    \ maintain the same total\ncomposite LST and T will be substantially overestimated.\
    \ Such ambiguous assumptions need to be\nstudied and improvised in detail for\
    \ routine mapping of ﬁeld-scale water stress in semi-arid and arid\necosystems,\
    \ and in the Mediterranean climates.\nNot only the challenges of TIR remote sensing\
    \ to derive ET are numerous but also ET modeling\nitself. due to aforementioned\
    \ criticalities in determining the aerodynamic (gA) and canopy-substrate\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n14 of 24\nconductance (gC) [157], and T0 [151]. Observations\
    \ of gA and gC are not available at the respective\nscales and their estimation\
    \ relies heavily on the empirical parameterizations of surface roughness,\ndisplacement\
    \ height, and atmospheric stability correction, which degrades the performance\
    \ of the\nmodels especially in the water-stressed ecosystems. A new ET model,\
    \ SPARSE [130,158], is particularly\ndesigned for ET mapping in water-scarce ecosystems\
    \ and tends to overcome the T0 vs. LST inequality\nchallenges. The non-parametric\
    \ STIC ET model [125–128], has also been developed to circumvent the\nchallenges\
    \ of scalability of empirical conductance functions for satellite-based ET mapping,\
    \ and is\nthe only model that estimates spatially explicit ET without any biophysical\
    \ parameterization of the\nconductances [124]. For successful application of SEB\
    \ models in ET mapping, it is not only important\nto have an LST component in\
    \ the model, but, another crucial importance is to have an ensemble\nET from a\
    \ range of LST-driven models to obtain the best ET estimate for respective crop,\
    \ soil, and\nhydrometeorological conditions.\n4.4. Data Processing\nThe main challenge\
    \ of all TIR approaches for the detection of crop water-stress at airborne\nand\
    \ satellite level is associated with sensor related technical limitations and\
    \ scale eﬀects. From the\ntechnical side, instrument SNR, atmospheric correction,\
    \ and TES are the most challenging tasks to\nbe solved. Meanwhile, scale eﬀects\
    \ are dealing with constraints originating from mixed pixels and\ncanopy structure-related\
    \ factors such as scattering, re-radiation and cavity eﬀects [95]. For example,\
    \ the\ndisaggregation of crop temperature from the much warmer soil pixels is\
    \ of great interest for the accuracy\nof temperature-based indices and ET modeling\
    \ approaches as retrieved from airborne- and satellite\nplatforms [159]. However,\
    \ since the pre-processing of TIR data is essential for the retrieval of both\n\
    spectral emissivity and surface temperature, the major limitation of hyperspectral\
    \ TIR remote sensing\nfrom airborne- and satellite platforms persists in the lack\
    \ of appropriate data processing schemes.\nTherefore, further research is especially\
    \ needed in the development and implementation of solid\natmospheric correction\
    \ processing schemes and TES algorithms. Since hyperspectral remote sensing\n\
    in the TIR is currently limited to ground- and airborne level and thus only available\
    \ for small-scale\nstudies, there is a demand for hyperspectral satellite TIR\
    \ missions with regional or global coverage.\n4.5. Satellite Multi-/Hyperspectral\
    \ TIR Missions\nSince multi- and hyperspectral TIR satellites are currently missing,\
    \ mission designs such as\nHiTeSEM (High-resolution Temperature and Spectral Emissivity\
    \ Mapping [95]) HyspIRI (Hyperspectral\nInfrared Imager [94]), and LSTM (Land-Surface\
    \ Temperature Monitoring [96]) provide very promising\nperspectives towards the\
    \ application of multi-/hyperspectral TIR for the detection of environmental\n\
    stresses from space.\nFurthermore, in 2018 four innovative Earth-observation instruments\
    \ were launched and tested\nfor potential future satellite-based plant function\
    \ monitoring on the International Space Station\n(ISS) [93]. This multi-sensor\
    \ approach covers a wide range of instruments for the survey of novel\nregional\
    \ and global insights into ecosystem processes and functions. The instruments\
    \ are the Global\nEcosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI, NASA), the Ecosystem\
    \ Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer\nExperiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS, NASA),\
    \ the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-3, NASA),\nand the Hyperspectral Imager\
    \ Suite (HISUI, JAXA). GEDI carries a LiDAR (Light Detection And\nRanging) measuring\
    \ canopy structural parameters (e.g., height, biomass). TIR data products (i.e.,\n\
    surface temperature, ET) will be delivered by ECOSTRESS. SIF is measured by OCO-3\
    \ and HISUI\ndelivers surface reﬂectance (10 nm spectral resolution) in the VNIR/SWIR.\
    \ The data products will be\nfreely available and will open the unique opportunity\
    \ for scientists to examine the performance and\ncapabilities of such innovative\
    \ satellite-based multi-sensor approach to study plant functioning and\nthe response\
    \ to environmental stress in a wide range of ecosystems. In particular, the ECOSTRESS\n\
    instrument on ISS will oﬀer ﬁrst prospects for future TIR satellite missions.\
    \ However, the atmospheric\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1240\n15 of 24\ncorrection\
    \ of the data is very challenging due to the changing height of the ISS. Thus,\
    \ the data from the\nupcoming TIR satellite missions are expected to be more beneﬁcial.\n\
    4.6. Representativness and Compatibility\nThe justiﬁcation of water-stress research\
    \ originates due to the increases in agriculture because of\npopulation growth,\
    \ and increases in environmental stressors (such as drought). However, most of\
    \ the\ncurrent satellite missions fail to have representative spatial and/or temporal\
    \ resolutions. Because of\ntechnical limitations of the remote sensing sensors,\
    \ current state-of-the-art thermal infrared sensing\nsatellites either deliver\
    \ high temporal (e.g., MODIS, AVHRR, or Sentinel-3 with 1–3 days revisit time;\n\
    Table 2) but coarse spatial resolution (i.e., 1 km) or high spatial (e.g., Landsat\
    \ series, ASTER with ~100 m;\nTable 2) but low temporal (i.e., 16 days) resolution\
    \ images. One Solutions to this could be multi-sensor\nscaling, such as pan-sharpening,\
    \ or more complex disaggregation approaches (e.g., thermal sharpening\nor temperature\
    \ unmixing as listed in Zhan et al. [159]). The combination of independent spectral\n\
    domains in a multi-sensor approach would deﬁnitely provide the possibilities of\
    \ new insights in the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere continuum. However, before multi-sensor\
    \ combinations can be performed, one\nof the major challenges in today’s remote\
    \ sensing products (i.e., satellite and airborne), the compatibility\nof such\
    \ datasets originating from diﬀerent platforms and spectral domains with various\
    \ spatial and\ntemporal resolution, needs to be conﬁrmed.\n5. Conclusions\nThis\
    \ review paper has brieﬂy discussed the current state-of-the-art, opportunities\
    \ and limitations\nof multi-/hyperspectral remote sensing approaches for the detection\
    \ of crop water stress. Water-deﬁcit\nstress is of utmost importance to guarantee\
    \ global water and food supply and knowledge of crop\nwater status over large\
    \ farmland areas bear large potential for optimizing agricultural water use. Plant\n\
    responses to water stress can be recognized as a sequence of physiological and\
    \ biochemical changes\ndepending on the severity and duration of plant water deﬁcit.\
    \ Hence, the detection of water-stress\nsymptoms is a function of time and depends\
    \ on the plant responses to water deﬁcit and their\ncorresponding physiological\
    \ changes, which may be sensitive to diﬀerent remote sensing techniques.\nThe\
    \ latest state-of-the-art remote sensing techniques for the detection of crop\
    \ water stress are:\n(i) thermal infrared (TIR) multi-/hyperspectral, (ii) SIF\
    \ approaches and (iii) classic solar-reﬂective\n(VNIR/SWIR) hyperspectral imaging.\
    \ For all three domains dedicated sensor technology is required,\nwhich are currently\
    \ in place for ground and airborne applications and either have satellite concepts\n\
    under development (e.g., HySPIRI, Sentinel-8, HiTeSEM in the TIR) or are subject\
    \ to satellite missions\nrecently launched or scheduled within the next years\
    \ (i.e., EnMAP and PRISMA (launched on March\n2019) in the VNIR/SWIR, FLEX in\
    \ the SIF).\nAlthough TIR remote sensing has several potential advantages over\
    \ optical remote sensing in\ncrop water-stress detection, there are important\
    \ challenges to the large-scale usage of hyperspectral\nTIR remote sensing for\
    \ precision agriculture applications: (i) missing thresholds of temperature-based\n\
    indices (e.g., CWSI) for the application in irrigation scheduling, (ii) profound\
    \ knowledge about the\nrelationship between the spectral emissivity features and\
    \ changes in leaf traits under environmental\nstress conditions is missing, (iii)\
    \ lack of current TIR satellite missions with suitable spectral and\nspatial resolution,\
    \ (iv) lack of appropriate data processing schemes and radiative transfer models\n\
    in TIR spectral domain (including atmospheric correction and temperature emissivity\
    \ separation)\nfor hyperspectral TIR remote sensing at airborne- and satellite\
    \ level. Information from multi-sensor\napproaches, including sensors from all\
    \ three domains (i.e., multi-/hyperspectral TIR, VNIR/SWIR,\nand SIF sensors),\
    \ could provide profound insights about the actual plant status and the rationale\n\
    of physiological and biochemical changes. Furthermore, soil water content (SWC)\
    \ derived by SAR\n(Synthetic Aperture Radar) remote sensing (e.g., Sentinel-1)\
    \ together with ET modeling can add some\nextra information about the soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum.\
    \ All this remotely sensed information\nare independent but interlinked to the\
    \ plant available water in the soil and the resulting ﬂuxes of water\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2019, 11, 1240\n16 of 24\nvapor and heat. A synergistic multi-sensor use will\
    \ provide better information on the crop water status\nthan the information provided\
    \ by a single spectral domain.\nIn particular, hyperspectral TIR remote sensing\
    \ provides a large potential for the detection of crop\nwater stress. Synergistic\
    \ sensor use will open new avenues for scientists to study plant functioning\n\
    and the response to environmental stress in a wide range of ecosystems.\nAuthor\

    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\

    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n13 of 29\n6.1.2. Simulations\nCrop simulation models\
    \ based on ﬁrst principle physical models of crop phenology, soil physics\nand\
    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

    \ the literature on applications of remote sensing for monitoring soil- and\n\
    crop- water status for irrigation purposes. The review is organized into two main\
    \ sections: (1) sensors\nand platforms applied to irrigation studies and (2) remote\
    \ sensing approaches for precision irrigation\nto estimate crop water status,\
    \ evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, soil and crop characteristics\nmethods.\
    \ Recent literature reports several remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor\
    \ crop water\nstatus in the cultivated environment. Establishing the right amount\
    \ of water to supply for different\nirrigation strategies (maximization of yield\
    \ or water use efﬁciency (WUE)) for a large number of\ncrops is a problem that\
    \ remains unresolved. For each crop, it will be necessary to create a stronger\n\
    connection between crop-water status and crop yield.\nKeywords: crop water status;\
    \ water use efﬁciency (WUE); platforms; sensors; evapotranspiration\n(ET); Crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI); time-temperature threshold (TTT); vegetation indices\
    \ (VIs)\n1. Introduction\nFood is the basic and compulsory human requirement.\
    \ It is expected that limited land and\ninadequate water resources will negatively\
    \ impact the expected increase in demand for food crops\nduring the next ﬁfty\
    \ years [1–3]. Subject to scenarios used, and assumptions and models employed,\n\
    different forecasts have been made for food and agricultural production and related\
    \ irrigation water\nneeds. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projections\
    \ indicated a growth rate of world\nconsumption of agricultural products of 1.1%\
    \ per year for the period from 2005 to 2050. In order to\nmeet this projected\
    \ global demand, agricultural production would have to increase by 60% from 2005\n\
    to 2050 [4,5].\nProduction of food requires water. Since water resources are a\
    \ limiting factor for human actions,\nWater Use Efﬁciency (WUE) will be a crucial\
    \ factor [6]. For these reasons, the European Parliament,\nin agreement with the\
    \ Horizon 2020 program, has coined the phrase “produce more with less” [7].\n\
    Agriculture is the main user of water worldwide, accounting for about 70% of total\
    \ water withdrawals,\nincluding the water used in livestock and aquaculture production\
    \ [8]. Furthermore, it is expected that\nthis sector will witness increased water\
    \ consumption of about 20% by the year 2025 [9]. Thus, it is\nwidely expected\
    \ that the competition for water resources in many regions will increase. To meet\
    \ the\nincreasing population’s demands for food and for water, it is critical\
    \ to improve agricultural water\nproductivity, or economic yield per volume of\
    \ water used [1,10].\nForty percent of total agricultural production comes from\
    \ the 20% of the land that is irrigated [11].\nFarmers in developing countries\
    \ have to improve agronomic and water management practices in\norder to increase\
    \ WUE in all agroecosystems (from fully-rainfed to fully-irrigated farming systems).\n\
    Pereira et al., [12] reported that the above goal is chieﬂy important where water\
    \ is a scarce commodity\n(arid and semiarid regions). In these regions, it will\
    \ be crucial to increase water productivity rather\nthan maximizing crop yield.\
    \ Molden et al. [13] suggested, “The adoptions of techniques to improve water\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40; doi:10.3390/horticulturae3020040\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n2 of 36\nproductivity will require an enabling policy\
    \ and an institutional environment that aligns the incentives of\nproducers, resource\
    \ managers and society, and provides a mechanism for dealing with trade-offs”.\
    \ Irrigation\nwater management is sustainable if it realizes the objectives of\
    \ preserving the natural environment\nand sustaining irrigated agriculture for\
    \ food security. Appropriate irrigation practices are aimed at\nimproving WUE\
    \ in order to save water and maintain satisfactory yields [14].\nPainter and Carren\
    \ [15] emphasized the importance of reducing water losses below the root zone,\n\
    improving yield and crop quality, conserving the resource base, and lowering the\
    \ risk of salinization\nof groundwater to enhance sustainability. The authors\
    \ also pointed out that “these gains can only be\nachieved when all elements of\
    \ precision operate synergistically within a given environment”.\nFor improving\
    \ WUE at the regional level, Batchelor [16] suggested four methods of agronomic\n\
    improvements: (1) rely on improved crop husbandry; (2) introduce varieties with\
    \ higher productivity;\n(3) maximize cropped area during periods of low potential\
    \ evapotranspiration and (4) when rainfall is\nhighest, promote water recycling.\n\
    Wallace and Batchelor [17] reported four categories (agronomic, technical, managerial,\
    \ and\ninstitutional) for improving the efﬁciency of irrigation. Technical solutions\
    \ may improve irrigation\nuniformity, reduce leaching, and lead to adoption of\
    \ irrigation practices that increase rainfall\neffectiveness. Among managerial\
    \ improvements, the authors highlighted the implementation of\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ systems based on crop demand. The institutional improvements “rely on the user\n\
    involvement in scheme operation and maintenance; introduction of water pricing\
    \ and legal frameworks to provide\nincentives for efﬁcient water use and disincentives\
    \ for inefﬁcient use; introduction of integrated catchment\nmanagement; improved\
    \ training and extension”. In 2005, Johansson [6] emphasized the importance at\
    \ the\nfarm level of the extension services for improving information or of cheap\
    \ credit for adjusting to the\nchanging environments associated with water policy\
    \ reforms (water-pricing reforms, particularly).\nBecause more efﬁcient irrigation\
    \ practices can optimize WUE [18], and drip irrigation reduced\ncrop evapotranspiration\
    \ losses and runoff [19–21], the technology was appropriate for applying water\n\
    to orchards and vegetables [22]. Proper irrigation (timing and amount) increased\
    \ the crop WUE and\ncrop yield [23]. In contrast, improper irrigation can lead\
    \ to the onset of crop water deﬁcits causing\nwater and nutrient deﬁciencies that\
    \ reduce yield [23,24]. Nevertheless, regardless of the strategy\nengaged, the\
    \ beneﬁts of irrigation scheduling can be reached only by applying the exact amount\
    \ of\nwater required [25]. Raine et al. [26] deﬁne precision irrigation as “the\
    \ accurate and precise application\nof water to meet the speciﬁc requirements\
    \ of individual plants or management units and minimize\nadverse environmental\
    \ impact”. Monitoring water use and crop water status in the ﬁeld is important\n\
    for developing effective precautions, and for this purpose, some indicators are\
    \ required [27]. A very\nlarge body of research, spanning almost four decades,\
    \ has demonstrated that much of the required\nagricultural information can be\
    \ derived from remotely sensed data [28] starting from crop water status\ndetection.\
    \ IN order to develop effective irrigation strategies, it is necessary to identify\
    \ the appropriate\nindicators for monitoring crop water status at the farm level\
    \ [27]. For these purposes, the required\nagricultural information may be derived\
    \ from remotely sensed data [28].\n2. Scope of the Review\nThe applications of\
    \ remote sensing to irrigation monitoring and management are reviewed\nherein.\
    \ The assessment of the ideal crop water requirement is indispensable for several\
    \ objectives\nlinked to agronomic, economic, and environmental issues: (i) maximize\
    \ crop yield (the ’yield gap’);\n(ii) stabilize production by adopting a safeguard\
    \ against the vagaries of weather; (iii) ameliorate crop\nquality; (iv) save water;\
    \ (v) limit onset of diseases; and (vi) limit groundwater pollution caused by\n\
    N leaching losses. A seventh (vii) crucial point is the ’yield gap’ of the environment\
    \ under study.\nThis means deﬁning the potential and constraints of the ﬁeld environment\
    \ (sub optimal management,\ninappropriate technology, and/or lack of training\
    \ of farmers). This is possible when water constraints\non crop production are\
    \ removed by using appropriate irrigation scheduling for getting more crop\nyield\
    \ per drop of water [9,29], contributing to social growth of the irrigated area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n3 of 36\nIn 2008, Fereres [8] called for a more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable irrigation than in the past, at a\ntime when the rate of irrigation\
    \ was expected to slow down, and when the investments in irrigation\nand drainage\
    \ were on the decline. Fereres also emphasized challenges in irrigated agriculture\
    \ due to\nmodernization of irrigation networks and management, the improvement\
    \ of water institutions, and\nthe responses to periodic droughts. The last point\
    \ has imposed the introduction of new water saving\ntechnologies in horticulture.\n\
    A holistic approach is necessary for moving from a traditional approach to precision\
    \ irrigation,\ndeﬁned as site-speciﬁc irrigation management that relies on the\
    \ variable application of water according\nto soil and crop variability. It is\
    \ a potential solution for increasing productivity and reducing the\nenvironmental\
    \ impact of irrigated agriculture. A holist approach needs a deep and precise\
    \ knowledge\nof the crop water requirements and the cultivated environment. The\
    \ innovative deﬁcit irrigation and\npartial root drying management strategies\
    \ [29] have encouraged the development of new methods for\nmonitoring water stress\
    \ (abiotic). Fernández [30] focused on plant-based methods that integrate the\n\
    soil and atmospheric water status and the plant response to the surrounding conditions.\n\
    The present review describes the role of remote sensing with respect to crop water\
    \ status, its\nsurface energy balance, the relationship between surface temperature\
    \ and remotely sensed vegetation\nindices, and WUE and evapotranspiration. This\
    \ review is limited to ﬁeld-key studies, and presents\napplications of remote\
    \ sensing for managing irrigation and water resources for meeting the current\
    \ and\nfuture challenges of agricultural water resources management. A list of\
    \ references is presented\nas a good resource for any who are interested in remote\
    \ sensing applied to irrigation studies.\nThe review is organized into the following\
    \ main sections: (1) Sensors and platforms applied to\nirrigation studies; (2)\
    \ Remote sensing approaches for precision irrigation for estimating crop water\n\
    status, evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, and soil and crop characteristics.\n\
    3. Sensors and Platforms\nJensen et al. [31] reported that the ﬁrst aerial images\
    \ were taken by a camera mounted on a balloon\naround 1859. From the very beginning\
    \ of satellite-based remote sensing in the 1970s, the use of remote\nsensing for\
    \ terrestrial applications has increased tremendously [32]. Remote sensing is\
    \ the acquisition\nof information about an object, or event through the analysis\
    \ of data acquired obtained by a device\nwithout contact with the target under\
    \ investigation [33]. The term remote sensing includes all the\ntraditional primary\
    \ mapping data acquisition technologies [34].\nRemote-sensing instruments are\
    \ designed to identify various wavelengths of the electromagnetic\nspectrum referred\
    \ to as a “band” or “channel”. Each instrument is characterized by a speciﬁc number\n\
    and widths of wavelengths detected; some instruments detect discrete bands, while\
    \ others detect\nfairly narrow wavelengths or broader bands (multispectral, visible\
    \ and near-infrared wavelengths,\nmicrowave, thermal sensing systems) [35–37].\n\
    Remote sensing is able to identify spectral signatures of all surfaces and objects.\
    \ Sensors can sense\ntargets with a speciﬁc spatial resolution of image data deﬁned\
    \ by the smallest spatial area sampled or\nviewed. Digital images are made up\
    \ of pixels, each pixel characterized by speciﬁc spectral and spatial\nattributes\
    \ [38], as the intensity of reﬂectance or emittance measured by a sensor [39].\
    \ Spatial resolution\ncorresponds to the spatial area each displayed or printed\
    \ pixel represents.\nWhen the time image was shot (day or year) is a crucial point\
    \ in interpreting remotely sensed data\nanalysis [40]. If the same area is imaged\
    \ in the morning and late afternoon, a greater number of features\nwith different\
    \ orientations may be discerned than if the area is only imaged in the morning\
    \ [41]; this\nis especially true when interpreting vegetation classes. Multi-temporal\
    \ images are taken at different\ntimes to monitor changes in the environment and\
    \ to analyze numerous processes [42,43]. The temporal\ndynamics may range from\
    \ hours to a number of years. Sexton et al. [44] and Guerschman et al. [45]\n\
    reported that “to assess changes over a time sequence accurately, effects in the\
    \ data not caused by true\nenvironmental changes (such as differing atmospheric\
    \ conditions and sun or view angle positions)\nmust ﬁrst be accounted for”.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n4 of 36\nOther sensors are deﬁned as bidirectional,\
    \ due to the illumination angle at which the energy\nsource strikes the target,\
    \ and the position (angle) at which the instrument receives the emitted or\nthe\
    \ reﬂected energy (called the view angle) as described by Schowengerdt [46] and\
    \ Campbell and\nWynn [47].\n3.1. Remote Sensing Sensors\nDifferent remote sensing\
    \ sensors have been developed for monitoring crop growth and yield, as\nwell as\
    \ the spatial variability within ﬁelds. Many factors may affect crop growth and\
    \ yield variability,\nsuch as soil characteristics, soil fertility, soil moisture,\
    \ canopy volume, biomass and architecture, water\ncontent, and biotic and abiotic\
    \ stress. Different types of sensors can monitor and measure these factors;\n\
    Lee et al. [48] discussed electronic sensors, spectroradiometers, machine vision,\
    \ multispectral and\nhyperspectral sensors, thermal sensors, and machine olfaction\
    \ systems. A detailed review on sensors\nrelated to agricultural crop was reported\
    \ by Ruiz-Altisent et al. [49]. The authors provided an overview\nof sensing technologies\
    \ and application as: (i) electromagnetic sensors, spectroscopic sensors, and\n\
    computer vision; (ii) mechanical contact and acoustic sensors; (iii) biosensors;\
    \ and (iv) wireless-sensor\nnetworks. Wang et al. [50] studied recent development\
    \ and future perspective of wireless sensors in\nagriculture and the food industry.\n\
    Sensors can be divided into several broad categories of basic sensor system types\
    \ such as active and\npassive. Passive sensors (photographic, electro-optic radiometers,\
    \ passive microwave systems visible,\ninfrared, and thermal imaging systems, etc.)\
    \ are the most common for vegetation correlated remote\nsensing. These sensors\
    \ provide helpful information for crop monitoring, but their major limitation\n\
    is the strong relationship among data acquisition and lighting (time of day and\
    \ year; latitude) and\nweather conditions (cloud cover). Data from passive sensors\
    \ requires accurate measurements of solar\nradiation and correction for “atmospheric\
    \ effects” [34,40].\nActive sensors use an artiﬁcial source of energy; in active\
    \ remote sensing, humans can control the\nnature (wavelength, power, duration)\
    \ of the source energy. Active sensors (Radar systems, LiDAR)\ndo not need sun\
    \ light and perfect weather conditions (less dependence on environmental factors);\n\
    therefore, they can be more dedicated and targeted toward the remote sensing objectives\
    \ even at night\nor under adverse conditions (haze, clouds, rain, etc.) [34,40].\n\
    3.2. Remote Sensing Platforms\nThe platform on which a particular sensor is lodged\
    \ states the distance of the sensor from the\ntarget, timing, periodicity, location,\
    \ and extent of coverage of the acquired image. The detailed\ninformation obtained\
    \ is strictly related to the distance between the object of interest and the type\
    \ of\nplatform. Remote sensing platforms can be divided into three groups: satellite,\
    \ airborne and Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs), and ground based solutions. According\
    \ to Matese et al. [51], each of these\nplatforms and sensors shows strengths\
    \ and weaknesses related to technological, operational and\neconomic factors.\n\
    3.2.1. Satellite\nSatellites can be classiﬁed by (i) altitude; (ii) orbital geometry\
    \ (geostationary, equatorial and sun\nsynchronous) and (iii) timing. Regarding\
    \ the ﬁrst point, there are space shuttles orbiting around\n250–300 km above the\
    \ earth; space stations orbiting from 300 to 400 km above; low level satellites\
    \ from\n700 to 1500 km above, and high-level satellites, about 36000 km above\
    \ the earth's surface. The ﬁrst\nremote sensing satellite appeared in 1960 for\
    \ meteorological purposes. Geostationary satellites have a\n24 h-period of rotation,\
    \ so they always stay over the same earth location. Usually, communications\n\
    and weather satellites have often-geostationary orbits, generally located over\
    \ the equator. To ensure\nrepeatable sun illumination conditions during speciﬁc\
    \ seasons, sun synchronous satellites have orbits\nnearly passing over the poles.\
    \ Sensor and orbital characteristics determine the frequency of data\nacquisition\
    \ (Table 1). The satellite frequency ranges from twice a day to every 16 days.\n\

    Toth and Jó´zków [34] reported on new satellite technologies related to microsatellites\
    \ and\nnanosatellites, which increment the number of observations by sharing the\
    \ same orbit. One of the\nﬁrst examples comes from Planet Labs, which launched\
    \ four prototype satellites in order to test the\nperformance of the system [34].\n\
    Satellite\nconstellations\n(Landsat,\nSPOT,\nGlobal\nNavigation\nSatellite\nSystem\n\
    and\nGeoEye/WorldView families;\nRapid Eye) have identical satellites positioned\
    \ on the same\norbit to diminish the revisit time [52,53].\nSatellites that operate\
    \ in dual mode are deﬁned as a constellation, such as GOCE and the dual\nGRACE\
    \ satellites launched in 2009 to measure the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth [54].\n\
    In the recent past, satellites were characterized by a low spatial resolution\
    \ and were used for\nseveral purposes over large geographic areas, but were unable\
    \ to assess crop yield variability within\na ﬁeld [48]. Single satellite based\
    \ systems continue to improve in imaging performance, including\nbetter spatial\
    \ and spectral resolution as well as sensor agility, so in-track and cross-track\
    \ stereo capture\nis available [55]. Currently, new opportunities for mapping\
    \ and monitoring crop yield variability\nare provided by high-resolution satellite\
    \ sensors (e.g., SPOT 6 and 7, Ikonos, Quick-Bird) that have\nnarrowed the gap\
    \ between image by satellite and by airborne vehicles [56,57].\nLandsat series\
    \ from 1 to 7, for example, had a spatial resolution ranging from 30 to 79 m and\
    \ a\nradiometric resolution of 6–8 bits, usable to some extent for mapping water\
    \ quality parameters [58–61].\nLandsat 8 (12-bit radiometric resolution) is suitable\
    \ for remote sensing of water in lakes (even dark\nwith CDOM-rich); although the\
    \ revisit time of 16 days limits its use in routine monitoring of water\nbody\
    \ quality.\nSince\nsatellite\nmeasurements\nare\nnot\nsatisfactory\nfor\nmonitoring\n\
    diurnal\nvariation,\nRoussel et al. [62] noted advantages from the use of electromagnetic\
    \ waves constantly released by the\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\
    \ satellite constellations for retrieving different geophysical\nparameters of\
    \ the Earth's surface. For irrigation purposes, GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) system\
    \ is\nuseful for soil moisture monitoring, because it is able to monitor diurnal\
    \ variation [62].\nSatellite missions, labelled Sentinel 1 up to 5, were set up\
    \ for environmental monitoring [63].\nThe launch of Sentinel-2 in 2015 opened\
    \ a new era in remote sensing. This system has a medium spatial\nresolution, super-spectral\
    \ instrument with a ﬁeld of view of 290 km, a revisit capability of 5 days\n(two\
    \ satellites), a resolution of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, and a moderately large band\
    \ set (13 spectral bands)\naiming to provide global land coverage. The mission\
    \ ensures continuity of the previous missions\n(Landsat and SPOT) and provides\
    \ geochemical and physical variables, land cover maps and land\nchange detection\
    \ maps. Its image spatial resolution (from 60 m to 10 m) allows the monitoring\
    \ of several\nsmall water bodies as reported by Toming et al. [64], who have shown\
    \ that Sentinel-2 was able to map\nwater quality. It may monitor Chlorophyll a\
    \ (Chl a) as an indicator of phytoplankton, Chromophoric\n(or colored) Dissolved\
    \ Organic Materials, and Dissolved Organic Material concentrations.\nImmitzer\
    \ et al. [65] have assessed the suitability of Sentinel 2 data in agriculture\
    \ for land cover\nclassiﬁcations. Results appeared encouraging, although the classiﬁcation\
    \ results for the pixel- and\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n7 of 36\nthe object-based\
    \ approach were not extremely high. The authors relied on the support of two twin\
    \ S2\nsatellites for consistently improving spectral and temporal information\
    \ with high spatial resolution.\nSaadi et al. [66] have conducted an experiment\
    \ on regional evapotranspiration and crop\nwater consumption estimated over an\
    \ irrigated area in Tunisia with the SAMIR model that used\nSPOT high-resolution\
    \ time series. The SAMIR model was calibrated with local evapotranspiration\n\
    measurements taken from ﬂux towers. It was validated at plot and perimeter scales\
    \ using known\nirrigation volumes. The objective of the work was to assess the\
    \ operational feasibility and accuracy\nof SAMIR outputs at plot and perimeter\
    \ scales, in a context of high land cover complexity (i.e., trees,\nwinter cereals,\
    \ summer vegetables) and limited data available for parameterization. The authors\n\
    concluded that acquisition frequency (ﬁve days) of the satellite Sentinel-2 would\
    \ not answer the\nproblem of cloudiness, even in semi-arid conditions, as in the\
    \ case of Tunisia. The authors suggested\nthe combination with Landsat8 or SPOT,\
    \ which have VIS-NIR high-resolution sensors. Using these\ntime series, including\
    \ clear images approximately every 20 days, would make it possible to estimate\n\
    irrigation volumes at perimeters scale. The seasonal volumes estimated by this\
    \ method appeared\nacceptable, even though results at ﬁner timescales (monthly\
    \ and below) need to be improved.\nA variety of variables (e.g., leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content, leaf water content, leaf area index) are\nproposed for Sentinel-2 as\
    \ inputs to earth system models. Van der Werff and van der Meer [63]\nsummarized\
    \ spectral position (λ) and bandwidth (∆λ), spatial resolution, heritage and purpose\
    \ of\nSentinel-2 bands, according to the Copernicus derived user requirements.\n\
    Escorihuela and Quintana-Seguí [67] reported recently on soil moisture measurements\
    \ by remote\nsensing at local and regional scales. Recent technical developments\
    \ have allowed the outgrowth\nof space borne L-band microwave radiometry. Two\
    \ satellite missions, the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity (SMOS, 2009) and the\
    \ Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP, 2015) provide global mapping of\nsurface\
    \ soil moisture based on radiometric measurements at L-band (21 cm, 1.4 GHz).\
    \ The authors\nfound SMOS to be the only satellite able to detect irrigation and\
    \ the only one that does not show clear\nvegetation or roughness effects and is\
    \ able to map irrigated areas. Entekhabi et al. [68] produced\ncomposited maps\
    \ of the difference between weekly mean soil moisture over one week, one month,\n\
    and three months.\nThe NASA report “Microwave Technologies Review and Strategy”\
    \ [69] contained an overview\nof technologies for Earth science measurements involving\
    \ passive microwave radiometry for soil\nmonitoring. The Soil Moisture Active\
    \ Passive mission goal was to produce global maps of surface\nsoil moisture at\
    \ low (36 km) and high resolution (9 km).\nThe mission was based on L-band\nradiometer\
    \ and radar/radiometer measurements for low and high-resolution maps, respectively.\n\
    The preliminary results of the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA)\
    \ for retrieving\n(i) soil moisture; (ii) Vegetation Optical Depth; and (iii)\
    \ scattering albedo estimates, from passive\nmicrowave measurements alone and\
    \ without reliance of a priori information were reported. At L-band,\nthe Vegetation\
    \ Optical Depth was related to total vegetation water content and albedo to structural\n\
    changes. The analysis of these two parameters, at different temporal and spatial\
    \ scales, disclosed the\npotential of L-band microwave sensors for ecological\
    \ studies on a global scale [70]. Kojima et al. [71]\nreport an estimate of Soil\
    \ Moisture Distributions across Small Farm Fields with ALOS/PALSAR.\nThe ALOS\
    \ (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) has an active microwave sensor; PALSAR (Phased\n\
    Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) has a ﬁne resolution of 6.5 m. Because\
    \ of the ﬁne resolution,\nPALSAR provides the possibility of estimating soil moisture\
    \ distributions in small farmlands. Making\nsuch small-scale estimates has not\
    \ been possible with traditional satellite remote sensing techniques.\n3.2.2.\
    \ Airborne Platforms\nAirborne platforms (from 50 m to 50 km) carry out downward\
    \ or sideward sensors to obtain\nearth’s surface images. Airborne platforms give\
    \ images with a spatial resolution of 20 cm or less, much\nhigher than satellite\
    \ maps, but they have low coverage area and high cost per unit area. For these\n\
    reasons, it is not proﬁtable to monitor and map large areas. Airborne missions\
    \ are one-time operations,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n8 of 36\nwhereas satellites\
    \ provide continuous target monitoring [72]. The quality of images acquired may\
    \ be\ndegraded by factors that introduce blurring, improper focusing, atmospheric\
    \ scattering and target\nmotion [34,40]. The ﬁelds of application of airborne\
    \ remote sensing are numerous, such as biodiversity,\nbiogeochemical cycles, climate\
    \ change, eco-hydrology, infectious disease, land use, invasive species.\nFor\
    \ natural and agricultural environments, it is worth mentioning airborne remote\
    \ sensing studies\non vegetation: (i) cover amount; (ii) dominant type; (iii)\

    \ weight. The small systems were deﬁned\nas an UAV of a maximum weight of 25 kg.\
    \ Watts et al. [87], Matese et al. [51], DeBell et al. [88],\nCandiago et al.\
    \ [89], and Toth and Jó´zków [34] describe current UAS systems (ﬁxed and rotating\
    \ wing),\nsolutions and applications. The following description provides only\
    \ the basics for the UAV remote\nsensing ﬁeld; an extended recent review (monograph)\
    \ on the topic can be found in Pajeres [90], as well\nas in Toth and Jó´zków [34].\n\
    Large volumes of UAVs are expected to ﬂy in upcoming years, so safe operation\
    \ is essential for\nthe user and the public. There are extremely large numbers\
    \ of UAV applications to remote sensing [34].\nColomina and Molina [91] reported\
    \ the evolution of the use of UAVs in the ﬁeld of photogrammetry\nand remote sensing.\n\
    Another state-of-the-art example is available in Sankaran et al. [92], who studied\
    \ the use of UAV\ntechnology for various crop applications (crop emergence, vigor,\
    \ characterization of yield potential).\nThe review also reported the potential\
    \ and future perspectives of using UAV imaging to evaluate the\neffect of biotic\
    \ and abiotic stresses for crop breeding and precision crop yield management.\n\
    DeBell et al. [88] suggested that UAVs are set to become a crucial factor of a\
    \ water-resource\nmanagement toolkit. They can ensure high-resolution data (not\
    \ available from other platforms such as\nsatellites or aircrafts), in a cost-effective\
    \ way and in a more sustainable way for water-resource\ntargets.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest the use of UAVs for data analysis of water resource information\n(e.g.,\
    \ regular surveys of reservoir resources, soil moisture assessments by thermal\
    \ imaging, more\neffective consumption).\nAn interesting point of view was reported\
    \ by Anderson [53], who put an emphasis on remote and\nproximal sensing changes\
    \ due to a variety of sensors ﬁtted to drones and kites to improve ﬁne-grained\n\
    understanding of environmental processes. Anderson et al. [93] also proposed a\
    \ grassroots remote\nsensing and democratic mapping for delivering rapid spatial\
    \ data (GeoTIFF images) from lightweight\ndrones and kites with open-source geospatial\
    \ toolkits and android smartphone apps.\nUAVs offer many advantages with respect\
    \ to other platforms, the main one relying on readiness\nand repeatability of\
    \ the measurements. The UAV operator can monitor the procedure and decide\nto\
    \ repeat the ﬂight if something went wrong. Conversely, each satellite has a speciﬁc\
    \ revisit time\n(see Table 1), and it is almost impossible to replicate a survey.\
    \ The airborne ﬂights try to reduce costs\nby bringing together several targets\
    \ and actions (e.g., one strip on different subjects or many strips on\nthe same\
    \ one). This prevents modiﬁcation of the ﬂight plan. The operation costs are the\
    \ lowest for\nthe UAVs, which are ﬂexible and may change sensors/missions/objectives\
    \ easily. However, satellite\nsensors cannot be replaced when they are obsolete\
    \ or out of service.\n3.2.4. Ground-Based Platforms\nThe more common ground-based\
    \ platforms (up to 50 m) are tripods, towers, poles, and cranes,\nas well as instruments\
    \ mounted on vehicles. They are characterized by different land coverage:\nshort\
    \ (50–100 m), medium (150–250 m), and long (up to 1 km).\nPlatforms may be temporary\n\
    or permanent and are usually used to support research projects, even for micro-meteorological\n\
    measurements like, for example, for Bowen-ratio and Eddy-covariance [94].\nImportant\
    \ data can be also collected in the ﬁeld using vehicle-mounted instruments.\n\
    O’Shaughnessy et al. [95] have studied how to enhance crop-water-use efﬁciency\
    \ by reducing\nirrigation losses and enhancing soil water availability. The authors\
    \ underline that abiotic and biotic\nfactors can increase the yield gap through\
    \ a reduction of water use and of crop yield potential.\nEmerging technologies,\
    \ such as wireless communication, may be integrated with soil and plant sensors\n\
    (variable-rate irrigation equipment, and decision support systems).\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n10 of 36\nAqeel-ur-Rehman et al. [96] discussed different examples\
    \ of the use of sensors and their networks\nfor agriculture and irrigation purposes.\
    \ Damas et al. [97] developed an automatic irrigation system\nwith signiﬁcant\
    \ water conservation (i.e., up to 30–60%). Evans and Bergman [98] worked on precision\n\
    irrigation control of self-propelled, linear-movement and center-pivot irrigation\
    \ systems, controlled by\nwireless technology. To improve water use efﬁciency,\
    \ Morais et al. [99] implemented a smart irrigated\nsystem piloted by a wireless\
    \ data acquisition network to acquire environmental (climate) and soil\nmoisture\
    \ data. Basu et al. [100] set a drip-irrigation-control system characterized by\
    \ remote sensing\ndata acquisition. Kim et al. [101] devised a site-speciﬁc sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system equipped with a\nreal time sensor (using Bluetooth and GPS\
    \ technologies) and control software based on soil moisture,\ntemperature and\
    \ weather information data. Kim and Evans [102] and Evans et al. [103] improved\n\
    the above noted irrigation system with “in-ﬁeld data feedback to support the decision-making\
    \ and real-time\nmonitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio\
    \ communication”. Thompson et al. [104]\nstudied soil moisture sensors to support\
    \ the decision-making irrigation management scheduling.\nThe study was aimed at\
    \ determining threshold values of soil water characteristics (matric potential\n\
    and available soil water content), using appropriate values of leaf water potential\
    \ for pepper, melon,\nspring tomato and winter tomato crops.\n4. Approaches to\
    \ Precision Irrigation\nRemote sensing has many potential applications in many\
    \ ﬁelds and at different scales. Table 2\nlists ﬁeld applications of remote sensing\
    \ in agriculture. Moran et al. [28] summarized the important\nrole of remote sensing\
    \ in site-speciﬁc farming.\nRemote Sensing can provide non-destructive, automatic,\
    \ and continuous measurements, easily\nimplemented with data transmission systems\
    \ for the user to have nearly real time access to the\ncollected data from a remote\
    \ computer, smart phone or similar [30].\nMost of these methods\nand related systems\
    \ are highly sensitive and capable of working under ﬁeld conditions for long\n\
    periods. These characteristics confer great potential for both monitoring water\
    \ stress and scheduling\nirrigation [105].\nTable 2. Applications of remote sensing\

    \ resources\nRemote sensing can provide precise information of irrigated crop\
    \ areas [106] by monitoring the\nphenological development of crops through multi-temporal\
    \ image [107].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n11 of 36\nCrop water status is the\
    \ crucial biophysical property, used in particular to manage irrigation\nby remote\
    \ sensing. It is, in most cases, directly associated to the available soil water\
    \ content, and in\nother conditions to soil salt content when salinity is a limiting\
    \ factor of water uptake. Similarly, plant\ndiseases, which may be obstacles to\
    \ plant-water ﬂow, may negatively inﬂuence crop water status,\nwhich becomes an\
    \ indicator of disease presence and severity [108,109]. Crop water status can\
    \ be\nquantiﬁed at the canopy and leaf levels, by monitoring leaf or stem water\
    \ potential, or leaf water\ncontent [110]. Unfortunately, this simplistic view\
    \ is complicated by several plant factors (root signaling,\naerodynamic characteristics\
    \ of vegetation, genetic control of crop performance, etc.), which interact\n\
    in a complicated way with environmental factors, such as solar radiation (intensity\
    \ and insulation),\nwind speed and direction, air humidity, and air temperature.\
    \ Plant species may or may not be highly\ncoupled to the environment [111]. The\
    \ Ω coefﬁcient (or decoupling coefﬁcient) is a measure of the\ncoupling between\
    \ conditions at the canopy surface and in the free airstream (well above the crop),\
    \ and\ncan vary between 0 (for perfect coupling) to 1 (for complete isolation).\
    \ Jones [111] reports Ω values of\n0.85, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3 for strawberry, tomato,\
    \ raspberry, and citrus orchards, respectively. In other words, a\ncitrus orchard\
    \ is more coupled to the environment than more dense horticultural crops. The\
    \ concept is\nsummarized by Hsiao [112], who stated that relatively open, tall\
    \ and aerodynamically rough canopies\nmade of small leaves facilitate turbulence\
    \ and air movement within the canopy, and therefore, are\nclosely coupled to the\
    \ air overhead. Conifer forests show a low decoupling factor Ω. In contrast, dense,\n\
    smooth and short canopies, with all the leaves packed into the limited vertical\
    \ space, would obstruct air\nmovement and therefore are nearly uncoupled from\
    \ the air overhead. For many ﬁeld and horticultural\ncrops with short and dense\
    \ canopies, control of transpiration may be expected to be minimal until\nstomata\
    \ close, and canopy conductance decreases markedly. Another crucial point is the\
    \ ability of\nsome crops to limit their leaf water potential, preventing it from\
    \ falling below a critical level (isohydric\nbehavior). Marino et al. [113] have\
    \ reported that daytime leaf water status (or water potential) was\nmaintained\
    \ relatively constant as long as the potential transpiration exceeded the hydraulic\
    \ threshold.\nThis means that water potential of the leaves remained relatively\
    \ constant during the day and during\nperiods of minor-to-moderate water stress\
    \ events, regardless of soil water status, because of active\nstomatal control.\
    \ The assessment of the isohydric crop response is important for crop-water-use\n\
    predictions and requirements, and photosynthetic productivity under uneven irrigation\
    \ conditions.\nIn contrast, many species show unisohydric behavior with leaf water\
    \ potential relatively coupled\nto the environment. The different behavior of\
    \ isohydric and unisohydric plants may affect Remote\nSensing measurements based\
    \ on thermography. Two crops, one isohydric and the other unisohydric,\nboth held\
    \ in non-limiting soil water conditions, would be expected to return different\
    \ values of Crop\nWater Stress Index (CWSI). Since both crops are well-watered,\
    \ the differing behaviors of isohydric and\nunisohydric crops may affect irrigation\
    \ scheduling if appropriate corrections are not applied to each\nspecies (e.g.,\
    \ by using different thermal index threshold values).\nAccording to Casa et al\
    \ [114], several methodologies are available for estimating crop water use\nand\
    \ water use efﬁciency. Evett [115] developed a theoretical approach to precision\
    \ irrigation based on\nremote sensing, considered a powerful, practical and cost-effective\
    \ tool for obtaining comparable yield,\ncrop quality, and water and nutrient use\
    \ efﬁciencies proﬁtably and sustainably. In the ﬁeld of irrigation,\nﬁve major\
    \ approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing were reported (Table\
    \ 3).\nThe ﬁve approaches can be grouped into three major categories related to\
    \ ET estimation (point 1\nand 4); infrared thermography (point 2 and 3) and crop\
    \ characteristics (point 5). Many papers report\n“new methods” to calculate precision\
    \ irrigation based on remote sensing, combining, simplifying or\nintegrating the\
    \ methods described above.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n12 of 36\nTable 3. Five\
    \ major approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing. From Evett [115].\n\
    1\nScheduling irrigation to replace ET estimated from a reference ET (ETo), calculated\
    \ from local weather data,\nwhich is multiplied by a crop coefﬁcient estimated\
    \ with a crop coefﬁcient function, Kc (NDVI), where NDVI is\nthe normalized difference\
    \ vegetative index (NDVI) or a similar index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\n\
    The NDVI is based on canopy irradiance in the red and near-infrared bands, which\
    \ can be remotely sensed.\n2\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount of water\
    \ whenever a trigger to irrigate is generated by the crop water\nstress index\
    \ (CWSI), which is estimated using remotely sensed surface temperature (Ts) and\
    \ local weather data.\n3\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount when triggered\
    \ by the time-temperature threshold index (TTTI) reaching\na crop and region-speciﬁc\
    \ value. The TTTI is calculated using Ts.\n4\nScheduling irrigation to replace\
    \ ET estimated with the ﬁeld surface energy balance (FSEB), which uses remotely\n\
    sensed surface temperature, Ts, determined from thermal infrared data, and data\
    \ on canopy cover and surface\nemissivity deduced from the near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ and visible bands.\n5\nSensing of crop and soil characteristics in order to\
    \ guide timing, placement, and amount of fertilizer and water\nthrough irrigation\
    \ (or fertigation) systems of various orders of precision. The characteristics,\
    \ including crop cover\nfraction, nitrogen status of leaves, disease, and pest\
    \ damage, all of which vary spatially and temporally, are\ninferred from various\
    \ remotely sensed vegetative indices.\nEvett proposed an electronic hardware and\
    \ software system that acquires data from sensors and controls the\noperation\
    \ of other hardware to pilot irrigation. This Supervisory control and data acquisition\
    \ system (SCADA)\nacquires in situ, remotely sensed, or near-surface remotely\
    \ sensed crop, soil, and micrometeorological properties as\ninputs for a decision-making\
    \ algorithm. The system applies deﬁned amounts of water at deﬁned times automatically\n\
    through control of an integrated irrigation application system.\n4.1. ET Estimation\n\
    Satellite Remote Sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration has become a popular\
    \ tool and a focus of\nstudy in the past two to three decades. High-resolution\
    \ daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps would\ngreatly improve irrigation crop management\
    \ [116]. Remote Sensing based ET estimation roughly\nstarted in the 1980s and\
    \ has evolved into a variety of approaches and models as reported in an\nexhaustive\
    \ paper by Zhang et al. [117]. In addition, Liou and Kar [118] reported the estimation\
    \ of ET\nwith RS and various surface-energy-balance algorithms (SEBAL). The authors\
    \ reviewed these different\nsatellites based approaches and the main physical\
    \ bases and assumptions of these algorithms.\nIt is difﬁcult to categorize these\
    \ methods, since they try to compensate for the empirical modules\nand physically\
    \ based modules used. Table 4 lists a classiﬁcation by Courault et al. [119]\n\
    Table 4. Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation model categories. From Courault et\
    \ al. [119]\n1\nEmpirically direct methods (remote sensing data are introduced\
    \ directly in semi-empirical models to estimate ET)\n2\nResidual methods of the\
    \ energy budget (combining some empirical relationships and physical modules in\n\
    models such as SEBAL)\n3\nDeterministic methods (more complex models such as Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere\
    \ Transfer models (SVAT),\nwhich compute the different components of energy budget\
    \ (ISBA, Meso-NH)\n4\nVegetation-index methods (remote sensing to compute Kc or\
    \ Priestley Taylor-alpha parameters).\nRemote sensing techniques for estimating\
    \ ET from satellites [120] have been developed from\nenergy balances, thus generating\
    \ estimates of actual evapotranspiration [121,122]. The University\nof Idaho (USA)\
    \ has developed a model to estimate ET called Mapping Evapo Transpiration\nwith\
    \ high Resolution and Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [122], based on the Surface\
    \ Energy\nBalance Algorithms from the Land (SEBAL) model of Bastiaanssen et al.\
    \ [121]. In METRIC, the\nevapotranspiration is calculated from Landsat imagery\
    \ calculating the available energy using the\nearth surface temperature (Ts) derived\
    \ from satellite imagery thermal bands, to constrain the heat\nﬂux for one or\
    \ more layers (canopy and soil), and then computing the latent heat as a residual\
    \ to the\nsurface energy balance [123]. In other words, the energy utilized by\
    \ the ET process is considered as a\nresidual of the SEBAL equation. The ratio\
    \ between actual evapotranspiration (Etcrop) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (Eto) can be calculated only when ET is measured; this ratio is the Kcact, namely\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n13 of 36\nthe actual crop coefﬁcient [124]. Allen et\
    \ al. [122] reported this method (Crop ET estimations based on\nKcact) is a useful\
    \ tool for ﬁeld and regional water management.\nThe energy-balance approach has\
    \ the beneﬁt that it can be utilized to quantify the dimensions\nof irrigated\
    \ ﬁelds and their water-use dynamics, without reference to source of water as\
    \ opposed to\na water balance model. This latter model necessitates the information\
    \ of both the magnitude and\ntemporal distribution of rainfall and irrigation\
    \ applied to ﬁelds [125]. Temperature-based methods, as\nSEBAL, can be automated\
    \ and likely outperform vegetation-based methods in irrigated areas, especially\n\
    under conditions of low vegetation cover and high soil evaporation. According\
    \ to Biggs et al. [126],\nan automated SEBAL can estimate the evaporative fraction\
    \ from irrigated crops with a mean error of\n14% of Rn (range 218% to 124%). Allen\
    \ et al. [127] conﬁrmed the maturing technology of SEBAL and\nMETRIC for deriving\
    \ a satellite-driven surface energy balance for estimating ET from the ground’s\n\
    surface. The authors foresee a great future for these models in the scientiﬁc\
    \ groups dealing with\nwater resources.\nSantos et al. [120] have combined METRIC-derived\
    \ estimates of ET with a water balance model\nnamed LORMOD [128] to evaluate,\
    \ at a plot level, the use of near-real time ET estimates to update\nand correct\
    \ irrigation scheduling predictions and to assess its impact on WUE. ET estimates\
    \ derived\nfrom satellites were used in a daily soil-water-balance model to improve\
    \ accuracy of ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld ET\ndemands and, as a consequence, ﬁeld-scale irrigation\
    \ schedules. This approach combined high spatial\nresolution (satellite RS) data\
    \ with high temporal resolution data (daily soil-water-balance), providing\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ advances in irrigation schedules, as reported for cotton (a 24% reduction) increasing\
    \ ﬁeld\nirrigation efﬁciency to 0.72; the ﬁeld irrigation efﬁciency reached 0.90\
    \ for sugar beet [120].\nTrezza et al. [129] reported an estimation of actual\
    \ ET for central New Mexico. They matched ET\nimages derived from MODIS with those\
    \ taken by Landsat. The adoption of a METRIC model based on\nMODIS imageries produced\
    \ monthly and annual ET estimates, comparable to those obtained with\nLandsat\
    \ imagery.\nElhaddad and Garcia [130] reported a ReSET model based on wind from\
    \ multiple weather stations\nand the use of a weather station for the model calibration.\
    \ This ﬂexible approach generated raster\ninterpolated weather parameters, accounting\
    \ for spatial variation of weather parameters between\nweather stations, which\
    \ can be signiﬁcant. They found that ET calculated using this approach could\n\
    vary by 17% compared with ET calculated with point values.\nSubsequently, Elhaddad\
    \ and Garcia [131] assessed the use of actual ET calculated by ReSET to\nestimate\
    \ seasonal crop water use at regional scale instead of the traditional ET estimation\
    \ method\nbased on reference ET and crop coefﬁcients.\nOrtega-Farías et al. [132]\
    \ estimated the energy balance components over a drip-irrigated olive\norchard,\
    \ using thermal and multispectral cameras placed on a helicopter-based unmanned\
    \ aerial\nvehicle, acquiring high-resolution images to assess intra-ﬁeld spatial\
    \ variability.\nIn the ﬁeld of irrigation scheduling/WUE, there are very few concrete\
    \ outcomes. In particular,\nD’Urso et al. [133] analyzed, from the PLEIADeS framework,\
    \ ﬁve agricultural systems, in a broad\nrange of arid and semi-arid conditions\
    \ characteristic for the European, Southern Mediterranean, and\nAmerican regions.\
    \ The aim of the project was to improve the efﬁciency of the irrigation schemes,\
    \ made\npossible through wide space–time coverage of Earth Observation data and\
    \ interactive networking\ncapabilities of Information and Communication Technologies.\
    \ They included the following: canopy\nparameters, fractional vegetation cover,\
    \ LAI, albedo, crop coefﬁcients, potential ET, irrigation water\nrequirements.\
    \ They conﬁrmed the possibility of estimating crop coefﬁcient from NDVI, relying\
    \ upon\nadvances in spatial and radiometric accuracy of new sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2),\
    \ for a full exploitation of\ntheir applications.\nPeña-Arancibia et al. [107]\
    \ quantiﬁed irrigation water use and water provenance (surface water\nor groundwater),\
    \ combining t remote sensing data on irrigation dynamics and actual ET linked\
    \ with\na river-reach hydrological model. They concluded that the results were\
    \ as accurate as those of more\ntraditional irrigation area modelling using remotely\
    \ sensed irrigated areas. Actual ET data can be used\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n\
    14 of 36\nto understand irrigation dynamics, the constraints in irrigation models,\
    \ and speciﬁc areas that require\nbetter monitoring.\nVanino et al. [134] estimated\
    \ the ET and crop coefﬁcients of table grape vineyards trained on\noverhead “tendone”\
    \ systems in the Apulia region (Italy). The FAO direct methodology for estimating\n\
    potential evapotranspiration (ETp) was used to estimate maximum vineyard transpiration.\
    \ The model,\nbased on existing validated methodologies, used appropriate values\
    \ of canopy variables (albedo and\nthe LAI) derived by means of multispectral\
    \ satellite data. ETp values (mean seasonal daily ET) ranged\nbetween 4.2 and\
    \ 4.1 mm·d−1, and from 0.88 to 0.93 in 2013 and 1.02 to 1.04 in 2014 for the midseason\n\
    values, respectively. The results indicated that the values of Kc are site- and\
    \ year-speciﬁc and depend\non local ET0 rates, rainfall frequency, cumulative\
    \ thermal requirements, and effective canopy cover.\nThe resulting crop water\
    \ requirements were lower than the actual average irrigation volumes applied\n\
    by farmers, thus suggesting the possibility of improving the water use efﬁciency\
    \ of these crops by\nadopting the proposed methodology. We agree with the authors\
    \ that, in the Mediterranean, few studies\nhave investigated the satellite Kc\
    \ estimation for vineyards.\nLópez-López et al. [135] estimated ET starting from\
    \ ﬁeld weather data and Kc estimated with a\nfunction related to vegetation indices\
    \ such as NDVI or index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\nKamble et al. [136]\
    \ studied how to estimate Kc directly from reﬂectance and VIs derived from\na\
    \ satellite. The authors found that NDVI-Kc quantiﬁed from remote sensing could\
    \ be useful for\nestimating WUE, irrigation scheduling and performance, and agricultural\
    \ water budgets. The NDVI-Kc\nmay be also utilized for agriculture water conservation,\
    \ starting from local to continental scales.\nRecently, Battista et al. [137]\
    \ published a paper with the aim of demonstrating how spatialized\nmeteorological\
    \ data and remote sensing techniques may allow one to estimate actual ET and the\
    \ soil\nwater content of a small plot (about 0.1 ha) of an olive orchard. As a\
    \ rule, for Mediterranean areas,\ntrees were covered by several herbaceous species.\
    \ The authors found that the NDVI-Cws (coefﬁcient of\nwater stress) method is\
    \ a suitable tool for estimating daily olive tree actual transpiration and soil\
    \ water\ncontent in complex and multi-layer Mediterranean agricultural ecosystems.\
    \ The novelty of the adopted\nmethod was to consider the spatially fragmented,\
    \ two-layer structure of an olive orchard. For instance,\nthe ETa of trees and\
    \ grasses were combined with weather data (precipitation) to assess the site-speciﬁc\n\
    water balance, which was assessed through comparison with daily measurements of\
    \ soil water content.\nMoreover, this highlighted the importance of separating\
    \ trees and grasses for estimation of the NDVI,\nadopting statistical operations\
    \ to satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal properties.\nMarshall et\
    \ al. [138], with the aim of partitioning ET into soil evaporation and crop transpiration,\n\
    studied the ratio-based vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) retrieved from optical\
    \ remote sensing,\nhighlighting their limitations and how VIs can induce large\
    \ model error. NDVI explained half of the\nvariability in transpiration, the largest\
    \ component of ET. However, to estimate total ET one should\nconsider the Photochemical\
    \ Reﬂectance Index (PRI). To estimate soil evaporation, the authors suggest\n\
    two new ratio-based indices derived from NIR bands 743 and 953 nm and visible\
    \ blue 428 nm and\nfrom SWIR1 bands 1518 nm.\nGonzález-Dugo and Mateos [139] used\
    \ an approach based on the conjecture that variations in\nthe size of the crop\
    \ have much stronger effects on its ET than variations in stomatal conductance.\n\
    This assumption seems to be valid for irrigated crops, according to several studies\
    \ [140–142]. The results\nshowed the potential of this method for ﬁeld application.\
    \ Since there is little agreement on the nature\nof the relationships between\
    \ VIs and Kc, the latter can be estimated from spectral measurements.\nThe rationale\
    \ is that both the component of the crop coefﬁcient that represents transpiration\
    \ (Kcb)\nand VIs are sensitive to crop biomass (LAI and ground cover fraction—fc).\
    \ The relationships between\nKcb and VIs could be linear or non-linear. The linearity\
    \ of these relationships depends on the crop\narchitecture [143]. Er-Raki et al.\
    \ [142] used the same approach to derive Kcb values of wheat crops,\nanalyzing\
    \ the relationships between VIs, and both LAI and fc.\nThe use of remotely-sensed-vegetation\
    \ indices has been tested to predict crop coefﬁcients at\ndifferent scales. In\
    \ fact, González-Dugo and Mateos [139] found that the NDVI and SAVI were strictly\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n15 of 36\nrelated to LAI, vegetation ground cover and\
    \ biomass. These relationships were obtained by radiometric\nmeasurements obtained\
    \ from satellite and ground-based platforms. The relationship is simple and\n\
    robust and may be used for studying WUE and water productivity at a regional level.\n\
    The statistical analyses of ﬁeld data and remote sensing data, derived from multispectral\
    \ imagery\nusing an UAV, conﬁrms the feasibility of applying the proposed methods\
    \ to assess physiological and\nstructural properties of Citrus under water and\
    \ saline stress. The novelty of this study was to show\nthat diurnal changes in\
    \ physiological and structural traits of citrus irrigated with RW combined with\n\
    RDI could be determined by multispectral images from UAVs. NIR was a useful indicator\
    \ of s, A and\ngs on both crops. The NDVI was strictly related to gas exchange\
    \ in both species and on mandarin [144].\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] hypothesized\
    \ that the index PRI (normalized by canopy chlorophyll\ncontent), might be a strong\
    \ indicator of the diurnal dynamics of water stress.\nThey acquired\nnarrow-band\
    \ multispectral and thermal imageries over a vineyard cultivated under three different\n\
    irrigation treatments, and evaluated the relationships between the normalized\
    \ PRI, ﬁeld-physiological\nparameters (stomatal conductance) and plant water potential.\
    \ Relationships with CWSI, which were\nused as a remote sensing benchmark for\
    \ water stress detection, were also discussed by the authors,\nwho reasoned that\
    \ CWSI can be used as a remote sensing benchmark for water stress detection. Some\n\
    critical points were suggested for integrating VIs derived by UAVs and everyday\
    \ water resource\nmanagement, such as the integration of differential global positioning\
    \ and the development of\nintelligent control of UAV platforms to improve positional\
    \ accuracy and spatial data capture.\nA review by Kang et al. [146] set up the\
    \ ﬁrst worldwide dataset to analyze the global LAI-VI\nrelationships at different\
    \ spatial and temporal scales. Analysis was derived from low-resolution (30 m)\n\
    satellite Landsat images, with the goal of producing large-scale ﬁne resolution\
    \ LAI maps, essential\nfor agricultural applications, especially in mosaic agriculture.\
    \ The authors reported that the LAI-VI\nrelationships were crop-speciﬁc and may\
    \ explain why the largest amount of variance in ﬁeld-measured\nLAI was obtained\
    \ using only remotely sensed observations.\n4.2. Infrared Thermography\n4.2.1.\
    \ CWSI\nScientists tried to ﬁnd indexes that describe the relationship between\
    \ and thermal characteristics\nof plants and water stress [147]. Jackson et al.\
    \ [148] set up the CWSI, Jackson [149] the Surface\nTemperature (ST), Moran et\
    \ al. [150] the Water Deﬁcit Index (WDI), Vidal et al. [151] the Stress Index\n\
    (SI), and Guilioni et al. [152] the Stomatal conductance index. Plants showing\
    \ symptoms of wilting emit\nmore longwave infrared radiation, revealing canopy\
    \ temperature. Unfortunately, canopy temperature\nis affected by meteorological\
    \ conditions at the time of measurement, so it cannot be an absolute\nindicator\
    \ of water stress.\nWe recommend several papers related to theoretical approaches\
    \ dealing with infrared\nthermography: Jones and Vaughan [40] provided a rigorous\
    \ and detailed explanation of the theory\nand practical applications of remote\
    \ sensing; Maes and Steppe [153] wrote an exhaustive review\non thermal remote\
    \ sensing technique and ﬁeld variation of plants and environmental parameters\n\
    involved. Other key papers include those from Mulla [94], Gago et al. [154], Thenkabail\
    \ et al. [155],\nand Jones [156].\nAmong the indexes cited above, the most studied\
    \ is the CWSI, which was developed at the U.S.\nWater Conservation Laboratory\
    \ in the 1970s and 1980s [148,157,158] and has been commercialized and\nwidely\
    \ used in irrigation management. Jackson et al. [148] found that CWSI was deﬁned\
    \ by the ratio of\nactual to potential ET calculated from the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation, and highlighted the usefulness\nand limitation of the index. Although\
    \ it appeared to be a promising tool for quantifying crop water\nstress, it was\
    \ unable to quantify crop water needs, or the time threshold for watering a crop.\n\
    A long list of indices is available at the website IDB (http://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i.\n\
    php?offset=1), which reports the basic information for each index including the\
    \ following: name,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n16 of 36\nabbreviation, formula,\
    \ variables, explanations of variables, wavelengths, source, description; sensors,\n\
    visualization of required spectral range; visualization of Sensor-Bands, applications,\
    \ references.\nGiven deﬁned environmental conditions (air humidity, air temperature),\
    \ the CWSI index is based\non the quantiﬁcation of the behaviour of a crop both\
    \ when it is fully transpiring and when it is not.\nLópez-López et al. [135] expressed\
    \ CWSI in terms of evapotranspiration:\nCWSI = 1 − ETc/ET0\nwhere, ETc is the\
    \ actual crop evapotranspiration and ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration.\n\
    According to López-López [135], the relation between ETc and ET0 approaches the\
    \ theoretical values\nproposed by Jackson [148], because it is decoupled from\
    \ the wind velocity as in the classical form,\naccording to Idso et al. [158].\n\
    Idso [159] suggested replacing the estimations of VPD from minimum temperature\
    \ with air\ntemperature measurements in direct radiation on irrigated plots, with\
    \ the goal of increasing and partly\ncorrecting the inﬂuence of the superﬁcial\
    \ soil temperature on LAI. The accurate assessment of the ET\nby means of the\
    \ CWSI is assumed by the relation between ETc and the leaf’s water potential (ET0)\
    \ at\ndawn, according to Itier et al. [160].\nEvett [115] deﬁned the CWSI as:\n\
    CWSI = ((Tc − Ta)m − (Tc − Ta)l)/((Tc − Ta)u − (Tc − Ta)l)\nIt uses the crop canopy\
    \ temperature (measured by an IR thermometer or thermal images) and\nenvironmental\
    \ parameters (air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation). The\
    \ canopy-air\ntemperature difference (Tc − Ta) is normalized to the lower and\
    \ upper limits of canopy-air temperature\ndifferences, which represent non-water-stressed\
    \ and completely water-stressed crops, respectively.\nThe subscript “m” denotes\
    \ measured data, while “l” denotes a lower baseline (non-water-stressed\ncrop),\
    \ “u” denotes an upper limit (completely water stressed crop), which is an estimated\
    \ parameter.\nThe (Tc − Ta)l and (Tc − Ta)u limits may be estimated either on\
    \ an empirical or theoretical basis as\ndescribed by Idso et al. [158] and Jackson\
    \ et al. [148]. Both approaches require readings of air humidity\nand air temperature\
    \ but it works better with wind speed and solar radiation data, and estimates\
    \ of\nbulk canopy resistances.\nIrrigation scheduling based on (Tc − Ta) has often\
    \ been determined by the stress degree day\nmethod (SDD), originally suggested\
    \ by Idso et al. [157] and Jackson [161]:\nSDD =\nn\n∑\ni=l\n(Tc − Ta)i\nwith\
    \ Tc and Ta measured 1–1.5 h after solar noon at day i, during a n-day period.\
    \ Irrigation was\ninitiated as soon as SDD exceeded 0. The formula was used successfully\
    \ for different crops [162], and\naccording to Maes and Steppe [153] SDD worked\
    \ well for wheat, and in semi-arid climates where\nweather conditions were expected\
    \ to differ little between consecutive days.\nAccording to King and Shellie [163],\
    \ the CWSI is also deﬁned as:\nCWSI = (Tcanopy − Tnws)/(Tdry − Tnws)\nwhere Tcanopy\
    \ is the temperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C), Tnws is the temperature\
    \ of\nfully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop is non-water-stressed (well-watered)\
    \ and Tdry is the\ntemperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop\
    \ is severely water stressed due to low soil\nwater availability. Temperatures\
    \ Tnws and Tdry are the lower and upper baselines used to normalize\nCWSI for\
    \ the effects of environmental conditions (air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ radiation, wind\nspeed, etc.) on Tcanopy. Maes and Steppe [153] emphasized the\
    \ limited application of the CWSI by the\ndifﬁculty of estimating without actually\
    \ measuring Tnws and Tdry.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n17 of 36\nJones [164] proposed\
    \ a stress index (SICWSI) analogous to the Idso-Jackson CWSI, using wet\nsurface\
    \ conductance rather than the ﬁnite value for a well-watered crop.\nSIcwsi = (Tleaf\
    \ − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)\nRojo et al. [165] suggested a modiﬁed CWSI (MCWSI) in\
    \ grape and almond using the\ncontinuous leaf monitor data, where the well-watered\
    \ and dry conditions were measured using\na well-watered tree and a simulated\
    \ dry leaf. The CWSI and MCWSI indices were calculated and\nwere capable of representing\
    \ the stress level of the grape and almond crops, so variable rate irrigation\n\
    was implemented.\nThe CWSI is considered a sensitive tool for monitoring and assessing\
    \ plant water stress for a\nwide range of crops. CWSI was inversely correlated\
    \ to cotton yields [166], and positively correlated\nwith soil water depletion\
    \ for a fully developed canopy when no soil reﬂectance was present [167].\nThe\
    \ CWSI was also able to foresee a yield of several crops under stress and to develop\
    \ schemes for\nmanaging irrigation [168,169]. Furthermore, the Water Deﬁcit Index,\
    \ which is a two-dimensional CWSI\nnormalized for vegetation cover, was related\
    \ to crop water stress [150,170].\nOrta et al. [171] studied the upper and lower\
    \ baselines, and CWSI values on watermelon were\nslightly different. They tested\
    \ CWSI for scheduling irrigation for watermelon grown with ﬁve irrigation\ntreatments\
    \ (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in terms of the replenishment of the water depletion\
    \ (0.90 m\nsoil proﬁle depth). The CWSI was calculated from IR canopy temperatures,\
    \ air temperatures, and\nvapor pressure deﬁcit values. In two years, the fully\
    \ irrigated treatment gave the highest yield and\nwater use. The CWSI values tended\
    \ to be consistent with the soil water content. The authors proposed\na linear\
    \ equation of CWSI versus yield prediction, and suggested testing in long-term\
    \ experiments a\ncritical value of CWSI at which a farmer should irrigate.\nRecently,\
    \ Bellvert et al. [172] measured the CWSI in three peach cultivars (Prunus persica\
    \ L.)\nthroughout different growing seasons. They measured the canopy temperature\
    \ of well-watered trees\nusing high-resolution thermal imagery obtained from an\
    \ airborne platform and related it to leaf water\npotential (ψL) as a water stress\
    \ indicator. Results demonstrated that (i) the CWSI had similar seasonal\nresponses\
    \ and (ii) a common “non-water-stressed baseline” can be used during the course\
    \ of the entire\ncrop season. The CWSI is a practical method for evaluating the\
    \ spatial variability of peach tree water\nstatus in heterogeneous orchards, and\
    \ for deriving ψL maps throughout a complete growing season.\nSantesteban et al.\
    \ [173] evaluated the ability of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging\nto\
    \ estimate instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within\
    \ a vineyard.\nCWSI correlated well with ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition,\
    \ showing great potential\nfor monitoring instantaneous variations in water status,\
    \ but it did not provide a good estimation of\nvariations of plant water status\
    \ on a single day. The results added evidence regarding the suitability of\nthis\
    \ approach, and reinforced the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as\
    \ an instantaneous\nwater-stress mapping tool. Similarly, Baluja et al. [174]\
    \ conducted an airborne study over a vineyard,\nwith the goal of computing image-derived\
    \ spectral and thermal indices, and indicators of water status\nin vines including\
    \ (i) the crop water stress index (CWSI), stomatal conductance index (Ig) [164]\
    \ and\n(ii) a formulation of the stomatal conductance index (I3) [164]. They concluded\
    \ that the relationship\nbetween thermal imagery and derived indices can be considered\
    \ as a short-term response, a kind\nof instantaneous “picture” of the plant water\
    \ status situation, while spectral vegetation indices are\nprobably the result\
    \ of cumulative water deﬁcits.\nBerni et al. [84] validated a methodology for\
    \ producing high-resolution maps of canopy\nconductance and CWSI, potentially\
    \ useful for calculating actual ET and as an input for scheduling\nirrigation.\
    \ The canopy of conductance and CWSI maps of olive orchards were acquired by airborne\n\
    and UAV platforms for two years with different irrigation treatments.\nTesti et\
    \ al. [175] showed that the CWSI measured in the ﬁrst afternoon hours were a good\
    \ tool\nfor identifying seasonal changes in the water status of a pistachio orchard\
    \ submitted to variable\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n18 of 36\nwater stress by\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation practices. The temperature of pistachio trees showed\
    \ great\nresponsiveness to variations in plant water status.\nLópez-López et al.\
    \ [135] analyzed ET and CWSI in tomato conﬁrming that the use of infrared\nthermometry\
    \ to calculate the CWSI is a reliable technique for scheduling irrigation using\
    \ the\ndetermined upper and lower CWSI baselines in a husk tomato crop. The CWSI\
    \ value increased\nuntil it reached 0.7 in the treatment with severe irrigation\
    \ restrictions (40% ETo).\nGonzález-Dugo et al. [176] used UAV systems to derive\
    \ CWSI from high-resolution thermal\nimagery. They assessed the spatial variability\
    \ of crop water status in a pistachio orchard for precision\nirrigation purposes.\
    \ The authors estimated a possible reduction of irrigation costs moving from\n\
    common irrigation system to a variable rate irrigation system [177].\nGonzález-Dugo\
    \ et al. [178] also used IR imagery taken by UAVs to evaluate the variability\
    \ in the\nwater status of ﬁve fruit tree species. They compared the daily differential\
    \ between Tc − Ta (canopy\nand air temperature) with the tree water status. Since\
    \ the slope of the differential with time was\nhighly correlated with water status,\
    \ the authors proposed the slope as an indicator of the stomatal\nbehavior. An\
    \ empirical approach was used to deﬁne the upper and lower limits of Tc − Ta;\
    \ CWSI\nwas calculated using the temperature data from a 13-h ﬂight. Another important\
    \ contribution of the\npaper was the assessment of variability in the water status\
    \ based on the differences in relative canopy\ntemperatures. The authors concluded\
    \ that their approach (i) was worthwhile for managing precision\nirrigation; (ii)\
    \ could identify water stressed areas; and (iii) could deﬁne threshold CWSI values,\
    \ a great\nhelp for farmers and for irrigation strategies at different phenological\
    \ stages.\nSezen et al. [179] analyzed the CWSI of red pepper irrigated with two\
    \ systems (drip and furrow)\nand with different irrigation regimes. The authors\
    \ concluded that CWSI could measure crop water\nstatus and improve irrigation\
    \ scheduling. For high-quality yields, the authors suggested CSWI values\nof 0.26\
    \ for drip irrigation and 0.38 for furrow irrigation. For both irrigation methods,\
    \ linear relations\nwere found between CWSI and red pepper yield.\nAgam et al.\
    \ [180] tested CWSI for analyzing the changes in water status of olive trees when\n\
    entering into and recovering from stress on a diurnal scale. CWSI was tested in\
    \ an empirical form\nand in two analytical conﬁgurations. The results showed that\
    \ the empirical CWSI was capable even\ngiven its limitations, while the analytical\
    \ forms of CWSI needed enhancement for monitoring the water\nstatus of olive.\
    \ The authors proposed calculating the wet temperature analytically and ﬁxing\
    \ the dry\ntemperature at a level of 5 ◦C higher than the air temperature. Thermal\
    \ imaging and water status\nmeasurements were recorded between 12:00 and 14:00.\n\
    Wang et al. [181] conducted a two-year experiment on early-ripening peach exposed\
    \ to postharvest\ndeﬁcit irrigation schemes, concluding that IR measurements might\
    \ estimate plant water stress,\nparticularly in high-radiative arid and semi-arid\
    \ climates. They found that the temperature differences\n(infrared-canopy temperature\
    \ and air temperature) where correlated to stem water potential and\nproved to\
    \ be a useful tool for water stress assessment for managing regulated deﬁcit irrigation.\n\
    Temperature differences (midday canopy to air temperature) ranged from 5 to 7\
    \ ◦C in the water-stressed\npostharvest deﬁcit irrigation treatments, while they\
    \ ranged from 1.4 to 2 ◦C in the non-water-stressed\ncontrol treatments.\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] calculated CWSI for four 1-hour periods, ranging from 10:00 to\
    \ 14:00,\neach day for 29 days.\nThe estimated CWSI was smallest from 10:00 to\
    \ 11:00 and largest from\n12:00 to 13:00. These values may be used for precise\
    \ (amounts and timing) irrigation scheduling.\nWhen measurements were taken during\
    \ earlier hours, the authors suggested adopting a conservative\nthreshold value\
    \ of CWSI; in contrast, they suggested higher levels when measurements were recorded\n\
    one hour after solar noon.\nGarcía-Tejero et al. [183] conducted a study using\
    \ thermal data to monitor crop-water status in\nirrigated Mediterranean viticulture.\
    \ They found that CWSI and IG might provide more meaningful\ninformation about\
    \ the crop-water status than Tcanopy-air.\nThe authors also found that TC was\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n19 of 36\nsigniﬁcantly correlated with gs and net assimilation,\
    \ suggesting that it can be used as a simpler\nparameter to support thermal remote\
    \ sensing of water stress in grapevines.\nKullber et al. [184] compared and evaluated\
    \ the accuracy of several water-stress coefﬁcient\nmethods for estimating crop\
    \ ETc under different levels of deﬁcit irrigation. Four canopy temperature\nbased\
    \ methods were used to calculate Ks: CWSI, Canopy Temperature Ratio (Tc ratio),\
    \ Degrees Above\nNon-Stressed Temperature (DANS), Degrees Above Canopy Threshold\
    \ (DACT). Methods using only\ncanopy temperature measurements (DANS, DACT, and\
    \ Tc ratio) performed with comparable error to\nmore data intensive methods such\
    \ as CWSI and demonstrated their potential for irrigation scheduling.\nOsroosh\
    \ et al. [185] carried out an experiment on apple trees, to compare two empirical\
    \ indexes, a\nCWSId (averaged over daylight hours) and a CWSIm (midday CWSI).\
    \ Since CWSI was very sensitive\nto mild variations in the soil water content,\
    \ the authors suggested using CWSId and CWSIm for\nestimating soil water availability.\
    \ These indices were also stable under transitional weather conditions.\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] considered the time changes of IR for monitoring corn water stress\
    \ at high\nspatial and temporal resolution for managing irrigation water within\
    \ large agricultural production\nsystems. In the 80-day study, they observed a\
    \ statistical decrease in soil moisture “only when the\nCWSI value increased past\
    \ 0.6 with 82% of soil moisture variation explained by the CWSI”. The CWSI\nwas\
    \ negatively correlated to soil moisture, demonstrating the potentiality of CWSI\
    \ (i) as an alternate\nirrigation scheduling method; and (ii) for quantifying\
    \ spatial soil moisture by IR canopy temperatures.\n4.2.2. Time-Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT)\nThe TTT is a method based on a canopy temperature threshold and a time\
    \ threshold [187,188].\nBecause it is a response method of automatic control,\
    \ the TTT method does not need supplementary\ninputs for activating irrigation;\
    \ and it has been credited for regulating water-use efﬁciency.\nEvett et al. [188]\
    \ found no statistical differences in yield and WUE, when comparing TTT and with\n\
    manually irrigated plots, in soybean and corn.\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [189] studied\
    \ the relationship between cotton irrigation scheduling, using\nsoil water measurements\
    \ and two thermal indices. An automatic irrigation scheduling determined by\n\
    a TTT algorithm reduced applied water volumes that did not negatively affect yield.\
    \ In well-watered\nconditions (full irrigation), the TTT method increased WUE\
    \ with respect to the water balance method;\ndifferences were not signiﬁcant at\
    \ reduced water depths (rates of 33 and 67% of full irrigation).\nThe authors\
    \ also found similar trends between two thermal indices, although the daily theoretical\n\
    CWSI resulted in over-irrigation when it was over 0.5.\nLamm et al. [190] compared\
    \ the TTT and ET-based irrigation scheduling for corn production.\nThe TTT method\
    \ accumulated time when the crop was above a speciﬁed temperature. An irrigation\n\
    event signal was triggered when the accumulated time exceeded the speciﬁed TTT\
    \ threshold.\nThe authors compared (i) three irrigation treatments with TTT values\
    \ of 2.5 h, 4.0 h or 5.5 h above a\ncanopy temperature of 28 ◦C; and (ii) two\
    \ ETc treatments (100% and 65%), plus a treatment receiving\nno further irrigation\
    \ after mid-July in Kansas. The results indicated that a TTT with a threshold\
    \ of 2.5 h\ncorresponded to a fully irrigated treatment.\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\
    \ [191] developed a method of integrating the CWSI over a day for presenting\n\
    clear CWSI signals occurring in some environmental conditions, near solar noon.\
    \ CWSI-TT was the\naccumulated time when CWSI was greater than a threshold value\
    \ of 0.45; this cumulated time value\nwas compared with a CWSI-TT value obtained\
    \ for a well-watered crop. The use of CWIS-TT, however,\ncan lead to an over-irrigation\
    \ due to false positive triggers that may be generated early in the season.\n\
    CWSI-TT provided yield results similar to scientiﬁc irrigation scheduling using\
    \ a neutron probe.\nOsroosh et al. [192] tested an automatic control system along\
    \ with a wireless network of soil,\nthermal and weather sensors, developed for\
    \ an apple orchard. Seven irrigation-scheduling algorithms\nwere tested: TTT,\
    \ CWSI, soil-based using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), an ET model, a soil water\n\
    balance (WB), a combination of SOIL and WB, a conventional irrigation practice\
    \ used in the region,\nand soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark.\
    \ The treatments TTT, CWSI, NP and WB\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n20 of 36\nsubstantially\
    \ reduced water (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range. WB\
    \ seemed\nto demonstrate the characteristics of being economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate.\nDeJonge et al. [193] conducted an experiment on corn to evaluate\
    \ several water stress indices based\non canopy temperature. All thermal indices\
    \ responded quickly to irrigation-treatment differences at\nmajor growth stages,\
    \ in particular Degrees Above Non-Stressed index and Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold\
    \ index were highly correlated with CWSI above the corn threshold of 28 ◦C used\
    \ in the\nTTT method. Furthermore, all indices showed a linear relationship with\
    \ soil water deﬁcit at high\ntemperatures. Degrees Above Canopy Threshold was\
    \ the best index due to (i) the strong relationships\nwith other indices and crop\
    \ water measurements; and (ii) because it was derived from a single canopy\ntemperature\
    \ measurement.\n4.2.3. Thermography Issue and Critical Aspects\nThe infrared thermometry\
    \ measurements suffer from several critical points, which may affect\nnegatively\
    \ the accuracy of the results. Jones et al. [156] found many important deﬁciencies\
    \ in the\ngeneral applications of CWSI. In particular deﬁciencies included (i)\
    \ the absolute temperature ranges\nmay be small in humid environments; (ii) the\
    \ canopy temperature was negatively affected when crop\nsurface target accidentally\
    \ includes areas such as soil, sky, and trunks; (iii) there existed a different\n\
    distribution of temperatures of sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy; and (iv)\
    \ the sunlit part of the\ncanopy showed a wider range of temperatures when viewed\
    \ normal to the rows or down the rows.\nEvett et al. [115] reported some other\
    \ critical points including that (i) the signal was not stable\nduring cloudy\
    \ periods; (ii) the lower base line and upper limit were difﬁculty to determine\
    \ and (iii)\nno uniqueness of these limits. Others problems were related to the\
    \ ﬁrst growth stages, when soil\nbackground was visible and it was more difﬁcult\
    \ to measure the canopy temperature.\nBaselines\nThe theoretical deﬁnition of\
    \ the two baselines, the lower baseline (well-watered crop, or more\nprecisely\
    \ non-water-stressed crop), and the upper baseline (completely water stressed\
    \ crop).\nThe lower baseline (non-water-stressed crop) depends on the plant species,\
    \ and even among\nvarieties of the same species, which have different canopy and\
    \ leaf structures. The energy balance of\ncrops may differ consistently, since\
    \ each canopy structure has its own radiometric properties, which\ncan facilitate\
    \ in some cases eradiation capture, and, in other cases, that which can escape\
    \ excessive\nradiation loads.\nLeaf Temperature Variability\nOptical parameters\
    \ of leaves of 30 plant species were presented by Gausman and Allen [194],\ndemonstrating\
    \ that each species demonstrated its own coefﬁcient of leaf emissivity. Leaves\
    \ showed\nwide ranges of temperature within a crop, often several degrees within\
    \ and between plants because of\nseveral factors. Each plant had (i) speciﬁc leaf\
    \ angles, that may vary during the day for several reasons\n(e.g., leaf turgidity;\
    \ radiation load, etc.); (ii) speciﬁc dimensions of (young and old) leaves, (iii)\
    \ unique\ncanopy architecture, (iv) different LAI, (v) different radiation loads\
    \ that impacted the crop, and (vi)\naerodynamic properties related to the wind\
    \ speed and direction. Therefore, Jones et al. [195] stated that\n“is desirable\
    \ to measure the canopy surface temperature (Tc) as an aggregate of all leaf temperatures”.\
    \ Maes and\nSteppe [153] noted that measurements of Tc differed from those of\
    \ a single leaf for two main reasons.\nCanopy emissivity was larger than leaf\
    \ emissivity, which has the function of capturing radiation\nfor photosynthesis.\
    \ The estimation of canopy emissivity is quite difﬁcult because it requires night\n\
    measurements. A second difference with canopy temperature measurements include\
    \ branches and, in\nparticular, soil which have temperatures usually higher than\
    \ the canopy. This is particularly evident in\norchards and croplands when the\
    \ canopy cover (crop fraction) is low. Furthermore, they reported that\nin stressed\
    \ conditions, at very low leaf stomatal conductance, the total range in surface\
    \ temperature\nbetween leaves is larger than in unstressed conditions, so that\
    \ canopy temperature variability often\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n21 of 36\n\
    reported as an index of drought stress. The sunlit side of a crop tends to have\
    \ a greater variance of\ntemperature among leaves than the shade side.\nSunlit\
    \ and Shade Leaves\nBoth baselines account for fully sunlit canopy leaves, but\
    \ it is evident that the average canopy\ntemperature is a summary of attributes\
    \ of different leaves, an extensive variety of leaf temperatures,\nwith sunlit\
    \ leaves showing much higher temperatures than shaded leaves [156,196]. Both shade\n\
    and sunlit leaves constantly move to adjust light interception to maximize their\
    \ water use efﬁciency\nand protect leaves from excessive heat and radiation load.\
    \ In both well-watered transpiring and\nwater-stressed canopies, there will be\
    \ a wide range of sunlit and shaded leaves, since it is known that\nthat dry matter\
    \ accumulation in crops is directly related to the interception of solar radiation,\
    \ up to the\ncritical LAI.\nAlvino et al. [196] reported that the fraction of\
    \ light absorbed by leaves, which controls crop\ngrowth rate, plant development,\
    \ crop biomass accumulation, is directly related to the interception of\nsolar\
    \ radiation, up to the critical LAI [197]. The light distribution within the canopy\
    \ affects, inter alia,\nthe photosynthetic efﬁciency. Under comparable environmental\
    \ conditions, the most important are the\nlight levels, since leaf photosynthetic\
    \ rates decline with age after leaf full expansion. The complexity is\nmade worse\
    \ by the difﬁculty of estimating the true age of each leaf in a plant community.\
    \ Furthermore,\nthe head-on viewing of a crop may increase the number of leaves\
    \ that appear shaded, even though\nthey are sunlit. As reported by Jones [156],\
    \ “there are always a few sunlit leaves on the shaded side and some\nshaded leaves\
    \ visible on the sunlit side”.\nTesti et al. [175] reported that measurements\
    \ of tall trees are particularly challenging, because\n(i) open sky is within\
    \ the sensor ﬁeld of view; (ii) a tree canopy has a vertical rather than horizontal\n\
    structure; and (iii) there is a canopy temperature difference between the shaded\
    \ and the sunlit sides.\nCrops with genetic modiﬁcations (reduced leaf and modiﬁed\
    \ stipule morphology) may result in\nenhanced yield when water is a limiting factor,\
    \ avoiding drought stress [198].\nIt is still critical to deﬁne a well-watered\
    \ crop, which according to deﬁnition should transpire\nat a rate regulated by\
    \ physical conditions (e.g., VPD), and not present any physical resistance\nto\
    \ transpiration ﬂuxes.\nHowever, even well-watered plants show a midday depression\
    \ of\nstomatal conductance in case of high VPD [199].\nDifferent indices and procedures\
    \ have been\nproposed [108,111,115,153,164,200].\nAs correctly stated by King\
    \ and Shellie [163], the CWSI has not been widely used for irrigated\ncrops since\
    \ it is necessary to acquire the temperature difference of both transpiring and\
    \ non-transpiring\nleaves under the same environmental conditions. Stated below\
    \ King and Shellie [163] obtained\nCWSI values ranging from 0 to 1, when adopting\
    \ the Tair + 5 ◦C for estimating the temperature\nof non-transpiring leaves (Tdry),\
    \ as proposed by Irmak et al. [201] and Möller et al. [108] for corn\nand grape,\
    \ respectively. The authors found that the maximum temperature difference between\
    \ the\ncanopy of deﬁcit-irrigated vines and Tair was inﬂuenced by irrigation frequency.\
    \ Greater maximum\ntemperature differences were found for vines irrigated once\
    \ a week compared to those irrigated three\ntimes per week. The cultivar response\
    \ to deﬁcit irrigation was different with ‘Syrah’ vines, which were\n2–4 ◦C cooler\
    \ than ‘Malbec’ vines [202], and differences were also detected in leaf surface\
    \ temperature\namong grapevine cultivars undergoing water stress. Bellvert et\
    \ al. [202] reported Tnws − Tair values\nmore than 7.5 ◦C for ‘Pinot-noir’ vines\
    \ subject to water stress, when air temperature was 32.3 ◦C and\nair humidity\
    \ 2.37 kPa. In more stressful conditions (37 ◦C and very low air humidity), the\
    \ authors\nmeasured a difference of 13 ◦C in ‘Syrah’ and 17 ◦C in ‘Malbec’ (Tnws\
    \ − Tair). King and Shellie [163]\nreport that a difference between canopy and\
    \ air temperature of vines of about 17 ◦C, which is much\nhigher than with Tdry\
    \ values assumed in other studies and slightly less than the energy balance models\n\
    developed by Jones [111]. Tdry for calculation of the CWSI was estimated as Tair\
    \ + 15 ◦C for both grape\ncultivars, resulting in a CWSI value between 0 and 1\
    \ for irrigation scheduling purposes. The CWSI\nvalue obtained was a good representation\
    \ of a measure of plant water stress.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n22 of 36\nMöller\
    \ et al. [108] studied the effect of different irrigation treatments on grapevines\
    \ for achieving\na higher fruit quality when the vineyard was subjected to mild-to-moderate\
    \ levels of water stress.\nThe authors found a higher accuracy for determining\
    \ CWSI combining thermal and visible images,\nand adopting the following assumptions:\
    \ (i) CWSI calculated with air temperature +5 ◦C and\n(ii) Twet assumed to be\
    \ the average temperature of the wet artiﬁcial reference surface. Other surface\n\
    temperatures were obtained by wetting the canopy surface before thermal image\
    \ acquisition and from\nthe energy balance according to Jones [164]. There was\
    \ a stable linear relationship when Twet was\nderived from the energy balance\
    \ and from image analysis of a wetted part of the canopy. The authors\nsuggested\
    \ in-depth study was needed to develop this calculation as a tool for irrigation\
    \ management\non a ﬁeld scale.\nLópez-López et al. [135] reported that in case\
    \ of no transpiration, the difference between the\nTair and the Tcrop averaged\
    \ 2.8 ◦C (n = 25). Irmak et al. [201] determined an average value of 4.6 ◦C\n\
    for corn.\nOrta et al. [171] determined in a study of trickle-irrigated watermelon\
    \ upper baseline limits of\n3.3 and 3.4 ◦C. Santesteban et al. [173] preferred\
    \ the approach suggested by Jones et al. [156], whereby\nleaves of two sampled\
    \ grapevines were coated on both sides with petroleum jelly to prevent leaf\n\
    transpiration and interrupt the transpiration-cooling phenomenon, simulating the\
    \ leaf physiological\nresponse to water stress conditions. The authors report\
    \ a variation in vineyard temperature range of\nthe (Tdry and Twet) h of about\
    \ 1.3 ◦C and 2.4 ◦C, respectively.\nKing and Shellie [163] adopted a neural model\
    \ to estimate daily mean CWSI starting from\nwell-watered leaf temperatures and\
    \ air temperature plus 15 ◦C for a non-transpiring leaf temperature\n(between\
    \ 13:00 and 15:00 MDT). They were able to discriminate between deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ amounts,\nirrigation events, and rainfall. In contrast, Park et al. [203] estimated\
    \ the lower boundary temperature,\nrepresenting the temperature of fully transpiring\
    \ leaves, while the temperature of a non-transpiring\nleaf (Tdry) was determined\
    \ by air temperature at + 6 ◦C.\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] found Tc − Tair of\
    \ well-irrigated grapes was effectively determined as\nTc − Tair = 0695 − 1.575\
    \ × VPD.\nMangus et al. [186] derived an instantaneous CWSI using air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and\nsolar radiance. Twet reference were empirically found\
    \ using well-watered plants, while a standardized\nTdry reference of 5 ◦C above\
    \ air temperature was utilized to represent the upper leaf temperature.\nThe same\
    \ results were obtained by DeJonge et al. [192] with an upper baseline of 5◦ C\
    \ and a linear\nrelation with VPD.\nGrant et al. [204] studied the effect of the\
    \ canopy architecture on the crop temperatures of two\ngrapevine cultivars grown\
    \ under two irrigation regimes (fully and not irrigated). They concluded that\n\
    it was desirable to calculate an average over several leaves per canopy in order\
    \ to reduce the effect of\nvariation in leaf angles. The simple CWSI, without\
    \ further data acquisition, was sufﬁcient for detecting\nthe relative stress required\
    \ for scheduling irrigation.\nTime of Measurements\nTesti et al. [175] found that\
    \ the CWSI measured in the early afternoon hours was a good\ndescriptor of water\
    \ status of a pistachio orchard. Ghaemi et al. [205] developed baseline equation\
    \ to\ncalculate eggplant CWSI reﬂecting water deﬁcit and salinity stresses, and\
    \ also studied the effect of\ngrowth environment (ﬁeld and greenhouse) on eggplant\
    \ CWSI values and its relationship with crop\nevapotranspiration and yield. CWSI\
    \ values were signiﬁcantly affected by water deﬁcit and salinity,\nand rising\
    \ levels of water salinity decreased the slope of the lower baseline in both crop\
    \ conditions,\nalong with a rise in the upper baseline.\nGarcía-Tejero et al.\
    \ [183] found that the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically\nmeaningful\
    \ thermal data to assess grapevine water status was between 11:00 h and 14:00\
    \ h, independent\nof the variety.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n23 of 36\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] found differences in estimating CWSI at different times of day.\
    \ The smallest\ndifference was from 10:00 to 11:00 h and the highest from 12:00\
    \ to 13:00 h periods. In their study,\nthey combined IR thermometry with some\
    \ weather parameters to develop non-water-stressed and\nnon-transpiring baselines\
    \ for irrigated maize in of Colorado (USA).\nKing and Shelliey [163] reported\
    \ that clouds (thin cirrus), often present during the best\ntwo-hour-time for\
    \ CWSI monitoring, rapidly caused changes in levels of solar radiation and, as\n\
    a consequence, an effect on Tnws. They also provided a detailed description of\
    \ physiological variations\nwithin a canopy; particular attention was given to\
    \ rapid changes of leaf temperature in response to\nenvironmental ﬂuctuations\
    \ (e.g., air turbulence, changing radiation). For this reason, they proposed\n\
    the adoption of a 2-h-averaged CWSI value based on 15-min average measured values\
    \ (canopy\ntemperature, air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and\
    \ wind speed), which provided\na sound daily CWSI value under variable climatic\
    \ conditions. The results appeared to be consistent\neven when comparing two grape\
    \ cultivars, characterized by different canopy temperature in response\nto climatic\
    \ conditions and irrigation conditions.\nBellvert et al. [172] found a good estimate\
    \ for the calculated daily mean CWSI of well-watered\nleaves between 10:00 and\
    \ 16:00 h. Berni et al. [84], using airborne thermal data of an olive orchard,\n\
    found the best results from 07:30 to 09:30; however, at 12:30 h there was an overestimate\
    \ of canopy\nconductance values. Bellvert et al. [202] found that the correlation\
    \ between CWSI and ΨL had different\nR2 values at different hours of measurements\
    \ (0.46 at 09:30 and 0.71 at 12:30), suggesting that the latter\nwas the more\
    \ favorable time for obtaining thermal images that were linked with ΨL values.\n\
    In Zarco-Tejada et al. [145], CWSI was measured from 13:00 to 15:30 coinciding\
    \ with the times at\nwhich the non-stressed baseline was obtained.\n4.3. Remote\
    \ Sensing and Soil\nSoil moisture measurements are critical components for climate\
    \ studies, hydrology, weather\npredictions, analysis of ﬂooded areas or the recharge\
    \ of aquifers. Real time analysis of the soil water\ncontent is crucial for optimizing\
    \ water management of agricultural ﬁelds.\nNichols et al. [206] presented an overview\
    \ of soil-moisture retrieval methods using different\nremote sensing data (active\
    \ or passive). They reported the advantages and limitations of each method,\n\
    and the evaluation of the most robust methods for retrieving soil-moisture information\
    \ from bare and\nvegetated soils. The best results come from a combination of\
    \ active and passive sensing methods.\nA backscatter empirical model (active method)\
    \ gave a 95–97% correlation between the estimated and\nthe ﬁeld soil measurements.\
    \ The “neural networks method” (passive method) gave a 100% correlation\nbetween\
    \ the estimated and ﬁeld soil measurements.\nRoussel et al. [62] reported the\
    \ adoption of GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) based on a low-cost\ndevice and an airborne\
    \ solution. For irrigation purposes, the GNSS-R system was useful for soil\nmoisture\
    \ monitoring. Classical probes were not considered representative of the ﬁeld-soil\
    \ moisture\nsince they return punctual measurements. The authors considered the\
    \ soil moisture monitored on a\nlarge scale to be appropriate, even at the expense\
    \ of temporal and/or spatial resolution. Even satellite\nmeasurements were not\
    \ sufﬁcient to monitor diurnal variations.\nYueh et al. [207] provided a review\
    \ of the calibration, validation and assessment of Soil Moisture\nActive Passive\
    \ (SMAP) instruments. The project conducted two activities aimed at enhancing\
    \ the\nproducts’ resolution: (i) the Backus Gilbert interpolation and de-convolution\
    \ techniques based on the\noversampling characteristics of the SMAP radiometer;\
    \ (ii) the disaggregation of the SMAP radiometer\ndata using the Sentinel-1 C-band\
    \ synthetic aperture radar data to obtain a resolution from 1 km to\n3 km.\nMulder\
    \ et al. [208] studied microwave remote sensing of soil moisture content. The\
    \ system was\nfounded on the different dielectric properties of water with respect\
    \ to dry soil. The Soil Water Index\n(SWI) was combined with the METOP ASCAT and\
    \ ENVISAT ASAR GM to obtain one layer with\nhigh resolution (1 km). The authors\
    \ reported another way of assessing soil moisture, the Soil Energy\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n24 of 36\nBALance (SEBAl). All of these models were applied on\
    \ a local scale to produce the actual ET linked to\nsoil water. The authors indicated\
    \ that the most broadly used methods were the SEBAL, the Two-Source\nEnergy Balance\
    \ (TSEB) modeling approach, and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS).\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] performed a full-season experiment in a greenhouse with several\
    \ objectives.\nSince CWSI (values between 0.6 and 1.0) was negatively correlated\
    \ to soil moisture, the index may be\nconsidered “as an alternate irrigation scheduling\
    \ method to quantify spatial soil moisture”.\nOther information is reported in\
    \ the previous Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.4.\n4.3.1. Vegetation Indices\nDifferent\
    \ indexes have been set up to estimate different crop parameters (e.g., crop density,\n\
    biomass, chlorophyll, nitrogen, water content, etc.); the Enhanced Vegetation\
    \ Index (EVI), the Soil\nAdjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Simple Ratio (SR),\
    \ and the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI), are measures of canopy\
    \ greenness, which may be related to physiological processes\nsuch as transpiration\
    \ and photosynthesis [209–211].\nZhao et al. [212] studied the relationship between\
    \ stem water potential (SWP) and VIs extracted\nfrom high spatial resolution images.\n\
    A circle mission was conducted to evaluate the effects\nof bidirectional reﬂectance\
    \ distribution fraction (BRDF) and canopy NDVI mean.\nThe authors\ndemonstrated\
    \ the importance of BRDF to infer SWP from NDVI mean. Circle missions indicated\
    \ that\nview angle inﬂuenced the canopy NDVI. This could lead to a prediction\
    \ error of SWP of up to 12 bars.\nFurther analysis of images identiﬁed a non-normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NNDVI) based\non ground-derived measurements over\
    \ three weeks that showed a more signiﬁcant relationship with\nSWP than the canopy\
    \ NDVI mean.\nZúñiga et al. [213], in a study on a remote sensing-based WUE evaluation\
    \ of sub-surface irrigated\ngrape vines, compared several irrigation methods.\
    \ Differences in NDVI values occurred among\ndifferent irrigation strategies (surface\
    \ and subsurface irrigation methods) and when irrigation rates\nwere compared.\
    \ Multispectral satellite imagery, particularly with a red edge waveband, demonstrated\n\
    the potential for quantifying soil-moisture-tension variability, and hence could\
    \ be used for variable rate\nirrigation management. Red Edge Normalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (RENDVI) was especially\nsensitive to soil moisture tension\
    \ and demonstrated that a single image could be representative of\nvariability\
    \ up to two weeks after acquisition. However, it will be necessary to conﬁrm the\
    \ repeatability\nof these results at more maize growth stages and with other crops.\
    \ Finally, an economic study to\nevaluate the monetary and environmental implications\
    \ of such management at a ﬁeld scale would\nhelp transition these ﬁndings into\
    \ adoption by growers [214].\nToureiro et al. [215] presented work on the use\
    \ of remote sensing for measuring soil water\navailability for optimizing crop\
    \ growth. Data were determined by satellite and integrated with\natmosphere and\
    \ crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress\n\
    by NDVI, Kc, and Kcb. The results showed that remote sensing based on multispectral\
    \ images\nmay be used, with a high degree of accuracy and spatial representation,\
    \ to calculate crop water\nand irrigation requirements. However, frequent mapping\
    \ of soil water status and crop irrigation\nrequirements would be required; this\
    \ is the weakest point of the satellite imagery methodology used.\nTemporal representation,\
    \ once each 16 days with the Landsat 5 satellite, would not be enough for\nirrigation\

    4.3.2. WUE\nMarino et al. [216] evaluated the use of soil and vegetation spectroradiometry\
    \ to investigate crop\nwater use efﬁciency of drip-irrigated tomato. A new instrument\
    \ to measure in-depth soil moisture was\ntested combined with the Hargreaves method\
    \ and VIs with the goal of reducing irrigation volume, to\nassess crop spatial\
    \ variability, and to identify the best VIs related to WUE, at a ﬁeld scale. The\
    \ tomato\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n25 of 36\ncrop was drip irrigated by an automated\
    \ precision system, which maintained the soil water content\nwithin a speciﬁc\
    \ range related to growth stage and environmental conditions.\nThe instrument\
    \ recorded the soil moisture at different soil depths, providing information on\n\
    the amount of water to apply, taking into account—at each watering—the volume\
    \ of the root zone\nexplored by the crop. The results conﬁrmed that the system\
    \ saved water, applying lower soil water\ndepths than those calculated with the\
    \ Hargreaves formula. The ﬁeld was divided into three clusters,\ncharacterized\
    \ by increasing WUE. The highest (H) cluster showed a WUE value of 35.1 kg·m−3;\n\
    the lowest (L) showed WUE a value of 23.1 kg·m−3. Among VIs tested, the Perpendicular\
    \ vegetation\nindex (PVI), Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index (SAVI), optimized\
    \ Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index\n(OSAVI), and Weighted Difference Vegetation\
    \ (WDVI) were signiﬁcantly related to tomato crop yield.\nThe authors concluded\
    \ that “PVI proved to be a useful tool for (i) a better understanding of the different\
    \ ﬁeld\nproductive areas and for (ii) the adoption of variable water rate application\
    \ according to the different PVI values.\nThe irrigation system adopted proved\
    \ to be effective from agronomic and environmental point of view”.\nSimilar probes\
    \ were used by Nolz et al. [217] to monitor soil water in a vineyard for irrigation\n\
    management. Wang et al. [218] studied the application of quick techniques based\
    \ on thermal imaging\nand visual-NIR spectroscopy for measuring WUE in millet.\
    \ The authors suggested that the exact\nspectral parameters used for measuring\
    \ physiological factors (e.g., E, gs, leaf and WUE) may be used\nfor estimating\
    \ response of crops to changes in the environmental conditions.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    The advances in electronic and information technologies have developed various\
    \ non-invasive\nsensing systems, which return accurate georeferred information\
    \ on spatial variability within ﬁelds.\nThe sensing systems utilize sensors and\
    \ instruments that produce a huge amount of data at\ndifferent scales (temporal\
    \ and spatial) and distances from the target. Remote (satellite, airborne\nand\
    \ UAV imageries) and proximal sensors (mounted on tractors, poles or towers, and\
    \ portable\nspecto-radiometers) are able to detect soil and crop information,\
    \ such as soil status and traits, crop yield,\ncanopy volume and biomass, crop\
    \ water status, and pests (disease, weeds, and insects). These sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ cane be used for precision agriculture and irrigation management.\nSoaring investments\
    \ in R&D have spurred all branches of knowledge linked to RS, boosting the\nproduction\
    \ of reliable and accurate sensors. Temporal frequency of RS imagery has also\
    \ improved\nconsistently, although it has been impaired by considerable lengthening\
    \ of the average times for data\nprocessing. Data processing of images necessitates\
    \ adequate hardware, speciﬁc expertise, skills and\nfunds, which are likely to\
    \ be provided only by specialized reprocessing companies.\nOverall, there are\
    \ numerous studies with spatially distributed information on ET and plant\nwater\
    \ status. These approaches use reﬂectance, including thermal radiance, measurements\
    \ of the\nsurface, vegetation index-based crop coefﬁcients, surface energy balance\
    \ models, and soil water balance\n(although limited to the upper soil layer).\n\
    On a small scale, the focus on time and space has signiﬁcantly improved the monitoring\
    \ of the\ncrop water status of many crops, especially orchards and vineyards.\
    \ The estimation of ET and kc,\nof appearance of biotic and abiotic stresses,\
    \ of crop spatial variability, and of canopy volume have\nbeen improved signiﬁcantly.\
    \ On a ﬁeld scale, the attention paid to soil-water status seems inadequate,\n\
    although soil moisture monitoring is a prerequisite for professionally controlled\
    \ irrigation that satisﬁes\ncrop water requirements (precision irrigation) and\
    \ reduces inefﬁcient spatial allocation of irrigation\nwater, in particular over\
    \ irrigation that causes N leaching. There are current limits of RS, which can\n\
    answer the question of “when to apply water”, because the irrigation volume needs\
    \ to be estimated\nbased on other methods, as wisely pointed out by Taghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] These other methods,\ninclude—amongst many—the use of electronic\
    \ probes measuring crop water consumption [113], with\nthe aim of deﬁning the\
    \ right water depth to apply to a ﬁeld, and hopefully to each homogeneous area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n26 of 36\nSince positive correlations between crop-water\
    \ status and yield vary among crops, RS studies on\nirrigation should pay more\
    \ attention to ﬁeld production, either in absolute terms (maximizing ﬁeld\nproductivity)\
    \ or in relative terms (higher WUE).\nIn the near future, it is likely that all\
    \ available tools (multi-temporal images combined with\nmodels and improved sensors)\
    \ will contribute to monitoring crop status for triggering irrigation.\nAs mentioned\
    \ above, doubts persist on their ability to estimate the water delivery to the\
    \ ﬁeld for each\ncrop, or to different zones in the case of high crop spatial\
    \ variability.\nA holistic approach is necessary for moving toward precision irrigation.\
    \ It will be necessary\nto set up networks that contemplate the participation\
    \ of public/private partnerships, universities,\nand research institutes, for\
    \ producing multi-temporal images, models, sensors and data sets [94] for\nmanaging\
    \ precision irrigation. Among several EU hubs of excellence, the Quantalab IAS—CSIC\
    \ in\nSpain focuses on quantitative methods for remote sensing in agriculture\
    \ and forestry, for a wide\napplication of precision agriculture and precision\
    \ irrigation, for the assessment of environmental\nimpacts and stress detection.\n\
    Other\nscientists\nare\npursuing\ngrassroots\nremote\nsensing\nand\ndemocratic\n\
    mapping.\nAnderson et al. [93] have generated a toolkit using drones, live coding,\
    \ smartphones and kites.\nFor all institutions developing RS, a key factor will\
    \ be the operational readiness of information\nprovided to farmers and technicians\
    \ for managing irrigation. For irrigation purposes, it will be\nnecessary to develop\
    \ techniques and interpretative frameworks to provide low-cost and affordable\n\
    tools and real-time information to stakeholders involved in the management and\
    \ security of\nagricultural and related sectors.\nAuthor Contributions: Arturo\

    Get rights and content Highlights • The base concepts of soil water balance (SWB)
    models using the dual Kc approach are discussed. • The use of SWB, transient state,
    and crop growth and yield models is discussed. • The SIMDualKc model is taken
    as example and various extensions of the dual Kc are presented. • Trends for real
    time irrigation are discussed, including remote and proximal sensing data assimilation.
    • Future trends are analysed from the perspective of using remote sensing and
    cloud data. Abstract This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches
    to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the
    FAO56 method. The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline
    concepts namely standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc
    approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and
    calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches
    is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop
    evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient
    state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion
    on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity.
    The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication
    of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following
    FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling
    approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc,
    mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach
    to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining
    beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing
    the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table.
    The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time
    irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale
    multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things
    (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant
    sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance
    and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements.
    Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional
    models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models
    based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm
    practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks,
    re-analysis and other sources, and Kc data available in real time from large databases
    and remote sensing. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Crop

    use assessmentSIMDualKc model 1. Introduction The current imbalance between water
    demand and supply in agriculture has driven the search for new equilibria through
    adopting modern technologies and management tools to optimize irrigation water
    use (Pereira et al., 2009; Pereira, 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2020). The successful
    use of these tools depends, however, upon their adaptation to prevailing social,
    economic, institutional, climatic, soil and other environmental conditions. Reducing
    the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change, and ultimately decreasing
    the risks associated to food security, requires integrated and sustainable water
    management, including the adaptation of cropping systems and management practices
    adopting an efficient use of both rainfall and irrigation water. The need for
    such sustainable water management practices is particularly critical considering
    the steady increase of global population and the limitations on availability of
    natural resources, particularly in vulnerable agricultural areas where water scarcity
    is of great importance (Smith, 2000; Pereira, 2017). Sustainable water management
    at farm level assumes an enormous relevance, namely in terms of adopting adequate
    irrigation schedules, that should lead to optimal yields and agricultural and
    irrigation practices that allow reducing but optimizing water use, particularly
    non-beneficial ones (Pereira et al., 2009, 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2020). Numerous
    irrigation scheduling simulation models have been produced and made available
    to support irrigation decision-making since the 80’s as reported in various international
    conferences (ASAE, 1981, 1985, 1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995;
    Ragab et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996). The reported irrigation scheduling models
    were often based upon crop evapotranspiration and yield-water relations proposed
    in FAO manuals 24 and 33 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979).
    Reported soil water balance (SWB) models include steady state and transient state
    models. Steady state models solve the law of conservation of mass within a selected
    time step, generally a day, while transient state models contain the time variable
    explicitly and computations refer to the fluxes of water within and through the
    boundaries of the control volume of soil. The latter, highly exigent in terms
    of data and using mechanistic approaches to simulate soil water processes, often
    include mechanistic sub-models to simulate plant growth, predict crop yields as
    influenced by various environmental factors, and to assess the transport of salt,
    chemicals and pollutants that impact farm water use and sustainability. Steady
    state SWB models are less exigent in terms of parameterization and, when properly
    calibrated, are very accurate and easier to use for irrigation scheduling, as
    well as to assess the impact of changing environmental conditions on crops evapotranspiration
    and yield, which may be predicted when the model is associated to, or incorporates
    yield-water functions. A variety of tools, namely using hyperspectral reflectance
    data (Melton et al., 2012; Campos et al., 2017; Pôças et al., 2017; Saadi et al.,
    2018), can be used to support improved irrigation scheduling. More commonly, remote
    sensing vegetation indices may be used in combination with ground data after integration
    in current SWB model approaches (Olioso et al., 2005; Er-Raki et al., 2007; Santos
    et al., 2008; Vazifedoust et al., 2009; Pôças et al., 2015; Thorp et al., 2015;
    Corbari et al., 2019), although adopting a variety of data and integrative solutions.
    The current paper is focusing on steady state SWB simulation models having a known
    software and, mainly, when adopting the FAO56 method to determine ETc from the
    reference ETo and a crop coefficient. Particular attention is given to models
    that adopt the dual Kc approach due to the relevance of determining transpiration
    and soil evaporation, the former consisting of the beneficial consumptive use
    of water. Considering the vast panoply of innovation tools that support sustainable
    water use on farms, the overarching aim of this paper is to provide a review of
    the advances gained in modelling with the FAO56 method in the past two decades.
    The specific objectives of this paper are: (a) to discuss simple approaches to
    steady state water balance modelling in contrast with transient state, mechanistic
    soil water, crop growth and yield models; (b) to provide for an overview on models/software
    used to improve irrigation scheduling and management, with focus on dual Kc modelling
    with consideration of water scarcity and saving; c) to show examples of model
    applications and water use assessment based on the SIMDualKc model; and d) to
    analyze current trends and opportunities, focusing particularly on real time irrigation
    scheduling using modern information technologies. This article consists of various
    Sections. After the current Introduction, Section 2 refers to main concepts and
    calculation approaches of the FAO56 method and includes discussions on the one-step
    approach, transient state modeling, crop growth and yield prediction, and water
    use indicators. Section 3 presents an overview of SWB models aimed at improving
    irrigation scheduling and management, and Section 4 focuses on the dual Kc approaches
    taking the SIMDualKc model as an example for adopting and extending the use of
    the FAO56 dual Kc approach. Section 5 discusses real time irrigation scheduling
    and latest developments, namely related to the applications of remote sensing
    and internet platforms aimed at multi-users, while Section 6 presents the main
    conclusions and future trends. 2. Reference concepts 2.1. Crop evapotranspiration,
    crop water requirements and irrigation requirements The FAO56 method (Allen et
    al., 1998) uses the simple Kc-ETo approach to determine crop evapotranspiration
    as the product of a crop coefficient (Kc) and the grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) computed with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (PM-ETo). The PM-ETo equation
    is derived from the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation (Monteith, 1965)
    when it was parameterized for the standard grass reference crop (Allen et al.,
    1994a,b, 1998). As analyzed in the next Section, the PM equation is often used
    for direct calculation of crop ET. The FAO56 method adopted the concept of standard,
    optimal crop conditions as the basis for tabularizing the Kc values, which consisted
    of a main difference to the previous FAO24 method (Pereira et al., 2015a). Thus,
    Kc and ETc in FAO56 refer to potential crop ET rates under optimal, well-watered
    crop production conditions, which often differ from the field and common practice
    where crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non-uniform
    irrigation, low crop density, less adequate soil and agronomic management and/or
    salinity. The tabulated Kc values in FAO56 or in the review papers (Jensen and
    Allen, 2016; Pereira et al., 2020a,b,d) refer to the standard climate and need
    to be adjusted to the local climate (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). The potential ETc
    as computed from standard Kc values is then replaced by the actual crop ET, ETc
    act, and the standard Kc are replaced by the actual Kc act values, with Kc act
    =Ks Kc where Ks is a stress coefficient due to water deficiency or salinity effects,
    and that can be extended to other cultivation stresses. The concept of dual Kc
    was also adopted in addition to the traditional single one. The single Kc represents
    averaged soil evaporation (Es) and crop transpiration (Tc) from a cropped surface
    for typical frequencies of wetting. However, as noted by in the review by Pereira
    et al. (2015a), the single Kc only represents typical conditions that can vary
    with the wetting frequency by precipitation and irrigation, with the type of irrigation
    practiced and with crop management, namely the inter-row management in row crops.
    Adopting the concept of dual crop coefficient, Kc= Kcb+ Ke, where Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing primarily plant transpiration and Ke is the evaporation
    coefficient that represents the contribution of evaporation from soil to total
    ET, the variation of both Es and Tc are considered independently. In view of this,
    the partition of ETc or ETc act into both these components as proposed by FAO56
    (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a) allows to better represent field and management issues
    when acting differently on Es and Tc. The two stage evaporation model of Ritchie
    (1972) is adopted for the calculation of Ke, which implies performing an independent
    water balance of the evaporation top layer of the soil. The FAO56 method is dealt
    in detail with the very recent reviews and updates of the single and basal crop
    coefficients (Pereira et al., 2020a through d). These reviews also focused on
    the accuracy of diverse ET measurement methods, namely the measurement of changes
    of soil water, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio energy balance, sap-flow, and remote
    sensing vegetation indices (Allen et al., 2011b; Pereira et al., 2020a,b). Crop
    water requirements (CWR, mm) consist of the seasonal amount of water required
    by a crop to achieve its potential production under a given environment. CWR correspond
    to the seasonal potential crop ET (ETc, mm) and added the seasonal leaching requirement
    (LR, mm) required to control effects of soil and water salinity in case of cropping
    in saline soils or when using salty water (including treated wastewater). LR is
    herein considered as part of the CWR given the importance for the crop yield and
    the soil environment to adopt appropriate salinity control. Salinity effects and
    related water management control measures were recently reviewed and discussed
    by Minhas et al. (2020). The net irrigation requirements (NIR, mm) consist of
    the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its
    CWR when the water available through precipitation (P, mm), capillary rise (CR,
    mm) and soil water storage variation (SWvar, mm) are insufficient. NIR relative
    to the crop season, or to any selected time period, is given by the soil water
    balance as: (1) NIR = CWR – (P + SWvar + CR) + DP + RO where, in addition to variables
    previously defined, DP is deep percolation from the soil root zone (mm) and RO
    is runoff (mm), with all variables referring to the time period considered for
    the computation. The gross irrigation requirements (GIR, mm) for any time step
    is given as: (2) where BWUF is the beneficial water use fraction of the applied
    irrigation water (Pereira et al., 2012). BWUF is commonly referred as application
    efficiency when referring to the field, or combined conveyance, distribution and
    application efficiency when considering the operational losses in the conveyance
    and distribution canal and/or conduits systems in addition to application on the
    farm (Burt et al., 1997; Bos et al., 2005; Heermann and Solomon, 2007). 2.2. Computing
    the crop evapotranspiration: the one-step vs. the two-step approaches The Penman-Monteith
    combination equation (Monteith, 1965) may be used for computing crop ET as a one-step
    approach contrarily to the FAO56 method that adopts the two-step Kc-ETo product
    referred above. With the Penman-Monteith combination equation (PM-eq), crop ET
    is computed using the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances of the crop; differently,
    with the FAO method crop ET is given as the product of the grass reference ET
    (ETo) by the crop coefficient (Kc). Kc represents the integrated differences between
    the considered crop and the reference crop in terms of aerodynamic and bulk surface
    resistances. ETo is derived from the PM combination equation parameterized for
    the grass reference crop. The Penman-Monteith combination equation (Monteith,
    1965) is generally written as (3) where λ is the latent heat of vaporization [MJ
    kg −1], Rn-G is the net balance of energy available at the surface [MJ m-2 d-1],
    (es-ea) represents the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of air at the reference (weather
    measurement) height [kPa], ρ is mean air density [kg m-3], cp is specific heat
    of air at constant pressure [MJ kg-1 °C-1], Δ represents the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature relationship at mean air temperature [kPa °C-1], γ
    is the psychometric constant [kPa °C-1], rs is the bulk surface resistance [s
    m-1], and ra is the aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]. The transfer of heat and vapor
    from the evaporative surface into the air in the turbulent layer above a canopy
    is determined by the aerodynamic resistance ra between the surface and the reference
    level above the canopy. That transfer is determined by the wind speed, the height
    of wind speed, air temperature and air humidity measurements, as well as crop
    height and canopy architecture (Perrier, 1982). The surface resistance rs for
    full-cover canopies is often expressed as a function of the stomatal resistance
    of a well-illuminated leaf (rl) and of the effective leaf area index (LAIeff).
    The use of the PM-eq for prediction of crop water requirements is difficult because
    crop height and canopy architecture change throughout the crop cycle, thus changing
    the framework for computing ra and rs, which also changes with rl, thus with leaf
    age and water availability conditions, as well as with LAIeff. In addition, for
    the same crop, ra and rs are influenced by differences among varieties, and crop
    management and irrigation practices. Moreover, resistances rl and rs are influenced
    by the climate and water availability, with rs increasing when soil water availability
    limits ET, the VPD increases and ra is higher; rs decreases when the energy available
    at the surface increases. According to Alves et al. (1998) and Alves and Pereira
    (2000), rs may be expressed as dependent of ra and of the weather variables as
    (4) where β is the Bowen ratio (the ratio between the sensible and latent heat
    fluxes). In this equation β plays the role of a water-stress indicator. This equation
    illustrates that the weather variables interact and their influences are inter-dependent,
    which adds to the difficulties in appropriately selecting rs, thus creating challenges
    in applying the PM-eq or “multi-layer” resistance equations such as the two-source
    Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) equation (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). Various
    applications of the PM-eq (Eq. 3) are reported in the literature and they show
    that the SWB is not required to consider water stress impacts since the parameterization
    of Eq. 3 takes into account the water stress, e.g. through the consideration of
    stomatal conductance or predawn leaf water potential (Rana et al., 1997, 2001;
    Zhang et al., 2011). However, Ortega-Farias et al. (2004, 2006) performed the
    adjustment to water stress using a normalized soil water factor, similar to the
    stress coefficient Ks described in the next Section, which computation requires
    a simple SWB. A few studies compared the PM-eq with the Kc-ETo approach (Lovelli
    et al., 2008; Irmak and Mutiibwa, 2009). The accuracy of ET estimates depends
    upon the parameterization of the PM-eq. The one-step PM and SW equations are excellent
    for ET simulation but they are basically used in research, while the two-step
    Kc-ETo is used both in research and to support field practice as per the recent
    reviews by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo et al. (2020). The PM-eq (Eq. 3)
    is the base for the PM-ETo equation (Allen et al., 1994a,b, 1998), which for daily
    time steps computation takes the form (5) where, in addition to variables defined
    for Eq. (3), T is mean daily air temperature [°C] and u2 is wind speed [m s−1],
    with measurements at 2 m height. This represents a hypothetical crop with an assumed
    height of 0.12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23,
    closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively
    growing and adequately watered. This equation is also parameterized for hourly
    time steps (Allen et al., 2006). Kc represents an integration of the effects of
    three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference: crop
    height (affecting roughness and aerodynamic resistance); crop-soil surface resistance
    (related to leaf area, fraction of ground covered by vegetation, leaf age and
    condition, degree of stomatal control, and soil surface wetness); and albedo of
    the crop-soil surface (influenced by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation
    and soil surface wetness). It is defined through the ratio between potential crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and the reference ETo, thus (6) Kc = ETc/ETo The challenge,
    therefore, has been to summarize all referred differences relative to the PM-eq
    (Eq. 3) between the considered crop and the reference crop to just one parameter,
    Kc. Although, it was demonstrated (Pereira et al., 1999) that Kc values relate
    intimately with the ratios between ra and rs of the considered crop and the reference
    crop, which makes Kc a non-purely empirical parameter but a deterministic one.
    Though when using the two-step approach to compute crop ET, it is possible to
    achieve highly accurate estimation of crop ET, close to the accuracy obtained
    with the one-step PM-eq, despite the high requirements of the latter in terms
    of parameterization (Ortega-Farias et al., 2006; Lovelli et al., 2008; Irmak and
    Mutiibwa, 2009). 2.3. Soil water balance: the FAO56 method With the objective
    of managing irrigation in the day to day practice, instead of Eq. 1, the daily
    soil water balance applied to the entire root zone (Allen et al., 1998, 2007)
    may be expressed through computing the soil water depletion at the end of every
    day (Dr,i, mm), which is given as: (7) where Dr,i-1 is the root zone depletion
    at the end of previous day i-1 (mm), Pi is precipitation (mm), ROi is runoff (mm),
    Ii is the net irrigation depth that infiltrates the soil (mm), CRi is capillary
    rise from the shallow groundwater table (mm), ETc act,i is the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), and DPi is deep percolation through the bottom of the root zone (mm), with
    all terms referring to day i. ETc act refers to both optimal and suboptimal crop
    and irrigation conditions, i.e., under full or deficit irrigation and/or diverse
    cropping practices. Solving the water balance equation (Eq. 7) requires soil water
    content observations (or their estimation from observed soil matric potential),
    which allow to estimate the root zone depletion Dr. A computational algorithm
    is required to perform a daily SWB, which is based upon the knowledge of soil
    hydraulic properties, the field capacity and wilting point ( FC and θWP, m3 m−3)
    of various soil layers down to the bottom of the root zone. To estimate runoff,
    deep percolation and capillary rise, appropriate algorithms are required as discussed
    by Liu et al. (2006) and Allen et al. (2007). RO, DP and CR cannot be just estimated
    when an accurate SWB is to be performed, thus appropriate computational approaches
    are required, including simple spreadsheet applications to just support irrigation
    scheduling. ETc act is computed as: (8) ETc act=Ks Kc ETo = (Ks Kcb + Ke) ETo
    which requires knowing the standard values of Kc and/or Kcb and the daily estimation
    of the stress coefficient Ks, as well as the adjustment to climate of standard
    Kc mid, Kc end, Kcb mid and Kcb end values (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). Kc ini and
    Kcb ini values have to be determined as recommended by Allen et al. (1998, 2005a,2005b).
    Indicative Kc and Kcb values are tabulated by Allen et al. (1998), Allen and Pereira
    (2009), Jensen and Allen (2016) and updated by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo
    et al. (2020). FAO56 expressed Ks as a linear function of root zone depletion
    Dr when depletion exceeds the readily available water, RAW (mm), in the root zone,
    thus: (9a) (9b) where TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available
    soil water (mm), and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress (Allen
    et al., 1998). TAW is defined as the available soil water stored in the root zone
    with depth zr (m), thus computed as 1000 (θFC - θWP) zr, and RAW corresponds to
    the readily available portion of TAW, thus RAW = p TAW. Updated values for the
    p fractions for vegetable and field crops are tabulated by Pereira et al. (2020a,
    b). The value for Ks due to salinity stress is discussed in FAO56 (Allen et al.,
    1998) and in the review paper by Minhas et al. (2020). Referring to Eq. 9, it
    may be deduced that when no water stress occurs (Ks = 1.0) then θ≥θp, i.e. the
    soil water content is not below the threshold θp, which corresponds to the soil
    water content when the soil water depletion equals the depletion fraction p for
    no stress [0 - 1]. Therefore, θp is assumed as the soil water content threshold
    for no-stress or full irrigation: (10a) A management allowed depletion (MAD) larger
    than p is selected when deficit irrigation is adopted, i.e., when the depletion
    fraction exceeds p. The respective soil water threshold is then θMAD < θp: (10b)
    Examples on using these thresholds are given in Section 4.4. When adopting the
    dual Kc approach, it is required to separately compute Kcb and Ke and two SWB
    are required, the one relative to the root zone for computing transpiration, the
    other relative to the top soil layer, from where evaporation occurs, to compute
    soil evaporation. A spreadsheet calculator was provided in Annex 8 of FAO56 (Allen
    et al., 1998). The computation of Ke is based upon the assumption that evaporation
    from the soil is governed by the amount of water available in the upper soil layer
    from where water evaporates, and the amount of energy available at the soil surface.
    The latter depends upon the portion of wetted ground surface exposed to radiation
    and the portion of total energy consumed by transpiration. Ke is then calculated
    as: (11) where Kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient [0-1], few is the fraction
    of soil surface wetted and exposed to solar radiation, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient
    representing transpiration, and Kc max is the maximum value for Kc following rain
    or irrigation (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a). Kc max depends upon mid-season climate,
    through the wind speed u2 (m s−1) and the minimum relative humidity RHmin (%),
    and upon crop height h (m): (12) where u2 = 2 m s−1 and RHmin = 45 % characterize
    the standard climate (Allen et al., 1998). The depth of water depleted from the
    few fraction of soil wetted and exposed (De, mm), is computed from the daily water
    balance of the upper 0.10 to 0.15 m of the soil as (13) where the subscript i
    refers to the day of estimation, Pi is the precipitation [mm], ROi is runoff [mm],
    Ii is the net irrigation depth [mm] that infiltrates the soil in the wetted fraction
    fw, (Ke ETo/few)i is the evaporation from the few fraction of the exposed soil
    surface [mm], and Ts i is the transpiration from the fw fraction of the evaporating
    soil layer [mm]. When De exceeds the readily evaporable water (REW), the evaporation
    rate decreases in proportion to the remaining water. Therefore, Kr (Eq. 11) is
    calculated as: (14a) (14b) where REW and TEW are respectively the readily and
    total evaporable water in the soil evaporation layer of depth ze (m), which depend
    upon the soil textural and hydraulic characteristics of that soil layer. Further
    details on the water balance of the evaporation layer are discussed by Allen et
    al. (1998, 2005a) and Rosa et al. (2012a, b). When the complete soil surface is
    fully wetted by precipitation or irrigation, the fraction few consists of the
    fraction of ground non-shaded by the vegetation (1-fc), thus few p = 1-fc, where
    fc is the average fraction covered by vegetation [0 – 1.0]. When only a fraction
    of the soil surface is wetted by irrigation, few i = min (1-fc, fw). These differences
    in few, thus in few Kc max (Eq. 11), evidence that it is required to compute separately
    Ke for the cases when rainfall and irrigation fully wet the ground, or when irrigation
    only partially wets the soil, e.g. under drip or furrow irrigation. Different
    few fractions then occur. A weighing coefficient for partitioning the energy available
    for soil evaporation depending upon fc and fw (Allen et al., 2005a, b; Rosa et
    al., 2012a) eases the daily Ke computation. The fraction fc should be observed
    in the field as reviewed by Pereira et al. (2020c); otherwise, it may be estimated
    according to Allen et al. (1998) as: (15) where Kc min is the minimum Kc for dry,
    bare soil, generally 0.15. The exponent "1 + 0.5 h" represents the effect of plant
    height on shading the soil and increasing the Kcb given a specific value for fc.
    (Kcb - Kc min) ≥ 0.01 for numerical stability. Eq. 11 is the base for partitioning
    ET. On the one hand, it shows that when the crop develops, from the initial to
    the mid-season stage, Kcb increases and the difference Kc max-Kcb therefore decreases,
    as well as the fraction few since fc also increases. Therefore, Ke decreases as
    much as Kcb and fc increase. Contrarily, during the late season Ke increases because
    Kcb and fc decrease. The rates of Kcb and fc variation, thus of Ke decrease or
    increase, change from a crop to another and with the management practices, with
    Kcb varying also with water and salinity stress (Ks, Eq. 9). On the other hand,
    Ke varies with the water amount available for evaporation, which depends upon
    Kr with the irrigation method and frequency of irrigation. The advantage of the
    adopted approach results from combining the variation of Kcb and Ke and adopting
    Kc max as the upper limit for Kcb+Ke. Therefore, there is the need for performing
    daily the water balance of the soil evaporation layer in addition to the root
    zone water balance, which increases the accuracy of computations. A discussion
    comparing the ET partition using the FAO56 dual Kc approach with that used in
    the popular AquaCrop model has been presented by Pereira et al. (2015b), which
    highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the FAO56 dual Kc approach. As referred
    by DeJonge and Thorp (2017), reported results with maize and cotton have shown
    that crop coefficient simulations with the dual “ETo-Kcb method better mimicked
    theoretical behavior, including spikes in the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke)
    due to irrigation and rainfall events and basal crop coefficient response as associated
    with simulated crop growth.” Consequently, the FAO56 approach has been implemented
    with the DSSAT Crop System Model (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017). 2.4. Soil water balance:
    transient state models Mechanistic approaches to the SWB commonly compute variably-saturated
    water flow as described by Richards’ equation: (16) where θ is the volumetric
    soil water content [L3 L−3], t is time [T], z is the vertical space coordinate
    [L], h is the pressure head [L], K is the hydraulic conductivity [L T−1], and
    S is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots [L3 L−3 T−1]. The
    unsaturated soil hydraulic properties are often described with the van Genuchten-Mualem
    functional relationships (van Genuchten, 1980). These relationships require appropriate
    calibration. The sink term, S, may be calculated using the Feddes et al. (1978)
    approach where the potential transpiration rate, Tp [L T−1], is distributed over
    the root zone using the normalized root density distribution function, β(z,t)
    [L−1], and multiplied by the dimensionless stress response function, α(h, hϕ,
    z, t), that accounts for water and osmotic stresses. In HYDRUS-1D (Šimünek and
    Hopmans, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011) we have: (17) where Sp(z,t) and S(h, hϕ, z,
    t) are the potential and actual volumes of water removed from unit volume of soil
    per unit of time [L3 L−3 T−1], respectively, and α(h, hϕ, z, t) is a prescribed
    dimensionless function of the soil water (h) and osmotic (hϕ) pressure heads (0≤α≤1).
    The actual transpiration rate, Ta [L T-1], is obtained by integrating Eq. (13)
    over the root domain LR: (18) It is generally assumed that the potential root
    water uptake is reduced when water stress occurs due to deficit irrigation and/or
    osmotic potential resulting from soil salinity or the use of saline irrigation
    waters. While the Richards’ equation is commonly adopted in a variety of models,
    the sink term may be different from a model to another. For solving the Richards’
    equation, the formulation of the boundary conditions may be diverse. In SWAP (Vazifedoust
    et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013), the upper boundary condition is determined by
    the fluxes of potential evapotranspiration computed with the PM-eq (Eq. 3). The
    model does not use the FAO56 method but it allows computing the actual Kc (Xu
    et al., 2013). Differently, with HYDRUS, the Kc-ETo approach is often used to
    define the potential ET flux at the upper boundary (Ramos et al., 2011); alternatively,
    Ramos et al. (2012) used the sum Kcb-ETo and Ke-ETo with Kcb and Ke obtained with
    a dual Kc partition tool. Transient state models may be calibrated purposefully
    for scheduling irrigation under selected conditions, e.g. the model SWB-2D for
    drip irrigated hedgerow orchards (Annandale et al., 2003). Transient state models
    usually perform the partition of ETc act with reference to the crop leaf area
    index (LAI), particularly when knowing its maximum values, LAImax. Because transient
    state models focus on the accurate simulation of water fluxes within and through
    the boundaries of the soil root zone, these models accurately compute DP and CR
    and, often also RO. When applied to rice, they can also simulate water depth in
    the paddies (Bhadra et al., 2013). These models may be used to parameterize steady
    state SWB models, e.g. the WAVE model was used to define the parametric DP and
    CR equations adopted in the model ISAREG (Liu et al., 2006) and later in SIMDualKc.
    Transient state models, since they are mechanistic models that accurately simulate
    the dynamics of transpiration, are commonly integrated with crop growth and yield
    models, e.g. SWACROP (Kabat et al., 1992) and SWATRER-SUCROS (Xevi and Feyen,
    1992). Currently, coupling of transient state and crop growth and yield models
    is commonly adopted, e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and
    EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). The advantage of transient state models is that soil water
    processes can be accurately described mechanistically, e.g. infiltration and water
    redistribution, root water uptake, deep percolation and capillary rise. However,
    the inputs of soil hydraulic properties, such as the soil water retention and
    permeability curves (respectively θ(h) and K(h) curves), are much more exigent
    than for simpler SWB models in terms of data acquisition and θ(h) and K(h) calibration.
    Often, the inverse model simulation needs to be adopted for their calibration
    before application. In addition, the vegetation parameters needed are much more
    complex than for FAO56-based SWB models. Therefore, these models are hard to parameterize
    and calibrate resulting more suitable for agronomic and irrigation research, and
    when assessing nitrates, chemicals and salinity dynamics in relation to crop growth
    and yield. Differently, the SWB models adopting the FAO56 methods are easier to
    use and appropriate to support practical irrigation scheduling and planning, as
    well as to assess the performance of irrigation management options. Along this
    line, the crop simulation models DSSAT-CSM, which basically require an accurate
    prediction of transpiration to predict biomass and yield accurately, recently
    adopted the FAO56 approaches (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017), namely the grass reference
    ETo and the FAO56 dual Kc approach. 2.5. Crop yields prediction and performance
    indicators for irrigation scheduling Knowledge of yield responses to water is
    required to construct irrigation scheduling models, namely aiming at developing
    appropriate irrigation schedules that cope with the variability of climatic conditions,
    water availability limitations, and the need to improve yields and economic returns.
    Crop growth models may then be used to predict biomass and yields in combination
    with predicted or assessed crop and irrigation management practices. The DSSAT-CSM
    models are often used for assessing yields when comparing irrigation management
    options (DeJonge et al., 2012; Thorp et al., 2014). By recently adopting the FAO56
    Kcb-ETo approach (Thorp et al., 2017), their use for assessing irrigation management
    options resulted easier to interpret. The crop growth and yield SWB AquaCrop (Raes
    et al., 2016) is also commonly used but, contrarily to the DSSAT models, its approach
    to calculating ET diverges from the FAO56 method. Another approach consists of
    coupling a crop model with a transient state model. e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D
    (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). These models may be very
    demanding in terms of parameterization and input data, but they are suitable when
    dealing with complex hydrologic and water quality conditions. Simple yield prediction
    approaches, such as the one by Jensen (1968), consist of a multiplicative parametric
    function that combines the effects of limited soil water on yield at various crop
    growth stages. Hanks (1974) developed the model PLANTGRO assuming that total dry
    matter production is directly proportional to the seasonal transpiration. For
    grain yield predictions, Hanks (1974) adapted the Jensen (1968) model and developed
    a multi-stage model (Hanks and Hill, 1980), while Stewart et al. (1977) assumed
    a linear dependence of the relative yield deficit from the relative evapotranspiration
    deficit, which is described as: (19) where Ky is the yield response factor, Ya
    and Ym are, respectively, the actual and maximum (potential) yields (kg ha−1),
    and ETc act and ETc are, respectively, the actual and potential crop evapotranspiration
    (mm) corresponding to the yields Ya and Ym. Ym may be observed or estimated. ETc
    act and ETc may be observed or computed with a SWB model. Ky values are tabulated
    for a wide range of crops (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and they were updated recently
    (Minhas et al., 2020). Stewart et al. (1977) also proposed a multiple linear phasic
    model to account for the effects of water deficit during the vegetative, flowering
    and maturation stages using specific yield response factors (βi) for each stage
    i, which were tabulated by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). Considering that transpiration
    is the ET component directly responsible for yield formation, and that various
    models perform the partition of ET, hence estimating transpiration, a modified
    version of Stewart’s model (Paredes et al., 2014) may be used to estimate Ya:
    (20) where Tc act and Tc are, respectively, the seasonal actual and potential
    crop transpiration (mm), thus replacing ET in Eq. (19). Research has shown that
    both Stewart’s global and phasic models predict yields with appropriate accuracy
    for evaluating irrigation schedules, namely when using Eq. (20) with Tc act data
    computed with the SIMDualKc model. Fig. 1a shows that maize yield predictions
    with Eq. (20) match well the yields observed in experiments carried out in both
    Portugal and Uruguay (Paredes et al., 2014; Giménez et al., 2016), and Fig. 1b
    shows a similar match of soybean yields relative to experiments developed in China
    and Uruguay (Wei et al., 2015; Giménez et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res

    (b0 - regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the origin; R2 –
    coefficient of determination of the ordinary least squares regression, RMSE –
    root mean square error, NRMSE – normalized root mean square error). Water scarcity
    and global change lead irrigation water use to essentially aim at increased water
    productivity, water conservation and water saving. Water conservation refers to
    every policy, managerial measure, or user practice that aims at conserving or
    preserving the water resources and combating its degradation, namely focusing
    on its quality, while water saving aims at limiting or controlling the water demand
    and use, thus avoiding wastes and the misuse of water (Pereira et al., 2012; Pereira,
    2017). A comprehensive analysis on water conservation and saving measures and
    practices for a variety of agricultural uses was presented by Pereira et al. (2009,
    2012) and Jovanovic et al. (2020). Water productivity in agriculture (WP, kg m−3),
    also known as water use efficiency, may be generically defined as the ratio between
    the actual crop yield achieved (Ya) and the corresponding water use, which may
    refer to the total water use (TWU), hence including rainfall, to the irrigation
    water use (IWU), to the consumptive use (ETc act), or just to crop transpiration
    (Tc act). Therefore, different indicators result to assess diverse irrigation
    scheduling scenarios: (21) (22) (23) (24) where P is rainfall, CR is capillary
    rise or groundwater contribution, ΔSW is the variation in soil water storage in
    the root zone from planting to harvesting, I is the amount of irrigation, ETc
    act is the actual crop evapotranspiration, and Tc act is the actual crop transpiration,
    all expressed in m3 and referring to the crop season. Ya in Eqs. (21) through
    (24) may be observed, or may be estimated with a crop growth and yield model or
    with a simple water-yield parametric function as reported above. The meaning of
    indicators in Eqs. (21), (22), (23), (24) is necessarily different and indicators
    should be selected considering the actual farming objectives, the respective implications
    in terms of resource, environment and climate change, and the data availability.
    An application of similar WP concepts to olive orchards, including a related economic
    analysis, was recently discussed by Fernández et al. (2020). Improving WP could
    lead to water saving in irrigation but it requires the consideration of various
    factors. WP may be increased by minimizing the non-beneficial water uses such
    as percolation through the bottom of the root zone, runoff out of the irrigated
    fields, and losses by evaporation and wind drift in sprinkling. A high WP could
    be attained when increasing yields but, often, a higher WP is obtained when the
    crop is deliberately under-irrigated, thus when water stress is allowed in some
    less-sensitive crop stages; nevertheless, a yield reduction will then occur. 3.
    Overview of models aimed at improved irrigation scheduling 3.1. Soil water balance
    simulation models from FAO24 to FAO56 Many models have been proposed since the
    early 1980’s following the publication of FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    which has been the landmark in the domain of crop water requirements and irrigation
    scheduling. Model papers considered herein limit to those having an identified
    software, adequate reference to calibration and/or validation, and not referring
    to single uses only. In addition, since the objectives of the current review refer
    to FAO56 with focusing on the dual Kc approach and considering that transient
    state models are dealt in Section 2.4, the reviewed SWB refer to models using
    a Kc approach, mainly referring to FAO24 and to FAO56. Numerous SWB models have
    been developed since the 1980’s as early reviewed by Lascano (1991). Related articles
    were often presented in research reports or to scientific conferences (ASAE, 1981,
    1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995; Smith et al., 1996; Ragab et al.,
    1996). These articles show a great variety of approaches, using the FAO Kc-ETo
    and/or transient state models, which received the preference of researchers by
    that time (Belmans et al., 1983). Developments also included landscape and turf
    grass irrigation. ETo equations were diverse because FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977) proposed various alternative equations. Howell et al. (1990) presented a
    first application of the Penman-Monteith grass reference equation proposed by
    Allen et al. (1989) when a commonly used ETo equation was the Penman equation.
    Without a common ETo definition and equation, standard Kc values could not be
    defined despite a consolidated set of Kc values was presented in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977) for numerous field, vegetable and woody crops. These authors
    proposed the well-known segmented FAO Kc curve but various curvilinear approaches
    were in use (e.g., Wright, 1982; HiIl, 1991). However, the segmented Kc curve
    was adopted by several authors (Howell et al., 1990; Combre and Kamieniarz, 1992;
    Teixeira and Pereira, 1992). Single Kc models of the 80’s and 90’s were often
    developed for application at farm level and evolved to support farm irrigators’
    communities. A first model has been developed with CIMIS, the California Irrigation
    Management Information System (Snyder, 1986), which keeps evolving nowadays and
    is based on a large grid of weather stations and a very large number of users
    (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/ accessed on 27 May 2020) and partners. Among the
    latter is the Satellite Irrigation Management Support framework (SIMS, Melton
    et al., 2012, 2020). The model CROPWAT (Smith, 1988, 1992) is paradigmatic since
    it consisted of a database built from FAO24 data (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    a supplementary CLIMWAT weather database, a reference ET calculator and a water
    balance computational tool able to propose an irrigation scheduling calendar for
    the selected crop, soil and field. The model was updated after the FAO experts
    consultation on crop water requirements (Smith et al., 1991) and the publication
    of FAO 56, and has been successively upgraded. The version CROPWAT 8.0 has been
    recently released. BIdriCo (Danuso et al., 1995) is updated and is operating with
    real time weather data to support irrigation farmers of the Friuli Venezia Giulia
    region, Italy. IRRICANNE is an irrigation scheduling simulation model (Combre
    and Kamieniarz, 1992) designed to support sugarcane producers and was used for
    many years in the Island of Reunion. The model RENANA (Giannerini, 1995) was applied
    to support farmers irrigation scheduling in the Emilia-Romagna Region and evolved
    to a large-scale web based DSS, IRRINET, in use by farmers of various regions
    of Italy (Mannini et al., 2013), as well as to support irrigation water delivery
    (Genovesi et al., 2019). Three models early reported - IRSIS (de Goes Calmon et
    al., 1992), ISAREG (Teixeira and Pereira, 1992) and PILOTE (Mailhol et al., 1996)
    - were designed for both research and application in the field practice. IRSIS
    (Raes et al., 1988) was modified to produce BUDGET (Raes et al., 2006) that was
    further developed with extensions for improved water balance and yield assessment
    (Shrestha et al., 2010), then becoming the SWB basis of the crop model AquaCrop
    (Raes et al., 2016). ISAREG adopted the PM-ETo equation following the FAO Expert
    Consultation that decided its adoption (Smith et al., 1991). ISAREG was first
    modified to support real time farmers advising with the development of RELREG
    (Teixeira et al., 1995), later turning into a web based DSS, WEBISAREG (Branco
    et al., 2005), and developing GIS facilities, HYDROGEST (Mateus et al., 2007).
    However, since the Irrigation Associations did not develop local support to farmers,
    the model was used essentially for research after adoption of computational tools
    relative to DP, CR and salinity (Pereira et al., 2007, 2009). It is currently
    used in several countries, e.g. Brazil (Saraiva et al., 2017), Bulgaria (Popova
    et al., 2014) and China (Zheng et al., 2014). Meanwhile, ISAREG was the base of
    SIMDualKc (Rosa et al., 2012a), described in the next Section. PILOTE software
    has been continuously improved and it became a crop model with various capabilities
    including irrigation and crop management (Mailhol et al., 2004, 2018). CADSM (Walker
    et al., 1995) was the first distributed SWB model aimed at computing the aggregated
    irrigation demand at the command area of a collective irrigation system using
    the Kc-ETo approach. It was also one of the first models using the PM-ETo equation
    after it was proposed to a wide audience (Allen et al., 1994a,b). Similarly, the
    combined use of the ISAREG model and the paddy basins simulation model IRRICEP
    (Paulo et al., 1995) was adopted to simulate the demand hydrographs at the sector
    level in a collective irrigation system using the FAO methods (Teixeira et al.,
    1996). Buchleiter (1995) presented the model SCHED for scheduling irrigations
    with a center-pivot system. However, this type of approach is currently replaced
    by precision irrigation software, namely variable rate scheduling with support
    of wireless sensors (e.g. O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). Hess (1996) reported on
    a microcomputer irrigation-scheduling model to be available for farmers since
    they were progressively adopting such computing facilities; however, with changes
    in hardware the approach was abandoned. The SIMDSS (Malano et al., 1996) was developed
    for practical irrigation scheduling and improved surface irrigation practices
    aimed at an integrated real-time management for pastures in SE Australia. MARKVAND
    was a DSS system for farmers use in Denmark, which software provides information
    on timing and volumes of irrigation as well as on the expected economic returns
    (Plauborg et al., 1996). Changes in technologies led to abandon these type of
    models. Models including the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation
    were rare. The first was reported by Wright (1982) but his pioneer approach aimed
    at deriving Kcb when soil water evaporation could be considered nil, i.e. the
    soil surface was dry but transpiration was near optimal. The approach applied
    well to infrequent water applications but not to highly frequent wettings; however,
    data reported by this author have been fundamental in developing the FAO56 dual
    Kc approach (Allen et al., 1998). Tuzet et al. (1992) developed an approach where
    ET partition was supported by the observed LAI. Many researchers lately followed
    a LAI approach for partitioning ET. Further developments in using a dual Kc were
    initiated after publication of FAO56, mainly using its spreadsheet for calculation
    of Kcb and Ke, which still is used at present. A first SWB model relative to paddy
    rice using the Kc-ETo approach, the IRRICEP model, was reported by Paulo et al.
    (1995). The model required not only the calibration of Kc values but the calibration
    of soil hydraulic properties determining the computation of percolation adopting
    a Darcy approach, as well as lateral seepage to downstream paddies and drainage
    ditches. That model was later used by Mao et al. (2004) adopting the PM-ETo equation.
    Singh et al. (2001) modified the model SAWAH to adopt the Kc-ETo approach and
    a partition of actual crop ET based upon an empirical exponential function of
    LAI. Agrawal et al. (2004) developed a Visual Basic SWB model where the Kc-ETo
    is used, seepage is computed with the Dupuit approach and percolation is determined
    with a soil water simulation using partial differential equations distinguishing
    water ponded conditions and unsaturated conditions when intermittent irrigation
    is used. Transient state approaches for the ponded and the unsaturated conditions
    were also used by Khepar et al. (2000) when modeling intermittent paddy irrigation.
    A different approach is reported by Jeon et al. (2005), who developed PADDIMOD.
    In this model, surface drainage and percolation are estimated with parametric
    equations, which require parameters calibration. These referred models, despite
    posterior to the publication of FAO56, did not adopt the PM-ETo equation but FAO24
    equations. 3.2. Soil water balance simulation models after FAO56 This review focused
    only on SWB simulation models using the FAO56 Kc-ETo approach and which calibration
    and validation procedures are recognizable. Many other publications on SWB models
    not using the Kc-ETo method and not adopting the PM-ETo equation were not considered.
    The selected SWB models are presented in Table 1 for those using the single time
    averaged Kc, while Table 2 refers to the SWB models using the FAO56 dual Kc approach
    (see Section 2.3 above) or a similar approach where LAI replaces fc. Table 1.

    are used: Csalt – Salt concentration in the soil solution; ECe – Electrical conductivity
    of the soil saturation extract; ETsalt – Actual crop evapotranspiration affected
    by salinity; Ksat – Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Abbreviations:
    n/r – not reported; seep – seepage. Single Kc models in Table 1 are diverse in
    terms of the target crops; these can be single annual crops, e.g. maize, wheat,
    cotton or paddy rice, or various annuals and/or perennials. They have in common
    the use of the FAO56 PM-ETo equation, in some cases also considering alternative
    temperature based methods, and the use of the stress coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including
    modifications for paddies water balance. Models have a variety of base input parameters.
    Soil base parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, but θsat and Ksat may also
    be included when deep percolation and capillary rise are among the model outputs.
    Only one model (ISAREG) uses the input of electrical conductivity of the soil
    saturation extract (ECe, dS m−1) to compute the ET reduction due to salinity (ETsalt)
    as described in FAO56 and by Minhas et al. (2020). All reported models were calibrated
    and validated, generally using SWC data, a few using ETc act or Tc act (Consoli
    et al., 2016; Mancosu et al., 2016), and the ponded water depths in case of paddy
    rice (de Silva and Rushton, 2008; Inthavong et al., 2011). The model outputs are
    diverse but all models, in addition to ET, provide DP estimates. Several models
    also compute RO but CR is only provided by few models (Pereira et al., 2003; Shang
    and Mao, 2006; Chopart et al., 2007; Boegh et al., 2009; Consoli et al., 2016).
    Paddy water models outputs refer to the ponded water and to DP, seepage and drainage.
    References to the possible use of remote sensing data are very limited. SWB models
    using the dual Kc approach are referred in Table 2. As for single Kc models, they
    are diverse in terms of the target crops but most of them can be used with both
    annual and perennial crops. A few refer to annuals or only to specific crops (wheat,
    maize, groundnuts and paddy rice). All use the PM-ETo equation and the stress
    coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including those modified for paddies. Models have a variety
    of base soil input parameters. Soil parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, a
    few θsat and Ksat, and some models (Annandale et al., 1999; Ragab, 2002) also
    have a transient state approach and require θ(h) and K(θ). Salinity base data
    on ECe are used in the AQUACROP and SIMDualKc models, while SALTMED and “SWB”
    use the salt concentration in the soil water. Models are calibrated and validated
    with SWC data but some models may be calibrated with ETc act or Tc act data (Rosa
    et al., 2012a, b; Campos et al., 2016); when they also predict actual yields,
    Ya data may also be used for calibration (Ragab, 2002; Raes et al., 2012). Model
    outputs are diverse but all models, in addition to ETc act and Tc act, provide
    for DP while a few also compute RO. The computation of CR is only available from
    the models SALTMED, AquaCrop, SIMDualKc and the model reported by Han et al. (2018).
    The paddy rice model RiceWCA (Yang et al., 2012) outputs are different from those
    referred before and include the predicted applied water, DP, seepage, and tail
    water runoff. A few models refer to the possibility of using remote sensing-retrieved
    data. This review recognized that few models are able to compute groundwater contribution
    from a water table as well as impacts of salinity. DSSAT crop models using Kc-ETo
    with the dual Kc approach (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) could be added in Table 2
    but they are very different from the listed models and rarely used for irrigation
    scheduling. Farmers’ information models commonly using Kcb values derived from
    remote sensing vegetation indices, such as SIMS (Melton et al., 2012, 2020; Cahn
    and Johnson, 2017), consist also of a peculiar group of dual Kc models that require
    mention. For selecting the best crop irrigation schedules, the SWB models adopt
    user-friendly software that helps the users to handle data and, often, to compute
    indicators such as those referred in Section 2.5. Performance scenarios may be
    the object of ranking, e.g. when DSS approaches adopt multi-criteria analysis
    as discussed by Darouich et al. (2014, 2017), namely when the selection of irrigation
    schedules is tied to the performance of the irrigation method. However, the use
    of multi-criteria analysis is rare in irrigation scheduling and, commonly, only
    simple comparisons of indicators are used (Paredes et al., 2014, 2017a,b; Pereira
    et al., 2015b). 4. The dual Kc soil water balance approach using the model SIMDualKc
    4.1. Brief presentation of the model SIMDualKc is a quite unique software model
    that performs a daily soil water balance at the field scale (Rosa et al., 2012a,b)
    adopting the dual Kc approach to compute and partition crop ET into Tc and Es.
    Data inputs and model outcomes are described in Fig. 2 where the flowchart of
    the model is presented. In general, compulsory data inputs are common to other
    SWB models that adopt the FAO56 dual Kc approach, although requirements may change
    with the type of algorithms used in computations. Facultative data differ depending
    upon the specific objectives of the simulation. This is the case for data used
    to compute runoff, deep percolation, groundwater contribution, as well as effects
    of mulches and no-till planting, active ground cover, intercropping, and soil
    and water salinity. Naturally, model outcomes also differ depending on the modelling
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (919KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Simplified flowchart of SIMDualKc model (modified from Rosa et al.,
    2012a). Model calibration consists of adjusting the influential model parameters
    within their reasonable ranges so that the model results are consistent with available
    observed data, thus estimation errors are minimized. The process of validation
    permits the verification of the goodness of fitting when the model is used with
    the set of calibrated parameters but with different, independent data sets, without
    tuning such parameters. Calibration and validation of models and appropriate goodness-of-fit
    indicators are a must for every model as discussed by several authors (e.g., Moriasi
    et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012) and by Pereira et al. (2015b) relative to SIMDualKc.
    The calibration parameters of SIMDualKc consist of: Kcb and p relative to the
    various crop growth stages; Ze, TEW and REW characterizing the soil evaporation
    layer; the parameter CN relative to the runoff algorithm; and the parameters relative
    to the DP and CR parametric functions. Initial sets of these parameters are inputs
    to the model, which are improved through calibration. Soil water content observations
    are the most commonly used for calibration, e.g. Fandiño et al. (2012, 2015) for
    a vineyard and for hop for industry, Zhao et al. (2013) for maize and wheat, Wu
    et al. (2016) for a groundwater dependent grassland, and Paredes et al. (2017a)
    relative to pea for industry. Calibration may also be performed by comparing observed
    eddy covariance ET with model computed ETc act for field crops (Zhang et al.,
    2013; Tian et al., 2016) and citrus orchards (Peddinti and Kambhammettu, 2019),
    or by comparing observed sap-flow transpiration data with simulated Tc act (Paço
    et al., 2012, 2019; Qiu et al., 2015). Descriptions of the calibration and validation
    processes are provided in the cited applications. Various methods may be used
    to estimate accurately actual crop ET as reviewed by Allen et al. (2011b) and
    Pereira et al. (2020a,b). Methods include the measurement of the soil water content
    for deriving ET from the SWB, the measurement of ETc act using eddy covariance
    (EC) or Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems, as well as the measurement
    of Tc act with sap-flow systems. All these methods are potentially very accurate
    as point measurements, and the EC and BREB are used in such a way that their footprint
    may span a relatively large area representative of the vegetation. EC is receiving
    the preference of many ET users, but measurements of the soil water content (SWC)
    and sap-flow continue to be largely used. Fig. 3a shows the comparisons of simulated
    and observed seasonal SWC data of a wheat crop used to calibrate SIMDualKc, and
    Fig. 3b shows a similar comparison of simulated wheat ETc act with EC observed
    data, both obtained at the same location in North China plain (Zhang et al., 2013;
    Zhao et al., 2013). The goodness-of-fit indicators resulted similar, i.e. there
    was no advantage of one calibration over the other, which means that a user may
    select the most convenient approach to calibrate a model if measurements of SWC,
    ETc act or Tc act are accurately performed. Download : Download high-res image

    vs. observed soil water content (adapted from Zhao et al., 2013) and (b) simulated
    vs. observed ETc act (adapted from Zhang et al., 2013). 4.2. Deriving crop coefficients
    Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB simulations is a main capability of SWB models, e.g.
    SALTMED (Silva et al., 2012), which is quite common for vegetable and field crops
    as reported in recent reviews (Pereira et al., 2020a,b); however, it is uncommon
    for fruit trees and vines. In the case of evergreen trees and vines, a full crop
    coefficient curve requires that, in addition to the Kc and Kcb for the initial,
    mid-season and end-season, the Kc and Kcb values for the non-growing period are
    also known. Moreover, due to climate differences between the growing and non-growing
    seasons, the Kc and Kcb curves may be substantially different. Nevertheless, there
    are various examples of derivation of Kc and Kcb for orchards (e.g., Peddinti
    and Kambhammettu, 2019). As an example for evergreen woody crops, a study performed
    with irrigated olives in southern Portugal (Paço et al., 2019) is analyzed. Crop
    transpiration was measured with the sap-flow Granier method, which data provided
    for calibrating SIMDualKc, thus obtaining the best Kcb values for the initial,
    mid-season, end-season and non-growing periods. A few observations of ETc act
    with an EC system were also used for testing. The Kcb curve (Fig. 4) resulted
    in a FAO segmented curve with higher Kcb during the growing season, spring and
    summer, when irrigation was applied, and smaller Kcb in the non-growing period,
    when transpiration is naturally low. Differently, because it depends on soil evaporation,
    the time averaged Kc (=Kcb+Ke) resulted smaller during the active growing period,
    when Es and Ke were low because precipitation was reduced and drip lines were
    located directly in line with the crop and shaded by the crop canopy, thus irrigation
    was applied under trees’ shadow. Contrarily, Kc was larger in fall and winter,
    when rainfall occurred (Fig. 4). A segmented Kc curve resulted with low values
    by the mid-season and a Kcb curve with a higher value during the mid-season. The
    Kc curve changed with rainfall, with Kc mid and Kc in the non-growing season,
    which is higher when rainfall was larger (Fig. 4a) and smaller under dry conditions.
    Contrarily, the standard Kcb values did not change. When considering the daily
    Kcb act, changes occurred depending on the water stress of the olive crop. The
    daily Kc act changed a lot, causing the referred changes in the Kc curve. Download

    Standard and actual basal and single crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient
    curves for a super-intensive olive orchard in two contrasting rainfall years:
    a) wet year and b) dry year (Paço et al., 2019). Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB
    simulations is also uncommon for forage crops managed with cuttings. The FAO56
    approach for Kcb and Kc of forages managed with cuttings consists of adopting
    a segmented curve for each cut (Allen et al., 1998). SIMDualKc has proved appropriate
    to support the derivation of Kcb and Kc under these conditions in an application
    to Tifton 85 bermudagrass in Santa Maria, Brazil (Paredes et al., 2018b). The
    cutting treatments were spaced according to selected cumulative growth degree
    days (CGDD), which varied among treatments. With this approach, shorter time spans
    between cuttings resulted in summer and longer ones in winter. Results for Kcb
    and Kc with cuttings at CGDD of 248 °C, which refer to six forage cuttings, and
    372 °C, with only four cuttings, are presented in Fig. 5a and 5b respectively.
    The computed time average Kc before the cuttings are 0.96 for the CGDD 248 °C
    and 0.97 for CGDD 372 °C while the Kc after cuttings, when the forage crop is
    shorter, decreased to 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. Reported time averaged Kc before
    and after cuttings are close due to abundant precipitation during the crop season.
    The standard Kcb before the cuttings are 0.93 for the treatment with CGDD of 248 °C
    and 0.94 for CGDD of 372 °C while Kcb values after cuttings were respectively
    0.83 and 0.84. Values for the standard Kcb would be more distinct if the forage
    height would be smaller after cuttings. Results show that the approach proposed
    in FAO56 for Kc and Kcb curves for forages managed with cuttings was applicable
    with SIMDualKc. Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download

    where cuttings were performed for cumulative growth degree days of (a) 248 °C
    and (b) 372 °C (adapted from Paredes et al., 2018b). 4.3. ET and crop coefficients
    of relay inter-cropping An approach based on light/shadow effects was used to
    estimate ETc act and its partition for crops cultivated in a relay inter-cropping
    system. The mutual effects of shading by the crops combined in an inter-crop system
    were estimated by considering the height of both crops and the fraction of ground
    covered by each crop throughout the crop season (Miao et al., 2016). This principle
    is based upon the approach of Allen and Pereira (2009) to compute Kcb for a fruit
    crop cultivated with active ground cover. Naming the first planted crop as dominant
    and the second as the subordinate crop, and considering their interaction, the
    Kcb of the intercrop (Kcb inter) may be estimated daily as (Miao et al., 2016):
    (25) where Kcb dom and Kcb sub are, respectively, the Kcb values of the dominant
    and subordinate crops when mono-cropped, and Kd dom and Kd sub are the density
    coefficients of the dominant and subordinate crops. Kd are computed as: (26a)
    (26b) where fsc dom and fsc sub are the fractions of the soil surface cropped
    with the dominant and the subordinate crops, respectively, and hdom and hsub are
    the heights of the dominant and subordinate crops, respectively. The max function
    in Eqs. (25) and (26) aims at considering that the conditions observed at earlier
    stages, Kcb dom > Kcb sub and h dom >h sub, may change with the growth of the
    subordinate crop, thus making Kcb sub > Kcb dom and h sub > h dom. For example,
    this is the case of the wheat-sunflower intercrop, where sunflower develops taller
    than wheat when the latter matures, thus Kcb sunf > Kcb wheat and hsunf > hwheat.
    The application of this methodology to a winter wheat-sunflower relay inter-cropping
    in Hetao, China, is illustrated in Figs. 6a and b, which show the Kcb, Kcb act
    and Ke relative to wheat and sunflower mono-cropped, while Fig. 6c shows Kcb,
    Kcb act and Ke for the inter-cropping of both. Fig. 6a shows that a small stress
    occurred for wheat while Fig. 6b evidences that sunflower was largely stressed
    during the mid- and late-season stages, thus indicating that a large irrigation
    should have been given early in the mid-season. The resulting potential Kcb of
    the inter-cropping system (Fig. 6c) was smaller than that of the crops when single-cropped,
    with Kcb act following the trends evidenced for both crops when cropped alone.
    The Ke values also followed the Ke curves of both crops but they were different
    because basin irrigation was used and water was applied to the entire field, including
    when the second crop was not sowed yet, thus producing high evaporation in the
    non-cropped parts of the field. Fig. 6c shows that four irrigations were applied
    to the intercrop, however too early for sunflower that, contrarily to wheat, exhibited
    large water stress during mid- and late seasons. This is a consequence of avoiding
    irrigation by the end-season of wheat. The example shows that the use of a calibrated
    model helps interpreting and evaluating the irrigation schedules of intercropped
    crops. Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download full-size

    wheat-sunflower in Hetao, upper Yellow River basin, China, 2011 (adapted from
    Miao et al., 2016). 4.4. Assessing alternative planting dates An important issue
    in developing irrigation calendars is assessing the impacts of changing planting
    dates. Such changes may be desired when anticipating planting dates may increase
    the probability of rainfall early in the season, or to avoid hot waves in the
    late season. This search of better planting dates may be performed with irrigation
    scheduling models and using a statistical analysis of weather time series, namely
    when supplemental irrigation is practiced, such as with small grains and grain
    legumes in the Mediterranean area. However, few examples are available in the
    literature and they mostly refer to the impacts on crop yields rather than on
    water requirements. Abi-Saab et al. (2014) provided a good example relative to
    sunflower and soybean cropped in Lebanon, while Montoya and Otero (2019) reported
    an application to soybean in Uruguay, in both cases using the AquaCrop model.
    A different approach, using BUDGET, consisted of performing an analysis of risk
    relative to maize planting dates (Kipkorir et al., 2007). Various supplemental
    irrigation schedules for malting barley for industry were assessed for two contrasting
    rainfall years (Pereira et al., 2015b; Paredes et al., 2017b) using a cultivar
    that adjusts to a wide planting period, from November to January. Center-pivot
    irrigation was used with depths of 8 mm per event and ceasing 25 days before harvest
    to prevent water-related diseases that could affect malt grain quality. Based
    upon the observed sowing dates, the following alternatives were considered: 16th
    and 30th of December, and 6th and 16th of January. These sowing dates were assessed
    in terms of impacts on the total water use (TWU), forecasted yields (Ya), and
    water productivity (WPtotal, Eq. 21) defined in Section 2.5. They were also assessed
    considering two contrasting rainfall years - wet (2013) and dry (2012) – and various
    supplemental irrigation scenarios: Sc. 1: Full irrigation as practiced by the
    farmer (MAD = p); Sc. 2: Very mild water deficit during the entire season (MAD = 1.10
    p, Eq. 10); Sc. 3: Moderate water deficit during most of the crop season (MAD = 1.20
    p), but very mild (MAD = 1.10 p) during flowering/grain filling; Sc. 4: Moderate
    water stress during the entire season (MAD = 1.20 p); Sc. 5: Rainfed. Fig. 7 shows
    the predicted TWU, yield and WP indicators for the four sowing dates and five
    irrigation management scenarios. The adoption of early sowing leads to a smaller
    TWU than late sowing, particularly in the wet year. In the dry year, differences
    in TWU among irrigation management scenarios are larger than those due to planting
    dates. Yields show to increase for the last two planting dates but, again, differences
    in yields are greater among irrigation scenarios. Under dry conditions, the use
    of supplemental irrigation to meet barley water requirements is essential since
    yields are much lower under rainfed conditions. Differences in water productivity
    are larger among planting dates and quite small among irrigation management scenarios.
    Combining information relative to these three indicators, it was identified that
    the best sowing dates are likely those around the first days of January. The mid-January
    date is discouraged because the crop cycle enters in a period of high water demand
    by the late season, which increases TWU and decreases WP. The consideration of
    economic criteria would also be beneficial. This example shows the usefulness
    of a SWB model in recommending best planting dates to help farmers’ decisions.
    This can also be based on weather forecasts that provide for anticipating crop
    growth conditions. Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download : Download

    various sowing dates and alternative irrigation schedules relative to two contrasting
    rainfall years (adapted from Paredes et al., 2017b). 4.5. Assessing beneficial
    and non-beneficial water uses The analysis of the water use by a crop allows to
    perform the field water balances and assess the time dynamics of its input and
    output terms, thus determining which are the consumptive and non-consumptive uses
    of water and, likely more important, which uses and consumptions are beneficial
    or, contrarily, consist of water waste and losses (Pereira et al., 2012). Molden
    and Sakthivadivel (2011) applied similar water use concepts at the basin scale,
    and Lecina et al. (2010) used this type of assessment to evaluate improvements
    of surface and sprinkler irrigation at the project scale. An application at field
    scale aimed at maximizing beneficial water use and controlling the non-beneficial
    one using the DSSAT-maize model is reported by Jiang et al. (2016). An application
    of the SIMDualKc model to a malt barley cropped under center-pivot irrigation
    in Central Portugal (Pereira et al., 2015b) is used herein as example of assessing
    beneficial and non-beneficial water uses throughout the crop cycle. The model
    was calibrated using field data of the dry year 2012 and was validated with data
    of the wet year 2013. The various SWB terms for both years and four crop growth
    stages are presented in Table 3. Groundwater contribution was not included in
    the balance because the water table was below 10 m deep. Irrigation water application
    depths averaging 7 mm per event were adopted to prevent high water stress. Table

    DP – deep percolation, ETc - crop evapotranspiration, ETc act - actual crop evapotranspiration,
    Tc act - actual crop transpiration, Es – soil evaporation. The non-consumptive
    water use terms, runoff (RO) and deep percolation (DP), were about nil in the
    dry year. RO was 10.5 % of the seasonal precipitation (P) in the wet year while
    DP, a potentially recoverable resource providing for vadose zone and aquifer recharge,
    represented nearly 30 % of P. The consumptive use terms, Tc act and Es, respectively
    beneficial and non-beneficial, showed a similar partition in both years, with
    transpiration representing 77 % of ETc act in the wet year and 79 % in the dry
    year. Es was smaller in the dry year because there was insufficient water supply
    during the late season, with ETc act representing only 64 % of the potential ETc.
    This fact occurred due to irrigation cutoff 25 days before harvesting in both
    years, with stored soil water supplying the crop in the wet year but not in the
    dry year. Otherwise, differences in consumptive water use in both years are small
    and are due to the higher climatic demand in the dry year, when ETc was larger
    by 56 mm relative to the wet year. Performing water use assessment adopting this
    approach is uncommon but could be helpful when considering issues for water conservation.
    4.6. Assessing the groundwater contribution from a shallow watertable The assessment
    of groundwater contribution (GC) to crop water needs in the presence of a shallow
    water table is often performed with a transient state modeling approach (e.g.
    Ragab, 2002; Jovanovic et al., 2004; Acharya and Mylavarapu, 2015). Empirical
    functions are used by others, such as Yang et al. (2007), who computed GC as a
    function of the depth of the water table, the soil water storage and crop ET,
    which consists of a modification of the empirical approach proposed in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977). Differently, Liu et al. (2006) developed a parametric function
    for use in ISAREG and, later, with SIMDualKc, which parameters are calibrated
    during the process of model calibration (e.g., Cholpankulov et al., 2008). With
    this approach, GC is a function of the actual water table depth, the actual soil
    water storage in the root zone, crop evapotranspiration and potential (maximum)
    capillary rise, which depends upon the soil hydraulic characteristics that regulate
    the intensity of upward fluxes. Liu et al. (2006) proposed sets of default parameters
    relative to soil textural and hydraulic properties and that are improved through
    model calibration. The use of SIMDualKc to assess consumptive and non-consumptive
    water use by a groundwater dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern Inner
    Mongolia, China (Wu et al., 2016) is selected as an example of groundwater contribution
    assessment in a wet landscape. The analysis focused on the wet year of 2008 and
    the dry year of 2009. The daily dynamics of P, Tc act, Es and GC (all in mm) during
    the growth season is presented in Fig. 8, which clearly shows that the upward
    fluxes from the shallow water table were the main fraction of the water supply
    to the studied grassland. GC is essential to meet the water requirements of this
    crop. GC was small when there was enough soil water for extraction by the grassland
    but increased when crop water demand was high and the SWC decreased. Comparing
    both years (Fig. 8), it is evident that Tc act was similar in both years because
    GC supplemented rainfall, thus becoming much higher in the dry year, when rainfall
    was insufficient. Considering that ground cover by the grassland was very large,
    Es depended on precipitation only, thus being higher in the wet year. Download

    in Table 4 show that, despite rainfall in the wet year was nearly 3 times that
    of the dry year, ETc act were not very different in both years, and Tc act were
    quite similar because GC effectively supplemented the lack of rainfall. The ratios
    between GC and the total water supply (TWS, mm) were very distinct, with GC/TWS = 33
    % in the wet year and 59 % in the dry year. These ratios quantified well the relative
    importance of GC for the water supply of the considered grassland. The ratios
    between GC and actual transpiration also showed the role of GC in meeting the
    grassland water requirements since GC/Tc act increased from 46 to 63 % from the
    wet to the dry year. Table 4. The terms of the water balance of a groundwater

    irrigation scheduling Real time irrigation scheduling aims at optimizing the timing
    and amount of water applied in the day-to-day irrigation management. It requires
    combining a model with data streaming from diverse sources such as weather forecasts,
    soil and plant sensors, or remote sensing data. Models referred in Table 1, Table
    2 may be adopted for this purpose but they are generally used to support research.
    In the past, several attempts to adapt and use SWB for supporting real time irrigation
    have been performed. Teixeira et al. (1995) developed and tested RELREG, a model
    derived from ISAREG, that could be updated every day, and used weather data predicted
    around three days in advance. Other models were developed and in use at farm level,
    e.g. SCHED for center-pivot irrigation (Buchleiter, 1995) and, for application
    at large scale, models such as RENANA (Giannerini, 1995). The latter has been
    continuously updated and gave origin to IRRIFRAME and IRRINET, widely used in
    Italy (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015), which enter in the
    era of the cloud data models. In South Africa, a review of irrigation scheduling
    atmospheric-based computer models was published by Annandale et al. (2011). Computerized
    real-time irrigation scheduling revolved around a number of historic models such
    as BEWAB (pre-plant seasonal irrigation schedules based on target yields; Bennie
    et al., 1988), “SWB” (providing daily water schedules based on calculated ETc
    act; Annandale et al., 1999), PUTU (De Jager et al., 2001), and various specialized
    models for irrigation management of sugarcane (Singels, 2007). The adoption of
    scientific irrigation scheduling was investigated in a technical project by Stevens
    et al. (2005). The outcomes were that the uptake of scientific irrigation scheduling
    by farmers is low, it is highly dependent on many other day-to-day farming and
    business operations, and there is generally need for engaging dedicated managers,
    extensionists or consultants to run a scientifically-based irrigation scheduling
    program on commercial farms. There are several web-based tools that were purposefully
    designed for supporting farmers in real-time irrigation decision-making such as
    IRRINET (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015) in Emilia Romagna
    Italy, the California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS, https://cimis.water.ca.gov/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS, https://irrigweb.uaex.edu/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), or the Mississippi irrigation scheduling tool (MIST).
    The SAPWAT model, originally developed by Crosby and Crosby (1999) with several
    improved versions (van Heerden and Walker, 2016), is used to determine crop water
    requirements and water allocations in South African water management areas. Other
    models with diverse workflows and computational procedures are applied for supporting
    farmers decision making, namely integrating SWB models, but they are rarely the
    object of scientific publications or information about calibration. Examples are
    the IRRIGA SYSTEM© (https://www.irrigasystem.com/, accessed on 25 May 2020) used
    both in South America and in Europe, IrrigaSys (http://irrigasys.maretec.org/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) used in Vale do Sorraia, Portugal, and Irristrat™ (http://www.hidrosoph.com/EN/index.html,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) also applied in Portugal for both orchards and annual
    crops. The developing field of information and communication technology (ICT)
    opened up a variety of opportunities for smart agriculture in general, and irrigation
    scheduling in particular, by making use of Internet of Things (IoT), satellites
    and drones, robotics and artificial intelligence to improve farming operations,
    management of irrigation schedules and fertigation, and to achieve better yields,
    quality of products and profits. Tzounis et al. (2017) provided a review of potential
    applications of IoT technologies in agriculture. The drivers for these technologies
    are large volumes of data that are generated in space and time, and commonly referred
    to as Big Data. Big Data can be defined as huge datasets (commonly in the order
    of magnitude of TB) originating from a diversity of sources that makes them difficult
    to be collected, stored and analysed by conventional tools and techniques (Chen
    and Zhang, 2014; Ylijoki and Porras, 2016). They can be categorized into structured
    data that can be easily stored in tabular format (e.g. soil and plant measurements,
    remote sensing georeferenced data), unstructured data (e.g. text, video, audio
    and images) or semi-structured data (e.g. emails and XML files) that are usually
    inconsistent to store and process in customary databases (Lee, 2017). In order
    to extract usable information from the variety of sources of information to the
    benefit of researchers, practitioners and farm managers, these data need to be
    processed through systems, such as machine learning, and packaged into tools that
    facilitate interpretation and decision-making. Systems of heterogeneous sensors
    and networks for collection and communication of data are commonly referred to
    as Internet of Things (IoT). Given the vast amount of information and storage
    space that is often required, the processing, storage and analyses of these data
    can be done via Internet servers and infrastructure that are specifically designed
    for this purpose (e.g. Cloud Computing) (Tzounis et al., 2017). Ultimately, data
    need to be packaged into information tools, prescriptive/predictive models and
    decision-support systems that can aid decision-making on farms. Depending on data
    volume and computing requirements, irrigation scheduling tools can reside on cloud-based
    platforms (Bartlett et al., 2015). This is particularly the case when the tools/apps
    require information from large databases, e.g. soil properties, climate, satellite-derived
    observations. In other instances, soil input and climatic data can be obtained
    from localized sources, e.g. soil measurements and weather forecasts, and all
    calculations can be performed in reasonable time with algorithms running in the
    background (e.g. Internet apps). Several examples of these IoT applications for
    irrigation scheduling were reported in the literature and described below. The
    IoT infrastructure provides the opportunity to replace models, such as the above-mentioned
    SCHED, with automation-model systems applied to lateral moving systems coupled
    with sensors that provide for variable rate irrigation and nutrients applications,
    thus moving from the simple water scheduling to precision agriculture (Han et
    al., 2009). A review on variable rate issues for sprinkler systems, including
    an analysis of sensor systems usable for such purposes, was recently proposed
    by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2016). Similar approaches are used with drip-irrigated
    horticultural crops (Perea et al., 2017) and woody crops (Fernández, 2017). Payero
    et al. (2017) developed a communication system for transferring wireless soil
    water sensors data to an open-sources platform (https://thingspeak.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020), where data are hosted and visualized in the form of usable information
    to support decision-making. However, SWB models remain popular tools for supporting
    irrigation scheduling. For operational irrigation schedules, using real-time models
    requires daily updated actual weather data, which may not be fully available.
    Thus, alternative sources of climatic data have been tested showing good accuracy,
    such as the use of re-analysis data for estimating PM-ETo (e.g. Paredes et al.,
    2018a), or satellite derived climatic products as referred by Paredes et al. (2020b).
    Since weather forecasts generally provide for incomplete data sets (precipitation
    and temperature), computing ETo requires simplified approaches using temperature
    data only, namely the Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) and the Hargreaves and
    Samani equation (HS-eq) (Paredes and Pereira, 2019; Paredes et al., 2020a). Thus,
    a main challenge in using models for supporting irrigation scheduling is to use
    short-term weather forecasts that could support real-time irrigation scheduling
    and, considering larger range forecasts, to plan irrigation in advance (Kusunose
    and Mahmood, 2016; Klemm and McPherson, 2017). Studies on the use of short-term
    weather forecasts to support irrigation scheduling focus more on precipitation
    than on climatic demand (ETo). The study by Cai et al. (2009) focused on the use
    of short-term weather forecast messages provided by the National Meteorological
    Institute of China for estimating ETo and supporting irrigation scheduling, showing
    the good adequacy particularly for estimation of crop ET using a SWB model. A
    similar but updated approach is reported by Zhang et al. (2018). Lorite et al.
    (2015) developed a methodology based on the use of weather forecast data from
    freely and easily accessible online information for determining irrigation scheduling,
    reporting good accuracy for ETo estimations. Other studies focus on evaluating
    the use of short-term forecasts for real-time decision support for irrigation
    scheduling in terms of net profit and water savings. Cai et al. (2011) assessed
    the use of rainfall short-term forecasts provided by the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Despite the imperfect forecasts, results showed
    net profit of up to 8.5 % as well as high water savings ranging from 11.0 to 26.9
    % when compared to modelled soil moisture information. The study by Hejazi et
    al. (2014) focused on the use of reanalysis-based short-term weather forecasts
    relative to rainfall and ETo for supporting irrigation decision-making, reporting
    on average an expected profit of up to 3 % and a water saving ranging from 4 to
    6 %. Jamal et al. (2018), using the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model,
    reported an overall good performance of using probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts
    to support chickpea real-time irrigation scheduling. Differently, Linker et al.
    (2018), using the AquaCrop model for irrigation scheduling and yield predictions
    coupled with 4 to 6-day weather forecasts, reported an overall inadequacy of the
    forecasts for several locations (Denmark, Greece, Italy and Portugal) and crops
    (potato, cotton, tomato and maize); in addition, these authors also outlined that
    there was no considerable advantage of using those forecasts relative to historical
    average data. Overall, the use of short-term weather forecasts keeps being a bottleneck
    due to their uncertainty/inaccuracy. Combining SWB model predictions with plant
    indicators (Ferreira, 2017) and/or soil sensors, is also an option that has been
    investigated, e.g. Cancela et al. (2015) used SIMDualKc with an automatic control
    irrigation system supported by a low cost wireless soil moisture sensors network.
    Thus, these tools rely less on weather data, and more on soil and plant sensors,
    which calls for new approaches in using the FAO56 method. An example of such new
    approaches is the model reported by Schwartz et al. (2020) aimed at actual Kc
    for maize when deficit irrigation is used and non-uniform soils also affect the
    crop and the available soil water. The use of soil water sensors is recognized
    as having a great importance for the accuracy of modern SWB modeling approaches
    (El-Naggar et al., 2020). The use of canopy temperature sensors is also recognized
    as contributing to improved accuracy (Han et al., 2018). Remote sensing data provide
    the opportunity to model at large scale and they typically fall in the domain
    of Big Data. This includes both data originating from unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV, Ortega-Farias et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2019) and satellites. Two main
    approaches may be considered: energy balance models and vegetation indices. Models
    such as SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm of Land), TSEB (Two-Source Energy
    Balance) and METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration)
    are quite accurate in assessing crop evapotranspiration from the energy balance
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011a; French et al., 2015; Dhungel
    et al., 2016). ET from remote sensing may also be used to derive Kc or Kcb values.
    Vegetation indices, mainly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
    the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), are often used to estimate Kc and Kcb
    values (Johnson and Trout, 2012; Pôças et al., 2015; Campos et al., 2017). Satellite
    Kc data are then assimilated into SWB models. Another issue is the assessment
    of crop stress indicators from remote sensing (Pôças et al., 2017), namely using
    UAV. The use of optical/thermal satellite imagery at farm level would also allow
    drawing water requirement maps and implementing precise irrigation (Hendrickx
    et al., 2016). Melton et al. (2012, 2020) described the SIMS framework that combines
    NASA’s Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS
    satellite imagery, and a surface sensors network to map indicators of crop irrigation
    demand and to develop information products to support irrigation management and
    other water use decisions. Li et al. (2018) described and tested a new method
    for sequential data assimilation that allows integrating soil water content measurements
    into the Community Land Model (CLM) aiming to improve irrigation scheduling. Evaluation
    of the method was performed on several citrus orchards allowing to save on average
    24 % of water relative to the farmers’ irrigation schedules while the use of the
    irrigation schedules based upon the FAO56 SWB provided for similar average water
    savings of 22 %. The development of mobile and on-line applications (apps) has
    also been investigated, with support of cloud computing and IoT. This kind of
    tools allows to provide to farmers easy-to-use information (Car et al., 2012),
    particularly when the information is conveyed using text messaging service (SMS).
    Todorovic et al. (2016) described and evaluated an automatized decision support
    system (Hydro-Tech) available as an app; Hydro-Tech integrates FAO56 methods,
    including the SWB, with continuous soil sensor-based monitoring, short-term weather
    forecasts, remote monitoring of the water supply network, diverse tools for data-cloud
    processing, and an economic and eco-efficiency assessment tool for optimizing
    irrigation scheduling. Evaluations performed in farmers’ fields with diverse crops
    (vegetables and fruit orchards) in the Apulia region, Italy, showed potential
    water savings ranging from 5 % to 20 % relative to the schedules used by farmers.
    Goap et al. (2018) presented an IoT-based smart irrigation management system,
    available as an app, using machine learning technology to predict crop irrigation
    requirements when combining sensing soil moisture along with the forecasts of
    precipitation, air temperature and humidity. Good accuracy of soil moisture predictions
    was reported thus allowing improving irrigation scheduling. An irrigation scheduling
    app (Bluleaf®) was evaluated by Abi-Saab et al. (2019) using field observations
    and showing its accuracy for estimations of soil moisture content and leaf water
    potential along the wheat season. In addition, the tool was able to enhance water
    savings by almost 26 % relative to the farmer’s traditional schedule. The progression
    of the satellite-based SEBAL model into an operational tool for irrigation scheduling
    is of particular interest. The private venture eLEAF (https://eleaf.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020) developed a number of applications of interest to irrigation scheduling,
    namely PiMapping®7 (Pixel Intelligence Mapping), CropLook for field crops, as
    well as GrapeLook and FruitLook for grapes and fruit trees in the Western Cape,
    South Africa. The applications are based on satellite information to produce evapotranspiration
    maps and data that farmers and practitioners can access through a web portal (https://www.fruitlook.co.za/,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). A similar service providing information that can be
    accessed with different devices is IrriSat (https://www.irrisat.com/en/home-2,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). The Portuguese Association of Horticulture also makes
    available to farmers an app for real-time irrigation advice, Manna Irrigation
    Intelligence (https://aphorticultura.pt/2020/01/13/manna-irrigation-intelligence-tecnologia-de-deteccao-remota/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), which bases upon a SWB model, remote sensing data and
    weather forecasts. Advances in ICT provide great opportunities to make use of
    large volumes of data and sources (sensors, models, remote sensing, images, tweets,
    farmers’ knowledge and experience, etc.). For using the Kc-ETo approach, ETo may
    be estimated with reduced datasets using the PMT and HS-eq approaches which require,
    among other, ground observed data, gridded and reanalysis data, and/or Meteosat
    Second Generation products, as well as forecasted weather data (Allen et al.,
    2020; Paredes et al., 2020a, b). Kc data sets refer to the updated tabulated standard
    Kc and Kcb values (Pereira et al., 2020a,b) and to the use of the A&P approach
    to compute Kcb and Kc from fc and height (Allen and Pereira, 2009; Pereira et
    al., 2020c,d). The challenge is to streamline these diversely structured data
    into usable and reliable information. Although major advances have been documented
    in the literature, the level of uptake is still not widespread mainly due to the
    need to own devices, applications, costs of services, etc. Maintenance of these
    systems can also be expensive in terms of hardware (e.g. sensors exposed in the
    field), securing a steady power supply, network and software stability, data storage
    infrastructure, security and access control. Nevertheless, given the volume of
    usable information that can potentially be produced to optimize farming production,
    it can be expected that IoT will become a more and more prominent feature in smart
    farming. 6. Conclusions and recommendations The current review has shown that
    SWB models have an enormous potential for irrigation scheduling including the
    assessment of alternative crop management practices, as well as biophysical and
    economic indicators of crop water productivity. The FAO56 methodology adopted
    in SWB is very accurate with moderate data requirements; simpler SWB models have
    been adopted for supporting irrigation scheduling but likely at a greater risk
    of water balance inaccuracies, namely when deep percolation and capillary rise
    are not properly taken into consideration and when Kc estimation is less appropriate.
    Research users may also prefer to adopt mechanistic, high-input intensive models
    having capabilities to simulate crop growth and yield as depending not only on
    water, but also on nutrients and other practices. Trends for future also refer
    to the adoption of crop growth and yield models for irrigation scheduling, at
    least for research purposes; the adoption of the FAO56 method in the DSSAT models
    already performed (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) consists of an excellent foundation
    for this purpose. Easy to parameterize and calibrate, field and crop-focused SWB
    models will likely continue to be used by farmers and farm advisers as well as
    using the cloud data facilities at the large scale. However, trends for IoT and
    cloud computing seem to lean towards simple crop ET computations, likely using
    the Kc-ETo approach. Then, ETo is likely estimated from temperature using the
    FAO56 recommended approaches (PMT and HS-eq), or is derived from reanalysis products,
    gridded data or Meteosat Second Generation products, as well as using forecasted
    weather data. Future trends are also envisaged with farmers using models with
    ready to use information through mobile phones and smartphone apps. This approach
    is easier to apply with IoT or cloud data. In fact, simpler models provide acceptable
    to good indicative information to support basic irrigation decisions while more
    complex models are difficult to be deployed for the variety of users in terms
    of crops and cropping practices and management. It is therefore recommended that
    IoT models use the FAO56 method, including the updated FAO56 temperature based
    ETo, and the updated data sets of Kc and Kcb, or with application of the A&P approach
    to estimate Kcb and Kc from the fraction of ground cover and crop height, that
    are well proved and tested at various locations. Innovation in cloud data and
    IoT models needs to enlarge the present focus on solving data acquisition and
    sensors management to the quality of crop and ET computations, since this approach
    may support attaining better water productivity and water saving, which are definitely
    relevant in terms of facing climate change. A main opportunity for future is the
    use of remote sensing and the integration of remotely-sensed data into the SWB
    and crop growth models. Two main approaches may be considered (energy balance
    models and vegetation indices) as well as diverse sources of information (satellite
    imagery, imagery obtained from drones and infrared thermometry measurements on
    the ground). The dual Kc approach is already used in remote sensing applications
    for estimating ETc of various crops, which compared well with the Kcb estimated
    using the SIMDualKc model for many crops. Thus, results show that for real-time
    irrigation management the Kcb derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices
    may be used to adjust SIMDualKc and similar models’ simulations in near real-time,
    particularly when using sensors from satellites with high revisiting frequency.
    An effective exchange between research and practice represents a great challenge
    in SWB models use and development. Research uses models to better and more accurately
    understand the processes relative to soil water fluxes and transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum. Irrigators need that a SWB model responds to their need for knowing
    when and how much water to apply to a crop in a given environment and in a defined
    development stage. The users require timely and simple responses, very easy to
    interpret. SWB models for research and practice already are, and will keep being
    distinct. The question is therefore how and which information created from research
    shall pass into practice and which type of SWB will facilitate both new knowledge
    and its transfer to practice. Likely this requires that research considers transferability
    as a main option, but that freedom of research is not affected by the need for
    transferability of results. Is the development of more and more sophisticated
    models a need? Is scrutiny of field data quality a priority? Is the consideration
    of the energy balance, namely through crop coefficients, an essential approach
    in research? Is empirical research, with a minimal use of models to be continued?
    Would it be advantageous to bring into research the models used in practice? These
    are questions that future research should debate and substantiate. Declaration

    \ tool for crop yield prediction, allowing the\nmodel to automatically extract\
    \ features and learn from the datasets. Meanwhile, smart farming\ntechnology enables\
    \ the farmers to achieve maximum crop yield by extracting essential parameters\
    \ of\ncrop growth. This systematic literature review highlights the existing research\
    \ gaps in a particular\narea of deep learning methodologies and guides us in analyzing\
    \ the impact of vegetation indices and\nenvironmental factors on crop yield. To\
    \ achieve the aims of this study, prior studies from 2012 to 2022\nfrom various\
    \ databases are collected and analyzed. The study focuses on the advantages of\
    \ using\ndeep learning in crop yield prediction, the suitable remote sensing technology\
    \ based on the data\nacquisition requirements, and the various features that inﬂuence\
    \ crop yield prediction. This study\nﬁnds that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and\
    \ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the\nmost widely used deep learning\
    \ approaches for crop yield prediction. The commonly used remote\nsensing technology\
    \ is satellite remote sensing technology—in particular, the use of the Moderate-\n\
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Findings show that vegetation indices\
    \ are the most\nused feature for crop yield prediction. However, it is also observed\
    \ that the most used features in the\nliterature do not always work for all the\
    \ approaches. The main challenges of using deep learning\napproaches and remote\
    \ sensing for crop yield prediction are how to improve the working model for\n\
    better accuracy, the practical implication of the model for providing accurate\
    \ information about crop\nyield to agriculturalists, growers, and policymakers,\
    \ and the issue with the black box property.\nKeywords: deep learning approaches;\
    \ crop yield prediction; remote sensing techniques; systematic\nliterature review\n\
    1. Introduction\nCrop yield prediction is becoming more important because of the\
    \ growing concern\nabout food security [1–3]. Early crop yield prediction plays\
    \ an important role in reducing\nfamine by estimating the food availability for\
    \ the growing world population [2]. Hunger is\none of the most devastating issues\
    \ in the world and increasing crop yield production is a\nfeasible solution to\
    \ overcome this problem. The World Health Organization [1] estimated\nthat there\
    \ is still an inadequate food supply for 820 million people around the world.\
    \ The\ntarget for the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations is to\
    \ eliminate hunger,\naccomplish food security, and encourage sustainable agriculture\
    \ by 2030. The Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO) estimated that there will\
    \ be a 60 per cent demand for food\nto supply the world population of 9.3 billion\
    \ by 2050 [2]. Therefore, crop yield prediction\ncan offer crucial information\
    \ required for developing a reasonable solution to achieve the\ntarget and end\

    \ 21\ntechnology, the development and training of a novel approach for crop yield\
    \ prediction\nhave become feasible [3]. Deep learning is a signiﬁcant technique\
    \ that is extensively used in\nthe agricultural domain because of its numerous\
    \ data technologies and high-performance\ncomputing [4]. Deep learning is a class\
    \ of machine learning that has multiple layers\nof neural networks capable of\
    \ learning from data that are unstructured and unlabeled,\nwhereby the learning\
    \ can be supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised. Sarker [4]\npointed out\
    \ that deep learning techniques focus on learning abstract features of large\n\
    datasets. To accurately predict crop yield requires primary knowledge of the association\n\
    between functional attributes and interactive factors. To study such correlation\
    \ requires\nboth comprehensive datasets and high-efﬁciency algorithms, which can\
    \ be achieved by\nusing deep learning.\nThis paper conducts a systematic literature\
    \ review on the application of deep learning\napproaches in crop yield prediction\
    \ using remote sensing data. The rationale of conducting\nthis systematic literature\
    \ review is because it has the potential to highlight the existing\nresearch gaps\
    \ in a particular area of deep learning methodologies and guides us in analyzing\n\
    the impact of vegetation indices and environmental factors on crop growth. This\
    \ systematic\nliterature review provides a new perspective of research by investigating\
    \ the advantages\nof using deep learning in crop yield prediction, the suitable\
    \ remote sensing technology\nbased on the data acquisition requirements, and the\
    \ various features that inﬂuence crop\nyield prediction.\nThe structure of this\
    \ paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the overview of\ncrop yield\
    \ prediction. Section 3 presents the research methodology adopted in conducting\n\
    the systematic review. Section 4 presents the results and discussion, followed\
    \ by the\nconclusions in Section 5.\n2. Research Methods\n2.1. Review Methodology\n\
    This systematic literature review helps us to understand the application of deep\n\
    learning approaches in crop yield prediction using remote sensing data. This systematic\n\
    literature review is carried out to highlight the existing research gaps in a\
    \ particular area of\ndeep learning methodologies and guide us in analyzing the\
    \ impact of vegetation indices\nand environmental factors on crop growth. For\
    \ the systematic literature review, not only\nare all research studies from journals,\
    \ conferences, and other electronic databases assessed,\nbut they are also integrated\
    \ and presented in correspondence to the research questions\nmentioned in our\
    \ study.\nA systematic literature review is an exceptional way to evaluate theory\
    \ or evidence\nin a speciﬁc area or to study the accuracy or validity of a speciﬁc\
    \ theory [5]. The review\nguidelines given by Kitchenham and Charters [6] are\
    \ appropriate for our systematic litera-\nture review as they provide objectivity\
    \ and transparency. Based on the review guidelines,\ninitially, the research questions\
    \ are formulated. The review is undertaken in accordance\nwith the Preferred Reporting\
    \ Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)\nstatement [7]. Several\
    \ databases, such as IEEE Explorer, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Google\nScholar, MDPI,\
    \ and Web of Science, are used for selecting the relevant research articles.\n\
    These research articles are assessed and ﬁltered based on the quality criteria.\
    \ A complete\nchecklist of PRISMA (prisma-statement.org) is used for conducting\
    \ and reporting the results\nof the review.\n2.2. Research Questions\nThe following\
    \ research questions are developed to guide the systematic review:\nQ1. What deep\
    \ learning approaches are used for crop yield prediction?\nThis question helps\
    \ us to analyze both the advantages and limitations of using deep\nlearning approaches\
    \ in crop yield prediction.\nQ2. What remote sensing technologies are used with\
    \ deep learning approaches for\ncrop yield prediction?\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14,\
    \ 1990\n3 of 21\nWith various remote sensing technologies in existence, this question\
    \ helps us to under-\nstand the suitable remote sensing technology based on the\
    \ data acquisition requirements\nfor the study of crop yield prediction, such\
    \ as land area and crop type.\nQ3. What are the vegetation indices and environmental\
    \ parameters used in crop\nyield prediction?\nAnswering this question helps us\
    \ to learn about the various features that are inﬂuenc-\ning the deep learning\
    \ approaches in crop yield prediction.\nQ4. What are the challenges in using deep\
    \ learning approaches and remote sensing\nfor crop yield prediction?\nThis question\
    \ helps us to understand the limitations and challenges in the existing\napproaches.\n\
    2.3. Procedure for Article Search\nThe approach to searching the articles is designed\
    \ based on the framed research\nquestions and the aim of the systematic literature\
    \ review. Narrowing down the focus from a\nmajor concept to the central idea of\
    \ the review helps in creating an effective search strategy.\nUsing “deep learning”\
    \ alone as a search string will generate a lot of published articles from\nvarious\
    \ application ﬁelds that are not likely related to the aim of the review and cause\
    \ the\nsearch to be complicated. Redeﬁning the search strategy as “crop yield\
    \ prediction” AND\n“remote sensing” AND “deep learning” can reduce the probability\
    \ of deviating from the\nscope of the review. Initially, by using these search\
    \ strings, the articles were retrieved from\nﬁve databases, including IEEE Explorer,\
    \ Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, and MDPI.\nFurther, to include any other\
    \ relevant studies, the following keywords, namely “crop yield\nprediction” OR\
    \ “crop yield estimation” AND “deep learning” AND “remote sensing” OR\n“artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence” AND “smart farming”, were used to retrieve the articles from the\n\
    databases. The articles from the last 10 years (2012–2022) were used for the study\
    \ as deep\nlearning approaches gained momentum after 2012 [8]. Since then, much\
    \ research has been\nconducted on deep learning approaches.\n2.4. Article Selection\
    \ Criteria\nThe retrieved articles are initially selected based on aspects such\
    \ as the quality of a\njournal, any type of remote sensing technology used for\
    \ the study, and the type of deep\nlearning approaches adopted. Analyzing the\
    \ abstracts of articles helps in understanding\nthe keywords and the selection\
    \ of articles. Exclusion of irrelevant articles was carried out\nbased on the\
    \ following criteria:\n•\nArticles that belong to the agricultural sector but\
    \ that do not fall under crop yield prediction;\n•\nPublications that include\
    \ machine learning approaches for crop yield prediction;\n•\nPublications that\
    \ have no open access;\n•\nLiterature search for articles that are published before\
    \ 2012;\n•\nArticles in different languages other than English.\nAfter applying\
    \ all the exclusion criteria, a total of 51 articles are selected. Further\nremoving\
    \ the repeated articles across the selected databases, 44 articles are selected\
    \ for\nthe review. In Figure 1, we explain the process for article selection and\
    \ rejection from\ndatabases for the review based on PRISMA. Table 1 shows the\
    \ number of articles retrieved\nafter selection criteria are applied and the number\
    \ of articles obtained after excluding the\nrepeated articles from the selected\
    \ databases. The research questions are addressed after all\nthe data from retrieved\
    \ articles are summarized and synthesized.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n4 of\

    \ their limited\napplicability and uncertainty [9,10]. Many studies have used\

    5 of 21\ntreat the output, crop yield, as an implicit function of the input variables,\
    \ such as weather\ncomponents and soil conditions, which could be very complex\
    \ [11]. Moreover, supervised\nlearning approaches in machine learning fail to\
    \ capture the nonlinear relationship between\ninput and output variables [12].\
    \ However, the advancements in technology in recent years\nhave made it possible\
    \ to develop an advanced crop yield prediction model utilizing deep\nlearning.\
    \ Deep learning is a class of machine learning that uses hierarchical structures\
    \ to\nlink with the other layers, and the capability to analyze both unlabeled\
    \ and unstructured\ndata makes it a class apart from other traditional machine\
    \ learning approaches [13]. Deep\nlearning is broadly used in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld as it can analyze huge datasets, learn the\nrelationships between various\
    \ variables, and use nonlinear functions. These approaches\ncan extract features\
    \ for huge datasets in an unsupervised environment. When compared to\ntraditional\
    \ machine learning approaches, deep learning approaches perform better in fea-\n\
    ture extraction [13]. Since an accurate crop yield prediction relies on the factors\
    \ inﬂuencing\ncrop growth, deep learning has a strong ability to extract features\
    \ from available data.\nDeep neural networks have a collection of nonlinear layers\
    \ that convert the untested\ninput data into an extracted form at each layer [14].\
    \ Deep neural networks with various\nhidden layers are important to discover the\
    \ nonlinear correlation between input and\nresponse variables [14]. Nevertheless,\
    \ they are difﬁcult to train and need recently developed\nhardware and optimization\
    \ methodologies [15]. Thus, a rise in the number of hidden layers\ncan be effective\
    \ but it has some restrictions, which can be resolved by implementing\nsome techniques.\
    \ The vanishing gradient problem in deeper neural networks can be\nreduced by\
    \ making use of residual skip connections for the network [15–17]. Moreover,\n\
    the performance of deep learning approaches has been improved by undertaking various\n\
    techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), batch normalization, and\
    \ dropout.\nSome of the deep learning approaches are given below.\n3.1.1. Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Networks (ANN)\nArtiﬁcial neural networks are simple neural networks\
    \ that were modeled based on\nthe human brain’s neural structure [14]. The neural\
    \ network consists of nodes, which are\nconnected to each other, where the neurons\
    \ are grouped into layers. The network has three\nlayers: the input layer, the\
    \ hidden layer, and the out layer. The inputs are received by the\ninput layer\
    \ of neurons; the hidden layer with interconnected neurons performs the function\n\
    and then provides the output to the output layer [16]. Moreover, to initiate the\
    \ process,\ninitial weights are assigned randomly.\n3.1.2. Deep Neural Networks\
    \ (DNN)\nA DNN is a special kind of feed-forward neural network with many hidden\
    \ layers\nthat are fully connected. Generally, activation functions such as ReLU\
    \ and loss functions\nsuch as L2 regularization and mean squared error are used\
    \ with the hidden layers [13].\n3.1.3. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN)\nBNN uses\
    \ a neural network with Bayesian inference and probability distributions are\n\
    used as weights in BNN. Using a Bayesian neural network can prevent the problem\
    \ of\noverﬁtting without necessary validation data to evaluate the regularization\
    \ parameter [18].\nFor better accuracy, training a BNN with a large dataset can\
    \ be helpful.\n3.1.4. Convolution Neural Network (CNN)\nCompared to conventional\
    \ neural network approaches, a CNN includes layers such\nas convolution layers,\
    \ pooling layers, and fully connected layers, which helps in efﬁciently\nﬁnding\
    \ salient features within the data. The convolution layer consists of a convolution\n\
    operation and activation function, which perform feature extraction [19]. Convolution\n\
    operation includes a ﬁlter and feature map. A ﬁlter is a group of weights applied\
    \ across the\ninput and a feature map is the corresponding output for a given\
    \ ﬁlter. Moreover, a pooling\noperation is used to perform down-sampling as it\
    \ helps to detect features effectively [19].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n6 of\
    \ 21\nThe outputs are then passed through a nonlinear activation function as it\
    \ generates non-\nlinearity into the output. Fully connected (FC) layers are used\
    \ after convolution layers;\nthe network has the capacity to learn the mapping\
    \ between the feature and the target by\nincreasing the FC layers [20].\n3.1.5.\
    \ 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN\nA 2D-CNN is called a spatial method whereas 3D-CNN is called\
    \ a spatio-temporal\nmethod [16]. In a 2D-CNN, the input data are considered as\
    \ the spatial–spectral volume,\nwhere the kernel slides along the two spatial\
    \ dimensions that are across width and height.\nIn a 3D-CNN, to the two spatial\
    \ dimensions, a temporal dimension is also added. A 3D-\nCNN uses three-dimensional\
    \ kernels, which slide along width, height, and depth and help\nin generating\
    \ a 3D feature map [21]. The 3D-CNN approach is developed by implementing\n3D\
    \ convolutional layers [21].\n3.1.6. Faster R-CNN\nThe region-based convolutional\
    \ neural network (R-CNN) is predominantly used for\nobject localization and object\
    \ detection [22]. There are four different kinds of R-CNN;\nthey are R-CNN, Fast\
    \ R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN. The difference in pooling\nmethods and\
    \ region proposal methods makes the R-CNNs different and their process faster.\n\
    3.1.7. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nLSTM is a special kind of recurrent neural\
    \ network (RNN) that can learn time-\ndependent information with an appropriate\
    \ gradient-based algorithm. The LSTM com-\nprises a chain structure, which starts\
    \ with an input layer, one or more LSTM layers, and\nthe output layer. To control\
    \ the cell state and output, the LSTM uses three gates, namely\nthe input gate,\
    \ forget gate, and output gate. These gates are more likely as neural network\n\
    layers, which can control the information transfer [14]. Each cell in LSTM layers\
    \ has three\ngates; the input gate decides which information needs to be retained,\
    \ the forget gate de-\ntermines the amount of previous information that must be\
    \ forgotten and the amount of\ncurrent input that needs to be reserved, the output\
    \ gate uses both the current input and\nprevious output to decide the ﬁnal output\
    \ [23]. Tian et al. [24] proposed the ALSTM model,\nwhich had six layers, namely\
    \ one input layer, one LSTM layer, one attention mechanism\nlayer, two dropout\
    \ layers, and one output layer.\n3.2. Remote Sensing for Data Acquisition\nCrop\
    \ yield can vary according to environmental factors, climatic conditions, disease,\n\
    and other parameters. The crop growth during different stages is inﬂuenced by\
    \ these above-\nmentioned factors and this reﬂects on crop production [10]. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental\nfactors, other parameters, and crop growth can be carried\
    \ out using various instruments\nand methodologies, such as ground observation,\
    \ remote sensing, global positioning sys-\ntems, and on-ﬁeld surveying. In ground\
    \ observation and other traditional methods, it is\nchallenging to personally\
    \ acquire data for a large area and the result will be less accurate\nand unreliable\
    \ [10]. To counteract this limitation, nowadays, remote sensing is increasingly\n\
    utilized for crop monitoring.\nRemote sensing techniques provide details about\
    \ the status of crops at various growth\nlevels through the use of spectral signatures,\
    \ and all at a minimum cost when compared to\nextensive on-ﬁeld surveying. Remote\
    \ sensing technology is the acquisition and analysis\nof information about the\
    \ world and its objects by an instrument placed in the atmosphere\nor a satellite,\
    \ without any physical contact [25]. Remote sensing has the ability to produce\n\
    an adequate number of data when compared with other data acquiring techniques\
    \ such\nas ﬁeld surveying [26]. It is the process of monitoring and recognizing\
    \ places on Earth\nby measuring the emitted and reﬂected radiation with the help\
    \ of sensors [27]. Data\nacquired using remote sensing have several applications\
    \ in agriculture, which include crop\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n7 of 21\ntype\
    \ classiﬁcation, crop yield prediction, soil property detection, crop health monitoring,\n\
    weather data assessment, and soil moisture retrieval [28].\nOne of the most important\
    \ reasons to use optical remote sensing for acquiring crop\ninformation is due\
    \ to the computation of vegetation indices. Combinations of spectral\nmeasurements\
    \ at various wavelengths are known as spectral indices. They are employed\nto\
    \ derive vegetation phenology and calculate biophysical parameters [29]. Among\
    \ various\nspectral indices, vegetation indices are the desired indices signiﬁcantly\
    \ used in crop yield\nprediction. Crops in healthy condition are indicated by\
    \ strong absorption and reﬂectance of\nred and near-infrared bands [30]. The strong\
    \ difference in the intensities of the absorption\nand reﬂectance of red and near-infrared\
    \ bands can be integrated into various quantitative\nindices of the vegetation\
    \ environment. These linear or nonlinear combinational operations\nare known as\
    \ vegetation indices (VI) [31,32]. Some of the VI are the normalized difference\n\
    vegetation index (NDVI), green vegetation index (GVI), chlorophyll absorption\
    \ ratio index\n(CARI), and many others.\n3.3. Impact of Vegetation Indices and\
    \ Environmental Factors\nVegetation indices are formulated in which the sensitivity\
    \ to the vegetation character-\nistics is maximized while the factors such as\
    \ soil background reﬂectance and directional or\natmospheric effects are minimized.\
    \ Most of the vegetation indices use information involv-\ning the red and near-infrared\
    \ (NIR) canopy reﬂectances or radiances [33]. A satellite with a\nmultispectral\
    \ sensor and several bands covers the visible, near-infrared, and short-wave\n\
    infrared wavelength regions, which provides numerous vegetation indices.\nDifferent\
    \ types of vegetation indices are designed by various researchers and are\nextensively\
    \ utilized in several research areas. Even though there is some variation in these\n\
    proposed indices, all these designed indices are sensitive to biochemical attributes\
    \ and\nbiophysical parameters such as leaf angle distribution function, leaf chemical\
    \ contents, frac-\ntion of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, biomass,\
    \ fraction of green coverage,\nand leaf area index (LAI). Due to the strong correlation\
    \ between vegetation indices and\nbiophysical parameters, they are widely used\
    \ to determine the nutritional level of plants,\nmostly relative to nitrogen [34,35],\
    \ to classify vegetation and to schedule crop management.\nHowever, the phenological\
    \ stage of evaluation and the type of indices utilized inﬂuence\ntheir accuracy.\
    \ Zhao et al. [35] developed a function that established a relationship between\n\
    the crop coefﬁcient (Kc) for irrigation management and the vegetation index, and\
    \ it was\nused in water conservation. Other signiﬁcant areas where these indices\
    \ are used are the\nestimation of crop yield, protein content, biomass, weed management,\
    \ and fertilizer man-\nagement [36–38]. Some of the most commonly used indices\
    \ are the normalized difference\nvegetation index (NDVI), green vegetation index\
    \ (GVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI),\nchlorophyll absorption ratio index\
    \ (CARI), and many others.\nVarious studies have investigated how the correlation\
    \ between remotely sensed data\nand crop yield differs as a function of time in\
    \ the course of the growing season [39,40].\nThe studies have indicated that the\
    \ relationship between vegetation indices and crop\nyield varies during the crop\
    \ growth cycle [41–44]. Moreover, the relationship between\nvegetation indices\
    \ and crop yield is not consistent in every growth stage. For example, the\nsuitable\
    \ phenological growth stages for wheat to obtain spatial yield data from satellite\n\
    remote sensing are stem elongation, heading, and the development of fruit until\
    \ early\nripening [45–47]. Similarly, Ali et al. [48] proposed that the appropriate\
    \ crop growth stage\nto study the correlation between vegetation index and crop\
    \ yield and to estimate crop yield\nand biomass for oat grain was the appearance\
    \ stage of the leaf health and kernel watery\nripe stage. Most previous studies\
    \ have performed correlation analyses between vegetation\nindices, soil data,\
    \ and yield data and were mostly carried out for particular crop types,\nspeciﬁc\
    \ years, and a restricted number of vegetation indices [48–51]. The ultimate goal\n\
    in correlation analysis between vegetation indices and crop yield data is to develop\
    \ an\noptimal crop yield prediction model [52–54].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n\
    8 of 21\nFor developing a workable crop yield prediction model, it is important\
    \ to determine\nthe appropriate vegetation indices and environmental factors [55,56].\
    \ You et al. [57] pre-\ndicted corn yield using the greenness index with 90% accuracy.\
    \ Fernandes et al. [58]\nnoticed that the crop yield is inﬂuenced by vegetation\
    \ indices selection. Their study on\nmaize yield prediction showed that NDVIre,\
    \ NDVI, and GNDVI performed well for ﬁeld\nvariability. Haghverdi et al. [59]\
    \ observed that crop yield prediction with NDVIre was\nmore effective when compared\
    \ to NDVI and GNDVI. Wang et al. [60] estimated the corn\nyield by combining vegetation\
    \ indices such as the normalized vegetation index (NVDI)\nand Absorbed Photosynthetically\
    \ Active Radiation (APAR) with environmental factors\nincluding canopy surface\
    \ temperature and water stress index [56]. Further, other features,\nsuch as humidity,\
    \ nutrients, and soil information, are also used in crop yield prediction.\nAs\
    \ so many features are already used in crop yield prediction, there is less investigation\n\
    related to ﬁnding speciﬁc features majorly impacting crop yield prediction. Hence,\
    \ detailed\nresearch is essential to achieve a better overview of these variables\
    \ and factors inﬂuencing\ncrop yield prediction.\n4. Results and Discussion\n\
    The articles selected for the review are analyzed and summarized. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the\nnumber of articles published between 2012 and 2022. For the years 2012–2014,\
    \ the articles\nthat we retrieved did not satisfy the condition of using both\
    \ deep learning and remote\nsensing to predict crop yield. It is evident that\
    \ the study of crop yield prediction using\nremote sensing has increased in recent\
    \ years. Table 2 provides a detailed review of the type\nof remote sensing used\
    \ for the study, data and parameters used in the study, and the model.\n \nFigure\

    \ —Approaches used in literature discussion:\nFor the ﬁrst research question (RQ1),\
    \ the deep learning approaches used for crop yield\nprediction are summarized\
    \ in Table 2. Some unique approaches used are Neuroevolution\nof Augmenting Topologies\
    \ (NEAT) and YieldNet. Table 2 shows that LSTM and CNN are\nthe most used deep\
    \ learning approaches for crop yield prediction. Apart from using CNN\nand LSTM\
    \ approaches, these approaches are widely used together with CNN-LSTM, multi-\n\
    level deep learning approaches with multiple levels, and when using multimodal\
    \ fusion\napproaches. It is found that simple neural networks are least used for\
    \ crop yield prediction\nwhen using remote sensing data. The use of Neuroevolution\
    \ of Augmenting Topologies\n(NEAT) in ANN, Caffe for implementing CNN, and Faster\
    \ R-CNN are some promising\naspects of deep learning. Most of the approaches included\
    \ data-pre-processing, and in\nsome approaches, the Gaussian process was used\
    \ along with CNN and LSTM. Figure 3\nshows the distribution of crop yield prediction\

    \ \nThe overall result of this study indicates that the use of deep learning approaches\
    \ for \ncrop yield estimation has increased over the years, and the number of\
    \ articles retrieved \nfrom our initial search strategy before applying exclusion\
    \ criteria indicates the considera-\nble amount of research carried out on crop\
    \ yield prediction. However, the number of ar-\nticles using remote sensing and\
    \ deep learning approaches for crop yield prediction is still \nrelatively low.\
    \ Even after selecting possible potential articles for this review, there is a\
    \ \npossibility that some valuable articles might have been missed. However, the\
    \ effectiveness \nof this systematic literature review can be validated considering\
    \ the process adopted to \nconduct this review and the search string used to retrieve\
    \ the maximum number of articles \nrelated to this review. \n \nFigure 3. Distribution\
    \ of articles based on deep learning approaches. \n \n \nFigure 3. Distribution\
    \ of articles based on deep learning approaches.\nTable 2 shows that one of the\
    \ most frequently used deep learning approaches for crop\nyield prediction is\
    \ the convolutional neural network (CNN). It is widely used because of its\nspecial\
    \ ability to ﬁnd the important features within the data. Nevavuori et al. [20]\
    \ studied\ncrop yield prediction with a unique proﬁle of temperature and photoperiod,\
    \ developing\na region-speciﬁc deep learning model. Terliksiz and Altýlar [66]\
    \ explained that choosing\nthe right data frame for 3D-CNN is signiﬁcant for crop\
    \ yield prediction. Wolanin et al. [67]\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n11 of 21\n\
    analyzed the inﬂuence of reducing the input time series in 25 days on model performance,\n\
    and the CNN model with 10 variables had a better prediction for days during the\
    \ ﬂowering\nstage of wheat. Nevavuori et al. [85] developed 3D-CNN, ConvLSTM,\
    \ and CNN-LSTM\nfor modeling crop yield. Among them, a model with ﬁve 3D-CNN layers\
    \ had good\nperformance. Yang et al. [86] studied crop yield prediction during\
    \ the ripening stage, in\nwhich the VI-based model had poor performance as the\
    \ maximum greenness stage had\nan inﬂuence on the VIs, but the CNN with RGB and\
    \ multispectral images performed well\neven in the fully ripened stage. Yang et\
    \ al. [87] proposed a CNN approach to study corn\nyield, in which the CNN using\
    \ spectral and color image features performed well when\ncompared to the 1D-CNN\
    \ and 2D-CNN using spectral and spatial features.\nLSTM was also used extensively\
    \ in crop yield prediction, and its ability to learn\ntime-dependent information\
    \ makes it different from the other deep learning approaches.\nWang et al. [60]\
    \ studied the model performance accuracy by using a different combination\nof\
    \ remote sensing and meteorological data and soil data. The addition of soil data\
    \ was\nan advantage for the model in acquiring the spatial variability of yield.\
    \ Tian et al. [23]\nused different combinations of input data, such as a combination\
    \ of vegetation temperature\ncondition index (VTCI) and remote sensing data and\
    \ a combination of VTCI, meteorological\ndata, and remote sensing data, to identify\
    \ the best-performing wheat yield estimation\nmodel. The authors pointed out that\
    \ the incorporation of VTCI with remote sensing and\nmeteorological data can acquire\
    \ information about various inﬂuences on crop growth.\nCunha and Silva [61] studied\
    \ crop yield prediction using LSTM and performed thirty\ndifferent train–test\
    \ cycles to assess the performance. Their approach was to use weather\nand soil\
    \ data rather than satellite data as NDVI-based crop yield prediction is achievable\n\
    only after a certain plant growth stage, whereas weather-based prediction is feasible\n\
    before the planting period. Kaneko et al. [77] studied crop yield prediction in\
    \ a group of\ncountries using the LSTM approach. LSTM with Gaussian processing\
    \ performed well for\nrandom splits when compared to the chronological splits.\
    \ Jiang et al. [78] proposed an\nLSTM approach; prediction accuracy was good in\
    \ extreme weather conditions compared\nto LASSO and RF. Moreover, LSTM performed\
    \ well in learning temporal features when\ncompared to ML approaches such as RF\
    \ and LASSO. Zhang et al. [80] also found that the\ncombination of input data\
    \ performs well for crop yield prediction and estimated a suitable\nVI for crop\
    \ yield prediction. The authors trained the model with six VIs and two climatic\n\
    indices individually to choose the optimal CI, and then found the optimal combination\n\
    for crop yield prediction from the following optimal VI and environmental indices\
    \ (EI)\ncombination, optimal CI and EI combination, optimal VI and optimal CI\
    \ combination,\nand optimal VI, optimal CI, and EI combination. Incorporating\
    \ all these indices helped to\ncapture important variations in maize yield prediction.\n\
    Tian et al. [24] applied a stepwise sensitive analysis method to investigate the\
    \ signiﬁ-\ncance of each input variable in wheat yield prediction, which can help\
    \ in understanding\nthe ALSTM algorithm. ALSTM has two parts: one is the LSTM\
    \ network and the other is\nthe attention mechanism. The ALSTM’s performance was\
    \ better when compared to LSTM.\nMoreover, ALSTM has good generalization ability\
    \ and performed well even though the\nsampling sites had varied farming systems.\n\
    The CNN and LSTM approaches are combined and are studied as CNN-LSTM ap-\nproaches.\
    \ Sharma et al. [70] studied crop yield estimation using the CNN-LSTM approach.\n\
    They studied the inﬂuence of contextual information such as water bodies, farmlands,\n\
    and urban landscape in crop yield prediction by comparing it with another prediction\n\
    model using CNN-LSTM without these factors. The CNN-LSTM along with contextual\n\
    information performed well, thus improving the yield estimation. Gastli et al.\
    \ [72] used\nCNN-LSTM with Gaussian Process (GP) to predict crop yield in California\
    \ and compared\nthe approach with CNN and LSTM. It was found that CNN-LSTM with\
    \ GP performed\nbetter on data with and without moisture and histograms. When\
    \ compared to CNN\nand LSTM, the CNN-LSTM aims to capture features effectively.\
    \ Sun et al. [92] used the\nCNN-LSTM approach to study the end-of-season crop\
    \ yield prediction and compared its\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n12 of 21\nperformance\
    \ with the CNN and LSTM approaches. The CNN-LSTM-based end-of-season\nmodel performed\
    \ well when compared to both CNN and LSTM for ﬁve years. Compared\nto environmental\
    \ features, the MODIS surface reﬂectance had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the\nCNN-LSTM-based\
    \ model.\nDNN was also mostly used in crop yield prediction, either individually\
    \ or in mul-\ntimodal fusion. Cao et al. [68] compared DNN with ML approaches\
    \ such as SVM and\nrandom forest to ﬁnd the best winter wheat yield prediction\
    \ model. Jin et al. [82] stud-\nied biomass estimation using the DNN approach.\
    \ Initially, the DNN performed well for\nbiomass estimation with 15 vegetation\
    \ indices; however, the biomass estimation accuracy\nwas improved when LAI was\
    \ combined with 15 vegetation indices. Ma et al. [79] com-\npared BNN with ML\
    \ approaches, and BNN performed well in both end-of-season and\nwithin-season\
    \ crop yield prediction.\nChen et al. [22] used a region-based convolutional neural\
    \ network (R-CNN) as this\nreduces the number of proposed regions generated while\
    \ ensuring precise object detection.\nMoreover, the authors compared the R-CNN,\
    \ Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN performance\nfor detecting strawberry ﬂower and\
    \ fruit. The Faster R-CNN showed better performance\nwith the lowest training\
    \ time and had the fastest detection rate.\nMultimodal data fusion, a fundamental\
    \ method of multimodal data mining, aims\nto integrate the data of different distributions,\
    \ sources, and types into a global space\nin which both intermodality and cross-modality\
    \ can be represented uniformly [93–96].\nGavahi et al. [62] proposed a deep yield\
    \ approach by combining 3D-CNN and Conv-\nLSTM networks together. Maimaitijiang\
    \ et al. [90] used feature fusion at the input level\nand intermediate level within\
    \ a DNN framework to predict crop yield. The proposed\nmultimodal deep learning\
    \ performed well, and also when considering prediction accuracy,\nspatial adaptivity,\
    \ and robustness, the overall performance of the intermediate-level feature\n\
    fusion DNN framework was comparatively higher than the input-level feature fusion\n\
    DNN framework. Similarly, Danilevicz et al. [91] used multimodal deep learning\
    \ by\nincorporating tab-DNN, sp-DNN, a fusion module with two linear layers, and\
    \ ReLU. For\nthe fusion module input, the authors concatenated the weights from\
    \ the last layer of tab-\nDNN and sp-DNN. The approach performed well for early\
    \ crop yield prediction. However,\nin MLDL/ensembling techniques, several networks\
    \ are stacked in levels and the model\nuses the features extracted by several\
    \ networks. Moreover, Sun et al. [92] proposed the\nMLDL, which is based on combining\
    \ models together to form a single network and stacking\nit in different levels\
    \ with convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.\nA deep\
    \ residual network or ResNet is a speciﬁc type of neural network that was\nintroduced\
    \ to avoid the vanishing/gradient problem. ResNet can assist in training up to\n\
    a thousand layers of deep networks. The core element of ResNet is the residual\
    \ blocks,\nand the skip connections in ResNet help to skip any layer that affects\
    \ the performance\nof the approach using regularization [77]. The YieldNet framework\
    \ was proposed by\nKhaki et al. [97], where they used a transfer learning methodology\
    \ to share weights for the\nbackbone feature extractor. Based on this approach,\
    \ the authors predicted the yield of corn\nand soy simultaneously. Moreover, when\
    \ compared to YieldNet, other approaches such\nas 3D-CNN and DFNN required more\
    \ parameters for prediction and longer training time.\nBarbosa et al. [81] proposed\
    \ an approach called NEAT, where they used a genetic algorithm\ncalled Neuroevolution\
    \ of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) on the proposed dataset. NEAT\nis used to adjust\
    \ both topology and weight parameters in the development of the artiﬁcial\nneural\
    \ network for crop yield prediction.\nIt can be seen that CNN approaches have\
    \ performed well in dealing with data with\nsimilar features. Yang et al. [87]\
    \ used a CNN to predict crop yield at the ripening stage.\nThe CNN approach performed\
    \ well when both the test set and training set had the same\nphenological stage.\
    \ The CNN-LSTM model performs better when predicting crop yield\nwith a large\
    \ dataset [60,68,78,93]. From Table 2, based on the evaluation metrics, the\n\
    CNN- and LSTM-based approaches have better performance when compared to ANN and\n\
    DNN approaches.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n13 of 21\nFrom the study, we have\
    \ observed that multiple software programs were used to\nprocess the data and\
    \ various techniques were adopted to overcome overﬁtting in deep\nlearning approaches.\
    \ Fernandes et al. [58] used TIMESAT to extract a set of metrics from\nthe NDVI\
    \ growing curves and they only considered the unmixed sugarcane pixels while\n\
    extracting metrics for each municipality in Brazil using an Interactive Data Language\
    \ (IDL)\ntechnique. The wrapper with sequential backward elimination technique\
    \ with ANN for\nfeature extraction was carried out as input in a stacking ensemble\
    \ neural network model.\nIn order to overcome overﬁtting, the authors divided\
    \ the datasets into three parts (70%\nfor training, 10% for validation, and 20%\
    \ for testing). Haghervedi et al. [59] calculated\nvegetation indices and implemented\
    \ the ANN approach using Neurosolution V 7.1.1.1\nsoftware. The authors used the\
    \ technique of stopping the training when the mean square\nerror of the cross-validation\
    \ subset started to increase or showed no improvement after\n100 iterations to\
    \ avoid overﬁtting. For UAV images, Chen et al. [22] incorporated the\nidea of\
    \ using orthoimages to avoid the distortion of photos, and all the images were\n\
    labeled manually using the labeling program developed by the Computer Science\
    \ and\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence Laboratory (MIT, MA, USA). Kaneko et al. [77] used\
    \ the surface\nreﬂectance data (all seven bands of the MOD09A1.006) and temperature\
    \ data (two bands\nof the MOD11A2.006) of MODIS to generate features such as NDVI\
    \ and EVI. The authors\nemployed the histogram dimensionality reduction approach\
    \ with LSTM to counteract\noverﬁtting as the quantity of label data might be sparse.\
    \ Nevavuori et al. [20] processed the\nirregular set of data points obtained from\
    \ the yield measurement devices as rasters of ﬁeld-\nwise yield. FarmWorks software\
    \ was used for ﬁltering and the generation of raterizable\nvector ﬁles. The authors\
    \ extracted ﬁeld-wise image data (UAV images) and yield values\nusing the sliding\
    \ window technique to obtain geolocational matching pairs of inputs and\ntargets.\
    \ To overcome the problem of overﬁtting, two distinct regularization strategies\
    \ with\nCNN, such as weight decay and early stopping, are used. The GEE-based\
    \ transformation\nwas used by Sun et al. [69] to transform an entire image collection\
    \ composed of remote\nsensing data into a 32-bin normalized histogram by country\
    \ level. The authors employed\nthe early stopping regularization technique to\
    \ reduce the generalization error in the CNN-\nLSTM model. The pooling layer with\
    \ convolution layer were used to extract features [62].\nSharma et al. [70] did\
    \ not include a pooling layer in the CNN-LSTM approach because\nof strided convolutions.\
    \ Regularization strategies such as early stopping, L2 penalty, and\nthe dropout\
    \ technique were used in CNN- and LSTM-based approaches to overcome the\nproblem\
    \ of overﬁtting.\nSome of the software and techniques used for calculating VIs,\

    crop yield estimation has increased over the years, and the number of articles\
    \ retrieved\nfrom our initial search strategy before applying exclusion criteria\
    \ indicates the consider-\nable amount of research carried out on crop yield prediction.\
    \ However, the number of\narticles using remote sensing and deep learning approaches\
    \ for crop yield prediction is\nstill relatively low. Even after selecting possible\
    \ potential articles for this review, there is a\npossibility that some valuable\

    \ literature review can be validated considering the process adopted to\nconduct\
    \ this review and the search string used to retrieve the maximum number of articles\n\
    related to this review.\nRQ2 —Remote sensing used with deep learning:\nTable 2\
    \ shows that the most commonly used remote sensing technology was satellite\n\
    remote sensing technology—in particular, MODIS. The data, such as surface reﬂectance,\n\
    land surface temperature, and annual land cover, were obtained from MODIS. The\
    \ other\nsatellite remote sensing technologies used along with deep learning were\
    \ Landsat 8 and\nLandsat 7, Sentinel-2, WorldView-3, and PlanetScope. It can be\
    \ observed that satellite\nremote sensing has the ability to produce an adequate\
    \ amount of data. The satellite remote\nsensing is a reliable source of data acquisition\
    \ as it is easily available and inexpensive when\ncompared to other remote sensing\
    \ technologies. The multispectral satellites can offer huge\namounts of information\
    \ on crop yield using high spatial and temporal resolution [57]. The\nraw bands\
    \ from the remote sensing technology help to derive the vegetation indices and\n\
    the extracted features are used with DL for crop yield prediction. The correlation\
    \ between\nthese features and the crop yield was studied in the articles to understand\
    \ the efﬁciency of\nthese features in crop yield prediction. Sometimes, the use\
    \ of all the derived vegetation\nindices does not help signiﬁcantly in generating\
    \ better performance of the approach. It is\nobserved that the use of remote sensing\
    \ technology for data acquisition is based on the\nrequirements of the study.\
    \ For instance, satellite images are more useful when dealing with\na large area\
    \ of land, such as a state or district. Figure 4 depicts the distribution of articles\n\
    using satellite data across years 2015–2022. It can be seen that the majority\
    \ of the articles on\nthe use of satellite data with deep learning were published\
    \ in 2015 and 2020, with 39% and\n25%, respectively.\nRQ3 —Features used in crop\

    \ authors state that the use of MODIS Land Surface Temperature over air temperature\
    \ is\neffective as the LST-based growing, killing, and frozen degree days were\

    \ is reactive to the surface–energy\nbalance, leaf canopy temperatures, and plant\
    \ moisture, which makes it advantageous\nin crop yield prediction. However, the\
    \ performance of satellite-based precipitation was\ncomparatively lower than the\
    \ temperature-based metrics. Moreover, in some articles, RGB\nimages have outperformed\
    \ spectral images. Nevavuori et al. [85] established that RGB\nimages’ performance\
    \ was better than that of NDVI images. Maimaitijiang et al. [90] found\nthat the\
    \ RGB-based information had comparatively better prediction accuracy than the\n\
    spectral features.\nYou et al. [57] observed that the growth-related infrared\
    \ band and the short-wave\ninfrared band were signiﬁcant during crop growing months,\
    \ whereas land surface tem-\nperature bands had importance in earlier crop growing\

    \ of the model for providing accurate\ninformation about crop yield to agriculturalists,\

    \ challenges faced when using deep learning approaches\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14,\
    \ 1990\n17 of 21\nas it is difﬁcult to understand the working behind the neural\
    \ networks, and understanding\nthis may help to develop a better model. Khaki\
    \ et al. [99] have trained DNN and CNN-RNN\nusing the backpropagation method to\
    \ perform feature selection for reducing the black box\nnature of the model. The\
    \ authors used this feature selection method to effectively evaluate\nthe individual\
    \ effects of weather components, soil conditions, and management variables,\n\
    as well as the time period. To improve the traceability and interpretability of\
    \ the LSTM\nmodel, recurrent network structures such as the Gated Recurrent Unit\
    \ and basic RNN,\nand advanced analytical tools such as the attention network,\
    \ can be further explored in\nthe model [67]. Moreover, as the inﬂuence of the\
    \ crop growth phase/phenological stage\nin crop yield prediction is signiﬁcant,\
    \ any change in the climatic conditions during crop\ngrowth stages can drastically\
    \ affect the plant growth, which eventually leads to variation\nin crop yield\
    \ estimation. Nevavuori et al. [85] observed the signiﬁcance of the crop growth\n\
    phase in crop yield prediction using weather information at a city scale; however,\
    \ the use\nof local temperatures and other climatic variables from local weather\
    \ stations can improve\nthe possibility to learn the accuracy of change in crop\
    \ growth stages.\nThe ANN approach was not efﬁcient to capture the variability\
    \ in micro-topography,\nwhich affected the prediction and had large model errors\
    \ for ﬁelds with high yield vari-\nability [75]. The challenge with deep learning\
    \ approaches is that large amounts of data are\nrequired to achieve good accuracy,\
    \ and also the complexity of deep learning approaches\nincreases the time complexity\
    \ of the algorithm [76]. Terliksiz and Altýlar [66] observed\nthat the results\
    \ can be affected when data frames with different cropland coverage are fed\n\
    to the 3D-CNN. Ma et al. [79] mentioned that incorporating the Bayesian deep learning\n\
    approach with another deep learning approach such as LSTM, which has the potential\n\
    to handle time-series features, can help in improving the model. Apart from the\
    \ features\nmentioned in the previous section, the inclusion of other factors\
    \ such as phenological stages,\ncrop varieties, water availability, and others\
    \ can help in the development of a potential\nmodel [69,75]. Moreover, the challenge\
    \ lies in developing an approach with potential\nvariables that is likely to perform\
    \ well for all crops or speciﬁc kinds of crops.\n5. Conclusions\nThis paper has\
    \ presented a systematic literature review on the application of deep\nlearning\
    \ approaches for crop yield prediction using remote sensing data. The rationale\
    \ of\nconducting this systematic literature review was to highlight the existing\
    \ research gaps\nin a particular area of deep learning methodologies and provide\
    \ useful information on\nthe impact of vegetation indices and environmental factors\
    \ on crop yield prediction. This\nsystematic literature review has provided various\
    \ deep learning approaches, features, and\nfactors adopted for crop yield prediction.\
    \ All the studies were carried out on different types\nof crops, geological positions,\
    \ and various features. Overall, the performance and accuracy\nof the deep learning\
    \ approach for crop yield prediction are better when compared to tradi-\ntional\
    \ machine learning approaches. The deep learning approaches are all equally capable\n\
    in crop yield prediction based on the factors/parameters used in the model. However,\
    \ the\nmost effective deep learning approaches for crop yield prediction are the\
    \ CNN- and LSTM-\nbased approaches. CNN has the ability to ﬁnd important features\
    \ that can inﬂuence the\ncrop yield prediction. Moreover, LSTM does not only identify\
    \ the data’s variation pattern,\nbut also the time-series data’s dependent connection\
    \ [23]. Based on this study, it is observed\nthat the vegetation indices and the\
    \ meteorological data are the most used features, where\nthe vegetation indices\
    \ explain the crops’ characteristics and the meteorological data help to\nmonitor\
    \ the climatic conditions, which has a direct inﬂuence on crop yield prediction.\
    \ It\ncan also be seen that the factors inﬂuencing crop yield prediction are selected\
    \ based on the\ncrop yield and its correlation with other factors. It is also\
    \ shown that the main challenges\nof using deep learning approaches and remote\
    \ sensing for crop yield prediction are in\nhow to improve the working model for\
    \ better accuracy, the practical implications of the\nmodel for providing accurate\
    \ information about crop yield to agriculturalists, growers, and\npolicymakers,\
    \ and the issue concerning the black box property.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1990\n\
    18 of 21\nIn future work, we will consider conducting a systematic literature\
    \ review on articles\nthat use data from hyperspectral sensors for crop yield\
    \ prediction. Moreover, we will\ninclude the speciﬁc food crops and classify the\
    \ techniques and approaches used for different\ncrop yield predictions.\nAuthor\

    \ paper is dedicated to Prof. Hartmut K. Lichtenthaler, a pioneer in imaging techniques\
    \ applied to plant\nstress research in Europe.\nAbstract: In the last few years,\
    \ large efforts have been made to develop new methods to optimize\nstress detection\
    \ in crop ﬁelds. Thus, plant phenotyping based on imaging techniques has become\
    \ an\nessential tool in agriculture. In particular, leaf temperature is a valuable\
    \ indicator of the physiological\nstatus of plants, responding to both biotic\
    \ and abiotic stressors. Often combined with other imaging\nsensors and data-mining\
    \ techniques, thermography is crucial in the implementation of a more\nautomatized,\
    \ precise and sustainable agriculture. However, thermal data need some corrections\n\
    related to the environmental and measuring conditions in order to achieve a correct\
    \ interpretation of\nthe data. This review focuses on the state of the art of\
    \ thermography applied to the detection of biotic\nstress. The work will also\
    \ revise the most important abiotic stress factors affecting the measurements\n\
    as well as practical issues that need to be considered in order to implement this\
    \ technique, particularly\nat the ﬁeld scale.\nKeywords: Remote sensing; proximal\
    \ sensing; thermography; plant phenotyping\n1. Introduction\nEnvironmental conditions\
    \ driven by climate change and infections are great challenges\nthat need to be\
    \ overcome by modern agriculture. The economic loss in agriculture caused by\n\
    increasing environmental pressures could reach an annual 0.3% to 0.8% of projected\
    \ global\ngross domestic product by the end of the century [1]. Moreover, plant\
    \ diseases are the main\ncause of the drop in production and economic losses in\
    \ agriculture worldwide, reaching\nyield losses of 20 to 30% depending on the\
    \ crop [2]. Current practices and social activities\n-such as intensiﬁed monoculture\
    \ in large areas, the use of genetically uniform plant varieties\nand the development\
    \ of global supply chains and logistic activities- contribute largely to\nthe\
    \ widespread of plant disease epidemics and rapid pathogen evolution [3].\nPlant\
    \ phenotyping based on imaging techniques is a pertinent approach to quantify\n\
    the appearance and performance of crops under different environmental conditions\
    \ while\naddressing the spatial heterogeneity of crop ﬁelds. Therefore, plant\
    \ phenotyping, applied\nto precision agriculture, is a valuable tool for the diagnosis\
    \ and detection of plant stress,\neven in the absence of symptoms. Optical sensors\
    \ have been used to study (a) the response\nof plants to pathogens, pests and\
    \ abiotic stressors; (b) to identify primary disease foci; (c) to\nmonitor resistance\
    \ or susceptibility of different plant genotypes to speciﬁc stress factors;\n\
    (d) to evaluate the severity of symptoms; (e) and to assess plant biomass and\
    \ yield [4].\nStomatal activity is one of the most important physiological traits\
    \ for plant growth\nand development. It plays a crucial role in the carbon and\
    \ water balance by controlling\nphotosynthesis and transpiration [5]. Hence, stomatal\
    \ conductance to water (gs) is related\nto yield and to the tolerance of environmental\
    \ stresses [6] and correlates strongly with leaf\ntemperature [7–9]. Thermal long-wave\
    \ infrared (TIR) cameras (or simply thermal cameras)\nare calibrated sensors able\
    \ to record emitted radiation in the thermal range (8–14 µm)\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 68. https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13010068\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n2 of 21\nand provide images representing temperature\
    \ values per pixel. Thus, conventional, time-\nconsuming ground-based gs measurements\
    \ can be feasibly replaced by thermal images\nevaluating plant physiological status\
    \ at different scales in short periods of time [10,11]. Ad-\nditionally, highly\
    \ sensitive thermal cameras with a relatively simple operational procedure\nhave\
    \ become more available to research groups, at a lower cost and at higher spatial\
    \ reso-\nlution [12,13]. Moreover, TIR imaging is a very valuable method of stress\
    \ detection prior to\nthe appearance of symptoms since it operates out of the\
    \ visual range of the spectrum [14].\nHowever, some considerations must be taken\
    \ when interpreting thermograms in terms\nof gs since plant surface temperature\
    \ is mainly driven by environmental factors such as\nair temperature and relative\
    \ humidity. Even though high-end thermal cameras carry out\ncorrections for these\
    \ two parameters, there are other factors affecting canopy temperatures,\nsuch\
    \ as wind speed and light intensity, as well as by plant features, ranging from\
    \ leaf size\nor angle to canopy structure. A number of corrections for these factors\
    \ can be found in\nthe literature as TIR stress indices (Table 1). Some of these\
    \ parameters have been found\nto correlate with physiological traits related to\
    \ the water balance status of plants (Table 2).\nThe most common TIR parameters\
    \ are:\n1.\nNormalized canopy or leaf temperature with reference to air temperature\
    \ (∆T), uti-\nlized as an index of crop water status. The applications of ∆T was\
    \ recently reviewed\nby Still et al. [15];\n2.\nCrop water stress index (CSWI),\
    \ which introduces two baselines: (Tcanopy − Tair)wet\nas the estimated difference\
    \ for a well-watered plant, and (Tcanopy − Tair)dry for a\ndry (non-transpiring)\
    \ plant. CWSI is one of the most commonly used normalization\nmethods for TIR\
    \ measurements, which overcomes the effects of other environmental\nparameters\
    \ affecting plant temperature [16,17];\n3.\nIndex of stomatal conductance (IG),\
    \ since it is directly proportional to this parame-\nter [18];\n4.\nMaximum temperature\
    \ difference (MTD), calculated for every leaf or sample [19].\nThis parameter\
    \ has only been correlated with the severity of symptoms for several\ndiseases,\
    \ as reviewed in [20,21];\n5.\nNormalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT),\
    \ based on the maximum and the\nminimum temperature measured in the whole ﬁeld\
    \ trial. This parameter has been\nfound to be a valid estimation of the crop water\
    \ status [22];\n6.\nAverage canopy temperature (Tav), based on maximum and minimum\
    \ values of\ntemperature, was one of the ﬁrst parameters used by the conventional\
    \ infrared\nthermography [23,24]. However, this parameter can excessively simplify\
    \ outcome\ndata, and some important thermal information can be lost. Estimated\
    \ shape factors\nderived by ﬁtting the whole temperature data of the thermal images\
    \ to the Weibull\ndistribution could solve this constraint [25].\nTable 1. Most\

    \ this technique per se\nhas a very limited capacity for diagnosis. Indeed, temperature\
    \ raises may be due to\nstomatal closure, which is on its own an unspeciﬁc mechanism\
    \ of plant defense against\nboth abiotic and biotic stressors. Even more, temperature\
    \ raises can also respond to a\ndecreased capacity for water evaporation or even\
    \ to the loss of vegetation [10]. In contrast,\nsome stresses can cause temporary\
    \ decreases in leaf temperature. That would be the case\nof some pathogens that\
    \ can interfere in the regulation of stomatal movements to favor\ntheir entry\
    \ to the mesophyll [68]. As a consequence, alterations in TIR parameters stand\n\
    as ambiguous clues for diagnosis. Moreover, abiotic stress factors (mostly drought,\
    \ soil\nsalinity or extreme ambient temperature) also cause increases in canopy\
    \ temperature.\nThis is most important under natural conditions, where abiotic\
    \ stressors are difﬁcult to\nassess and avoid. Keeping in mind that under such\
    \ conditions, several stress factors often\naffect the vegetation simultaneously,\
    \ possible misinterpretations of TIR data would lead to\ninaccurate determination\
    \ of the incidence and severity of a particular pathogen infection\nor even to\
    \ a wrong diagnosis.\nTo overcome the restraints of thermography as a diagnostic\

    \ techniques. Roitsch et al. [69]\nand Sperschneider [70] reviewed the implementation\

    \ plants. Attending to this need, this review will\nrevise the most relevant applications\
    \ of thermography to agriculture with the main aim of\nproviding TIR camera users\
    \ with a collection of host plant–pathogen systems described in\nthe literature\
    \ in terms of thermal response and the mechanisms of plant defense involved.\n\
    Furthermore, a state-of-art review on the detection of abiotic stress by thermography\
    \ will\ncomplement our current knowledge on thermography applied to the diagnosis\
    \ of biotic\nstress in plants.\n2. Biotic Stress Detection by Thermography at\
    \ Different Scales\nStomata are the main natural entry of pathogens into the plant\
    \ tissues. Hence, the regu-\nlation of the stomatal movements plays a key role\
    \ in plant defense against microbes [86]. The\nrecognition of a potential pathogen\
    \ by plants usually triggers stomatal closure; to counteract\nthis defense response,\
    \ some pathogens are able to override the plant signaling pathways to\nactivate\
    \ stomatal aperture [87]. Other effects of pathogen infection include disturbances\
    \ on\nleaf development, cell wall and leaf cuticle composition or integrity, alterations\
    \ in the plant\nmetabolism or even necrosis of the tissues. These physical and\
    \ chemical disturbances affect\nthe plant water status, which can be monitored\
    \ by thermography [88–90].\n2.1. Proximal Sensing on Growth Chambers and Greenhouses\n\
    2.1.1. Viral Infections\nEven when some virosis cause alterations neither in gs\
    \ nor in leaf temperature [91],\nthermography is very often helpful in tracking\
    \ viral infections on plants. Most of those\nworks report temperature increases\
    \ between +0.5 and +1.5 K; on the contrary, some works\nreported decreases in\
    \ leaf temperature of −0.5 K relative to mock-controls. Hypersensi-\ntive response\
    \ (HR) to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) could be visualized as spots of elevated\n\
    temperature before any disease symptoms became visible on tobacco leaves. Those\
    \ spots\nwere conﬁned to the site of infection as a result of the HR triggered\
    \ by salicylic acid. On\nthe other hand, no thermal response was observed on susceptible\
    \ tobacco-TMV-infected\nplants [92]. In the case of Pepper middle mottle virus\
    \ (PMMoV)-Nicotiana benthamiana plants,\nvirus spreading through asymptomatic\
    \ leaves could be ﬁrst detected by an increase in\ntemperature on the tissues\
    \ around the main veins. This effect extended to adjacent tissues\nbefore the\
    \ spreading of the virus across the midrib of the leaf, as shown by immunolocaliza-\n\
    tion. Interestingly, the thermal symptoms caused by the most severe strain of\
    \ PMMoV were\ndetected before those caused by the less virulent one [93]. Among\
    \ other tobamoviruses,\nCucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Cucumber green mottle\
    \ mosaic virus (CGMMV) have a\nparticular impact on cucumber production. Plants\
    \ infected with CMV displayed homoge-\nneously higher temperature in the whole\
    \ inoculated leaf relative to the controls, whereas\nleaves of CGMMV-infected\
    \ cucumber plants showed a heterogeneous temperature pattern,\nconsisting of cold\
    \ spots at the infection sites. However, none of those changes was de-\ntectable\
    \ presymptomatically. Nevertheless, classiﬁcatory algorithms could early detect\
    \ the\ninfection caused by each pathogen when combining data obtained by TIR,\
    \ ﬂuorescence and\nhyperspectral imaging [94]. Another virus of agricultural interest\
    \ is the Sweet potato feathery\nmottle virus, which is the most widespread virus\
    \ that infects sweet potato plants, causing\ndevastating problems when co-infecting\
    \ with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus. Higher leaf\ntemperatures were associated\
    \ with more severe symptoms; thus, plants co-infected with\nboth viruses displayed\
    \ higher temperatures than single virus-infected plants [95].\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 68\n6 of 21\n2.1.2. Bacterial Infections\nIn the case of bacterial-infected\
    \ plants, literature reports temperature changes relative\nto the controls ranging\
    \ between −3.3 K and +3 K. The tumor caused by Agrobacterium\ntumefaciens in the\
    \ hypocotyl of castor oil plant produces irreversible disruption of the plant\n\
    epidermis and hence, the tumor lacks a protective cuticle against water loss.\
    \ Moreover,\nstomata located at the tumor edge are hypertrophied and non-functional;\
    \ as a consequence,\nthe tumor surface was the coldest part of the plant [96].\
    \ Some works have studied the\nrole of plant defense elicitors produced by bacterial\
    \ pathogens. That is the case of the\nproteinaceous harpin synthesized by the\
    \ bacterium Erwinia amylovora. When inﬁltrated\nin the leaves of Nicotiana sylvestris\
    \ wild plants, harpin induced a marked presymptomatic\ncooling at the inoculation\
    \ sites, followed by an increase of temperature during the HR [97].\nThe same\
    \ trend was described for spots of bacterial canker caused by Pseudomonas syringae\n\
    pv. actinidiae on kiwifruit leaves [98]. The decrease in temperature localized\
    \ at the infection\nsites could be related to bacterial virulence factors that\
    \ actively open the stomata by\ninterfering with hormonal signaling pathways leading\
    \ to stomatal closure [99]. On the\nother hand, it is well known that recognition\
    \ of some pathogen-associated molecular\npatterns triggers stomatal closure to\
    \ impede bacterial entrance through these natural\napertures [68]. In bean plants,\
    \ P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 induces an HR, whereas\nP. syringae pv. phaseolicola\
    \ 1448A produces systemic infection. First symptoms are evident\nafter 10 h and\
    \ 2 days post-infection, respectively. Thermography could presymptomatically\n\
    reveal those bacterial challenges as an increase of temperature of the inoculated\
    \ areas at 1\nand 2 h post-infection in the case of HR and systemic infection,\
    \ respectively [100].\nSeveral works have addressed the effect of the Dickeya\
    \ dadantii infection on plant tran-\nspiration by thermography. This bacterium\
    \ usually produces soft-rot, a characteristic tissue\nmaceration, as in the case\
    \ of N. benthamiana infected at high inoculum dose. After mechani-\ncal inﬁltration,\
    \ the temperature of the affected areas raised presymptomatically, linked to\n\
    an increase in hormones controlling stomatal closure. In subsequent days, the\
    \ temperature\ncontinued rising, affecting the whole leaf. However, N. benthamiana\
    \ can activate an efﬁcient\ndefense response against D. dadantii when the plant\
    \ is inoculated at doses resembling the\nnatural infection. In this case, after\
    \ an initial increase in temperature of the inﬁltrated\narea, infected plants\
    \ could recover, and temperature subsequently decreased [101]. Inde-\npendently\
    \ of the inoculum dose, D. dadantii does not cause tissue maceration on melon\n\
    leaves. It produces brownish spots at the inoculation sites that evolve chlorosis\
    \ in the\nsurrounding tissues in successive days; those symptoms appeared earlier\
    \ when high dose\nconcentrations were applied. Only inﬁltrated areas shown increased\
    \ temperatures at the\nbeginning of the infection process when inoculated at a\
    \ low dose; the whole leaf ﬁnally\ndisplaying higher temperature respecting to\
    \ the controls. However, when a high inoculum\ndose was applied, the whole melon\
    \ leaf displayed a higher temperature [102]. The whole\nleaf of another cucurbit,\
    \ such as zucchini, displayed higher temperature relative to the\ncontrols when\
    \ inoculated with D. dadantii, whereas visual symptoms (different degrees\nof\
    \ chlorosis proportional to the inoculated dose) were circumscribed to the inﬁltrated\n\
    spots [103,104]. Features extracted from TIR and multicolor ﬂuorescence images\
    \ were used\nto feed algorithms, which provided a good performance of classiﬁcation\
    \ of plants into\ncategories of infected and controls in both melon and zucchini\
    \ plants [102–104].\n2.1.3. Interactions with Pathogenic Fungi and Oomycetes\n\
    Thermography has been widely used to assess the effect of fungi and oomycetes\
    \ on\nhost plant transpiration. Depending on how these pathogens interact with\
    \ host plants,\ninitial phases of pathogenesis can induce increases or decreases\
    \ in leaf temperatures\naffecting only the inoculation sites or wholes leaves.\
    \ Subsequent symptoms development\nmay cause transitory drops in temperature as\
    \ the affected cells die and lose water. Later\ninfection phases usually lead\
    \ to an increase in temperature due to the lack of natural\ncooling of the necrotic\
    \ tissues. Concerning healthy areas, it is possible to ﬁnd in the cited\nliterature\
    \ that biotrophic fungi and oomycetes can cause temperature decreases ranging\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n7 of 21\nfrom −0.1 to −2.5 K, whereas increases have\
    \ been registered from +0.6 to +2 K. For their\npart, hemibiotrophic pathogens\
    \ can decrease leaf temperature between −0.6 and −2.2 K, or\ncontrary, increase\
    \ it in +0.4 to +7.5 K. Finally, it is possible to register temperatures decreases\n\
    between −2 and −5 K and increases ranging from +0.3 to +9 K when necrotrophic\
    \ fungi\nare studied by TIR imaging.\nConcerning infections caused by biotrophic\
    \ fungi leaves from wheat plants infected\nwith Blumeria graminis or Puccinia\
    \ striiformis (fungi causing powdery mildew and stripe\nrust, respectively) displayed\
    \ low temperatures due to the very low resistance to water\nevaporation of growing\
    \ mycelia [105,106]. The phytopathogens Pseudoperonospora cubensis\nand Podosphaera\
    \ xanthii are the causal agents of cucumber downy mildew and cucurbits\npowdery\
    \ mildew, respectively. In cucumber leaves, these pathogens produce infective\n\
    spots with lower temperatures than the surrounding healthy areas due to an abnormal\n\
    stomatal opening. In the case of P. xanthii infection, the thermographic detection\
    \ was\nnot presymptomatic, whereas disease caused by P. cubensis could be revealed\
    \ one day\nbefore the appearance of symptoms. Under laboratory conditions, the\
    \ MTD increased\nduring both pathogenesis and was related to disease severity\
    \ [19,94,107,108]. Despite\nbeing a biotrophic oomycete, P. cubensis also produces\
    \ necrosis in the latest infection phase\nassociated with an increase in cucumber\
    \ leaf temperature [19,108]. Leaves of rose infected\nwith the fungus Podosphaera\
    \ pannosa var. rosae (causal agent of powdery mildew in roses)\nshowed a presymptomatic\
    \ decrease in temperature. Furthermore, two algorithms were\ntrained on features\
    \ extracted from TIR images, obtaining high accuracy in classifying\nhealthy and\
    \ infected plants [109]. Raza et al. [110] also used information extracted from\
    \ TIR\nand RGB pictures to automatically detect tomato plants infected with Oidium\
    \ neolycopersici\nin a presymptomatic way, but the work did not address the physiological\
    \ changes caused\nby the fungus.\nRegarding hemibiotrophic fungi, TIR imaging\
    \ could describe the severity of the\ninfection, which could be related to the\
    \ disease stages but also to the host plant resistance\nto the pathogen. Thus,\
    \ Oerke et al. [111] and Belin et al. [112] analyzed apple trees\nsuffering from\
    \ apple scab. In that case, the detection of infection, as well as differences\n\
    in the virulence of several Venturia inaequalis isolates infecting apple trees,\
    \ were detected\nmore accurately by thermography than by chlorophyll ﬂuorescence\
    \ imaging. The thermal\nresponse was presymptomatic and consisted of spots of\
    \ decreased temperature due to\nthe subcuticular growth of V. inaequalis. A soilborne\
    \ fungus, Rhizoctonia solani, induces\nnecrosis in lettuce plants, which could\
    \ be visualized as an increase in leaf temperature\nand MTD [113]. The damage\
    \ produced by another soilborne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum,\nto whole cucumber\
    \ leaves could be detected as a presymptomatic raise in temperature\ninduced by\
    \ abscisic acid, followed by a slight decrease as wilt symptoms developed. Finally,\n\
    the temperature of whole leaves presenting necrosis increased again [114]. On\
    \ the contrary,\npea plants infected with this fungus showed an early and slight\
    \ reduction of temperature\ncompared to the control plants. At an advanced stage\
    \ of the infection, the leaf temperature\nincreased above control levels in the\
    \ case of susceptible plants, whereas the temperature of\nthose showing F. oxysporum-resistance\
    \ remained similar to the controls [115].\nIn the case of infections caused by\
    \ necrotrophic fungi, sugar beet plants inoculated\nwith Cercospora beticola (causal\
    \ agent of Cercospora leaf spot) displayed spots of presymp-\ntomatic low temperature\
    \ corresponding to the infection sites. Cold spots appeared pro-\ngressively until\
    \ covering the whole leaf surface, whereas lesions were hardly visible by\nthe\
    \ naked eye. Toxins inﬂuencing cell membrane permeability and produced by C. beticola\n\
    could account for this temperature decrease [92]. Aspergillus carbonarius is a\
    \ fungus causing\nsour rot of grape berries and produces ochratoxin-As, toxic\
    \ for humans. Mycelium growth\nareas showed low temperatures that identiﬁed affected\
    \ fruit sites at the very early-stages of\nA. carbonarius infection [25]. Thermography\
    \ also revealed that Alternaria alternata, A. bras-\nsicae and A. brassicicola\
    \ caused a decrease of temperature during the ﬁrst seven days of\ninfection on\
    \ oilseed rape leaves, followed by a temperature increase in successive days.\n\
    However, those plants inoculated with A. dauci only developed increases of mean\
    \ tem-\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n8 of 21\nperature at 21 days after inoculation\
    \ [116]. The infection with Botrytis cinerea (gray mold)\non bean plants caused\
    \ a presymptomatic increase of temperature at the infection sites. In\nsubsequent\
    \ days, leaves developed hot brownish necrotic lesions surrounded by a lower\n\
    temperature area [117]. Contrary, B. cinerea–infected roses ﬁrst showed a decrease\
    \ of tem-\nperature at regions where lesions were initially formed, followed by\
    \ a rise in temperature\nonce necrosis occurred [109]. Rosellinia necatrix (soilborne\
    \ fungus causing white root rot) is\none of the most important constraints to\
    \ production for a wide range of woody crops such\nas avocado. In the late phases\
    \ of R. necatrix infection, trees undergo a water deﬁcit in the\naerial part due\
    \ to failure of the root system [118]. As a result, infected plants experienced\
    \ a\nsigniﬁcant increase in leaf temperature from the early symptomatic stage\
    \ onwards [119].\nFurthermore, infected avocado trees in an orchard could be detected\
    \ by thermography (see\nSection 2.2) [120].\n2.1.4. Herbivory and Parasitic Plants\n\
    Herbivore insects disrupt the integrity of leaves, leading to uncontrolled water\
    \ loss\nfrom wounds and triggering intricate processes that affect gas exchange\
    \ also in the re-\nmaining leaf tissue. Thus, it is possible to ﬁnd temperature\
    \ drops from −0.3 to −3 K\nin the literature. TIR images of soybean leaﬂets affected\
    \ by corn earworm caterpillars\n(Helicoverpa zea) showed that leaf areas adjacent\
    \ to wounds were cooler than distant regions\nor sister leaﬂets [121]. The same\
    \ leaf temperature pattern was visible after injuries caused\nby cabbage looper\
    \ (Trichoplusia ni) instars on Arabidopsis [122], tobacco hornworm (Man-\nduca\
    \ sexta) on Nicotiana attenuata [123], or larval gypsy moth (Lymantria dyspar)\
    \ and gall\ndamage produced by midge ﬂies (Harmandia sp.) on aspen leaves [124].\
    \ When elevated\nCO2 was applied to the atmosphere, the cooling effect of gall\
    \ formation on remaining leaf\ntissue was reduced [124].\nThermography was also\
    \ useful in the detection of plants infested by parasites, reveal-\ning temperature\
    \ increases (from +0.4 to +0.9 K) due to a reduction in the plant water uptake\n\
    by affected roots. Examples of these interactions are the nematode Heterodera\
    \ schachtii\nwith susceptible sugar beet cultivars [125], as well as the obligatory\
    \ root parasitic plant\nOrobanche cumana (broomrape) and sunﬂower [126]. The early\
    \ detection of broomrape\nby nondestructive techniques was unprecedented since\
    \ natural infestation causes subtle\nalterations on host physiology and proceeds\
    \ unnoticed until the emergence of the ﬂoral\nshoots, by the time of sunﬂower\
    \ bloom.\n2.2. Remote Sensing on Crop Fields\nIn crop ﬁelds, thermography has\
    \ facilitated the detailed analysis of crop ﬁelds affected\nby pathogens, helping\
    \ in the localization of areas where plants are infected and requiring\nurgent\
    \ intervention [127]. In general, pathogen-infected plants show changes in their\n\
    temperature of -2 K to +3.1 K, relative to the temperature of healthy plants;\
    \ however, it is\nworth noticing that these values should be handled with care\
    \ depending on the sensitivity\nand the accuracy of the used TIR cameras. The\
    \ identiﬁcation of potentially infected plants\nusing classiﬁers provides accuracies\
    \ ranging between 59 and 89%, depending on the\napplied algorithm and parameters\
    \ used to feed it.\nIn sugar beet, canopy temperature correlated signiﬁcantly\
    \ with the density of the\nnematode parasite H. schachtii in the case of a susceptible\
    \ cultivar, whereas no correlation\ncould be found for the resistant one [128].\
    \ P. syringae pv. actinidiae infection in kiwifruit\norchards was assessed by\
    \ TIR maps based on canopy temperature. Images revealed\nthat infected trees were\
    \ signiﬁcantly warmer than the healthy ones, being localized in\nthe outer canes\
    \ of the canopy [98]. Temperature increases measured on pines infected\nwith Dothistroma\
    \ septosporum (causal agent of red band needle blight) and on winter wheat\ninfected\
    \ with Zymoseptoria tritici (causing septoria leaf blotch) could be positively\
    \ correlated\nto the damages caused by these hemibiotrophic fungi [90,129]. Necrotic\
    \ spots on leaves\nfrom three woody trees (oriental cherry, Japanese cornel and\
    \ sawtooth oak) caused by three\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n9 of 21\nfungi (Mycosphaerella\
    \ cerasella, Elsinoe corni and Tubakia dryina, respectively) can also be\ndetected\
    \ as dots with higher temperatures relative to healthy areas [130].\nThe fusion\
    \ of thermography with other imaging techniques such as multi- or hyper-\nspectral\
    \ reﬂectance or chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging cameras is very often an adequate\n\
    approach for stress detection. The combination with chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging\
    \ al-\nlowed monitoring several constraints (fungal infection, galls and chewing\
    \ damages caused\nby arthropods) in understory hardwood saplings. Thus, changes\
    \ in transpiration could be\nrelated to photosynthesis impairment in affected\
    \ trees [131]. However, the combination\nof TIR imaging with multi- or hyper-spectroscopy\
    \ reﬂectance is more feasible since both\ntechniques are based on passive measurements.\
    \ Moreover, it is possible to obtain multi-\nple reﬂectance VIs that could correlate\
    \ with physiological parameters. Furthermore, VIs,\ntogether with temperature\
    \ derived parameters, could be implemented on algorithms to\nclassify plants into\
    \ categories of interest in the earliest stages of infection. That was the\ncase\
    \ of important bacterial diseases causing a high impact on both agriculture and\
    \ the envi-\nronment, such as citrus greening or Huanglongbing in citrus trees\
    \ [132], or Xylella fastidiosa,\na quarantine pathogen in olive orchards [133].\n\
    In the case of diseases caused by foliar fungal pathogens, the joint use of thermography\n\
    and reﬂectance made it possible to discriminate between severity levels. That\
    \ was the\ncase of red leaf blotch (caused by Polystigma amygdalinum) in almond\
    \ trees [134] and also\nearly and late leaf spot diseases (caused by Passalora\
    \ arachidicola S. Hori and Cercosporidium\npersonatum, respectively) on peanut\
    \ trees [135]. Minimum temperature corrected by air\ntemperature showed a negative\
    \ correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index\n(NDVI) in opium\
    \ poppy orchards infected by the oomycete Peronospora arborescens (causal\nagent\
    \ of downy mildew) [136]. Furthermore, a strong relationship between yield, several\n\
    VIs and canopy temperature was observed in maize plants suffering tar spot complex\n\
    (caused by Phyllachora maydis and Monographella maydis) [137], as well as in chickpea\n\
    infected with Ascochyta rabiei (causing Ascochyta blight disease) [138].\n∆T correlated\
    \ with disease severity caused by soilborne fungal pathogens, such as\nVerticillium\
    \ dahliae (causal agent of Verticillium wilt) in olive trees or R. necatrix in\
    \ avocado\ntrees. Moreover, classifying algorithms applied to the data obtained\
    \ by spectral and TIR\nimaging could identify affected trees with high accuracy\
    \ [120,139,140].\n3. Assessing of Plant Abiotic Stress by Thermography\nIn natural\
    \ environments, abiotic stress conditions often concur with biotic stresses,\n\
    making their evaluation difﬁcult. For this reason, it is important to understand\
    \ how abiotic\nconditions can affect vegetation. The successive sections will\
    \ review how thermography\nhas been applied to monitor crop water stress, salinity,\
    \ nutrient availability, and application\nof herbicides, among others, at proximal\
    \ and remote scales.\n3.1. Proximal Sensing on Growth Chambers and Greenhouses\n\
    Drought, which importance emerges from the damage caused and its extent, is con-\n\
    sequently one of the main abiotic stresses monitored by TIR imaging to help farmers\
    \ to\nestablish precise water management and scheduling [141]. Most of the studies\
    \ related to\ndrought stress have been conducted in crop ﬁelds, but it is possible\
    \ to ﬁnd some works\ncarried out on plants grown under controlled conditions (Table\
    \ 2). Furthermore, salinity\nis essentially water stress that results from the\
    \ osmotic effect of ions in the soil solution,\nreducing the water availability\
    \ for plants. In addition, ions can accumulate in plant leaves\nup to toxic concentrations\
    \ [142]. Thus, TIR imaging provides an opportunity to screen\nfor salinity tolerance\
    \ traits in a reliable, quantitative and efﬁcient manner. The effects of\ndifferent\
    \ abiotic stress factors on leaf temperature at proximal sensing are summarized\
    \ in\nTable 3. The increase in temperature registered in these works for infected\
    \ plants ranges\nfrom +1.5 to +6 K.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n10 of 21\nTable\

    \ +0.7 to +7 K between healthy and stressed\nplants have been reported in the\
    \ literature at a remote sensing scale. These alterations in\ncanopy temperature\
    \ allowed stress detection with accuracies up to 75% using classiﬁcatory\nalgorithms\
    \ based on TIR stress indices.\nVineyards under different water regimes are proposed\
    \ as an exemplary study model\nthanks to the geometry of orchards. Moreover, climate\
    \ change threatens the most important\nwine-producer countries worldwide, which\
    \ will suffer increased frequency and severity\nof drought periods. On the contrary,\
    \ ﬁne-tuning irrigation management during the grow-\ning season leads to a slight-to-moderate\
    \ water deﬁcit, which stimulates optimal grape\nquality without signiﬁcantly compromising\
    \ yield [47]. Many authors have monitored\nphysiological parameters related to\
    \ water balance by handheld devices and correlated\nthem with stress indices extracted\
    \ from TIR images (Table 2). They found that TIR imaging\ncan distinguish between\
    \ irrigated and non-irrigated canopies and even between different\ndeﬁcit irrigation\
    \ treatments. However, the relationship between TIR stress indices and\nphysiological\
    \ parameters was found to be stable throughout the season in some cases [47]\n\
    or, on the contrary, affected by the phenological stage or the varieties [49,158].\
    \ All these\nworks have used TIR ground-based cameras positioned (lateral or nadir)\
    \ or implemented\non UAVs. However, it is also possible to use TIR images from\
    \ Landsat-5 for irrigation\nmanagement purposes [159].\nAs the water demand for\
    \ agriculture is steadily increasing, exploring indices obtained\nby thermography\
    \ to evaluate drought stress in other crops different from vineyards also\nhas\
    \ been extensively addressed (Table 2). The efﬁciency of the VI named photochemical\n\
    reﬂectance index (PRI) as an indicator of water stress was evaluated by TIR imaging\
    \ in\nolive and peach orchards under different water regimes. It was found that\
    \ PRI showed a\nhigher correlation with ∆T and gs than other vegetation indices\
    \ [30,160]. Regarding the\nmonitoring of water regimes in crops using satellite\
    \ images, thermal images taken with\nASTER could distinguish between rain-fed\
    \ and artiﬁcially irrigated olive tree orchards [161].\nBased on these works,\
    \ it can be concluded that thermal information remotely obtained by\nTIR cameras,\
    \ alone or in combination with other imaging techniques, is robust enough to\n\
    estimate the water status of crops and to help farmers to establish an appropriate\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling for plantations. However, this conclusion should be taken\
    \ with caution since\nthere are exceptions to the rule. As an example, canopy\
    \ temperature in maize ﬁelds under\ndrought stress only partially reﬂected gas\
    \ exchange rates and grain yield, presumably as a\nconsequence of other alterations\
    \ caused by this stress factor in plants, such as impairments\nin photosynthesis\
    \ and partitioning rates or alterations in plant leaves and canopy structures\n\
    (leading to ﬂuctuations in energy absorption and/or dissipation) [162]. Moreover,\
    \ the use\nof TIR imaging to ﬁgure out biologically relevant traits constitutes\
    \ a challenge under\nﬂuctuating conditions, as recently reviewed by Vialet-Chabrand\
    \ and Lawson [75].\nIn addition to physiological variables related to the water\
    \ status of plants, production\nparameters such as grain yield could be evaluated\
    \ by thermography in cereals. That was\nthe case of spring barley [163], maize\
    \ [162] and wheat [61,164,165], where grain yield under\ndifferent water regimes\
    \ showed good correlations with TIR stress indices. CWSI is a good\npredictor\
    \ of garlic bulb biomass under different water availability levels [166]. Another\n\
    production parameter, the average fruit weight of mandarins “clementina de Nules”\
    \ at\nharvest, could also be correlated signiﬁcantly with canopy temperature when\
    \ different\nirrigation regimes were tested [32].\nRegarding the nutrient availability\
    \ in soils, wheat crops growing under higher nitrogen\nsupplies exhibited lower\
    \ canopy temperature (and thus, lower CWSI) than those that were\nnot treated\
    \ [167]. Kefauver et al. [168] compared different nitrogen treatments in three\n\
    barley varieties and elaborated a detailed correlation network of physiological\
    \ traits, TIR\nand other imaging data. Another common stress in crop ﬁelds is\
    \ low temperatures. TIR\nimaging has been applied to study frost resistance in\
    \ apple orchards. When the soil was\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n12 of 21\ndefrosted,\
    \ the whole tree froze starting from peripheral twigs, whereas when the soil was\n\
    frosted, the tree started to freeze from the trunk at the tree base [169].\n4.\
    \ Future Perspectives\nFor more sustainable agriculture, the development of tools\
    \ providing real-time in-\nformation on the health status of plants is highly\
    \ demanded, as well as on their physical\nand physiological interactions with\
    \ their micro- and macro-environment, from soil to\natmosphere. In this sense,\
    \ the progressive implementation of high-throughput analysis\nbased on imaging\
    \ sensors and big data have represented an outstanding innovation [72].\nAutomation\
    \ allows rapid evaluations of plants and crops, avoiding subjectivity associ-\n\
    ated with visual assessments, reducing the cost of labor and permitting more frequent\n\
    assessments on the same plants over time [21]. Indeed, thermography implemented\
    \ in\nhigh-throughput facilities is contributing to the development of next-generation\
    \ crops by\ncrop breeders. However, before thermal sensing is adopted as a routine\
    \ tool in agriculture\nand integrated into decision-making for a wide range of\
    \ users, further research is necessary\nto address current challenges of the technology\
    \ and interpretation of thermal data [13,76].\n4.1. Future Technical Development\
    \ of Thermography\nTIR cameras suffer from challenges common to sensors for image\
    \ acquisition. At the\nproximal sensor scale, the volume of plants that can be\
    \ monitored at the same time is a\nlimitation. On the other hand, standardized\
    \ environments of measurements at a short\ndistance from the target may complicate\
    \ the scale up to the ﬁeld. Indeed, at a remote\nsensing scale, atmospheric conditions\
    \ are challenging. Wind makes the crops move around\nor may destabilize UAVs affecting\
    \ the quality of images. Rain, fog, and other atmospheric\nfactors could delay\
    \ scheduled measurements. Even more, satellites could not cover the\nentire desired\
    \ area or do it when atmospheric conditions are inadequate, reducing their\ntime\
    \ resolution or even limiting the measurements during long periods in the rainy\
    \ seasons.\nOperational conditions of TIR cameras must be observed, whereas technical\
    \ features,\nsuch as sensitivity and accuracy, should be taken into consideration\
    \ when handling thermal\ndata to avoid misinterpretation of the results. Thermography\
    \ also needs corrections\nto the accuracy of leaf or canopy measurements via the\
    \ development of more accurate\ncomplementary measurements of atmospheric conditions\
    \ disturbing the temperature of\nthe vegetation. That would include wind speed\
    \ and reﬂection of solar radiation on canopy\nsurfaces, dependent on the intensity\
    \ and quality of light affected by weather conditions\non day ﬂights, as reviewed\
    \ in [15,80]. Particular attention must be paid to the spatial\nand temporal variations\
    \ in these factors during the actual measurement. Even though\nthe last generation\
    \ of thermal cameras can make corrections for relative humidity and\ntemperature\
    \ of the air, these atmospheric parameters should be taken into account for other\n\
    TIR sensors. These complementary measurements are needed to improve the quality\
    \ of\nthe thermal data and to help in interpreting thermal information [15]. The\
    \ use of current\nUAVs minimizes the time-of-measurement effects [76]. On the\
    \ other hand, ﬂight altitude\naffects the measurements due to thermal infrared\
    \ radiation attenuation by the atmosphere,\nrequiring some corrections [65]. Focal\
    \ length, related to the ﬂying altitude, is another\ntechnical feature to take\
    \ into consideration in airborne thermography [170]. Nonetheless,\nnanosatellites\
    \ and new generation satellites with increasingly higher time and spatial\nresolution\
    \ could be the future of remote sensing applied to agriculture [84].\nPublic datasets\
    \ are progressively gaining relevance in plant phenotyping, as in many\nother\
    \ research ﬁelds since they offer great opportunities for networking and collaboration.\n\
    However, comparing data with other researchers is limited by technical features.\
    \ A possible\nsolution for this issue would be the development of a system of\
    \ standardization (similar to\nthose issued by the International Commission on\
    \ Illumination, CIE) that could be adopted\nby the international community.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n13 of 21\n4.2. Strategies to Overcome the Intrinsic\
    \ Non-Speciﬁcity of Thermal Patterns\nThermography is a sensitive tool for plant\
    \ stress detection. However, alterations in leaf\nor canopy temperature are intrinsically\
    \ unspeciﬁc for the stressor. Indeed, on crop ﬁelds\nunder natural conditions,\
    \ plant diseases are often found concurrent with abiotic stresses.\nConsequently,\
    \ in terms of diagnosis, thermography must be used in combination with other\n\
    phenomics techniques with the aim of ﬁnding distinctive patterns that better explain\
    \ the\netiology of the disorder, thus helping to cut down potential causes of\
    \ disease. Appropriate\nmanagement and control of abiotic stress factors considering\
    \ the heterogeneities of the\nfarmed land appear mandatory to avoid misinterpretations\
    \ of the thermal imagery. For\nexample, in orchards, water management can be improved\
    \ by precise measurements of\nsoil humidity by thermography, as reviewed by [171].\
    \ Thus, an accurate diagnosis and\nquantiﬁcation of the extent and severity of\
    \ disease-related symptoms can only be achieved\nbased on a collection of inputs\
    \ such as the geological features and history of the farmed\nland or weather conditions\
    \ at the time of image collection.\nDeep learning is key in the process of turning\
    \ data into knowledge, particularly when\nthermography is integrated with other\
    \ imaging techniques in a multidimensional analysis,\nas recently reviewed by\
    \ [72]. Public accessibility and interoperability of datasets, from\nhigh-throughput\
    \ phenotyping platforms and satellites, promoted by cooperative initiatives\n\
    such as those funded by the International Plant Phenotyping Network (https://www.plant-\n\
    phenotyping.org), are contributing to develop the potential of plant phenotyping\
    \ [172].\n4.3. Uses of Plant Thermography for Agriculture in the Near Future\n\
    In recent years, huge investments have been made in plant phenotyping facilities\
    \ to\nsupport basic and applied research. Further work is needed to widen our\
    \ knowledge on\nplant physiology upon stress as well as developing improved stress\
    \ detection methods.\nFuture research should also address the development of more\
    \ general stress detection\nmethods, valid for a range of plant species and growth\
    \ conditions, including location,\nor even independent from those factors. The\
    \ contribution of thermography to precision\nagriculture should not be limited\
    \ to the detection of stress.\nThermography also appears as a very convenient\
    \ tool to study other aspects of plants\nthat are out of the scope of this review,\
    \ such as seeds vigor [173], investigations on circadian\nrhythms [174,175], the\
    \ effects of microgravity on plant physiology [176], interactions with\nplant-symbiotic\
    \ microorganisms [177–180], the impact of climate change in ecology [15],\nor\
    \ food industry [181]. Thermography is also a very relevant tool for screening\
    \ for mu-\ntants [182,183] and cultivars [21] with desirable phenotypes such as\
    \ pathogen resistance\nor improved performance upon certain abiotic stress conditions.\
    \ In summary, thermog-\nraphy implemented in high-throughput facilities is contributing\
    \ to the development of\nnext-generation crops by crop breeders.\n5. Concluding\
    \ Remarks\nThe huge collection of works applying thermography to plants and crops\
    \ shows that\nthis technique is overcoming inherent constraints, being able to\
    \ determine plant water\nstatus and to detect plant stress in a robust, reliable,\
    \ low-cost way. On one hand, TIR stress\nindices are often more reliable than\
    \ actual temperature values as they counteract the effects\nof ambient conditions\
    \ on the measurement, providing good correlations with physiological\nparameters\
    \ related to the plant water status. On the other hand, the combined use of\n\
    thermography with other imaging sensors and the application of big data tools\
    \ are an\nadvantageous approach that allows identifying stressed plants and even\
    \ evaluating the\nseverity of symptoms. In spite of this, more detailed studies\
    \ are needed to build a solid\nbase of knowledge applicable to practitioners.\
    \ Additionally, platforms based on imaging\ntechnologies should be developed to\
    \ cover the needs of a wide range of end-users.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n14\

    \a\nAbstract: Spectral-based vegetation indices (VI) have been shown to be good\
    \ proxies of grapevine\nstem water potential (Ψstem), assisting in irrigation\
    \ decision-making for commercial vineyards.\nHowever, VI-Ψstem correlations are\
    \ mostly reported at the leaf or canopy scales, using proximal\ncanopy-based sensors\
    \ or very-high-spatial resolution images derived from sensors mounted on small\n\
    airplanes or drones. Here, for the ﬁrst time, we take advantage of high-spatial\
    \ resolution (3-m)\nnear-daily images acquired from Planet’s nano-satellite constellation\
    \ to derive VI-Ψstem correlations\nat the vineyard scale. Weekly Ψstem was measured\
    \ along the growing season of 2017 in six vines\neach in 81 commercial vineyards\
    \ and in 60 pairs of grapevines in a 2.4 ha experimental vineyard in\nIsrael.\
    \ The Clip application programming interface (API), provided by Planet, and the\
    \ Google Earth\nEngine platform were used to derive spatially continuous time\
    \ series of four VIs—GNDVI, NDVI,\nEVI and SAVI—in the 82 vineyards. Results show\
    \ that per-week multivariable linear models using\nvariables extracted from VI\
    \ time series successfully tracked spatial variations in Ψstem across the\nexperimental\
    \ vineyard (Pearson’s-r = 0.45–0.84; N = 60). A simple linear regression model\
    \ enabled\nmonitoring seasonal changes in Ψstem along the growing season in the\
    \ vineyard (r = 0.80–0.82). Planet\nVIs and seasonal Ψstem data from the 82 vineyards\
    \ were used to derive a ‘global’ model for in-season\nmonitoring of Ψstem at the\
    \ vineyard-level (r = 0.78; RMSE = 18.5%; N = 970). The ‘global’ model,\nwhich\
    \ requires only a few VI variables extracted from Planet images, may be used for\
    \ real-time\nweekly assessment of Ψstem in Mediterranean vineyards, substantially\
    \ improving the efﬁciency of\nconventional in-ﬁeld monitoring efforts.\nKeywords:\

    \ irrigation strategy in vineyards aiming to achieve\nhigh-quality berries for\
    \ premium wine production [1]. However, to optimize grape quality and\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2018, 10, 1615; doi:10.3390/rs10101615\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n2 of 22\nproduction deﬁcit, irrigation should be\
    \ properly controlled. Proper irrigation management is also\ncompulsory to achieve\
    \ uniform quality of berries across the vineyard area. An effective method to\n\
    guide irrigation management of wine grapes is continuous spatial (across the vineyard)\
    \ and temporal\n(along the season) monitoring of grapevine water status [2]. Water\
    \ status is typically quantiﬁed by\nmeasuring vine stem water potential (Ψstem),\
    \ which provides an indication of the impact of soil water\ncontent on grapevine\
    \ water status [3]. To achieve an accurate picture of the water status variability\n\
    across the entire vineyard area, continuous Ψstem measurements are required from\
    \ as many vines as\npossible. This task requires substantial human resources,\
    \ making it time consuming.\nEmerging precision agriculture tools such as proximal\
    \ and remote sensing offer possible\nreplacement, or at least support, of conventional\
    \ in-ﬁeld monitoring techniques [4,5]. Proximal\nand remote sensing tools may\
    \ be used to provide the required information for irrigation management\ncontrol\
    \ [6], as well as to allow spatial consideration of irrigation needs across the\
    \ crop ﬁeld [7]. Remote\nand proximal sensing have been used for monitoring vegetation\
    \ dynamics [8] and processes including\nwater status [9–11], plant nutrient content\
    \ [12,13], plant diseases [14,15] and crop phenotyping [16].\nThe information\
    \ received from sensors mounted on drones or small airplanes can be applied to\
    \ develop\nsite-speciﬁc irrigation and other management decisions [17]. Thermal\
    \ sensors mounted on airplanes\nor drones may provide information on plant water\
    \ status through the use of the crop water stress\nindex [18–20]. Crop water stress\
    \ index (CWSI), which is based on crop canopy temperature [21], has\nbeen recognized\
    \ as a reliable index for monitoring in-ﬁeld water status variability within a\
    \ vineyard\narea [22–25]. CWSI has been shown to correlate with Ψstem, though\
    \ typically displaying different\ncorrelations for different dates along the season\
    \ [26,27].\nAnother approach is to use vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spectral\
    \ bands as proxies\nfor water status parameters and/or yield production. For example,\
    \ Espinoza et al. [28], found that\nthe normalized difference vegetation index\
    \ (NDVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation\nindex (GNDVI) derived\
    \ from very-high-spatial resolution images (2.6 cm) were both correlated with\n\
    pre-harvest leaf stomatal conductance (gs; r = 0.56 and 0.65, respectively) and\
    \ yield production\n(r = 0.68 and 0.73, respectively) in a cabernet sauvignon\
    \ vineyard near Benton City, Washington.\nBaluja et al. [22] found strong correlations\
    \ of spectral-based vegetation indices such as, GNDVI,\nNDVI and the modiﬁed simple\
    \ ratio (MSR) with gs (r = 0.84, 0.87 and 0.88, respectively) and Ψstem\n(r =\
    \ 0.76, 0.82 and 0.81, respectively) using images acquired from an unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicle in a\ncommercial rain-fed tempranillo vineyard in Spain. Their results\
    \ imply that VIs can serve as good\nwater stress indicators in vineyards when\
    \ using very-high-spatial resolution images (10 cm) that\nallow the extraction\
    \ of pure canopy pixels. As expected, they also found high correlations of thermal\n\
    data with gs and Ψstem; however, the correlation changed along the season [22],\
    \ meaning that a\nper-date calibration should be derived in order to provide recommendations\
    \ for irrigation scheduling\nthroughout the season.\nZarco-Tejada et al. [29]\
    \ proposed a normalized photochemical reﬂectance index (PRInorm) using a\ncombination\
    \ of the re-normalized difference vegetation index (RDVI), which is sensitive\
    \ to canopy\nstructure, and a red edge index, sensitive to chlorophyll content\
    \ (R700/R670), to detect xanthophyll\npigment changes and normalize for leaf area\
    \ and chlorophyll content level reduction induced by water\nstress. They found\
    \ that PRInorm was highly correlated with midday gs (r = 0.89) and leaf water\
    \ potential\n(ΨLeaf; r = 0.88) in an experimental pinot noir vineyard in California.\
    \ Lower correlations were also\nobtained with original PRI (r = 0.72 and 0.7,\
    \ respectively) and NDVI (r = 0.57 and 0.62, respectively) [29].\nUsing leaf-level\
    \ spectroradiometer measurements, Rodríguez et al. [30] and Maimaitiyiming et\
    \ al. [31]\nshowed that water status parameters such as equivalent water thickness\
    \ (EWT), ΨLeaf, Ψstem and gs\ncan be derived from spectral-based VIs in vineyards.\n\
    Though promising, most of these studies (including some not mentioned here) are\
    \ conducted\nat the leaf-level or make use of sensors mounted on small airplanes\
    \ or drones, offering a limited\nmonitoring technique in terms of coverage area.\
    \ The ﬁnancial cost of ground or aerial sensing can\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n\
    3 of 22\nhardly allow their application on a daily basis. Also, historically,\
    \ the satellite spatial and/or temporal\nresolution has been too coarse for in-ﬁeld\
    \ water status monitoring [32].\nA constellation of nano-satellites (using a large\
    \ number of small compact satellites at the same\ntime) was recently suggested\
    \ to overcome this spatio-temporal limitation [33]. Planet [34] is an example\n\
    of such a company operating a large number of CubeSat 3U form (10 × 10 × 30 cm)\
    \ nano-satellites,\nproviding daily images with 4 wavebands (RGB + NIR) at a high\
    \ spatial resolution of 3 m since\nearly 2016.\nIn this study, we make use of\
    \ the high spatio-temporal resolution images provided by Planet to\ncompare four\
    \ different VIs with midday Ψstem measured weekly along the growing season of\
    \ 2017 in\n81 commercial vineyards and in one experimental vineyard (Mevo Beitar)\
    \ in Israel. We examine the\nuse of simple regression and multivariable linear\
    \ models, with several VI-based metrics extracted from\nthe VI time series, to\
    \ predict spatio-temporal variability in Ψstem along the growing season. The main\n\
    goal is to provide a high-resolution satellite remote sensing tool to support\
    \ real-time deﬁcit irrigation\nmanagement in high-quality commercial vineyards.\n\
    2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. The Study Region\nOur study was undertaken over\
    \ 81 commercial vineyards and one experimental vineyard in Israel\nduring the\
    \ 2017 growing season. The study targeted three regions, Judea, Upper Galilee,\
    \ and Golan\nHeights, located in hilly areas in the central and northern parts\
    \ of Israel (approximately 110 km apart;\nFigure 1a) in which grapevines are grown\
    \ in small commercial vineyards for premium high-quality\nwine production. All\
    \ of the vineyards were subjected to a Mediterranean climate, characterized by\n\
    rainfall limited to the mild winter months and hot dry summers.\nFigure 1. (a)\
    \ Location of the three regions with the 82 vineyards used in this study shown\
    \ on a Google\nEarth map, and (b) aerial photograph of the experimental vineyard\
    \ at Mevo Beitar in the Judea region\n(location marked with a red star in (a).\
    \ The 60 plots at Mevo Beitar vineyard in which stem water\npotential (Ψstem)\
    \ was measured in two grapevines per-plot along the 2017 growing season is shown\n\
    in (b).\nIn the Golan Heights region, vineyards typically consisted of cabernet\
    \ sauvignon (32%), merlot\n(16%) and other red and white species (Table A1). Located\
    \ at elevations of 600–1120 m above sea level\n(m.a.s.l.), these vineyards receive\
    \ a mean annual rainfall amount of c. 800 mm y−1. The minimum and\nmaximum mean\
    \ air temperatures in this region during 2017 were −5.6 ◦C and 34.3 ◦C for January\
    \ and\nAugust, respectively.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n4 of 22\nIn the Upper\
    \ Galilee, vineyards consisted of cabernet sauvignon (22%), chardonnay (17%) and\n\
    other red and white species (Table A1), which were grown at elevations of 710–830\
    \ m.a.s.l. The mean\nannual rainfall amount in the Upper Galilee region is 670\
    \ mm y−1, with minimum and maximum\nmean air temperatures of −0.6 ◦C and 33.8\
    \ ◦C for January and August 2017, respectively.\nIn the Judea region, vineyards\
    \ mainly consisted of merlot (40%), cabernet sauvignon (22%) and\nother red species\
    \ (Table A1). Vineyards are typically located at elevation of 600–740 m.a.s.l.,\
    \ receiving a\nmean annual rainfall amount of c. 535 mm y−1. Minimum and maximum\
    \ mean air temperatures in\nthis region were 2 ◦C and 38.2 ◦C for January and\
    \ August 2017, respectively.\n2.2. Characteristics of the Vineyards and Irrigation\
    \ Strategy\nVine spacing in the 82 vineyards was at most 1.5 m × 3 m. Soils are\
    \ quite homogenous in the\nGolan vineyards, consisting mainly of brown alluvial\
    \ soils in the northern vineyards and peat soils in\nthe southern vineyards. In\
    \ Galilee and Judea vineyards, soils are much more heterogeneous, consisting\n\
    mainly of basaltic and brown terra rossa soils.\nThe Mevo Beitar experimental\
    \ vineyard, located within the Judea region (31◦43′ N; 35◦06′ E;\nred star in\
    \ Figure 1a), covers a total area of 2.4 hectares. The average elevation of the\
    \ vineyard\narea is 700 m.a.s.l. Grapevines (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon)\
    \ were planted in 2011 in\na northwest-to-southeast direction with a vine and\
    \ row spacing of 1.5 m and 3.0 m, respectively\n(Figure 1b). The height of the\
    \ canopy typically varies between 2.0 m and 2.5 m.\nIrrigation in the 82 vineyards\
    \ was through a surface drip irrigation system using unilateral\ncordons trained\
    \ to vertical shoot positioning (VSP) on a 2-m-high two-wire trellis system. The\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol unit was set manually to be as close as possible to the\
    \ agricultural standard practice [2,35].\nThe irrigation strategy used in the\
    \ vineyards is of deﬁcit irrigation based on ETo (reference\nevapotranspiration)\
    \ information provided by the Israel Meteorological Service (IMS) from a nearest\n\
    IMS station to the vineyard. In practice, irrigation was applied approximately\
    \ once a week, with a\ndaily amount that ranged between 0.8 and 1.43 mm per day\
    \ in Mevo Beitar. Deﬁcit irrigation started\non DOY 131 (DI start; Figure 2) and\
    \ was applied throughout the season until EOS. DI ranged along the\nseason between\
    \ 14% and 25% of the vine evapotranspiration (ETc) [2], while ETc was calculated\
    \ from a\nmodiﬁed leaf area index to crop coefﬁcient ratio for vines [36,37].\n\
    Figure 2. Daily time series of the four vegetation indices and weekly measured\
    \ midday stem water\npotential (Ψstem) along the grapevine growing season at Mevo\
    \ Beitar (VIs are averaged values over all\npixels within the vineyard area).\
    \ Important phenological stages are shown (Pre—the pre-season period\nwhen vines\
    \ are leaﬂess and understory vegetation is absent or dry; SOS—start of season,\
    \ coincident\nwith budburst stage; POS—peak of season, corresponding to full bloom\
    \ stage; EOS—end of season,\nthe harvest stage). DI start is the date when deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation started (DOY 131). Horizontal grey bar\nindicates the period of expansive\
    \ presence of understory weeds and grasses in the vineyard.\nRemote Sens. 2018,\
    \ 10, 1615\n5 of 22\nOther speciﬁc characteristics of the 81 commercial vineyards\
    \ are summarized in Table A1.\n2.3. Measurements of Midday Stem Water Potential\
    \ in Vineyards\nMeasurements of Ψstem were conducted periodically by a team of\
    \ agronomists hired by the\ngrowers, approximately once a week in six grapevines\
    \ per vineyard in each of the 81 commercial\nvineyards throughout the 2017 growing\
    \ season. Ψstem was measured prior to irrigation at solar noon\n(from 12:00 to\
    \ 14:30), using a portable pressure chamber (model Arimad 2, Kfar Charuv, Israel\
    \ and\nArimad 3000, MRC, Hulon, Israel) according to the procedures described\
    \ in [38]. Six sunlit, mature,\nfully expanded leaves from each vineyard were\
    \ double bagged (plastic bags covered with aluminum\nfoil) 1.5 h prior to measurement.\
    \ The leaves were disconnected from the vines by sharp cutting of the\nleaf petiole\
    \ and quickly placed in the pressure chamber. The time elapsing between leaf excision\
    \ and\nchamber pressurization was less than 25 s. The six grapevines were selected\
    \ by visual observation as\nrepresentative of the entire vineyard.\nAt the experimental\
    \ vineyard in Mevo Beitar (Figure 1a, Figure A1), we measured Ψstem in 60\nplots\
    \ (c. 5 m2 each) approximately every week during the 2017 growing season in order\
    \ to monitor\nthe spatial variability in Ψstem across the vineyard area. Each\
    \ plot contained two grapevines (total\nN = 120 vines), from which 4 leaves were\
    \ taken for Ψstem measurements. The Ψstem measurements in\nMevo Beitar were conducted\
    \ using a portable pressure chamber (Arimad 3000, MRC, Hulon, Israel), as\ndescribed\
    \ above.\n2.4. Vegetation Indices\nWe used four VIs in this study: the enhanced\
    \ vegetation index (EVI), the soil-adjusted vegetation\nindex (SAVI), and the\
    \ abovementioned GNDVI and NDVI. These four VIs, as many others, are based\non\
    \ the ratio of solar reﬂection at the visible bands (RGB) to that at the near\
    \ infrared (NIR) waveband\n(Table 1). The four VIs used here are regularly used\
    \ in studies for tracking changes in plant-related\ntraits, such as leaf growth\
    \ (e.g., leaf area index), transpiration and evapotranspiration, as well as CO2\n\
    uptake and aboveground biomass from optical sensors mounted on unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles and/or\nsatellites [9,17,39–42] (see also Box 1 in [32]).\nOf the four\
    \ VIs, NDVI is the most widely used [32]. Although NDVI has some saturation issues\n\
    over dense vegetation [43], it was shown to be very reliable in monitoring vegetation\
    \ dynamics,\nparticularly in natural [8] and agricultural [16] Mediterranean vegetation\
    \ systems. GNDVI, which\nis quite similar to NDVI, with the difference being that\
    \ it uses the green instead of the red band\n(Table 1), is considered to be more\
    \ sensitive to changes in chlorophyll-a concentrations compared to\nNDVI [44,45].\
    \ EVI and SAVI were both designed to overcome the saturation drawbacks in NDVI\n\
    and GNDVI [43,46]. With a canopy background adjustment factor, both indices are\
    \ considered to be\nefﬁcient in terms of reducing soil background effects, with\
    \ SAVI apparently being the most effective in\nthat sense [43].\nThe four VIs\
    \ were derived using the four spectral bands provided by Planet’s images following\n\
    the formulations given in Table 1.\nTable 1. Formulation and source of the four\

    \ Stages\nWe deﬁned here three main phenological stages, which may be observed\
    \ through changes in the\nVI time series (Figure 2). The three stages are: start\
    \ of season (SOS), which corresponds to the time\nwhen the vines started their\
    \ growth around DOY 80–90 (budburst stage), approximately one month\nprior to\
    \ the start of the irrigation; peak of season (POS), when the canopy of the vines\
    \ reached their\nfull capacity (around DOY 120–140; full bloom stage); and end\
    \ of season (EOS), around DOY 240–250,\nthe harvest stage.\nExpansive understory\
    \ presence in the form of volunteer weeds and grasses occurs in Israeli\nvineyards\
    \ around DOY 50–85 prior to SOS (see in Mevo Beitar vineyard; Figure 2). This\
    \ understory\nvegetation was treated with herbicide in most of the Galilee vineyards\
    \ and mechanically removed at\nthe end of the spring in the Golan vineyards and\
    \ in most of the vineyards in the Judea region.\nFinally, pre-growth season (Pre)\
    \ was deﬁned here as the time when green vegetation (including\nunderstory weeds\
    \ and grasses) is absent or dry in the vineyard, at approximately DOY 30 (Figure\
    \ 2).\n2.6. Satellite Data\n2.6.1. Planet Satellites\nPlanet [34] is a commercial\
    \ company running a constellation of small, standardized CubeSat 3U\nform factor\
    \ (10 × 10 × 30 cm) nano-satellites of approximately 4 kg in mass. Planet currently\
    \ operates\nmore than 175 of the so-called ‘Doves’ PlanetScope (PS) nano-satellites,\
    \ providing unprecedented daily\nnadir-pointing high-resolution land surface imaging\
    \ of the entire earth. Planet’s PS satellites provide\nimages at a spatial resolution\
    \ of 3 m (nadir ground sampling distance) in four spectral bands (RGB and\nNIR),\
    \ with an equatorial overpass time of 9:30–11:30 a.m. (local time) [33], sometimes\
    \ even three times\na day (i.e., from different Doves). Planet Team currently\
    \ provides a series of application programming\ninterface (API) tools, such as\
    \ Clips API [49].\nIn this study, a total of 3015 clipped PlanetScope Ortho Tiles\
    \ were downloaded for 2017 using the\nClips API for the vineyard areas within\
    \ the three regions of interest (Figure 1a). Tiles were downloaded\nas TIFFs,\
    \ often including several ﬁles for a speciﬁc date with also missing images in\
    \ some dates due to\ncloudy conditions (<10% missing data). Figure A1 shows a\
    \ true RGB color Planet image of Mevo Beitar\nvineyard alongside the plots where\
    \ Ψstem were measured (see Section 2.3), for comparison of scales.\n2.6.2. Building\
    \ Time Series of Planet’s Vegetation Indices in Google Earth Engine\nWe used Google\
    \ Earth Engine (GEE; https://earthengine.google.com/), which is a freely available\n\
    cloud-based geospatial processing platform that combines a large catalog of satellite\
    \ imagery and\ngeospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities\
    \ [50]. All downloaded PS-clipped TIFFs,\nas well as the shapeﬁle vector layers\
    \ of the 82 vineyards (i.e., polygons), were uploaded as image- and\nfeature collections\
    \ to GEE. Then, GEE JavaScript API was used to: (1) calculate the four vegetation\n\
    indices (VIs) for all images; (2) merge the number of images to a single image\
    \ per date using a\nmaximum value criteria (i.e., creating an image mosaic by\
    \ selecting the maximum value for each pixel\nfrom all available images for that\
    \ day) [43]. In this way, noisy data caused by cloud contamination\nand/or sensor\
    \ view uncertainties were eliminated from the image; (3) generate time series\
    \ of the four\nVIs; (4) calculate the time series of the averaged VI over the\
    \ entire area of the vineyard (i.e., over all\npixels within the vineyard area),\
    \ for the 82 vineyards, and for the 60 plots within the vineyard area of\nMevo\
    \ Beitar (Figure 1b).\n2.6.3. Time Series Analysis\nTo further eliminate noisy\
    \ data in the time series, smoothing techniques are usually applied [32].\nHowever,\
    \ these techniques need the time series to be complete or at least have a predeﬁned\
    \ seasonal\nsignal [51]. Because we aim at predicting Ψstem from VIs without having\
    \ prior information on the\nseasonal behavior of the vineyard, conventional smoothing\
    \ techniques could not be used. Instead,\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n7 of 22\n\
    we adopted a simple weekly average approach similar to a moving average on a complete\
    \ time\nseries to eliminate noisy data. We calculated the weekly average VI value\
    \ (VI avg) for each vineyard.\nIn addition, for the time series analysis the maximum\
    \ and minimum VI values in each week were\nextracted (VI max and VI min, respectively).\
    \ To further eliminate noise of background signal related to\nsoil and/or understory\
    \ vegetation, the VI avg was scaled by dividing it by the VI avg value at POS.\n\
    Another important variable used in the time series analysis is ∆VI, which is deﬁned\
    \ as the\ndifference between the VI avg at POS and that at Pre, when green vegetation\
    \ is absent in the vineyard.\nThis ∆VI represents the difference in fractional\
    \ vegetation cover between the two periods due to\nleaf expansion and canopy development\
    \ of the vines. This means that vineyards with vines of less\ndeveloped canopies\
    \ will display a small ∆VI compared to those with more developed canopies.\nBecause\
    \ Ψstem is from the vines and VI is a mixed signal from vines and background signal,\
    \ we would\nexpect a negative correlation between ∆VI and the slope of the VI–Ψstem\
    \ relationship, meaning a\nweak VI response (steeper slope) to seasonal variations\
    \ in Ψstem, in vineyards with small ∆VI (less\ndeveloped canopies).\n2.7. Statistical\
    \ Analysis\nThree models were tested in this study:\n1.\nA multivariable linear\
    \ model with ﬁve variables (VI avg, VI max, VI min, ∆VI and day of year)\nwas\
    \ used to predict weekly Ψstem (one model per week) in Mevo Beitar vineyard (hereafter,\n\
    MB-Mult model).\n2.\nA single linear regression model was used in Mevo Beitar\
    \ to predict Ψstem from VIs for the\nentire season using the VI time series (hereafter,\
    \ MB-Reg model).\n3.\nA single ‘global’ multivariable linear model with the same\
    \ variables as in MB-Mult was used\nto predict seasonal Ψstem from VI time series\
    \ of the 81 commercial vineyards (hereafter,\nGlobal-Mult).\nIn Global-Mult, variables\
    \ from all four VIs were ﬁrst used in a single multivariable model with a\ntotal\
    \ of 20 variables, ﬁve variables per VI. Then, to avoid multicollinearity issues\
    \ in the model only the\nstatistically signiﬁcant variables (p < 0.05) with the\
    \ highest size effect in the model were maintained,\none VI per variable (total\
    \ of ﬁve variables). The Global-Mult with the ﬁve variables was then used to\n\
    predict Ψstem in the experimental vineyard of Mevo Beitar, comparing it with MB-Mult\
    \ and MB-Reg.\nIt should be noted that in MB-Mult and Global-Mult, the values\
    \ of the variables change along the\nseason, while the value of ∆VI remains the\
    \ same.\nPearson’s r of the correlation, coefﬁcient of determination (R2), and\
    \ root square mean error (RMSE)\nwere used as measures of model performance and\
    \ to compare between the models. The size effect\nof each variable in Global-Mult,\
    \ which is the effectiveness of the variable in predicting Ψstem, is\npresented\
    \ as LogWorth, deﬁned as −log10(p-value). The larger the LogWorth, the stronger\
    \ is the effect\nof the variable in the model. All statistical analyses were carried\
    \ out using JMP® software version 14.0\n(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).\n\
    3. Results\n3.1. Deriving Midday Stem Water Potential for Mevo Beitar Vineyard\n\
    Figure 2 shows daily time series of the four vegetation indices alongside the\
    \ Ψstem, while both VI\nand Ψstem were averaged over the entire vineyard area\
    \ at Mevo Beitar. In general, all four VIs showed\na decreasing trend similar\
    \ to that of the Ψstem consequential to soil water depletion and increasing\n\
    atmospheric demand for evapotranspiration. The inherent soil-background reduction\
    \ capacity of SAVI\nis well noted in Figure 2, displaying the lowest values in\
    \ comparison to the other three VIs (GNDVI,\nNDVI and EVI).\nRemote Sens. 2018,\
    \ 10, 1615\n8 of 22\nLow VIs values in DOYs 30–50 (Pre stage) are related mainly\
    \ to soil background and dry\nunderstory vegetation. Peak VI at POS is from the\
    \ fully developed canopies of the vines at this\ntime of the season, at the start\
    \ of the irrigation.\nMB-Reg was signiﬁcant for all four VIs (p < 0.01), with\
    \ r = 0.80–0.82 (Figure 3). High VI values\nwere generally associated with less\
    \ negative Ψstem at the time when DI started, while low VI values\nwere associated\
    \ with more negative Ψstem, reﬂecting the water stress condition of the vines\
    \ towards\nEOS (DOY 245).\nFigure 3. The correlation between the time series of\
    \ VI avg and the measured Ψstem in Mevo Beitar\nvineyard. Regressions presented\
    \ are for the four VIs: (a) GNDVI, (b) NDVI, (c) EVI and (d) SAVI.\nShaded band\
    \ indicates 99% conﬁdence intervals for the regression line.\nTable 2 summarizes\
    \ the statistics of MB-Mult for the four VIs. Here, again, SAVI showed a better\n\
    performance than the other three indices, likely due to its higher capacity in\
    \ reducing soil background\neffects. GNDVI, NDVI and EVI show quite similar r\
    \ scores, with NDVI showing a slightly better\nperformance than GNDVI and EVI\
    \ (Table 2). The highest r scores were mostly obtained from DOY 189\ntowards EOS\
    \ (DOY 245), although with a generally higher RMSE as well.\nWith the exception\
    \ of one week (DOY 168), models were generally statistically signiﬁcant along\
    \ the\nseason with an average r score > 0.64 (Table 2). It should be noted, though,\
    \ that the week corresponding\nto DOY 168 was particularly cloudy, which likely\
    \ affected Planet-derived VI and consequently the\nMB-Mult models in this particular\
    \ week.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n9 of 22\nTable 2. Statistics of the per-week\

    \ maps of Ψstem in Mevo Beitar vineyard from MB-Mult using SAVI\nfor selected\
    \ dates. The spatial pattern of Ψstem varies throughout the growing season (Figure\
    \ 4). Ψstem\nin DOY 154 was relatively high across the vineyard compared to other\
    \ dates because of the DI start in\nDOY 131 (Figure 2) and the relatively lower\
    \ atmospheric demand compared to the following weeks.\nFigure 5 shows the difference\
    \ (∆Ψ) between the Ψstem derived from MB-Reg and MB-Mult\n(both using SAVI). ∆Ψ\
    \ in Figure 5 was calculated as the absolute Ψstem value from MB-Reg minus\nthe\
    \ absolute Ψstem value from MB-Mult. Thus, blue colors indicate lower values of\
    \ Ψstem (more\nstressed) in MB-Reg than in MB-Mult, while red colors mean that\
    \ Ψstem was higher (less stressed) in\nMB-Reg than in MB-Mult. Most of the maps\
    \ in Figure 5 show a uniform distribution of ∆Ψ across the\nvineyard, which means\
    \ that MB-Reg was able to reproduce the spatial variability in Ψstem close to\
    \ that\npredicted by MB-Mult, though with some differences in magnitude. Yet,\
    \ at both ends of the growing\nseason, before and after the DI start (DOY 126\
    \ and 245), ∆Ψ across the vineyard shows a signiﬁcant\nspatial variability.\n\
    These results indicate that the measures from both models are consistent with\
    \ one another for\nmuch of the season. Thus, for irrigation management, either\
    \ approach could be used to monitor relative\ndifference (spatial variability)\
    \ within the ﬁeld at Mevo Beitar, to the extent that such information could\n\
    be used to improve the efﬁciency of ground operations.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10,\

    \ from MB-Mult and MB-Reg, both using\nSAVI (∆Ψ). ∆Ψ is the absolute Ψstem value\
    \ from MB-Reg minus the absolute Ψstem value from\nMB-Mult; therefore, blue color\
    \ indicates a lower Ψstem value (more stressed) in MB-Reg compared\nto MB-Mult,\
    \ while red color indicates a higher Ψstem value (less stressed) in MB-Reg compared\
    \ to\nMB-Mult.\n3.2. Vegetation Indices and Stem Water Potential in Vineyards\
    \ across Rainfall Gradient\nThe Pearson’s r of the VI-Ψstem linear ﬁt using all\
    \ data from the 82 vineyards together was positive\nand signiﬁcant (p < 0.001),\
    \ with 0.58 < r < 0.68 for the four VIs (Figure 6). Once again, SAVI was\ndemonstrated\
    \ to be the most successful index in tracking seasonal changes in Ψstem in the\
    \ 82 vineyards\n(Figure 6d).\nThe per-vineyard Pearson’s r of the VI-Ψstem linear\
    \ ﬁts ranged between 0.72 and 0.97, with an\naverage r of 0.85 ± 0.06 (Figure\
    \ 7). Linear ﬁts, though, differed between vineyards in terms of intercept\nand\
    \ particularly in slope (Figures 6 and 7).\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n12 of\
    \ 22\nFigure 6. Linear relationships between Planet-derived VI avg: (a) GNDVI,\

    \ four VIs. Error bars denote ±1σ. Mevo Beitar vineyard is indicated\nin red.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n13 of 22\nBackground effects of soil and/or understory\
    \ vegetation were likely responsible for the different\nslopes of the linear ﬁts\
    \ (Figures 6 and 7). Vineyards with a large background effect had more\npronounced\
    \ slopes, meaning weak VI response to seasonal changes in Ψstem. This background\n\
    effect may be noted as a negative correlation between ∆VI and the slope of the\
    \ VIs-Ψstem linear ﬁt in\nFigure 8.\nFigure 8. The relationship between the ∆VI\
    \ and the slope of the VI-Ψstem linear ﬁt in the 82 vineyards.\nNotice that a\
    \ larger slope signiﬁes weaker response of VI to increasing stress (i.e., to decreasing\
    \ Ψstem).\nFigure 8 shows that for vineyards with a small ∆VI (weak VI response\
    \ to Ψstem change), or, in\nother words, with grapevines of less developed canopies\
    \ and thus a larger background effect, the slope\nof the VIs-Ψstem linear ﬁt was\
    \ steeper than for vineyards with a large ∆VI. This suggests that ∆VI is\nan important\
    \ variable in predicting Ψstem and may assist in distinguishing between vineyards\
    \ with\ndifferent levels of background effect.\nThe performance of each of the\
    \ four VIs in a multivariable regression model (one model per\nVI) was quite similar\
    \ (r = 0.76, for the four VIs), with a slight improvement (r = 0.78; RMSE = 18.5%;\n\
    Figure 9) when using variables from different VIs in Global-Mult (Table 3). Global-Mult,\
    \ though,\nwas a signiﬁcant improvement over the simple linear regression model\
    \ used with the VI time series\n(0.58 < r < 0.68, Figure 6).\nRemote Sens. 2018,\

    \ is shown to reproduce seasonal changes in observed Ψstem at Mevo Beitar with\n\
    a fairly high accuracy (R2 = 0.84; RMSE = 0.12; bias = 0.07, Figure 10a,c), at\
    \ least as good as the\nsite-speciﬁc models of MB-Reg (R2 = 0.84; RMSE = 0.11;\
    \ bias = −0.02, Figure 10a,b) and MB-Mult\n(Figure 10a). Thus, Global-Mult appears\
    \ to present a useful tool for seasonal (weekly) predictions of\nΨstem in Mediterranean\
    \ vineyards.\n4. Discussion\nManagement of spatial variability within a vineyard\
    \ can increase proﬁts signiﬁcantly by allowing\noptimization of yield quantity\
    \ and quality [52,53]. Technologies and methodologies are currently being\ndeveloped\
    \ to allow variable-rate irrigation in drip irrigated vineyards and orchards [54,55].\
    \ Since the\ncurrent state of the art for irrigation decision-making uses time-\
    \ and labor-consuming measurement of\nΨstem [2,35,36,56], remote sensing methodologies\
    \ successfully acting as stem water potential proxies\nhave particular appeal.\
    \ That said, there remains a challenge in ﬁnding remotely acquired data that:\
    \ (a)\nhas sufﬁciently reliable correlation with Ψstem, (b) is affordable and\
    \ accessible, and (c) has both high\nspatial and temporal resolution, each of\
    \ which are necessary in order for the method to be useful for\nhigh frequency\
    \ irrigation scheduling.\nThis study showed a signiﬁcant correlation between vegetation\
    \ indices derived from\nhigh-resolution Planet images (3-m) and Ψstem in Mediterranean\
    \ (Israel) vineyards. Previous studies\nhave shown that CWSI and NIR-based indices,\
    \ like GNDVI and NDVI, may be good indicators of\nwater status in grapevines through\
    \ correlations with leaf stomatal conductance (gs) and water potential\n(ΨLeaf\
    \ and Ψstem). However, these relationships were mostly observed at the canopy-\
    \ [22,28,29] or\nleaf [30,31] levels using manual spectroradiometers or sensors\
    \ mounted on small airplanes and drones.\nAs far as the authors are aware, this\
    \ is the ﬁrst study that shows such a relationship using images of\ncoarser spatial\
    \ resolution acquired from satellites, and more speciﬁcally from Planet nano-satellites.\n\
    One of the main challenges when using satellite information is the spatial resolution\
    \ of the\nimages, which is often coarser than the targeted object and may induce\
    \ a mixed-pixel signal effect. For\nexample, understory vegetation was shown to\
    \ affect satellite spectral signals in complex vegetation\nsystems comprised of\
    \ multi-canopy layers [32]. The multi-canopy layer, vertical mixed-pixel effect\
    \ was\nfurther corroborated in a simulation model by Chen et al. [57], implying\
    \ that understory vegetation\nmay signiﬁcantly affect satellite signals. In our\
    \ case, understory expansion reaches its maximum at\n~DOY 60, while vines budburst\
    \ occurs later at DOY 80–90. Background effect in the vineyards, which\nmay include\
    \ the signal from soil and/or understory vegetation, was observed through a different\n\
    VI-Ψstem linear ﬁt in terms of magnitude of slope (slope ranged between 0.5 and\
    \ 2), meaning that some\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1615\n16 of 22\nvineyards experienced\
    \ weak VI response to seasonal changes in Ψstem, while others experienced a\n\
    stronger response to Ψstem changes. This differential response is due to the fact\
    \ that in vineyards with\ngrapevines of more developed canopies, and consequently\
    \ less exposed understory cover seen from\nthe satellite, the VI signal is mostly\
    \ coming from the vines while in vineyards with less developed\nvines much of\
    \ the VI signal comes from the ground.\nTo overcome this mixed-pixel effect, we\
    \ used the difference between the VI signal at the POS,\nwhich corresponded mainly\
    \ to the grapevines, and that of the understory derived at the Pre (∆VI).\nThat\
    \ way, background effects were eliminated allowing vineyards with diverse soil\
    \ and understory\nvegetation characteristics to be compared and used in a single\
    \ ‘global’ model. Results from the\nGlobal-Mult model showed that ∆NDVI had a\
    \ signiﬁcant size effect, being a key factor in predicting\nΨstem, with only day\
    \ of year having a stronger size effect and SAVI avg a similar effect (Table 3).\n\
    In Mevo Beitar, a highly variable vineyard, weekly based correlations (Pearson’s\
    \ r) of GNDVI,\nNDVI, EVI and SAVI vs. Ψstem were within the range of 0.28–0.84,\
    \ with an average value of 0.65 for all\nindices (Table 2). These results were\
    \ quite similar to previously reported VI-Ψstem correlations found\nby others\
    \ using very-high-resolution images [22,29]. When time series were used in the\
    \ regression\ninstead of date-speciﬁc data, correlations were even higher (0.80\
    \ < r < 0.82). A simple linear regression\nmodel (MB-Reg) was sufﬁcient to reproduce\
    \ temporal, as well as spatial variations in Ψstem in the\nexperimental vineyard.\n\
    In general, correlations from simple speciﬁc-date regressions between vegetation\
    \ indices and Ψstem\nwere also high for the 81 commercial vineyards (r = 0.72–0.97;\
    \ Figure 7), implying that Planet-derived\ntime series of vegetation indices like,\
    \ GNDVI, NDVI, EVI and SAVI may be good indicators of water\nstatus at the vineyard-scale\
    \ level.\nFinally, the Global-Mult model with spectral-based indices derived from\
    \ Planet satellites was\nproposed to predict Ψstem in Mediterranean vineyards.\
    \ After deriving ∆NDVI, SAVI avg, NDVI max\nand NDVI min of a speciﬁc vineyard\
    \ a real-time Ψstem estimation may be provided for that vineyard at\na weekly\
    \ basis. The Global-Mult shows promise in improving the efﬁciency of in-ﬁeld conventional\n\
    monitoring efforts.\n5. Conclusions\nThe relationship between stem water potential\
    \ and vegetation indices was evaluated in\nMediterranean vineyards through the\
    \ use of high spatial resolution Planet nano-satellite imaging\non the freely\
    \ available GEE cloud computing system for the ﬁrst time. Using JavaScript API\
    \ in GEE\nallowed fast computation of the derivation of time series of vegetation\
    \ indices for the area of the 82\nvineyards, showing potentials for real-time\
    \ monitoring in small-size agricultural ﬁelds.\nThe four vegetation indices tested\
    \ in this study (GNDVI, NDVI, EVI and SAVI) showed signiﬁcant\ncorrelation with\
    \ stem water potential, with SAVI displaying a slightly better performance, likely\
    \ due\nto its capacity for reducing soil effects. Correlations using of the four\
    \ vegetation indices were high for\nmeasurements across the vineyard area (0.89\
    \ < r < 0.82 for MB-Reg and 0.64 < r < 0.67 for MB-Mult)\nand along the season\
    \ (r = 0.92 for both MB-Reg and Global-Mult), allowing predictions of stem water\n\
    potential variability in space and time.\nA method to reduce the background effect\
    \ of understory vegetation and soil, which accounts for\nthe fractional cover\
    \ of the vines, was also presented. The fractional cover of the vines was retrieved\
    \ as\nthe difference in the value of the vegetation index at the peak of season\
    \ and prior to the appearance\nof green vegetation in the vineyard (∆VI). This\
    \ ∆VI, was negatively correlated with the slope of the\nvegetation index to stem\
    \ water potential relationship, meaning that vineyards with a low fractional\n\
    cover have weak VI response to changes in measured stem water potential. Using\
    \ the ∆VI allowed the\ndevelopment of a ‘global’ multivariable model for predicting\
    \ stem water potential in vineyards with\ndifferent background (soil and understory\
    \ presence) characteristics.\nOverall, the approach presented here shows promise\
    \ in exploiting these technologies, which\ninclude resolving the mixed-pixel problem\
    \ in agricultural as well as in the ecological monitoring of\nRemote Sens. 2018,\
    \ 10, 1615\n17 of 22\nnatural vegetation systems from satellites. The tools developed\
    \ here, i.e., the combination of Planet\nimages and GEE platform, with the aforementioned\
    \ mixed-pixel separation approach, may be also\nused for water status monitoring\
    \ of agricultural ﬁelds other than vineyards.\nFinally, pending further veriﬁcation\
    \ and validation, the proposed ‘global’ model presented here\nmay be used for\
    \ real-time irrigation management along the season from the abovementioned weekly\n\
    values extracted using daily Planet images. Using the ‘global’ model could substantially\
    \ improve\nsampling efﬁciency of conventional water status monitoring. The methodology\
    \ developed in this\nstudy should be further examined with supporting information\
    \ on soil texture, LAI/fractional cover\nand understory vegetation. Moreover,\
    \ a comparison with freely available satellite images like those\nfrom Sentinel-2,\
    \ which have coarser spatial (10–20 m) and temporal (5 day) resolution than Planet,\n\
    should be conducted.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, D.H. and Y.C.;\

    This paper presents a method for mapping water stress in a maize field using hyperspectral
    remote sensing imagery. An airborne survey using AISA (Specim, Finland) was performed
    in July 2008 over an experimental farm in Italy. Hyperspectral data were acquired
    over a maize field with three different irrigation regimes. An intensive field
    campaign was also conducted concurrently with imagery acquisition to measure relative
    leaf water content (RWC), active chlorophyll fluorescence (ΔF/ ), leaf temperature
    (Tl) and Leaf Area Index (LAI). The analysis of the field data showed that at
    the time of the airborne overpass the maize plots with irrigation deficits were
    experiencing a moderate water stress, affecting the plant physiological status
    (ΔF/ , difference between Tl and air temperature (Tair), and RWC) but not the
    canopy structure (LAI). Among the different Vegetation Indices (VIs) computed
    from the airborne imagery the Photochemical Reflectance Index computed using the
    reflectance at 570 nm as the reference band (PRI570) showed the strongest relationships
    with ΔF/ (r2 = 0.76), Tl − Tair (r2 = 0.82) and RWC (r2 = 0.64) and the red-edge
    Chlorophyll Index (CIred-edge) with LAI (r2 = 0.64). Thus PRI has been proven
    to be related to water stress at early stages, before structural changes occurred.
    A method based on an ordinal logit regression model was proposed to map water
    stress classes based on airborne hyperspectral imagery. PRI570 showed the highest
    performances when fitted against water stress classes, identified by the irrigation
    amounts applied in the field, and was therefore used to map water stress in the
    maize field. This study proves the feasibility of mapping stress classes using
    hyperspectral indices and demonstrates the potential applicability of remote sensing
    data in precision agriculture for optimizing irrigation management. Previous article

    1. Introduction In modern management of agricultural resources, there is an increasing
    interest in the development of systems to balance crop production with energy
    supply and sustainability of the farming system in order to increase the productivity,
    optimize the profitability, and protect the environment. The assessment of water
    status in crops is particularly important for precision irrigation practices,
    since water deficit stress is considered one of the main factors limiting photosynthesis
    and plant primary productivity (Boyer, 1982, Chaves et al., 2003). Maize (Zea
    mays, L.) is one of the major crops throughout the world (Leff et al., 2004),
    and it is the main crop in the Po Plain (Northern Italy), the largest and most
    intensive agricultural area in Italy. Maize has high irrigation requirements (Musick
    and Dusek, 1980). The decrease in summer rainfall predicted in the Mediterranean
    region (IPCC, 2007) may enhance water stress for this crop and limit its productivity.
    In this context, the development of methods for accurate irrigation scheduling
    and control aimed to achieve an optimum water supply for productivity and to maximize
    the water-use efficiency has an increasing importance (Li et al., 2009). Remote
    sensing has high potential in providing timely information on crop conditions
    during the growing season over large areas, and it can be used in conjunction
    with crop models for predicting crop yields (Beeri and Peled, 2009). In the last
    decades, a number of studies has shown that Vegetation Indices (VIs) obtained
    from hyperspectral remote sensing data can be used to derive variables related
    to plant status, such as the concentration of foliar pigments (Haboudane et al.,
    2002, Main et al., 2011, Panigada et al., 2010, Rossini et al., 2006, Vincini
    et al., 2008), nitrogen concentration (Fava et al., 2009, Stroppiana et al., 2009,
    Stroppiana et al., 2011), water content (Colombo et al., 2008, Colombo et al.,
    2011), Leaf Area Index (LAI) (Darvishzadeh et al., 2011, Rossini et al., 2012)
    and biomass (Fava et al., 2009, Fava et al., 2010). Moreover, vegetation physiological
    responses during the stress development can be monitored remotely by investigating
    how the light energy harvested by a plant is used (Meroni et al., 2009). Under
    water stress conditions, plants are often exposed to more radiant energy than
    is needed for photosynthesis. In such conditions the absorbed light exceeds the
    photosynthetic demand and is dissipated by plants as chlorophyll fluorescence
    and heat to avoid light-induced oxidative damage. Photochemistry, chlorophyll
    fluorescence and heat dissipation occur in competition (Papageorgiou and Govindjee,
    2004); hence, variations of the yield of chlorophyll fluorescence and heat dissipation
    have been exploited to detect stress-induced variations in photosystem II (PSII)
    efficiency (Flexas et al., 2004). Water stress also induces stomatal closure,
    which reduces the transpiration rate, thus decreasing evaporative cooling and
    increasing leaf temperature. For this reason canopy thermal imagery can provide
    information on the instantaneous canopy transpiration rate at the time of image
    acquisition, allowing the detection of vegetation stress before the symptoms are
    visible (Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran et al., 2012). Starting from the 1970s a number of
    studies has shown the great potential of thermal imagery for pre-visual stress
    detection (Idso, 1982, Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2006, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012).
    However, the main drawback that hampers the use of thermal imagery for water stress
    detection in the context of precision agriculture is the limited availability
    of high spatial resolution thermal sensors due to technical limitations of microbolometer
    technology. Thus, alternative and/or complementary remotely sensed stress indicators
    based on the visible and near-infrared spectral regions have been investigated.
    The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has been proposed (Gamon et al., 1992)
    to track changes in the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments,
    related to heat dissipation. Several previous studies investigated the feasibility
    of using PRI to track photosynthesis changes at leaf and canopy level caused by
    oxidative stress conditions with varying degrees of success (Gerosa et al., 2009,
    Meroni et al., 2008, Naumann et al., 2008, Naumann et al., 2010, Panigada et al.,
    2009, Peguero-Pina et al., 2008, Römer et al., 2012). Much work to date has been
    done using ground-based measurements at the leaf and canopy scale driven by the
    need to (i) understand the link between PRI and the plant status; (ii) to investigate
    the chances to detect PRI variations at larger scale using airborne or satellite
    platforms. At leaf level, a number of studies have shown the ability of PRI to
    detect water stress conditions (Peñuelas et al., 1997, Shahenshah et al., 2010,
    Thenot et al., 2002, Winkel et al., 2002) while other authors reported poorer
    results due to confounding environmental factors such as the ambient light conditions
    (Sarlikioti et al., 2010), structural changes due to severe wilting (Peñuelas
    et al., 1994) or contemporary changes in leaf pigment contents (Sun et al., 2008).
    At canopy level, additional effects such as canopy structure, canopy cover and
    viewing geometry have to be taken into account. Using in situ canopy measurements,
    Evain et al. (2004) showed that water stress detection was possible using PRI
    in grapevine before the drought was so severe to cause structural canopy variations
    due to wilting. In the same kind of canopy, Dobrowski et al. (2005) argued that
    the variability in carotenoid/chlorophyll ratios hampered the possibility to use
    PRI to monitor water stress development. Only a limited number of studies have
    focused on the use of PRI from remote sensing imagery to detect early stages of
    water stress in support to agricultural management practices (Stagakis et al.,
    2012, Suárez et al., 2008, Suárez et al., 2009, Suárez et al., 2010, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012). These studies investigated the use of PRI as an indicator of pre-visual
    water stress from airborne imagery. Due to the multitude of possible confounding
    factors affecting PRI at landscape scale, a general agreement on the possibility
    of using PRI as an early indicator of water stress has not been yet achieved.
    Further research is needed to investigate the feasibility of using PRI to support
    agricultural management systems providing consistent, timely and repeatable information
    over large areas. This study is intended to evaluate the potential for using airborne
    hyperspectral imagery for the early detection of water stress in a maize field.
    The specific objectives of this work aimed at: (i) the assessment of the response
    of widely used vegetation biochemical and biophysical parameters (chlorophyll
    fluorescence, leaf temperature, leaf water content and LAI) to increasing levels
    of water stress; (ii) the analysis of the relationship between VIs computed from
    AISA (Specim, Finland) airborne images and field measured maize properties; and
    (iii) the evaluation of a new method to map water stress classes based on airborne
    hyperspectral imagery. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental area and field
    campaigns The investigated area is located within the “Vittorio Tadini” experimental
    farm in Northern Italy (Gariga di Podenzano, PC – 44° 59′ 00″ N, 9° 41′ 01″ E,
    70 m a.s.l.). Maize was sown on 28 April 2008 (DOY 119) on a 2000 m2 (0.2 ha)
    area. The experimental design was a split-plot with four replications. The treatment
    design was a three by two factorial arrangement, with water treatment being the
    whole-plot treatment and N rate the split-plot treatment. Plot size varied from
    60 m2 to 120 m2 with 0.7 m row spacing and row orientation north–south. Nitrogen
    fertilization was carried out at sowing distributing 60 kg ha−1 of N on all plots
    in the form of Urea. An additional dose of 60 kg ha−1 of N was distributed manually
    on randomized plots immediately before the passage of the hoeing machine, for
    mechanical weed control, resulting in 12 plots treated with 60 kg ha−1 of N (hereafter
    called N0) and 12 plots treated with 120 kg ha−1 of N (hereafter called N1). Both
    the 12 N0 and 12 N1 plots received three different water treatments (4 N0 and
    4 N1 plots each) consisting of non-irrigated, 35% crop evapotranspiration (ETc)
    replacement (35 ETc) and 70% ETc replacement (70 ETc). ETc was computed from Penman–Monteith
    reference crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficients for maize (Allen et al.,
    1998). Water was distributed with drip irrigation using a piping system at low
    pressure with a device for volume control. The irrigation time and application
    amounts (mm) are shown in Fig. 1 together with precipitation (mm) and minimum
    and maximum air temperature (Tair) measured with a WatchDog 2900ET weather station
    adjacent to the field trial. Due to need of acquiring measurements as contemporary
    as possible to the time of the overflight, field measurements have been limited
    to 12 N1 plots. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download : Download

    air temperature (Tmax, °C); precipitation (mm) and irrigation application amounts
    (mm) in 35 and in 70 ETc plots from the date of sowing (28th April, DOY 119) until
    the AISA overpass (25th July, DOY 207). Dashed lines indicate the dates of field
    data collection (DOY 192 and 207). Two field campaigns were conducted over the
    experimental field: one 15 days before the airborne image acquisition (10th July
    2008, DOY 192) and the second one concurrently with the image acquisition (25th
    July 2008, DOY 207). On DOY 192 male floral organs were flowering (heading growth
    stage according to the extended BBCH (Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt
    and CHemical industry) scale (Lancashire et al., 1991)), while on DOY 207 maize
    plants were at the end of the flowering stage. These dates were therefore chosen
    to evaluate water stress because maize is more sensitive to drought stress during
    flowering, pollination and initial seed filling, than in the early vegetative
    stage (Prasad et al., 2008). The application of different irrigation treatments
    started on DOY 189. Only 0.7 mm precipitation fell between the two field campaigns,
    allowing a good differentiation of the water amounts applied in this period on
    non-irrigated (0.7 mm), 35 ETc (33.9 mm) and 70 ETc (59 mm) plots. The minimum
    and maximum Tair were similar on DOY 192 and 207. 2.2. Field data collection Leaf
    water content, active chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf temperature and LAI measurements
    were collected on 12 N1 plots to track the effects of water stress on crop condition
    and functioning. Furthermore, soil water content was measured at each sampling
    date by gravimetric method: soil samples from two different depths (0–20 and 20–40
    cm) were collected in each plot. The soil samples were weighted before and after
    oven drying at 90 °C. The soil water content (SWC, %) was estimated as percentage
    of wet soil weight. In the following analyses, for each plot the average of the
    SWC measured at the two depths will be considered. 2.2.1. Leaf sampling and water
    content measurements Leaf sampling was conducted on six maize plants for each
    plot with the collection of the youngest fully expanded leaf from each plant,
    for a total of 72 leaf samples. Samples were enclosed in a sealed plastic bag
    and kept in a cooler at 5 °C until they reached the laboratory. Leaf disks having
    an area of 3.80 cm2 were cut from each leaf using a cork borer. Fresh weight was
    recorded using an analytical balance, after which the leaf disks were immersed
    for 72 h in distilled water, blotted and weighed (turgid weight). Finally, leaf
    disks were dried at 80 °C in an oven, until constant weight (dry weight) was reached.
    Leaf RWC was calculated for each disk using the standard equation reported in
    Colombo et al. (2011). 2.2.2. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf temperature
    measurements Efficiency of light reactions of photosynthesis were measured on
    the level of single leaves using the miniaturized Fluorescence Yield Analyzer
    (Mini-PAM) (H. Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) with a leaf clip holder described by
    Bilger et al. (1995). On DOY 192, measurements were conducted at 12:00 local solar
    time on 72 leaves per water treatment. Contemporary to the AISA overpass, fluorescence
    measurements were still conducted on 72 leaves per treatment but four times during
    the day: at 8:00, 10:00, 12:00 and 14:00 local solar time to evaluate the diurnal
    cycle of leaf variables. The steady-state value of fluorescence (Ft) was measured
    under incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) conditions and a saturating
    light pulse (800 ms duration, intensity ∼4000 μmol m−2 s−1) was superimposed on
    the prevailing environmental light levels to measure the maximum light adapted
    fluorescence yield ( ). The effective quantum yield of PS II (ΔF/ ), reflecting
    the fraction of light utilized in PSII photochemistry at a given light intensity,
    was then calculated as (  − Ft)/ . For each measurement, temperature of the lower
    leaf side (Tl) and incident PPFD were also recorded with a small NiCrNi thermocouple
    and a miniaturized calibrated quantum sensor, respectively. The difference between
    Tl and air temperature (Tair) was chosen as useful indicator of water stress because
    it provides the gradient for the flow of sensible heat toward or away from a vegetal
    surface, regulated by leaf evapotranspiration (Sumayao et al., 1980). Positive
    values of Tl − Tair correspond to flow of sensible heat away from the leaf, indicating
    a reduction of transpiration rates due to water stress. 2.2.3. LAI and yield measurements
    On DOY 192 and 207, the LAI value was estimated from gap fraction measurements
    collected with the LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (Li-Cor, Inc.). Gap fraction
    measurements were acquired under diffuse radiation conditions, at sunset, using
    two separate inter-calibrated sensor units. The LAI-2000 field of view was limited
    with a 90° view-cap, to minimize the influence of the operator and of the adjacent
    plots. A single LAI value for each plot was then calculated by averaging four
    samples collected on a diagonal transect across the crop rows. LAI was computed
    excluding the fifth ring (67° midpoints), in order to reduce multiple scattering
    effects (Weiss et al., 2004). The exclusion of the fifth ring diminishes the radius
    of the sensor view area to approximately 1.6 times the canopy height. Harvesting
    was carried out on DOY 248 at dough maturity. Three maize rows per plot (4 m2)
    were harvested with a single-row chopper pulled by a tractor. Fresh weight was
    measured directly on-field with a balance mounted on the chopper. Then, maize
    samples were dried at 70 °C in an oven, until constant weight (dry weight) was
    reached to estimate the dry matter yield (t ha−1) of each plot. 2.3. Airborne
    hyperspectral imagery acquisitions and processing techniques Hyperspectral images
    were acquired on DOY 207 with the AISA Eagle (Specim, Finland) sensor covering
    the visible and near-infrared spectral region (wavelength range, 400–992 nm) with
    126 spectral bands with a full width at half maximum of 4.6 nm. The flight was
    conducted at an average altitude of 1200 m above ground level by the National
    Institute for Oceanography and Applied Geophysics (OGS). With an instantaneous
    field of view of 0.68 mrad, the pixel size of AISA data was approximately 0.84
    m and it was resampled to 1 m. The airborne image over the study area was acquired
    around 11.30 a.m. local solar time with the flight path oriented along the principal
    solar plane to minimize directional reflectance effects in the across-track direction.
    AISA data were geometrically corrected using CALIGEO software (Specim, Finland).
    The position of the plots was geo-located by means of a high precision differential
    global positioning system Trimble Geo-XT (Trimble, California, USA). AISA data
    were atmospherically corrected with the empirical line method (Smith and Milton,
    1999). Measurements of ground reflectance for the AISA atmospheric correction
    were made contemporary to the overpass on 12 different targets (black and white
    reference panels, asphalt, gravel, bare soils and vegetated surfaces) with an
    ASD FieldSpec FR Pro spectroradiometer (Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder,
    CO, USA). An empirical relationship between at-sensor radiance (μW cm−2 sr−1 nm−1)
    and surface reflectance of spatially homogenous targets within the image was established
    for each of the 126 AISA spectral channels. Mean reflectance values were extracted
    from a 3 × 3 pixels area (9 m2) located on AISA images in correspondence of the
    12 maize plots (4 per treatment). The mean reflectance spectrum for each water
    treatment is shown in Fig. 2. Several optical indices were calculated from mean
    reflectances (Table 1). Download : Download high-res image (53KB) Download : Download

    the Modified Triangular Vegetation Index 2 (MTVI2) (Haboudane et al., 2004), the
    green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIg) (Gitelson et al., 1996),
    the red-edge Chlorophyll Index (CIred-edge) (Gitelson et al., 2003, Gitelson et

    normalized by the Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) (TCARI/OSAVI)
    (Haboudane et al., 2002), the Water Index (WI) (Peñuelas et al., 1993) and the
    Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) (Gamon et al., 1992). These indices were
    designed to be sensitive to different canopy properties: NDVI, SR and NDVIg are
    expected to track changes in LAI, biomass and canopy structure, MTVI2 has been
    demonstrated to be sensitive to green LAI in maize canopies, minimizing the effects
    of chlorophyll variations, CIred-edge has been shown to be an accurate measure
    of maize chlorophyll concentration (Ciganda et al., 2009), TCARI/OSAVI has been
    shown to be sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and resistant to variations
    in soil background and leaf area index in crops (Haboudane et al., 2002, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2004), and WI and the ratio WI/NDVI sense leaf water content. Finally,
    PRI, originally developed for the detection of changes in the xanthophyll epoxidation
    state, was calculated to assess its relationship with photosynthetic efficiency.
    Different PRI reference bands proposed in previous studies to minimize structural
    effects (Hernández-Clemente et al., 2011) were tested. The reference AISA band
    closest to the original VI formulation was chosen. 2.4. Statistical analysis The
    effect of the irrigation treatment on the field measured variables (i.e. RWC,
    ΔF/ and Tl − Tair) was tested with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) with water
    treatment as the main effect, followed by the Tukey test. When the assumptions
    of ANOVA (i.e., independence, Gaussian distribution and homogeneity of variance)
    were not met (i.e. SWC, LAI and yield) the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test
    was performed. The average VI values (3 × 3 pixel areas) were related to the average
    RWC, ΔF/ , Tl − Tair and LAI of each of the 12 plots using linear regression.
    In order to produce a water stress map based on spectral indices computed from
    AISA data, an ordinal logit regression analysis between VIs and water stress classes
    was used. Categorical classes were defined as the irrigation level applied. Eqs.
    (1), (2), (3) were then applied to compute the probability (P) of a pixel of given
    VI belonging to water stress class 0 (non-irrigated plots), 1 (35 ETc plots) and
    2 (70 ETc plots), respectively: (1) (2) (3) where Z is a latent continuous variable
    defined as the product between VI and the regression coefficient (−β) and δi are
    the thresholds between the water stress classes with 1 < i < N (N = number of
    classes − 1). The performance of the models was evaluated with the Chi-square
    goodness-of-fit test. The equations of the best performing VI were then used to
    produce a water stress map by assigning each maize pixel to the class of water
    stress with the highest probability of occurrence. For mapping purposes the equations
    were applied on the whole maize field, including N0 plots, to qualitatively evaluate
    the robustness of the method proposed in this study against variations in the
    rate of N fertilization applied on the different plots. 3. Results 3.1. Seasonal
    and diurnal variability of field data The temporal evolution of leaf physiological
    measurements was assessed comparing measurements acquired at midday. The application
    of different irrigation amounts showed a progressive differentiation of SWC through
    the experiment. On DOY 192, the non-irrigated plots had a significantly lower
    SWC than plots 35 ETc and 70 ETc (Fig. 3(a)). On DOY 207, during the AISA overpass,
    SWC was statistically different between the three treatments. Differences in water
    availability affected physiological and biochemical properties with different
    temporal dynamics: on DOY 192 only ΔF/ and Tl − Tair showed significant differences
    between water treatments (Fig. 3(b) and (c)), while on DOY 207 also leaf RWC was
    affected. ΔF/ had significantly lower and Tl − Tair significantly higher values
    in plants with lower water-supply levels (non-irrigated) on DOY 192. Differences
    increased on DOY 207, with statistically significant differences between the three
    treatments. Download : Download high-res image (260KB) Download : Download full-size

    at midday, (d) relative leaf water content (RWC) (%), (e) Leaf Area Index (LAI)
    (m2 m−2) and (f) yield (t ha−1) at harvest of different water treatments. SWC,
    LAI and yield were analyzed with the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test; ΔF/ ,
    Tl and RWC were tested with the analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test.
    The results of the tests are evidenced by letters on the plots. Statistically
    different (p < 0.05) means are designated with different letters. Differences
    in RWC between water treatments became significant on DOY 207. RWC in 70 ETc plant
    leaves remained quite stable between the two sampling dates while on DOY 207 it
    had significantly lower values in 35 ETc and non-irrigated plants compared to
    70 ETc plants (Fig. 3(d)). Looking at the correlations between leaf traits measured
    in this study, a positive correlation was found between RWC and ΔF/ (r = 0.81,
    p < 0.001) and a negative correlation between RWC and Tl − Tair (r = −0.82, p
    < 0.001) and between ΔF/ and Tl − Tair (r = −0.98, p < 0.001). Concerning the
    structural canopy characteristics, LAI was not statistically correlated with any
    of the measured leaf traits and had similar values in all the plots analyzed.
    It was around 4.0 m2 m−2 on DOY 192 and slightly higher on DOY 207 (Fig. 3(e)).
    Finally, lower water treatments applied in this study resulted in a reduction
    of maize yield at harvest of 11% and 27% in 35 ETc and non-irrigated plots, respectively,
    compared to 70 ETc plots. The diurnal leaf measurements collected on DOY 207 with
    the mini-PAM fluorometer on attached leaves of non-irrigated, 35 ETc and 70 ETc
    plants (Fig. 4(a)) showed lower ΔF/ for the non-irrigated plants. The diurnal
    course showed greater ΔF/ differences at noon than in early morning and afternoon.
    It is worth noting that in 35 and 70 ETc plants, in the afternoon ΔF/ returned
    to the morning values, following inversely the evolution of incident PPFD. In
    non-irrigated plots, plants were not able to recover at the end of the day, showing
    a lower ΔF/ value in the afternoon than in the morning for a similar PPFD level.

    photon flux density and (b) mean difference between Tl and Tair. The three water
    treatments are indicated with different styles (n = 72 per treatment at each measuring
    time; error bars are the standard error). The Tukey test was performed on each
    time separately and the results are evidenced by letters on the plots. Statistically
    significant differences among treatments are indicated by different letters. The
    time course of Tl − Tair (Fig. 4(b)) showed that differences between treatments
    increased during the day. Significant thermal differences between irrigation treatments
    could be identified at midday and during the afternoon (12:00 and 14:00 solar
    local time), showing higher values for non-irrigated plants, followed by 35 ETc
    and 70 ETc, respectively. Thus, differences between treatments were maximum at
    midday during the AISA overpass for both parameters. 3.2. Modeling water stress
    from airborne data The correlations between indices of the same group were generally
    highly statistically significant (Table 2). For example, the greenness indices
    used in this study were highly correlated to each other (p < 0.001 in all cases).
    The same results were observed between indices belonging to the water content
    group (p < 0.001). The indices related to chlorophyll content were related between
    them with a slightly lower statistically significance (p < 0.01). Within the light
    use efficiency indices tested in this study, three of them were highly related
    (i.e. PRI570, PRI512 and PRI600), while PRI670 had lower correlation coefficients.
    Apart from the expected correlation within indices of the same group, a correlation
    existed in most cases also between indices belonging to different groups. Greenness
    indices were related (p < 0.001) with chlorophyll and water indices and the PRI
    formulations using a reference band in the red region (i.e. PRI600 and PRI670).
    PRI570 and PRI512 showed a lower correlation with both greenness and water indices
    and one of the index designed to be sensitive to chlorophyll content (CIred-edge).
    PRI570 and PRI512 were best related to the chlorophyll index TCARI/OSAVI (r =
    −0.84; p < 0.01). Table 2. Relationships between hyperspectral indices calculated

    linear regression analysis between VIs and RWC, ΔF/ , Tl − Tair, and LAI are reported
    in Table 3. The best relationship with RWC, ΔF/ and Tl − Tair was found for PRI570
    (r2 = 0.65, 0.76 and 0.82, p < 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 5(a)–(c)), followed
    by TCARI/OSAVI. CIred-edge was instead the VI that best explained the spatial
    variability of LAI (r2 = 0.64, p < 0.01) (Fig. 5(c)). This result is in agreement
    with previous studies (Nguy-Robertson et al., 2012) showing that indices designed
    to be sensitive to chlorophyll content allow accurately estimation of green LAI
    in maize when LAI is greater than 2 m2 m−2. Table 3. Coefficient of determination

    and lower frequency (29–31%) of pixels mapped as slightly or moderately stressed.
    Rain-fed plots (non-irrigated) showed instead a high frequency of pixels mapped
    as moderately stressed (50%) and a very low frequency (<20%) as non-stressed.
    35 ETc plots showed instead a similar frequency for each water stress class (from

    imposed in this experiment caused a moderate water-deficit stress on both non-irrigated
    and 35 ETc plots, appreciable as a decline of the photosynthetic efficiency (early
    stress symptom) on DOY 207 (Fig. 3). Plants exposed to low levels of irrigation
    initially (DOY 192) responded with stomatal closure, detected by an increase in
    Tl − Tair, as well as down regulation of PSII activity, detected by a decrease
    in ΔF/ , to safely dissipate excess excitation energy. When water-deficit stress
    develops, osmotic adjustment may prevent the imminent dehydration of leaf cells
    for some time, thus not immediately affecting turgor pressure and the RWC. However,
    if plants cannot cope with water deficit stress any longer, they will become dehydrated
    and thus lose leaf cell turgor pressure (Chaves et al., 2003, Major and Johnsen,
    2001). The decrease in leaf cell turgor was detected as a reduction of leaf RWC
    on DOY 207. The water treatments imposed in this experiment were not severe and
    they did not cause variations in canopy structure, confirmed by the similar LAI
    values between treatments. This is well suited for evaluating the potential of
    airborne hyperspectral data for operational precision farming applications, as
    early detection of stress symptoms would be a key requirement. Water treatments
    affected leaf physiological processes in a different way during the day. ΔF/ showed
    a diurnal evolution that generally mirrored that of PPFD. The decrease in PPFD
    after noon did not lead to an increase in ΔF/ in non-irrigated plants indicating
    an afternoon photoinhibition of photosynthesis (Bunce, 1990). The diurnal course
    of Tl − Tair is strongly related to water relations and in particular to the regulation
    of stomatal aperture (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013). In well-watered conditions,
    Tl − Tair decreased as the day advanced due to the increased evaporative demand
    causing the transpiration rate to increase too. Conversely, in stressed plants
    Tl − Tair increased from early morning to noon, presumably indicating that leaves
    were reducing their transpiration rates by reducing stomatal opening. As a consequence,
    the magnitude of Tl − Tair was greater in non-irrigated plants, in particular
    during the afternoon. Differences between the three treatments were statistically
    significant from the midday sampling on for both ΔF/ and Tl − Tair, confirming
    the suitability of planning the aerial survey at this time of the day. A flight
    close to solar noon was preferred to achieve an optimal sun-sensor configuration
    (lower solar zenith angle). PRI570 was the index best related to all the indicators
    of water stress measured in this study: photosynthetic efficiency, but also RWC
    and Tl − Tair. This can be explained by the functional correlation between these
    three eco-physiological indicators of water stress as, with the onset of water
    stress, RWC decreases, stomata close and Tl − Tair increases concurrently with
    a decline of photosynthesis (Prasad et al., 2008). PRI512, proposed in recent
    studies to minimize structural effects (Hernández-Clemente et al., 2011, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012), showed weaker correlations with all the leaf physiological indicators
    tested in this study. On the contrary the good performances of PRI570 in estimating
    leaf physiological changes in response to increasing water deficits confirmed
    the good correlations between PRI570 and canopy temperature obtained throughout
    an entire season in orchards subjected to different water treatments (Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012). This study was conducted when maize plants were at the end of the
    flowering stage, which is known to be more sensitive to drought stress than the
    early vegetative stage (Prasad et al., 2008). On this date, the plot LAI ranged
    between 3 and 6 m2 m−2, so varying soil background was not a major confounding
    factor on the PRI signal (Barton and North, 2001, Suárez et al., 2008). Furthermore
    the lack of a relation between PRI570 and LAI (Table 2) strengthened the confidence
    in readily using PRI as an early indicator of water stress in homogeneous canopies
    under similar structural conditions. However the significant correlation (p <
    0.01) observed between PRI570 and TCARI/OSAVI suggests that potential changes
    in chlorophyll and carotenoid concentration as a function of water stress may
    also have a role on the PRI570 variations (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). Thus, the
    extrapolation of this method to monitor the evolution of water stress during the
    whole maize growing cycle requires further studies on the effects of variations
    of pigment content, canopy LAI and fractional cover caused by plant growth. This
    can be accomplished by simulating the vegetation optical properties through radiative
    transfer (RT) models. However RT models require a demanding parameterization of
    the leaf and canopy parameters, extensive computational costs and long development
    time (Malenovský et al., 2009), hampering their use in an operational context.
    Another interesting result that requires attention is related to the detailed
    information about the intra-plot variability provided by the water stress map.
    The produced map (Fig. 6) in fact allowed tracking the different irrigation levels
    applied at plot level and at the same time identifying the intra-plot variability
    in plant conditions. This variability in plant responses to water stress can be
    explained with differences in soil water content and rooting depth. With the higher
    irrigation level, plants can theoretically meet 70% of their potential actual
    evapo-transpiration. As water started to be deprived, there were some plants that
    became stressed first and this can cause a flatter distribution of pixels within
    the three water stress classes. The Northern block showed generally higher water
    stress levels than the other three blocks, with high frequency of class 0 pixels
    also in 70 ETc plots. In this block, plants experienced some growth limitations
    confirmed also by lower ΔF/ and LAI values compared to the other blocks. This
    effect can be explained by the natural variability of soil properties causing
    an unequal capability of soil to retain humidity for a given amount of irrigation.
    However, 70 ETc plots showed a higher frequency of pixels belonging to class 2
    than the treatments with lower water supplies. The higher degree of water stress
    experienced in the Northern block was also manifested as a generally higher heterogeneity
    within all the plots. This suggests that the water stress map derived from PRI570
    allows tracking the spatial variability either due to intrinsic differences from
    plant to plant or differences in water availability due to heterogeneous soil
    characteristics. Few studies have been already published regarding the relationship
    between PRI derived from airborne hyperspectral images and physiological indicators
    widely used to detect water stress conditions, such as leaf stomatal conductance
    (Suárez et al., 2008), canopy temperature (Suárez et al., 2009), and xylem water
    potential (Stagakis et al., 2012). However, due to the confounding effects introduced
    by concomitant variations in canopy structural parameters, they never identify
    a direct relationship between PRI and the irrigation treatments applied on the
    field. This study proposes for the first time a method allowing the direct use
    of PRI to accurately mapping water stress based on the irrigation treatments imposed
    on the experimental field causing variations in RWC. We are aware that physiological
    indicators such as leaf stomatal conductance and leaf water potential can track
    changes in plant water status before a variation of RWC occurs (Acevedo et al.,
    1979). Although some recent papers demonstrated that PRI can be also related to
    water potential and stomatal conductance, canopy temperature generally showed
    the highest correlations. The present study demonstrated that PRI can be successfully
    used for the identification of water stress classes as an alternative or a complement
    to thermal measurements, enabling the use of high spatial resolution capabilities
    that are more difficult in the thermal region. However the possibility to use
    PRI for irrigation scheduling and for making prescription irrigation decisions
    requires further investigations. The water treatments applied in this study resulted
    in yield losses at harvest of 27% for non-irrigated compared to 70 ETc plots.
    Assuming that the administration of supplementing water to water stressed plants
    could mitigate the negative effect on maize yield, a timely knowledge of the spatial
    variations in water stress levels could provide useful information on plant water
    requirements for accurate irrigation scheduling and control. Further research
    is indeed needed to understand the effectiveness of such mitigation strategy in
    preventing yield losses. 5. Conclusions Airborne remote sensing data acquired
    with the hyperspectral AISA sensor were used to detect water stress in maize under
    different levels of irrigation. The main results of this study can be summarized
    as follows: (i) leaf physiological water stress indicators investigated in this
    study (chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf temperature, leaf water content) responded
    immediately to increasing levels of water stress, while structural variables (i.e.
    LAI) remained largely unchanged; (ii) the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI570)
    computed from the AISA imagery showed the strongest correlations with ΔF/ (r2
    = 0.76), Tl − Tair (r2 = 0.82) and RWC (r2 = 0.64), while the CIred-edge was the
    best estimator of LAI (r2 = 0.64); (iii) a method based on an ordinal regression
    between PRI570 and the water irrigation levels applied in the field was proposed
    to map water stress over a maize field. This method was successfully used to map
    water stress on plots different from the ones used to calibrate the model itself
    and characterized by a different rate of N application. The advances presented
    in this study have proved the possibility of mapping water stress classes using
    hyperspectral indices, providing timely spatial distribution information on crop
    condition. However the translation of this finding in accurate irrigation scheduling
    is not trivial and requires further investigations. Acknowledgements The airborne

    Abstract This study assessed the capability of several xanthophyll, chlorophyll
    and structure-sensitive spectral indices to detect water stress in a commercial
    farm consisting of five fruit tree crop species with contrasting phenology and
    canopy architecture. Plots irrigated and non-irrigated for eight days of each
    species were used to promote a range of plant water status. Multi-spectral and
    thermal images were acquired from an unmanned aerial system while concomitant
    measurements of stomatal conductance (gs), stem water potential (Ψs) and photosynthesis
    were taken. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), red-edge ratio
    (R700/R670), Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized
    by the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI), the Photochemical
    Reflectance Index using reflectance at 530 (PRI) and 515 nm [PRI(570–515)] and
    the normalized PRI (PRInorm) were obtained from the narrow-band multi-spectral
    images and the relationship with the in-field measurements explored. Results showed
    that within the Prunus species, Ψs yielded the best correlations with PRI and
    PRI(570–515) (r2 = 0.53) in almond trees, with TCARI/OSAVI (r2 = 0.88) in apricot
    trees and with PRInorm, R700/R670 and NDVI (r2 from 0.72 to 0.88) in peach trees.
    Weak or no correlations were found for the Citrus species due to the low level
    of water stress reached by the trees. Results from the sensitivity analysis pointed
    out the canopy temperature (Tc) and PRI(570–515) as the first and second most
    sensitive indicators to the imposed water conditions in all the crops with the
    exception of apricot trees, in which Ψs was the most sensitive indicator at midday.
    PRInorm was the least sensitive index among all the water stress indicators studied.
    When all the crops were analyzed together, PRI(570–515) and NDVI were the indices
    that better correlations yielded with Crop Water Stress Index, gs and, particularly,
    Ψs (r2 = 0.61 and 0.65, respectively). This work demonstrated the feasibility
    of using narrow-band multispectral-derived indices to retrieve water status for
    a variety of crop species with contrasting phenology and canopy architecture.

    Continuous advances in technology have promoted the use of unmanned aerial systems
    (UAS) for a large range of applications (Anderson and Gaston 2013). Precision
    agriculture is one of the most promising applications (Mulla 2013; Gago et al.
    2015) since low-cost UAS can be equipped with robust sensors providing very high
    resolution, such as miniaturized narrow-band and hyperspectral and thermal cameras
    used to remotely monitor vegetation (Bendig et al. 2012). Farm assessment by remote
    sensing using UAS enables crop monitoring from a closer range and a higher frequency
    than is currently possible with satellites. Inter- and intra-field variability
    of crops can then be assessed in detail providing farmers with crucial information
    to better optimize farm management and increase farmers’ profitability (Mulla
    2013). Water availability is becoming the most limiting factor for crop production
    in much of the world (Field 2014). This fact has increased the emphasis that policy-makers
    are placing on both demand and supply options to water management. Remote sensing
    takes on special significance within this context since it enables a better monitoring
    of large cultivated areas making it easier to assess the proper functioning of
    irrigation systems (for example, by identifying water-stressed areas or irrigation
    leaks with thermal images) and the precise management of plants water stress,
    which has been extensively pointed out in the literature (Taghvaeian and Neale
    2011) as a key factor to ensure the success of water-saving irrigation strategies
    based on irrigating plants below their full water requirements. High resolution
    thermal imagery has been successfully used in a variety of crops to assess the
    variability in plant water status at the field and farm scales (Bellvert et al.
    2013; Berni et al. 2009; Gonzalez-Dugo et al. 2012). Bellvert et al. (2013) mapped
    the spatial variability in leaf water potential of different vineyards based on
    high resolution thermal imagery and then used that information for scheduling
    irrigation. Similarly, Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013) identified water-stressed areas
    from thermal images in a farm composed of five fruit tree crops and based on the
    relationship between the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) and the stem water potential
    (Ψs) established a CWSI threshold for scheduling irrigation. Notwithstanding the
    suitability of thermal sensing for plant water stress assessment, alternative
    indices less sensitive to variations in the air vapor pressure deficit and more
    related to biophysical parameters such as the chlorophyll or xanthophylls pigment
    content are currently of interest (Zarco-Tejada et al. 2013). That is because
    in the field, in order to cope with drought, plants usually exhibit adaptive mechanisms
    at leaf level such as the dissipation of excitation energy (associated with an
    increase in the concentration of de-epoxidized xanthophyll cycle components),
    decrease in leaf chlorophyll concentration and down-regulation of photosynthesis
    (Chaves et al. 2002). Greenhouse experiments have shown that water stress periods
    of even eight days may have a significant effect on the content and organization
    of chlorophyll in the mesophyll (Albert and Thornber 1977). A variety of narrow-band
    optical indices obtained from remote sensing data have been related to leaf chlorophyll
    concentration (Haboudane et al. 2002; Zarco-Tejada et al. 2004). Combination of
    indices such as the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI)
    and the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) to give the TCARI/OSAVI
    index (Table 1), have been shown as more robust indices to estimate chlorophyll
    concentration than simple indices because of a lower sensitivity to soil background
    and crop leaf area index variations (Haboudane et al. 2002; Zarco-Tejada et al.
    2004). Table 1 Formulations used to obtain the vegetation indices: Photochemical
    Reflectance Index (PRI), normalized PRI (PRInorm), PRI using the reflectance band
    at 515 nm [PRI(570–515)], red edge ratio (R700/R670), Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized
    by the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) Full size table
    The narrow-band Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI, Table 1) proposed by Gamon
    et al. (1992), which is based on the xanthophylls cycle activation as a mechanism
    to dissipate the excess of energy when photosynthesis declines under conditions
    of stress, has been also successfully tested as a water stress indicator in several
    studies (Peguero-Pina et al. 2008; Suárez et al. 2010; Hernández-Clemente et al.
    2011). These authors, however, also pointed out that PRI is highly affected by
    factors such as canopy structure, viewing and illumination geometry effects, and
    background, which challenge its widespread use as a water stress indicator. Different
    formulations of PRI (based on different wavelength references) have been studied
    in this sense searching to overcome these limitations (Hernández-Clemente et al.
    2011). Recently, Zarco-Tejada et al. (2013) proposed a modified PRI-based index
    (PRInorm) to track the diurnal trends of water stress using a combination of a
    structural index (Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index, RDVI) and an index
    sensitive to the leaf chlorophyll content (the red edge ratio, R700/R670) to normalize
    PRI. The PRInorm index was tested in an experimental vineyard site in a diurnal
    setting, yielding higher correlations than PRI with the CWSI and the commonly
    used water stress indicators, leaf water potential and stomatal conductance (gs).
    Spectral indices have been usually evaluated in orchards consisting of a single
    crop. It is not uncommon for farms to be made up of several crop species with
    different canopy architectures, nutrient status and even phenological stages.
    Under these circumstances, the possibility of using a single multi-spectral index
    that could provide reliable information regarding the plant water status of all
    the co-existing crops in the farm would considerably simplify the farm assessment.
    With that objective in mind, a study was performed in a commercial farm consisting
    of five fruit tree crop species in which the capability of xanthophyll, chlorophyll
    and structure-sensitive spectral indices to track the effects of water stress
    on trees was assessed. The sensitivity of these indices to the imposed drought
    conditions were assessed by means of a sensitivity analysis as other authors (Goldhamer
    et al. 1999; Moriana and Fereres 2002; Intrigliolo and Castel 2006) have reported
    for the evaluation of alternative indirect physiological indicators. Thus, the
    specific objectives of the present work were: (i) to assess the sensitivity of
    xanthophyll, chlorophyll and structure-sensitive spectral indices to water stress
    conditions; (ii) to explore the relationship between the spectral indices and
    Ψs, gs and CWSI for each of the fruit tree crop species studied, and; (iii) to
    identify which of the spectral indices could more accurately track the water stress
    effects on trees when the five fruit tree crop species were assessed together.
    Materials and methods Site characteristics and irrigation treatments The study
    was performed in July 2010 in the same 42-ha commercial farm described in Pérez-Sarmiento
    et al. (2010) and Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013), located in the Mula Valley (37°55′N,
    1°26′W), Murcia (Spain), where the climate is considered as semi-arid Mediterranean.
    The annual reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and rainfall for the experimental
    season were 1182 and 445 mm, respectively. The farm consisted of five orchards
    planted in 1999 with almond (Prunus dulcis cv. Garrigues and cv. Ramillete), apricot
    (Prunus armeniaca cv. Bulida), peach (Prunus persica cv. Catherine), orange (Citrus
    sinensis cv. Lane Late) and lemon (Citrus x limon cv. Fino 49) trees. Each orchard
    was divided into 2–4 irrigation units, which enabled different irrigation managements
    and the development of contrasting plant water status. The number of irrigation
    units and other characteristics such as tree spacing, canopy ground cover and
    number of emitters per tree used within each orchard are shown in Table 2. At
    the time of the study (July), almond, peach, lemon and orange trees were being
    irrigated daily. In order to generate different levels of tree water status in
    these orchards, irrigation was withheld for eight days prior to the measurements
    in one single irrigation unit in the almond, lemon and orange orchards, and in
    two irrigation units in the peach orchard. Apricot trees, on the other hand, had
    already been harvested and water had not been applied since 24 days before the
    measurements date. Thus, to generate different water status in the apricot orchard,
    irrigation was resumed in one single unit eight days prior to the measurements.

    tree for each of the orchards in the study. The number of irrigation units established
    per orchard is also shown Full size table Airborne imagery and image processing
    Multispectral images were acquired on July 7th at 13.00 h (local time; UTC + 1
    h) with a 6-band multispectral camera (MCA-6, Tetracam Inc., California, USA)
    installed on a two-meter wingspan fixed–wing UAS platform. The image resolution
    was 1280 × 1024 pixels with 10-bit radiometric resolution and optical focal length
    of 8.5 mm. The UAS (mX-SIGHT, UAV Services and Systems, Germany) was controlled
    by an autopilot for autonomous flying (AP04, UAV Navigation, Madrid, Spain) following
    a flight plan of around 1 h at 350 m above the ground and 5.8 kg take-off weight
    using waypoints to acquire imagery from the entire orchards under study. At this
    flight altitude, the camera delivered a ground resolution of 200 mm pixel-size.
    The autopilot had a dual CPU controlling an integrated attitude heading reference
    system (AHRS) based on a L1 GPS board, 3-axis accelerometers, gyros and a 3-axis
    magnetometer (Berni et al. 2009). The ground control station and the UAS were
    radio-linked, transmitting position, altitude and status data at 20 Hz frequency.
    The bandsets chosen for this study were centered at 515, 530, 570, 670, 700 and
    800 nm (10 nm bandwidths). The high-resolution of the multispectral imagery enabled
    the identification of every single crown within the orchard. A region of interest
    was established in the center of each crown to extract pure vegetation reflectance
    and to avoid soil background effect. Then, the different indices were calculated
    at the object level (crown). The average crown reflectance derived from the imagery
    of well-watered and deficit-irrigated trees for each of the five tree crop species
    studied is shown in Fig. 1. Reflectance values obtained for the six spectral bands
    enabled the calculation of vegetation indices sensitive to variations in canopy
    structure, chlorophyll and xanthophyll pigment content (Table 1). Fig. 1 Average

    (DI) trees for each of the five fruit tree crops studied Full size image The Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to track changes in canopy structure.
    Effect of treatments on the leaf chlorophyll concentration was assessed with the
    red edge index (R670/R700), which uses the reflectance at 670 and 700 nm wavelengths,
    and the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized by
    the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI). Finally, PRI, PRI
    using reflectance at 515 nm [PRI(570–515)] instead of 530 and PRInorm were also
    determined. The spectral indices were compared with Tc and CWSI, which were determined
    in a parallel study by Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013) in the same trees. Thermal
    images were obtained from a thermal camera (MIRICLE 307, Thermoteknix Systems
    Ldt., Cambridge, UK) also installed on the UAS during the study. Field data collection
    Concomitant measurements of Ψs and gs were taken during the flight in selected
    irrigated and non-irrigated trees from each species. Measurements were carried
    out by five teams composed of 3–5 people each with experience taking in-field
    determinations. The Ψs determinations were carried out with five Scholander pressure
    chambers (Model 600 Pressure Chamber, PMS Instrument Company, Albany, USA) in
    two mature leaves per tree covered with aluminum foil for at least 90 min before
    measurements. The number of trees used for the Ψs and other in-field determinations
    within each irrigation unit are shown in Table 3. The gs was measured in 2-4 sunny
    leaves per tree using a diffusion porometer (SC-1 porometer, Decagon, WA, USA)
    in the lemon, orange and peach crops and a portable photosynthesis system (LI-6400
    Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with a LI-6400/40 Leaf Chamber Fluorometer
    and a LICOR 6400-01 CO2 injector in the almond and apricot crops. Leaf gas exchange
    was measured on fully expanded leaves placed in a 200 mm2 leaf cuvette. The CO2
    concentration in the cuvette was maintained at 400 µmol·mol−1 (≈ambient CO2 concentration).
    Measurements were performed at saturating light intensity of 1800 µmol·m−2·s−1
    and at ambient temperature and relative humidity. The airflow was set to 300 μmol·s−1,
    which enabled also recording the leaf net CO2 assimilation. Additionally, three
    leaf samples were taken from selected irrigated and non-irrigated trees of all
    the species with the exception of peach to determine the leaf chlorophyll content
    (Table 3). For the leaf chlorophyll determination, approximately 30 mg leaves
    were sampled from the same, avoiding major veins. Chlorophyll was eluted from
    the leaf by submerging them in 3 ml of N, N-dymethylformamide in the dark for
    at least 72 h. The amount of absorbance was read at 647 nm and 664.5 nm with a
    Thermo Spectronic (model Helios alpha, UVA No. 092009, England) and used to calculate
    fresh mass-based chlorophyll content according to the equations of Inskeep and
    Bloom (1985). Table 3 Number of trees in which measurements of stem water potential
    (Ψs), stomatal conductance (gs), leaf net CO2 assimilation (photosynthesis) and
    leaf chlorophyll content (Chl) were taken within each irrigation treatment Full
    size table Weather conditions at the time of flights were recorded with a portable
    weather station (Model WXT510, Vaisala, Finland) placed just outside the orchard.
    Mean values for the air temperature, vapor pressure deficit and wind speed at
    the time of flight were 31.9 °C, 3.76 kPa and 1.9 m s−1, respectively. Statistical
    analysis Sensitivity of the spectral indices related to the water stress conditions
    was assessed by means of a sensitivity analysis (sensitivity defined as signal
    to noise ratio) based on that proposed by Goldhamer and Fereres (2001) and comparison
    with traditional indicators of plant water status. When there were significant
    differences between treatments, the value “signal” for Ψs, Tc and the vegetation
    indices was calculated as the ratio between the average value for the water-stressed
    and control treatments while, for gs, it was obtained from the ratio between the
    average value for the control and water-stressed treatments. The “noise” was defined
    as the average coefficient of variation (CV) among trees from the same treatments
    as the signal value. The relationship between the spectral indices and Ψs, gs
    or CWSI for each of the crop species studied, as well as when data from all the
    crops were pooled together, was explored by correlation analyses. Results and
    discussion Sensitivity of the indicators to detect water-stressed areas Results
    obtained from the sensitivity analysis showed that Tc was the indicator with the
    lowest variability and highest sensitivity in three out of the four crop species
    included in the analysis (Table 4). Data from the orange orchard were not included
    in the analysis due to the non-significant differences in plant water status observed
    between treatments. Apricot was the only crop in which Ψs resulted in the most
    sensitive indicator to the imposed irrigation treatments, followed by PRI(570–515)
    and Tc. These results were mainly due to the low CV observed in Tc within trees
    from the same treatment in the almond, lemon and peach orchards, and the low tree
    to tree variability observed in Ψs in apricot trees at 13:00 h compared to the
    other indicators (Table 4). Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013) determined Tc in trees
    of the same orchards used in this experiment at different times (09:00, 11:00
    and 13:00 h). Their results (Gonzalez-Dugo et al. 2013) showed, in fact, that
    apricot was the species with the highest variability in Tc at any of the three
    measurement times and that CV within this crop was lowest at 11:00 h. Taking this
    information into account, the analysis was repeated for this species with Ψs,
    gs and Tc data obtained at 11:00 h (Table 4). For this time frame, results revealed
    that sensitivity of Tc was higher than that of Ψs and gs (no multispectral data
    were available at 11:00 h). Table 4 Sensitivity analysis of the stem water potential
    (Ψs), stomatal conductance (gs), Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), Photochemical
    Reflectance Index (PRI), normalized PRI (PRInorm), PRI using the reflectance band
    at 515 nm [PRI(570–515)], red edge ratio (R700/R670), Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized
    by the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) for each of the
    species assessed in the experiment Full size table Interestingly, PRI(570–515)
    was found to be the second most sensitive indicator to the imposed water-stressed
    conditions in all the cases. The results obtained for PRI(570–515) contrast with
    those obtained for PRInorm which, along with gs, was the indicator with the highest
    noise and least sensitivity. The multispectral indices NDVI, TCARI/OSAVI, R700/R670
    and PRI570 had, in general, intermediate values of sensitivity (Table 4). Relationships
    between the spectral indices and Ψs, gs or CWSI within each orchard Scaling up
    observations of plant water status from the leaf to the field, or even the farm
    level, requires validation of remote sensing data with ground-truth data. Here,
    data obtained from the multispectral imagery of selected trees within each orchard
    were compared with those of in-field measurements of Ψs and gs as well as CWSI,
    which had been already validated for this particular farm by Gonzalez-Dugo et
    al. (2013). Within the Citrus species, only indices sensitive to leaf chlorophyll
    content were significantly correlated with Ψs, gs or CWSI (Table 5). When R700/R670
    was plotted against gs, orange trees yielded a coefficient of determination (r2)
    of 0.62 (p < 0.05). In lemon trees, however, R700/R670 and TCARI/OSAVI were significantly
    correlated with Ψs (r2 = 0.41; p < 0.05) and CWSI (r2 = 0.64; p < 0.001), respectively.
    The structural and photochemical indices were not correlated with Ψs, gs or CWSI
    in any of the Citrus species, which could be related to the small range of plant
    water status reached in these two orchards compared to the others. The evaluation
    of structure, xanthophyll and chlorophyll sensitive indices in orange trees to
    detect plant water stress has been also studied by Zarco-Tejada et al. (2012).
    These authors found that in spite of the wide range of Ψs reached in that study
    (from −0.5 to −2.0 MPa) compared to the work presented here, PRI, TCARI/OSAVI
    and NDVI, although sensitive, were poorly correlated with Ψs. In that case, the
    PRI using the band 515 as a reference, proposed by Hernández-Clemente et al. (2011),
    and the structure-sensitive indicators RDVI, MTVI1 or TVI were shown as more robust
    water stress indicators for orange trees. Other recent studies (Romero-Trigueros
    et al. 2016), however, have reported significant changes in NDVI in grapefruit
    and mandarin trees as a consequence of short-term changes in Ψs. Table 5 Coefficients
    of determination obtained for the relationships between the Photochemical Reflectance
    Index (PRI), normalized PRI (PRInorm), PRI using the reflectance band at 515 nm
    [PRI(570–515)], red edge ratio (R700/R670), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
    (NDVI) and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized
    by the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) and the more classical
    water stress indicators: stem water potential (Ψs), stomatal conductance (gs)
    and Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) for each of the crops and cultivars studied
    Full size table Better correlations than in Citrus were obtained for the crops
    from the genus Prunus (Table 5). In almond trees, PRI(570–515), PRI, NDVI and
    TCARI/OSAVI indices were statistically correlated with Ψs, gs and CWSI with r2
    ranging from 0.32 to 0.79. The Ψs was better correlated with PRI(570–515) and
    PRI (r2 = 0.53 and 0.52, respectively; p < 0.001). The gs yielded the highest
    correlation with TCARI/OSAVI (r2 = 0.65; p < 0.001) while CWSI yielded the highest
    correlation with PRI(570–515) and NDVI (r2 = 0.79 and 0.70, respectively; p <
    0.001). Measurements of photosynthesis taken in almond trees were highly correlated
    with TCARI/OSAVI (Fig. 2). No correlations, however, were obtained with the other
    chlorophyll sensitive indicator, R700/R670. When comparing results from the two
    almond cultivars used in the study (cv. ‘Garrigues’ and cv. ‘Ramillete’), the
    relationships obtained between PRI(570–515) or TCARI/OSAVI and Ψs, gs and CWSI
    were similar. Nevertheless, PRI and NDVI relationships with Ψs, gs and CWSI were
    weaker for cv. ‘Ramillete’ (r2 ranging from 0.13 to 0.68) than for cv. ‘Garrigues’
    (r2 ranging from 0.46 to 0.89). Fig. 2 Relationships between photosynthesis (μmol
    m−2 s−1) and TCARI/OSAVI obtained in almond (r2 = 0.67; p < 0.001) and apricot
    (r2 = 0.75; p < 0.001) trees Full size image Apricot trees were in the stage of
    postharvest when the experiment was performed. In contrast to that obtained for
    almond trees, no correlations were found between Ψs, gs or CWSI and any of the
    PRI formulations studied. NDVI was significantly correlated with gs (r2 = 0.42;
    p < 0.05) and CWSI (r2 = 0.69; p < 0.01) but not with Ψs. Among the spectral indices,
    TCARI/OSAVI was the indicator that yielded the best correlations in apricot trees
    with Ψs, gs and CWSI (r2 ranging from 0.77 to 0.88; p < 0.001). TCARI/OSAVI is
    an index related to the chlorophyll content and not an index directly linked with
    the water status. Nevertheless, all the trees in this study were managed similarly
    before the beginning of the experiment. As aforementioned, apricot had already
    been harvested and water had not been applied for 24 days before the measurements
    date. In this case, and in order to increase the range of water status for this
    crop, irrigation was resumed in one single unit eight days prior to the measurements.
    Thus, the variation that is observed in the index might be related to the contrasted
    water status and the natural variability observed in the field. As also observed
    in almond trees, TCARI/OSAVI was highly correlated with photosynthesis (Fig. 2).
    Differences observed in the relationship between TCARI/OSAVI and photosynthesis
    between apricot and almond trees may be related to differences in the phenological
    stage between these two crops. Results obtained in the peach orchard were somewhat
    different from those reported for almond and apricot trees (Table 5). High correlations
    were obtained for all the spectral indices with the exception of PRI and TCARI/OSAVI.
    PRI(570–515), PRInorm, R700/R670 and NDVI yielded similar r2 compared with CWSI
    (0.61 to 0.68; p < 0.001). PRInorm and R700/R670, however, were the spectral indices
    with the highest correlations with Ψs and gs (r2 from 0.81 to 0.93; p < 0.001).
    The PRInorm has been reported as a more reliable water stress indicator (r2 =
    0.82 when compared against Ψs) than PRI (r2 = 0.53) in grapevines (Zarco-Tejada
    et al. 2013). Here, that was the case for peach trees but the opposite was observed
    for almond trees (Table 5). Most of the studies found in the literature assessing
    the use of spectral information to detect plant water stress have been conducted
    in one particular crop, generally crops of high economic interest such as olive
    (Berni et al. 2009; Suárez et al. 2008; Zarco-Tejada et al. 2004) and grapevines
    (Gago et al. 2015 and references therein). In the present study, multi-spectral
    indices were assessed in a farm composed of crops with different canopy architecture,
    nutrient status and phenology, which meant that a specific indicator performed
    better in some crops than in others. The use of a single multi-spectral indicator
    that would be sensitive enough to variations in the plant water status of several
    crops would facilitate the assessment of irrigation needs at the farm scale. Relationships
    between the spectral indices and Ψs, gs or CWSI at farm scale Pooling data from
    all the fruit tree crops species together, PRI(570–515), PRInorm, R700/R670 and
    NDVI showed a statistically significant correlation with Ψs with r2 ranging between
    0.15 and 0.65 (Table 6). Linear relationships were found for PRI(570–515), PRInorm
    and NDVI while R700/R670 was best-fitted by a polynomial curve (Fig. 3). Among
    these indicators, PRI(570–515) and NDVI were those which yielded the highest r2
    (0.61 and 0.65, respectively; p < 0.001). Table 6 Coefficients of determination

    the species were pooled together Full size table Fig. 3 Relationships between

    Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) for all the fruit species together Full size image
    Although weak, statistically significant correlations were also found between
    PRI(570–515), PRI and NDVI with gs (r2 of 0.16–0.18; p < 0.01), and between PRI(570–515),
    PRInorm, R700/R670 and NDVI with CWSI (r2 ranging from 0.19 to 0.33; p < 0.01)
    (Table 6). Mean chlorophyll content within the farm ranged from 0.10 µg mm−2 in
    lemon trees to 0.41 µg mm−2 in almond trees (Table 7). Both, the TCARI/OSAVI and
    the R700/R670 indices were statistically correlated with leaf chlorophyll concentration
    when data from all the species were pooled together (Fig. 4). The red edge ratio
    yielded higher r2 (0.67; p < 0.001) than TCARI/OSAVI (0.40; p < 0.001). Table

    Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized by the Optimized
    Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) and; b the red edge ratio (R700/R670)
    for all the crop species together Full size image The PRInorm, which was originally
    formulated to deal with contrasting canopy architecture and pigment content, did
    not perform as was expected. The non-linear relationship observed between water
    potential and the red edge ratio (R700/R670) shown in Fig. 3 might be responsible
    for the low performance observed for this index. Results obtained for the NDVI
    were also surprising considering that water restrictions were just applied during
    eight days and considerable canopy structure effects were not expected. Instead
    of that, NDVI yielded the best correlations with Ψs. Recent studies, however,
    have also shown a response of NDVI to short-term changes in Ψs (Romero-Trigueros
    et al. 2016). Overall, NDVI and the PRI(570–515) were the indices able to retrieve
    water status when the five fruit tree crops species were assessed together. These
    results suggest that these indicators could be used to detect water-stressed areas
    in farms composed of a variety of crop species with contrasting phenology and
    canopy architecture. Conclusions The work presented here evaluated the capability
    of a series of narrow-band indices sensitive to biophysical parameters of different
    nature to track water stress effects on a farm composed of five fruit tree crop
    species. Structure, chlorophyll and xanthophyll sensitive indices were all able
    to detect differences between irrigation treatments. Nevertheless, not all the
    indices were correlated with Ψs in all the fruit tree crop species studied. Weak
    or no correlations were found for the Citrus species. While best correlations
    in almond trees were obtained with the PRI and PRI(570–515) indices, TCARI/OSAVI
    was the index that best correlated with Ψs in apricot trees. Both chlorophyll
    and xanthophyll sensitive indices, on the other hand, correlated well with Ψs
    in peach trees. Comparison of the sensitivity analysis performed for direct and
    indirect physiological water stress indicators measured in the study, pointed
    out Tc and PRI(570–515) as the first and second most sensitive indicators to the
    imposed water conditions in all the crops with the exception of apricot trees.
    In fact, PRI(570–515), along with NDVI, were the spectral indices that better
    tracked differences in plant water status (r2 = 0.61 and 0.65, with Ψs, respectively)
    between treatments when all the fruit tree crop species were assessed together.
    These results demonstrate the feasibility of using multi-spectral narrow-band
    indices (i.e. 10 nm bandwidths) acquired from miniature cameras on board a UAS
    to retrieve water status for a variety of crop species with contrasting phenology
    and canopy architecture. Abbreviations gs : Stomatal Conductance Ψs : Stem Water

    \ to be a key inﬂuence on crop yields across the globe. Regarding\nviticulture,\
    \ primary climate vectors with a signiﬁcant impact include temperature, moisture\
    \ stress,\nand radiation. Within this context, it is of foremost importance to\
    \ monitor soils’ moisture levels, as well\nas to detect pests, diseases, and possible\
    \ problems with irrigation equipment. Regular monitoring\nactivities will enable\
    \ timely measures that may trigger ﬁeld interventions that are used to preserve\n\
    grapevines’ phytosanitary state, saving both time and money, while assuring a\
    \ more sustainable\nactivity. This study employs unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\
    \ to acquire aerial imagery, using RGB,\nmultispectral and thermal infrared sensors\
    \ in a vineyard located in the Portuguese Douro wine region.\nData acquired enabled\
    \ the multi-temporal characterization of the vineyard development throughout\n\
    a season through the computation of the normalized diﬀerence vegetation index,\
    \ crop surface models,\nand the crop water stress index. Moreover, vigour maps\
    \ were computed in three classes (high,\nmedium, and low) with diﬀerent approaches:\
    \ (1) considering the whole vineyard, including inter-row\nvegetation and bare\
    \ soil; (2) considering only automatically detected grapevine vegetation; and\
    \ (3)\nalso considering grapevine vegetation by only applying a normalization\
    \ process before creating the\nvigour maps. Results showed that vigour maps considering\
    \ only grapevine vegetation provided an\naccurate representation of the vineyard\
    \ variability. Furthermore, signiﬁcant spatial associations can\nbe gathered through\
    \ (i) a multi-temporal analysis of vigour maps, and (ii) by comparing vigour maps\n\
    with both height and water stress estimation. This type of analysis can assist,\
    \ in a signiﬁcant way,\nthe decision-making processes in viticulture.\nKeywords:\

    \ available worldwide clean water is used in agriculture [1]. Moreover, by the\n\
    year 2050, there will have to be an estimated 70% increase in food production\
    \ [1] to sustain Earth’s\npopulation. Therefore, to attain a sustainable agriculture,\
    \ it is essential to ensure proper water\nmanagement. Global warming evolution\
    \ throughout the years means this phenomena is one of the\nmajor threats to agricultural\
    \ production, also with eﬀects on society [2–5]. Less precipitation, associated\n\

    Agronomy 2019, 9, 581\n2 of 21\nwith more frequent and longer drought periods\
    \ [6], ultimately leads to an increase in the use of water\nin agricultural activity.\
    \ To improve water usage eﬃciency, the United Nations (UN) set sustainable\ndevelopment\
    \ goals with the aim to create an expected increase in eﬃciency in all sectors\
    \ by the year\n2030. This will ensure sustainable extractions and the implementation\
    \ of integrated water resources\nmanagement [7]. It is crucial that the agricultural\
    \ sector contributes to this eﬀort by developing and\nimplementing controlled\
    \ irrigation management systems [8,9]. As such, it is necessary to have an\neﬃcient\
    \ analysis of crops’ water status.\nThe enduring search for resource use optimization,\
    \ risks reduction, and minimizing environmental\nimpacts led to the emergence\
    \ of precision agriculture (PA) [10]. To understand both spatial and temporal\n\
    variabilities of a production unit, PA’s tools and technologies enable the acquisition\
    \ and processing of\nlarge data volumes (e.g., image processing techniques, geo-statistical\
    \ methods) [10,11]. The precision\nviticulture (PV) concept derived from PA involves\
    \ applying diﬀerent technologies to vineyard\nmanagement and grape production\
    \ [12,13]. However, grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) development is\nstrongly related\
    \ to spatial heterogeneity, which depends on several factors to determine both\
    \ its\nproduction and quality [14]. Some of the more relevant factors are soil\
    \ quality and type, vegetation\nmanagement operations, irrigation systems, nutritional\
    \ status, pest and disease control, air temperature,\nand precipitation levels\
    \ [13,15]. Changes in one of these factors may result in the occurrence of biotic\n\
    and abiotic problems. Depending on its severity, it may result in a signiﬁcant\
    \ decrease in production\nor quality, and therefore, considerable economic losses\
    \ [16]. The Douro Demarcated Region (DDR,\nnorth-eastern Portugal) spatial variability\
    \ is high due mainly to the terrain’s topographic proﬁle,\nclimatic variations,\
    \ and soil characteristics, which causes vineyards to be unique throughout the\n\
    DDR [12].\nIn the last few years, due to their ﬂexibility and eﬃciency in diverse\
    \ environments, the use\nof unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) emerged in agriculture\
    \ applications [17]. UAVs can acquire\ngeoreferenced data with a high spatial\
    \ resolution while using diﬀerent types of sensors (RGB,\nnear infrared, multi\
    \ and hyper-spectral, thermal infrared (TIR) and LiDAR) [18], which allow for\
    \ the\noutput of several digital products, such as ortho-rectiﬁed mosaics, digital\
    \ elevation models (DEMs),\nland surface temperature, and vegetation indices (VIs)\
    \ [18]. Indeed, their ability to carry diﬀerent\ntypes of sensors make UAVs a\
    \ suitable solution for agricultural applications. While multispectral\nsensors\
    \ acquire data from the electromagnetic spectrum in the near and visible infrared\
    \ region (400 to\n1000 nm), thermal sensors can acquire data in the far infrared\
    \ zone (5000 to 18,000 nm), where the\nreﬂection value of each pixel can be transformed\
    \ into a temperature value [18]. Among the diﬀerent\nVIs, which can be considered\
    \ as a set of arithmetic operations applied in diﬀerent bands used to extract\n\
    diﬀerent vegetation characteristics [18], the normalized diﬀerence vegetation\
    \ index (NDVI) [19] must\nbe highlighted as it is frequently used in agricultural\
    \ applications to estimate diﬀerent crop-related\nparameters: biomass [20]; canopy\
    \ structure, leaf area index (LAI), crop management [21]; and mapping\nvigour\
    \ zones [22]. Moreover, it was found to correlate well with grape quality properties\
    \ [23]. As for\ntemperature-based indices, they constitute a quick and practical\
    \ way to estimate crop water status,\ntherefore indicating the plants’ water content.\
    \ The crop water stress index (CWSI) [24] is widely used in\nremote sensing to\
    \ monitor plants’ water status and consequent irrigation management [25]. TIR-based\n\
    indices were employed to diﬀerent crops, such as olives [26], grapevines [27],\
    \ cotton [28], wheat [29],\nrice [30], sugar-beet [31], and maize [32]. Remote\
    \ sensing platforms can also be a helpful tool for a\nbetter understanding of\
    \ spatial variability, which has a signiﬁcant meaning in vineyard management\n\
    activities. Actually, UAVs have already been used to, e.g., estimate the leaf\
    \ area index [33,34], irrigation\nmanagement and water stress mapping [27,35,36],\
    \ disease detection and mapping [37,38], and detection\nof nutritional deﬁciencies\
    \ [39].\nUAVs have already proved to be a cost-eﬀective and ﬂexible alternative\
    \ for remote sensing, within\na PA context. They present an improved decision-making\
    \ process to the farmer and provide greater\nﬂexibility, when compared to other\
    \ remote sensing platforms [13].\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 581\n3 of 21\nAs for PV, vineyards\
    \ have signiﬁcant areas occupied by elements other than grapevines (e.g.,\ninter-row\
    \ vegetation, man-made structures, vegetation that usually surrounds the plot,\
    \ and grapevines’\nshadows) [13,40]. These elements can be automatically identiﬁed\
    \ by means of digital image processing\nmethods. Indeed, several methods have\
    \ been proposed to deal with UAV-based aerial imagery or\nwith the resulting digital\
    \ products from the photogrammetric processing. For example, grapevine\nsegmentation\
    \ [41,42], supervised and unsupervised machine learning [43], point clouds derived\
    \ from\nphotogrammetric processing [44,45], and DEMs [16,33,40]. Regarding VIs,\
    \ they are one of the most\ncommon segmentation techniques applied in a remote\
    \ sensing [46], mainly to segment a given image\ninto two classes: vegetation\
    \ or non-vegetation [47]. However, when considering vineyard vegetation,\nVIs\
    \ acknowledges all types of vegetation without distinguishing grapevines from\
    \ non-grapevines\n(e.g., inter-row vegetation). By using the DEM—or more speciﬁcally,\
    \ the canopy surface model (CSM),\nwhich can be obtained by subtracting the digital\
    \ terrain model (DTM) from the digital surface model\n(DSM)—quantifying and removing\
    \ non-grapevine vegetation in a vineyard’s segmentation process\ncan be done as\
    \ plant height is provided [48].\nWhile diﬀerent digital outputs can be generated\
    \ from UAV-based imagery, the amount of data\nand its complexity can be overwhelming\
    \ for the common farmer to interpret. Straightforward useful\ncrop-related information\
    \ is needed. Vigour maps are an example where by using the NDVI, vegetation\n\
    is classiﬁed into diﬀerent classes according to its characteristics. By applying\
    \ it to PV, grapevines’\nvigour can be deﬁned as the measure of the growth rate\
    \ during a given time period (e.g., the growing\nseason). This not only enables\
    \ the classiﬁcation of vineyard homogeneity zones [49], which is a way\nto represent\
    \ the impact of both environmental conditions and soil fertility [50]. There have\
    \ been\nsome related works done in this area. Khaliq et al. [51] compared satellite\
    \ imagery with UAV-based\nmultispectral data in four diﬀerent epochs of the grapevines’\
    \ vegetative cycle. Diﬀerent comparisons\nwere made by considering: (i) the whole\
    \ vineyard, (ii) only the grapevines’ vegetation, and (iii)\nonly inter-row areas.\
    \ The authors reported that satellite multispectral imagery presented limitations\n\
    due to the ground sampling distance (GSD, 10 m) and to the inﬂuence of inter-row\
    \ information.\nPrimicerio et al. [22] evaluated vigour maps produced for the\
    \ whole vineyard and only encompassing\ngrapevines’ vegetation by applying an\
    \ automatic segmentation method [41]. Campos et al. [52] used\nUAV-based vigour\
    \ maps to create prescription maps for vineyard spraying operations.\nStudies\
    \ supported by imagery acquired in one ﬂight mission alone mainly focused on assessing\n\
    non-grapevine vegetation removal when considering the whole vineyard, and in creating\
    \ task-oriented\nvigour maps [22,52–54]. With reference to multi-temporal studies,\
    \ there are those whose aim is\nto compare diﬀerent growing seasons by evaluating\
    \ biophysical grapevines parameters [54–56].\nFurthermore, studies utilizing intra-season\
    \ multi-temporal data, considered the whole vineyard\ninformation [57] or vineyard\
    \ changes were not the main focus [51]. As found in Primicerio et al. [22],\n\
    vigour maps using only grapevines’ vegetation showed a better representation of\
    \ the variability\nwithin the vineyard. The spatial variability in grapevines’\
    \ water status can be assessed thought both\nmultispectral and TIR imagery, where\
    \ TIR imagery serves as an immediate way to estimate crops’\nwater status, while\
    \ multispectral data can show cumulative water deﬁcits [35]. As such, the TIR\
    \ data\nhas the potential to help understand water stress for near-real-time decision-making\
    \ support [58].\nBy integrating TIR and multispectral data, datasets to study\
    \ grapevines’ response to climate change [59]\ncan be created.\nThis study aimed\
    \ to evaluate vineyard vigour maps (NDVI) created using UAV-based multispectral\n\
    imagery within a multi-temporal context and in diﬀerent grapevines’ phenological\
    \ stages. The main\ngoal was to study grapevines’ vegetation dynamics during the\
    \ growing season up until harvesting.\nTwo approaches were used: (i) considering\
    \ the whole vineyard area, and (ii) considering only\nautomatically detected grapevines’\
    \ vegetation. Spatial assessment between the generated vigour\nmaps, and grapevines’\
    \ canopy temperature and height data—obtained from UAV-based TIR and RGB\nimagery,\
    \ respectively—were conducted with the objective to correlate vigour maps with\
    \ potential\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 581\n4 of 21\ngrapevines’ water stress and canopy\

    \ and TIR imagery were acquired using both a DJI Phantom 4 (DJI, Shenzhen,\nChina)\
    \ and a Senseﬂy eBee (senseFly SA, Lausanne, Switzerland). The former is a low-cost\
    \ UAV\nequipped with an RGB sensor (12.4 MP resolution) attached to a three-axis\
    \ electronic gimbal. For the\npurpose of this study, it was modiﬁed to support\
    \ a multispectral sensor: the Parrot SEQUOIA (Parrot\nSA, Paris, France). This\
    \ sensor consisted of a four-camera array, which was able to acquire data in the\n\
    green (550 nm), red (660 nm), red-edge (735 nm), and near infrared (790 nm) parts\
    \ of the electromagnetic\nspectrum, with a 1 MP resolution. Moreover, a Sunshine\
    \ sensor (Parrot SA, Paris, France) was also\nadded to the UAV’s top. It is responsible\
    \ for acquiring the irradiance conditions during the ﬂight\nmission in the same\
    \ spectral bands as the multispectral sensor and to geolocate the acquired imagery.\n\
    As for the Senseﬂy eBee, it is a ﬁxed-wing UAV used to acquire TIR imagery with\
    \ the thermoMAP\n(senseFly SA, Lausanne, Switzerland) sensor (between 7500 nm\
    \ to 13,500 nm, with 640 × 512 pixels and\na temperature resolution of 0.1 ◦C),\
    \ with automatic in-ﬂight thermal image-based calibration. Ground\ncontrol points\
    \ (GCPs), used for aligning the acquired imagery during the photogrammetric processing,\n\
    were measured using a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver in real-time\
    \ kinematic\n(RTK) mode based on the TM06/ETRS89 coordinate system (GCP’s location\
    \ in Figure 1). While the\nmulti-rotor UAV was used mainly due to its capability\
    \ to survey areas at lower ﬂight heights, which\nprovides higher spatial resolution\
    \ [18], the ﬁxed-wing UAV surveyed a larger area, which included the\nstudied\
    \ area. Furthermore, the TIR sensor only operated as a ﬁxed-wing UAV.\nData acquisition\
    \ was conducted in ﬁve ﬂight campaigns, from 17 May 2018 to 21 September 2018.\n\
    Each ﬂight campaign corresponded to distinct grapevine phenological stages: ﬂowering\
    \ (May and\nJune), fruit set (July), veraison (August), and harvest (September).\
    \ Details are presented in Figure 3.\nAll ﬂight campaigns were conducted near\
    \ solar noon to minimize sun and shadow inﬂuences. Flights\nfor both the RGB and\
    \ multispectral sensors were done at a 40 m height, with a forward overlap of\n\
    80% and 70% side overlap between images. The GSD was approximately 1.8 cm for\
    \ the RGB and\nof 4.4 cm for the multispectral imagery. Regarding ﬂights for TIR\
    \ imagery acquisition, they were\ncarried out at a 75 m ﬂight height, with a 90%\
    \ forward overlap and 75% side overlap between images,\nresulting in an approximate\
    \ 17.5 cm GSD. All ﬂight campaigns utilized RGB and multispectral imagery,\nwhile\
    \ TIR imagery was only acquired from F3 onward (see Figure 3), due to both in-ﬁeld\
    \ observations\nand the environmental context, since rainfall can induce an error\
    \ in the remotely sensed grapevine\nwater status in the subsequent days [60].\
    \ Moreover, a radiometric calibration was performed prior\nto each ﬂight for the\
    \ multispectral imagery using a reﬂectance panel provided by the manufacturer,\n\
    along with the irradiance data from the sunshine sensor. Irradiance and reﬂectance\
    \ data enabled a\nreliable radiometric workﬂow for the collection of repeatable\
    \ reﬂectance data over diﬀerent ﬂights,\ndates, and weather conditions.\nAgronomy\

    \ Processing and Parameters Extraction\nImagery acquired in each ﬂight campaign\
    \ was processed using the Pix4Dmapper Pro (Pix4D\nSA, Lausanne, Switzerland).\
    \ This software makes use of structure from motion (SfM) algorithms\nto identify\
    \ common points in the images. It can create point clouds, and by interpolating\
    \ them,\ngenerate diﬀerent orthorectiﬁed outcomes depending on the sensor used.\
    \ Imagery from each sensor\nwas processed in diﬀerent projects. The default processing\
    \ options for each sensor were applied,\nbut point clouds were generated with\
    \ a high-point density. Point cloud interpolation was achieved\nusing inverse\
    \ distance weighting (IDW) and by applying noise ﬁlters. The generated digital\
    \ outcomes\nwere: (i) RGB–orthophoto mosaic, DSM, and DTM; (ii) multispectral–VIs;\
    \ and (iii) TIR–land surface\ntemperature. By subtracting the DTM from the DSM,\
    \ the CSM was obtained. From the multispectral\nimagery, the NDVI [19] was obtained\
    \ using a normalization between the near-infrared (NIR) and red\nbands, as given\
    \ in Equation (1).\nNDVI = NIR − RED\nNIR + RED\n(1)\nThe land surface temperature\
    \ was used to compute the CWSI through the empirical model\npresented in Equation\
    \ (2). It was based in the usage of canopy temperature, Tc, and the lower and\n\
    upper canopy temperature limits (Tdry and Twet), corresponding, respectively,\
    \ to well-watered and\nnon-transpiring leaves. These values can be directly obtained\
    \ in the ﬁeld or by using UAV-based\nthermal infrared imagery [61]. CWSI values\
    \ can vary between 0 (no stress signs) and 1 (high levels\nof stress). In this\
    \ study, Twet and Tdry values were obtained as described in the work of Matese\n\
    and Di Gennaro [23]: Twet was obtained by wetting some leaves and immediately\
    \ measuring their\ntemperature, while Tdry values were obtained by applying petroleum\
    \ jelly in the leaves and registering\ntheir temperatures after some minutes had\
    \ gone by. Temperature values were measured using a\nhandheld infrared thermometer\
    \ (Shenzhen Jumaoyuan Science and Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen,\nChina), with\
    \ a ±1.5 ◦C precision and operating between 8000 nm to 14,000 nm.\nCWSI =\nTc\
    \ − Twet\nTdry − Twet\n(2)\nTo remove non-grapevine elements from the acquired\
    \ imagery, segmentation was performed by\nusing the method proposed in Pádua et\
    \ al. [62]. Both the CSM and the G% index [63], computed from\nthe orthophoto\
    \ mosaic, were used as inputs, and through thresholding, considering both vegetation\n\
    and height thresholds, it identiﬁed all vegetation within a given height range.\n\
    While G% was\nautomatically obtained using Otsu’s method for thresholding, CSM\
    \ used a deﬁned height range.\nAn accurate grapevine segmentation was obtained,\
    \ ﬁltering out non-grapevine objects such as soil and\ninter-row vegetation.\n\
    This method has already been used in a multi-temporal analysis of grapevines’\
    \ vegetation\nevolution throughout a season in two vineyard plots in Pádua et\
    \ al. [64]. Similarly, in this study,\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 581\n7 of 21\nthe method\
    \ to segment grapevines’ vegetation [62] was applied to evaluate the multi-temporal\
    \ vineyard\nevolution when regarding grapevine area and canopy volume, as well\
    \ as the inter-row vegetation area.\nThe grapevine canopy volume was computed\
    \ according to Pádua et al. [64], using the mean height of\neach cluster of pixels\
    \ obtained during the segmentation process multiplied by its area, where the sum\n\
    of the volume of each cluster represents the total vineyard volume.\nAs such,\
    \ the orthorectiﬁed outputs from each ﬂight campaign were used for diﬀerent purposes.\n\
    The grapevines’ vegetation was detected and then CSM, NDVI, and CWSI values from\
    \ the detected\nparts were considered, while non-grapevine pixels were discarded.\
    \ Within the scope of this study,\nthree diﬀerent approaches were tested to create\
    \ vigour maps. Figure 4 describes the main steps in each\napproach. Moreover,\
    \ vigour classes were set to low, medium, and high. The workﬂow consisted in\n\
    loading the orthorectiﬁed outcomes, followed by the vineyard segmentation method,\
    \ depending on\nthe used approach. Then, vigour maps were created by a applying\
    \ a mean ﬁlter to the image, using a\n2 × 2 m sliding window. Data could then\
    \ be normalized according to Equation (3) before the vigour\nmap was created.\
    \ Again, this last step depended on the approach being used.\nAgronomy 2019, 9,\

    \ maps using three vigour classes. \nThe first approach relied on the usage of\
    \ data from the whole vineyard. The outcome was \ndirectly smoothed and divided\
    \ into three classes, using terciles. As for the second approach, it was \nsimilar\
    \ to the first, but it only considered the grapevines’ vegetation. Lastly, the\
    \ third approach, \nsimilar to the second approach, considered only normalized\
    \ grapevines’ vegetation. Normalization \nwas done based on the mean value of\
    \ the 10% higher and lower values of the smoothed grapevines’ \nvegetation values.\
    \ Then, three vigour classes are created by dividing the values in the normalized\
    \ \nraster according to fixed thresholds: (i) values lower or equal to 0.4 were\
    \ considered low vigour; (ii) \nbetween 0.4 and 0.7 were considered medium vigour;\
    \ (iii) and values above 0.7 were considered high \nvigour. \n2.4. Vigour Maps\
    \ versus Spatial Statistics \nVigour maps obtained from each flight campaign were\
    \ compared with the CSM and the CWSI \nusing statistical techniques that consider\
    \ geospatial variability. This comparison was done by \nconverting the three vigour\
    \ classes maps to a 4 × 4 m grid. The grid size was selected by considering \n\
    the studied vineyard’s characteristics: each grid square was confined to two vine\
    \ rows. This pipeline \nwas proposed by Matese et al. [56]. Regarding the methods\
    \ used in this comparison process, they \nwere the local bivariate Moran’s index\
    \ (MI) and the bivariate local indicators of spatial association \n(LISA) [65].\
    \ Local MI (LMI) is based in the Moran’s index [66], which measures the global\
    \ data \ncorrelation. While a positive correlation represents similar values in\
    \ the area’s neighbourhood, a \nnegative value represents the opposite, and zero\
    \ represents a random spatial agreement. Regarding \nthe LMI, a value is provided\
    \ for each observation through permutation. The local bivariate MI was \nused\
    \ in this study to assess the correlation between a defined variable and a different\
    \ variable in the \nnearby areas. In turn, LISA measures the local spatial correlation,\
    \ providing maps of local clusters \nwith a similar behaviour, which is based\
    \ on MI. This way, spatial clusters and its dispersion can be \nassessed. Bivariate\
    \ LISA (BILISA) [65] was used as in Anselin [67] to examine the spatial relationship\
    \ \nbetween the CSM and CWSI and the vigour maps. This comparison was made using\
    \ GeoDa software \n[68]. Spatial weights were necessary to perform these analyses:\
    \ a eight-connectivity approach (3 × 3 \nmatrix) was used to create the weights\
    \ map and BILISA was executed with 999 random permutations. \nThe computed cluster\
    \ maps and its significance were used. Cluster maps specify positive and \nFigure\

    \ considered only normalized grapevines’ vegetation. Normalization was done based\n\
    on the mean value of the 10% higher and lower values of the smoothed grapevines’\

    \ equal to 0.4 were considered low vigour; (ii) between 0.4 and 0.7\nwere considered\
    \ medium vigour; (iii) and values above 0.7 were considered high vigour.\n2.4.\
    \ Vigour Maps versus Spatial Statistics\nVigour maps obtained from each ﬂight\
    \ campaign were compared with the CSM and the CWSI\nusing statistical techniques\
    \ that consider geospatial variability. This comparison was done by converting\n\
    the three vigour classes maps to a 4 × 4 m grid. The grid size was selected by\
    \ considering the studied\nvineyard’s characteristics: each grid square was conﬁned\
    \ to two vine rows. This pipeline was proposed\nby Matese et al. [56]. Regarding\
    \ the methods used in this comparison process, they were the local\nbivariate\
    \ Moran’s index (MI) and the bivariate local indicators of spatial association\
    \ (LISA) [65]. Local\nMI (LMI) is based in the Moran’s index [66], which measures\
    \ the global data correlation. While a\npositive correlation represents similar\
    \ values in the area’s neighbourhood, a negative value represents\nthe opposite,\
    \ and zero represents a random spatial agreement. Regarding the LMI, a value is\
    \ provided\nfor each observation through permutation. The local bivariate MI was\
    \ used in this study to assess\nthe correlation between a deﬁned variable and\
    \ a diﬀerent variable in the nearby areas. In turn, LISA\nmeasures the local spatial\
    \ correlation, providing maps of local clusters with a similar behaviour,\nwhich\
    \ is based on MI. This way, spatial clusters and its dispersion can be assessed.\
    \ Bivariate LISA\n(BILISA) [65] was used as in Anselin [67] to examine the spatial\
    \ relationship between the CSM and\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 581\n8 of 21\nCWSI and the\

    were necessary to perform these analyses: a eight-connectivity approach (3 × 3\
    \ matrix) was used to\ncreate the weights map and BILISA was executed with 999\
    \ random permutations. The computed cluster\nmaps and its signiﬁcance were used.\
    \ Cluster maps specify positive and negative spatial associations\nand are divided\
    \ into four classes, based on the correlation of the value with its neighbourhood.\n\
    The obtained associations are: (i) high–high (HH), where high values correlated\
    \ with high values in the\nneighbourhood; (ii) low–low (LL), in which low values\
    \ correlated with low values in the neighbourhood;\n(iii) high–low (HL); (iv)\
    \ and low–high (LH). The three classes of vigour maps computed through the\ndiﬀerent\
    \ approaches were compared with their correspondent vigour map in the following\
    \ ﬂight\ncampaign, as well as with the CSM and CWSI three classes maps.\n3. Results\n\
    This study yielded diﬀerent digital products through the methods employed, from\
    \ which it\nis important to highlight the vineyard status, vigour areas, potential\
    \ water stress areas, and a\nmulti-temporal vineyard characterization.\n3.1. Multi-Temporal\

    constant from then on. As for the temperature (Figure 5c), a high temporal variability\
    \ was observed\ndue to both the day temperature and the inter-row vegetation.\

    The vineyard multi-temporal dynamics can be better understood using the orthorectiﬁed\
    \ results\nobtained via photogrammetric processing of the UAV-based imagery (Figure\
    \ 5) though their visual\ninspection in a geographical information system (GIS)\
    \ [69].\nOrthophoto mosaics can be used to detect missing grapevines and to manage\
    \ vineyard in-ﬁeld\noperations [64]. Vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI) can provide\
    \ an overall assessment of vegetation vigour\nand potentially detect phytosanitary\
    \ problems, such as ﬂavescence dorée [37] and esca [70]. Leaf canopy\ntemperature\
    \ maps and CWSI can suppress the need to manually measure leaf water potential\
    \ in the\nﬁeld [35]—a time-consuming approach, usually not performed in the whole\
    \ vineyard—as well as be\nused for irrigation management [71].\nIn this study,\
    \ an overall NDVI decline was noticeable from the third ﬂight campaign onward\n\
    (Figure 5a F4, F5). This was related to the grapevines’ vegetative cycle and to\
    \ the decline of inter-row\nvegetation. Regarding height values obtained from\
    \ each ﬂight campaign’s CSM (Figure 5b), a clear\ndistinction existed between\
    \ grapevine and non-grapevine vegetation (e.g., soil and inter-row vegetation),\n\
    except for in the ﬁrst ﬂight campaign (Figure 5b F1). Land surface temperature\
    \ (Figure 5c) was clear-cut\nbetween ﬂight campaigns. In fact, in the fourth and\
    \ ﬁfth ﬂight campaigns (Figure 5c F4 and F5), there\nwere some signs of the grapevines’\
    \ water stress.\nRemoving non-grapevine elements from the vineyard imagery provided\
    \ a diﬀerent perspective\non the results, as conﬁrmed in Table 1. Indeed, this\
    \ enabled the production of estimate parameters\nsuch as the overall inter-row\
    \ vegetation and the grapevines’ area and volume (Figure 6). The estimated\ngrapevines’\
    \ vegetation area in the ﬁrst ﬂight campaign was 81 m2 (3% of the vineyard plot)\
    \ and in the\nsecond ﬂight campaign, a 181 m2 growth took place (262 m2, 9% of\
    \ the vineyard plot). As for the third\nﬂight campaign, there was a growth of\
    \ 255 m2 to 518 m2 (18% of the vineyard plot). In the following\nﬂight campaigns,\
    \ the grapevines’ vegetation area was reduced by 199 m2 (−38%) to 319 m2. Regarding\n\
    the grapevines’ canopy volume, it was modiﬁed by +634%, +160%, −41%, and −12%\
    \ in between each\nsuccessive ﬂight campaign, respectively. Concerning the inter-row\
    \ vegetation area, it presented a\nbehaviour consistent with the available precipitation\
    \ data (Figure 2). Indeed, it had a 214% growth\nin between the ﬁrst two ﬂight\
    \ campaigns (from 181 m2 to 569 m2), representing 20% of the vineyard\nplot area.\
    \ A steep decline was noticeable in the third and fourth ﬂight campaigns (a decline\
    \ of 95%\nto 26 m2), followed by a growth in the last ﬂight campaign (88 m2).\
    \ As such, the vineyard inter-row\nvegetation was a good indicator of soil water\
    \ status. The same tendency had already been veriﬁed in\nPádua et al. [64].\n\
    By comparing the mean, maximum, and minimum values observed in the diﬀerent outcomes,\n\
    either when considering the whole vineyard or only grapevines’ vegetation (Table\
    \ 1), there was a clear\ndiﬀerence among the ﬂight campaigns. Mean NDVI values\
    \ were superior in all ﬂight campaigns when\nconsidering only the grapevines’\
    \ vegetation. The same tendency was veriﬁed in the CSM. This can be\nexplained\
    \ by the presence of a signiﬁcant amount of lower values in the non-grapevine\
    \ vegetation\nareas. However, the maximum NDVI values in the ﬁrst, second, and\
    \ fourth ﬂight campaigns were\nregistered in non-grapevine vegetation areas. Inter-row\
    \ vegetation can account for this. Regarding\nmaximum CSM values, they were similar\
    \ in all ﬂight campaigns, except for the ﬁrst one, where the\nmaximum height was\
    \ detected in a non-grapevine area (probably a vineyard post). Minimum CSM\nand\
    \ NDVI values were lower in non-grapevine areas. As for temperature-based outcomes\
    \ (land surface\ntemperature and CWSI), the opposite behaviour was found for the\
    \ maximum values: they were located\nin non-grapevine vegetation areas. Mean temperature\
    \ and CWSI values were lower in the grapevines’\nvegetation areas, as it was expected\
    \ due to the existence of bare soil areas in the vineyard. Minimum\nAgronomy 2019,\
    \ 9, 581\n16 of 21\ntemperature and CWSI values were similar in both approaches\
    \ since they were found in the grapevines’\nvegetation areas. These results showed\
    \ the importance of grapevines’ vegetation segmentation when\nanalyzing a whole\
    \ vineyard plot. The grapevines’ vegetation segmentation could improve the results\n\
    in studies where this operation was not automatically performed, which is beneﬁcial\
    \ for removing\nnon-grapevine elements from the analysis. Such an automatic procedure\
    \ could help in the evaluation\nof vegetation indices [21], to detect ﬂavescence\
    \ dorée and grapevine trunk diseases [72], and to estimate\ngrapevines’ biophysical\
    \ and geometrical parameters [73].\n4.2. Vigour Maps\nVigour maps generated when\
    \ considering the whole vineyard provided an overall perspective\n(Figure 7a)\
    \ about the studied area. Indeed, inﬂuences from bare soil and especially inter-row\
    \ vegetation\nwere clearly noticeable. Generally, the medium vigour class had\
    \ the smaller area (Figure 8a) and the\nhigh vigour class encompassed the majority\
    \ of the grapevines’ canopy volume (Figure 8b). The latter\nwas, on average, 150%\
    \ higher than the other vigour classes. A high homogeneity was veriﬁed for\nthe\
    \ last two ﬂight campaigns. The same happened from the second to the last ﬂight\
    \ campaigns,\nwhen computing height maps from the CSM and all campaigns with CWSI.\
    \ The whole vineyard was\nconsidered in both. Positive correlation values were\
    \ found for the LMI (Table 2). Moreover, the veriﬁed\nhomogeneity resulted in\
    \ meaningful HH and LL areas when comparing vigour maps with CSM and\nCWSI in\
    \ the same ﬂight campaign.\nDiﬀerent results were obtained in the other two approaches,\
    \ where only the grapevines’ vegetation\nwas considered to create vigour maps.\
    \ The higher incidence of missing grapevine plants in the left area\nof the vineyard\
    \ remained almost the same throughout all ﬂight campaigns. This was not noticeable\n\
    in the ﬁrst two ﬂight campaigns’ vigour maps when considering the whole vineyard,\
    \ probably due\nto an eﬀect caused by inter-row vegetation. Other studies reported\
    \ similar trends using vigour\nmaps produced from the UAV-based NDVI [22,51] when\
    \ excluding inter-row vegetation. Moreover,\nVanegas et al. [74] found positive\
    \ correlations when comparing vigour maps created from UAV-based\ndata and a vineyard\
    \ expert assessment.\nAs for vineyard area, when considering only grapevine vegetation,\
    \ it presented a more balanced\nbehaviour. The third approach, normalized grapevines’\
    \ vegetation, showed a considerable area\nof medium vigour class, particularly\
    \ in the last three ﬂight campaigns due to the ﬁxed cut-oﬀ\nvalues to create vigour\
    \ classes. Both approaches, grapevines’ vegetation and normalized grapevines’\n\
    vegetation, presented insigniﬁcant grapevines’ canopy volume values in the lower\
    \ classes. Moreover,\nwhen considering normalized grapevines’ vegetation, canopy\
    \ volume values were predominant in the\nmedium vigour class, in agreement with\
    \ the vineyard’s overall vegetative growth and decline (growth\nfrom ﬁrst to the\
    \ third ﬂight campaigns and decline onward). Similar relations between vigour\
    \ and\nthe grapevines’ canopy volume were reported in other studies [73,75]. A\
    \ higher heterogeneity was\nveriﬁed when observing both the CSM and CWSI maps\
    \ generated with the approach that considered\nthe normalized grapevines’ vegetation.\
    \ In fact, when analyzing the CWSI maps from the last two\nﬂight campaigns (Figure\
    \ 10), a period of the grapevines’ water stress was observed. However, this\n\
    period was not clearly distinguishable in a visual map inspection based on data\
    \ from the ﬁrst approach\n(when the whole vineyard was considered). These correlations\
    \ were observed in the BILISA cluster\nmaps (Figure 12b,c), where areas with a\
    \ high vigour showed a HL relationship with the CWSI maps,\nand signiﬁcant agreements\
    \ could be observed in the third ﬂight campaign. A similar trend was reported\n\
    in Matese and Di Gennaro [23]. Signiﬁcant spatial associations were found in all\
    \ approaches—whole\nvineyard, grapevines’ vegetation, and normalized grapevines’\
    \ vegetation—when analyzing the height\nclass maps (Figure 11). Although lesser\
    \ associations were found in the ﬁrst ﬂight campaign, this can\nbe explained with\
    \ the grapevines’ growth cycle. In this case, signiﬁcant HL areas were found in\
    \ the\napproaches considering only the grapevine vegetation. Similarly, Matese\
    \ et al. [75] observed that some\nareas with a higher vigour were linked to areas\
    \ with higher heights.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 581\n17 of 21\nThis study analyzed a\
    \ vineyard’s behaviour throughout a season with a multi-temporal approach\nbased\
    \ on multispectral data acquired using a UAV. Furthermore, correlations between\
    \ the diﬀerent\ndigital outcomes were found. This presents a potential tool for\
    \ multi-temporal vineyard assessment\nand can serve as a base to provide prescription\
    \ maps, similar to Campos et al. [52], since they can be\ncorrelated with agronomical\
    \ variables (e.g., yield, berry weight, and total soluble solids), as shown in\n\
    Matese et al. [56]. Indeed, patterns detected when comparing vigour maps from\
    \ consecutive ﬂight\ncampaigns (Figure 13) highlighted diﬀerences in the multi-temporal\
    \ data, which helps to understand\nlocal and spatial grapevines’ vegetative development\
    \ dynamics throughout the season. However,\nﬁltered data considering only values\
    \ representing grapevines’ vegetation, therefore representing the\nplants’ physiological\
    \ status, was proven to be more reliable when comparing the evaluated approaches\n\
    (Table 2); that is to say, it had a higher overall correlation. As such, it stands\
    \ to be an excellent tool for\ndecision support systems within vineyard management\
    \ processes.\n5. Conclusions\nClimate change can heighten key environmental vectors\
    \ that negatively impact vineyards.\nGrapevines can be weakened by both water\
    \ stress and exposure to higher temperatures, which will\nincrease their vulnerability\
    \ to phytosanitary issues. UAVs equipped with diﬀerent sensors can be used\nto\
    \ regularly monitor grapevines, documenting changes in the vegetation or signs\
    \ of diseases/infestation,\nas well as any stress caused by environmental constraints.\n\
    In this context, the need to evaluate current vineyard behaviour is crucial to\
    \ proceed toward PV.\nVigour maps can help to provide relevant insights, helping\
    \ farmers and/or winemakers to understand\ntheir vineyards status and enabling\
    \ timely actions to tackle problematic areas or observing response to\ntreatments.\
    \ Furthermore, the methods employed in this study to ﬁlter out non-grapevine vegetation\n\
    presented a better vineyard representation, which can be used to assess a vineyard’s\
    \ variability, but also\nto help in managing ﬁeld-operations, such as those to\
    \ inspect grapevines or to improve grapevines’\nphysiological status.\nThe use\
    \ of methods to compare spatial correlations allowed us to obtain a spatial distribution\
    \ of\nsigniﬁcant clusters among the diﬀerent approaches evaluated for creating\
    \ vigour maps. The importance\nof using diﬀerent UAV-based outcomes to estimate\
    \ biophysical and geometrical parameters shows the\nsuitability of UAVs as a remote\
    \ sensing platform for vineyard multi-temporal monitoring operations.\nThis study\
    \ allowed us to conclude that the need for UAV-based data can be tracked according\
    \ to a\nvineyard’s phenology. Moreover, TIR data should be acquired in periods\
    \ of higher temperatures to\nassess areas potentially aﬀected by water stress.\
    \ Nevertheless, the analysis presented in this study\nshould be assessed in other\
    \ vineyard types, such as those with irrigation systems, with a lower rate of\n\
    missing grapevines, and in other wine producing regions with diﬀerent grapevine\
    \ training parameters.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, L.P. and J.J.S.;\

    \ the most usual remote sensing approaches\nto assess cereal performance. Understanding\
    \ the relationships of these parameters and yield may\nhelp design more eﬃcient\
    \ strategies to monitor crop performance. We present an evaluation of\nvegetation\
    \ indices (derived from RGB images and multispectral data) and water status traits\
    \ (through\nthe canopy temperature, stomatal conductance and carbon isotopic composition)\
    \ measured during\nthe reproductive stage for genotype phenotyping in a study\
    \ of four wheat genotypes growing under\ndiﬀerent water and nitrogen regimes in\
    \ north Algeria. Diﬀerences among the cultivars were reported\nthrough the vegetation\
    \ indices, but not with the water status traits. Both approximations correlated\n\
    signiﬁcantly with grain yield (GY), reporting stronger correlations under support\
    \ irrigation and\nN-fertilization than the rainfed or the no N-fertilization conditions.\
    \ For N-fertilized trials (irrigated or\nrainfed) water status parameters were\
    \ the main factors predicting relative GY performance, while in\nthe absence of\
    \ N-fertilization, the green canopy area (assessed through GGA) was the main factor\n\
    negatively correlated with GY. Regression models for GY estimation were generated\
    \ using data from\nthree consecutive growing seasons. The results highlighted\
    \ the usefulness of vegetation indices\nderived from RGB images predicting GY.\n\

    \ δ13C\n1. Introduction\nBread wheat is one of the most cultivated herbaceous\
    \ crops in the Mediterranean region [1],\nwith water stress and low nitrogen fertility\
    \ being the main constraints limiting productivity [2].\nThese limitations are\
    \ likely to increase in the future because climatic change is expected to decrease\n\
    precipitation and increase evapotranspiration in the Mediterranean region [3].\
    \ Increasing productivity\nin these semi-arid environments depends on the eﬃciency\
    \ of crop management [2] and breeding [4],\nwhere eﬃcient and aﬀordable methodologies\
    \ to monitor crop performance, or to assess phenotypic\nvariability for breeding,\
    \ are needed. Remote sensing techniques at the canopy level have become\nvaluable\
    \ tools for precision agriculture and high throughput phenotyping [5–7]. Thus,\
    \ both spectral\nand thermal approaches have been proposed as potential solutions\
    \ to identify crop N status and\nwater stress across large areas [8,9]. In this\
    \ way, these techniques can help farmers to practice more\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 285;\

    \ 285\n2 of 23\nsustainable agriculture, minimizing risks of losing the harvest\
    \ by providing (whenever possible) the\nresources (e.g., water and fertilizer)\
    \ needed to secure yield. However, the adoption of new technologies\noften requires\
    \ much up-front investment and is therefore restricted to large-scale production\
    \ and/or\nfarmers with substantial economic resources. This limitation is particularly\
    \ evident for smallholder\nfarmers from developing countries. Nevertheless, satellite-derived\
    \ indices can be used in local\nmanagement to support farmers’ decision making,\
    \ including the rate of irrigation and fertilizer\napplication, and eventually\
    \ yield prediction in wheat [10,11] and other crops [12,13]. While satellite\n\
    images are often freely available, as in the case of Sentinel-2 [14], the resolution\
    \ (not higher than\n100 square meters per pixel), together with the periodicity\
    \ of image acquisition and weather constraints\n(e.g., clouds) and the need for\
    \ computing support and trained staﬀ makes this form of remote sensing\nis unattainable\
    \ for smallholder farmers. Diﬀerent approaches to small-scale-tailored crop management\n\
    have been proposed. For example, site-speciﬁc nitrogen management using leaf color\
    \ charts has\nbeen proposed in irrigated wheat [15,16]. However, the interaction\
    \ of the water regime with nitrogen\nstatus may aﬀect leaf color, making this\
    \ method impractical for rainfed or deﬁcit-irrigation crops.\nA more ﬂexible alternative\
    \ uses optical sensors such as portable spectroradiometers (like, for example,\n\
    the GreenSeeker) [17,18]. However, the cost of the equipment may limit the uptake\
    \ of this approach.\nIn this sense, the use of low-cost remote sensing methods\
    \ to schedule irrigation and fertilization and\npredict yield, such as digital\
    \ conventional imagery and/or infrared thermometry [19], may contribute\nto more\
    \ sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean where\
    \ irrigation\nand fertilization are not optimized in terms of timing and amount.\
    \ While remote sensing has been\nregarded as a potentially useful approach in\
    \ predicting grain yield, an inherent limitation of remote\nsensing methods is\
    \ that the relationships between yield and vegetation indices may be site and\
    \ season\nspeciﬁc, changing between sites and years. Thus, for example, in the\
    \ case of sensor calibration for N\nmanagement, site-year characteristics have\
    \ a critical impact [20]. While new methods for sensor-based\nsite-speciﬁc N management\
    \ are probably needed, it is likely that the best approaches will arise from\n\
    the use of multiple sensors [20,21], therefore increasing the cost of deployment.\
    \ Even when low cost\nremote sensing approaches using single sensors have shown\
    \ great potential in experimental trials with\nwheat [22], their practical application\
    \ needs to be proven.\nThe normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI) is one\
    \ of the most well-known multispectral\nvegetation indices. The NDVI has been\
    \ used extensively to estimate plant biomass [23–25], nitrogen\nstatus [26] and\
    \ yield in wheat and other cereals [27–29]. The leaf chlorophyll content measured\
    \ with\na portable chlorophyll meter, which uses the same principle as the NDVI,\
    \ but on the basis of the\nlight transmitted through the leaf, has also been used\
    \ extensively [30]. As an alternative, information\nderived from conventional\
    \ digital Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images to formulate canopy vegetation\nindices\
    \ is a low-cost and an easy proximal sensing approach to assess grain yield in\
    \ cereals [31–33],\neven when limitations related to shadows and changes in ambient\
    \ light conditions need to be taken into\nconsideration [34]. Information derived\
    \ from RGB images allows estimation of a wide range of crop\ntraits in durum and\
    \ bread wheat, such as early vigor, leaf area index, leaf senescence, aerial biomass\n\
    and grain yield [31,33]. The green area and the greener area are two indices derived\
    \ from conventional\ndigital images [31]. The ﬁrst parameter describes the amount\
    \ of green biomass in the picture, while the\nsecond one excludes the more yellowish-green\
    \ pixels. In fact, greener area is aimed at capturing\nactive photosynthetic area\
    \ and plant senescence [31]. Such indices are formulated using open access\nsoftware\
    \ [19,35].\nIt has been long recognized that plant temperature may represent a\
    \ valuable index to detect\ndiﬀerences in plant water regimes [36–38]. Reynolds\
    \ et al. (2007) [39] have reported that wheat canopy\ntemperature is a relative\
    \ measure of plant transpiration associated with water uptake from the soil.\n\
    Under water limited conditions, transpiration and its associated evaporative cooling\
    \ are reduced,\nresulting in higher leaf temperatures. Given that a major role\
    \ of transpiration is leaf cooling, canopy\ntemperature and its depression relative\
    \ to ambient air temperature is an indicator of the degree to\nwhich transpiration\
    \ cools leaves under a demanding environmental load [40]. In that sense, infrared\n\
    Agronomy 2019, 9, 285\n3 of 23\nthermometry has been proposed as a low-cost approach\
    \ in crop management to enable scheduling of\nsupport irrigation [41], to assess\
    \ spatial soil heterogeneity [42], or to evaluate genotypic performance to\ndrought\
    \ [43]. However, potential interaction eﬀects between N fertilization and water\
    \ regime should\nbe considered. In particular, how does N fertilization aﬀect\
    \ the water by temperature relationships and\neven how does water aﬀect the interaction\
    \ of N fertilization with vegetation indices. This is not trivial\nbecause haying-oﬀ,\
    \ which is the negative eﬀect of nitrogen fertilization on productivity caused\
    \ by an\nimbalance between transpired biomass and the available water, is regarded\
    \ as a potential problem for\nwheat cultivation in Mediterranean regions [44].\
    \ As a consequence, unexpected relationships between\nremote sensing readings\
    \ and grain yield may occur.\nSimilarly, other physiological characteristics related\
    \ to plant water status, such as stable carbon\nisotope composition (δ13C; frequently\
    \ measured as discrimination from the surrounding air, ∆13C)\nare also often used\
    \ for evaluating genotypic performance under water stress [40,44] or even to\n\
    monitor spatial variability and water status [45]. The natural 13C abundance in\
    \ plant matter provides\ntime-integrated information of the eﬀects of water stress\
    \ on the photosynthetic carbon assimilation\nof C3 species, including wheat [46–48].\
    \ Conditions inducing stomatal closure (e.g., water deﬁcit or\nsalinity) restrict\
    \ the CO2 supply to carboxylation sites, which then decreases the ∆13C (or increases\
    \ the\nδ13C) of plant matter [47,49]. Under Mediterranean conditions the δ13C\
    \ of mature kernels is better\ncorrelated with grain yield than the δ13C of other\
    \ plant parts [50]. The costs of these analyses have\ndecreased throughout the\
    \ years, making their analysis increasingly feasible.\nThe objective of this study\
    \ was to assess the grain yield performance of wheat under a range\nof water and\
    \ fertilization conditions in the Mediterranean, using diﬀerent low-cost remote\
    \ sensing\napproaches to assess canopy green biomass (NDVI and vegetation indices\
    \ derived from conventional\nRGB images), and characteristics associated with\
    \ plant water status, (canopy temperature depression),\ntogether with additional\
    \ traits informing on the water status (δ13C of mature grains and the stomatal\n\
    conductance of the ﬂag leaf). The novelty of the study centers on (i) testing\
    \ how diﬀerent low-cost,\nuser-friendly remote sensing techniques may contribute\
    \ to site-speciﬁc wheat management and\neventually to the prediction of yield\
    \ across seasons; and (ii) how interactions between growing\nconditions (water\
    \ regime and N fertilization) may aﬀect the predictive strength of these techniques.\n\
    Moreover, to better explore the potential usefulness of our study for wheat phenotyping\
    \ we developed\na conceptual model of how the combination of these diﬀerent traits\
    \ explains genotypic variability in\ngrain yield under diﬀerent combinations of\
    \ water regimes and nitrogen fertilization.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Plant\
    \ Material and Growing Conditions\nField trials were conducted during the 2014–2015\
    \ crop season at Bir Ould Khelifa in the area of\nKhemis Miliana commune, approximately\
    \ 230 km to the south west of Algiers (Algeria) and with\ngeographical coordinates\
    \ 36◦11′50.23” N and 2◦13′17.69” E. This commune receives an average rainfall\n\
    of between 400 and 450 mm, and it is characterized by clay-silty fertile soils,\
    \ with high organic\nmatter content and high levels of total and mineral nitrogen\
    \ (Table S1). Monthly total accumulated\nrainfall and temperatures for the study\
    \ region for the 2014–2015 crop season are presented in Table S2.\nFour bread\
    \ wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes were planted on 14 December 2014. The\
    \ wheat\ngenotypes were “Ain-Abid” and “Arz” (modern varieties) and “Wifak” and\
    \ “Maaouna” (local varieties).\nThe experimental design was a split-split-plot,\
    \ with the main-plot factor being water regime, the subplot\nfactor was the N\
    \ amount and the sub-subplot factor was genotype (Figure S1). A total of 108 plots\n\
    (four genotypes, three replicates per genotype, three water regimes, and three\
    \ nitrogen fertilization\ntreatments) each with a size of 10 m × 1.2 m and six\
    \ rows, 20 cm apart, were studied. The three water\nregimes consisted of one rainfed\
    \ and two support irrigation treatments of 30 mm (SI-1, a single amount\nof supplemental\
    \ irrigation) and 60 mm (SI-2, a double amount of supplemental irrigation) aimed\
    \ at\nproviding water in the typical range for the agronomic practices in this\
    \ area. Supplementary irrigation\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 285\n4 of 23\nwas applied\
    \ with sprinklers around the beginning of stem elongation. For SI-1, one irrigation\
    \ (30 mm)\nwas applied at the beginning of stem elongation (31 Zadoks stage),\
    \ whereas for SI-2, a second irrigation\nwas also delivered at heading (58 Zadoks\
    \ stage). Nitrogen fertilization was applied using urea fertilizer,\nand treatments\
    \ consisted of no fertilizer (N0) and 60 kg ha−1 and 120 kg ha−1 of nitrogen fertilizer\n\
    (N60, N120 respectively). Application of N fertilization was achieved at two growing\
    \ stages, tillering\nand jointing (26 and 31 Zadoks stages). Plots were harvested\
    \ with a sickle after physiological maturity\nand grain yield was estimated. Thousand\
    \ kernel weight and the number of kernels per square meter\n(Kernel m−2) were\
    \ evaluated.\n2.2. Vegetation Indices\nRemote sensing measurements were performed\
    \ on a sunny day around anthesis (26 March 2015)\nbetween 10 h and 15 h solar\
    \ time. The NDVI was determined with a portable spectroradiometer\n(GreenSeeker\
    \ handheld crop sensor, Trimble, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The NDVI is formulated using\n\
    the following equation: (NIR − R)/(NIR + R), where R is the reﬂectance in the\
    \ red band and NIR is\nthe reﬂectance in the near-infrared band. The distance\
    \ between the sensor and the plots was kept\nconstant at around 50–60 cm above\
    \ and perpendicular to the canopy. Additionally, one conventional\ndigital picture\
    \ was taken per plot, holding the camera about 80 cm above the plant canopy in\n\
    a zenithal plane and focusing near the center of each plot. The images were acquired\
    \ with an\nOlympus E-M10 camera (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), using a 14\
    \ mm lens, triggered\nat a speed of 1/125 seconds with the aperture programmed\
    \ in automatic mode. The size of the\nimages was 4608 × 3456 pixels stored in\
    \ JPG format using RGB color standard [51].\nPictures\nwere analyzed with the\
    \ free-access BreedPix 0.2 software, now integrated within the CerealScanner\n\
    plugin (https://integrativecropecophysiology.com/software-development/cerealscanner/),\
    \ from the\nMediterranean Crop Ecophysiology Group, University of Barcelona [22],\
    \ which was developed for\ndigital image processing. This software quickly provides\
    \ digital values from diﬀerent color properties.\nThe vegetation indices measured\
    \ were the green area (GA) and the greener area (GGA). GA is the\nportion (as\
    \ a %) of pixels with 60 < Hue < 120 from the total amount of pixels, whereas\
    \ greener area\nis formulated as the % of pixels with 80 < Hue < 120 [31,52].\
    \ GGA is designed to capture the active\nphotosynthetic area excluding senescent\
    \ leaves. In addition, the leaf chlorophyll content of ﬁve ﬂag\nleaf blades per\
    \ plot was measured using a Minolta SPAD-502 portable meter (Spectrum Technologies\n\
    Inc., Plainﬁeld, IL, USA).\n2.3. Canopy Temperature Measurements\nCanopy temperature\
    \ (CT) was measured at noon (12 h–14 h), on the same day around anthesis\nas the\
    \ vegetation indices, using an infrared thermometer (PhotoTempTM MXSTMTD, Raytek®,\n\
    Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Measurements were taken above the plants, pointing towards\
    \ the canopy\nat a distance of about one meter and having the sun towards the\
    \ rear. The air temperature was\nmeasured simultaneously for each plot with a\
    \ temperature humidity meter (Testo 177-H1 Logger,\nTesto, Lenzkirch, Germany)\
    \ and employed for the calculation of the canopy temperature depression\n(CTD)\
    \ as the diﬀerence between the ambient and the canopy temperature.\n2.4. Stomatal\
    \ Conductance\nStomatal conductance was measured on the ﬂag leaves on the same\
    \ days as the remote sensing\ntraits. Two measurements per plot were taken around\
    \ noon (12 h–14 h), using a Decagon SC-1 Leaf\nPorometer (Decagon Devices Inc.,\
    \ Pullman, WA, USA).\n2.5. Stable Carbon Isotope Composition\nCarbon isotope composition\
    \ was analyzed in mature grains using an Elemental Analyzer (Flash\n1112 EA; ThermoFinnigan,\
    \ Bremen, Germany) coupled with an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (Delta\nC IRMS,\
    \ ThermoFinnigan, Bremen, Germany) operating in continuous ﬂow mode to determine\
    \ the\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 285\n5 of 23\nstable carbon (13C/12C) isotope ratios.\
    \ Samples of about 0.7 mg of dry matter and reference materials\nwere weighed\
    \ into tin capsules, sealed, and then loaded into an automatic sampler (ThermoFinnigan,\n\
    Bremen, Germany) prior to EAIRMS analysis. Measurements were carried out at the\
    \ Scientiﬁc Facilities\nof the University of Barcelona. The 13C/12C ratios were\
    \ expressed in δ notation determined by:\nδ13C = (13C/12C)sample/(13C/12C)standard\
    \ − 1 [53], where sample refers to plant material and standard to\nPee Dee Belemnite\
    \ (PDB) calcium carbonate. International isotope secondary standards of known\n\
    13C/12C ratios (IAEA CH7 polyethylene foil, IAEA CH6 sucrose, and USGS 40 L-glutamic\
    \ acid) were\nused for calibration to a precision of 0.1%\x18.\n2.6. Statistical\
    \ Analysis\nData were subjected to factorial ANOVA to test the eﬀects of the growing\
    \ conditions (water regime\nand nitrogen fertilization), genotype, and their interaction.\
    \ Mean comparisons were performed using\nTukey’s honestly signiﬁcant diﬀerence\
    \ (HSD) test. Pearson correlation coeﬃcients between grain yield\nand all diﬀerent\
    \ traits were calculated. Multiple linear regression analysis (stepwise) was used\
    \ to\nanalyze grain yield under diﬀerent growing conditions. Data were analyzed\
    \ using IBM SPSS Statistics\n24 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Figures were created\
    \ using Sigma-Plot 11.0 for Windows (Systat\nSoftware Inc., Point Richmond, CA,\
    \ USA).\nThe performance of the diﬀerent remote sensing traits in predicting yield\
    \ performance across\nthe seasons was evaluated using data from the present study,\
    \ together with data already published\nby our team from the two previous seasons\
    \ (2012–2013 and 2013–2014) related to grain yield and\ndiﬀerent remote sensing\
    \ traits measured in a set of genotypes grown under diﬀerent water regimes [54].\n\
    The equations of the linear relationships between these traits and grain yield\
    \ (GY) determined in the\nﬁrst crop season (2012–2013) were further tested during\
    \ the two following crop seasons 2013–2014 and\n2014–2015 (the latter of these\
    \ conducted during the present study). Predicted and measured grain\nyields were\
    \ expressed as relative values; grain yields were normalized with regard to the\
    \ highest yield\ncombination (genotype and growing condition), then the means\
    \ of the three replicates per genotype\nwere calculated. Finally, we performed\
    \ path analyses to quantify the relative contributions of direct\nand indirect\
    \ eﬀects of water status (δ13C, gs and CTD) and vegetation indices (GA, GGA) on\
    \ grain\nyield. This methodology oﬀers the possibility of building associations\
    \ between variables on the basis\nof prior knowledge. Mechanisms that play potential\
    \ roles in grain yield variation and involving\ntraits that exhibited genotypic\
    \ diﬀerences have been proposed, as detailed in the conceptual model\ndisplayed\
    \ in Figure S2. This model was aimed at understanding grain yield responses to\
    \ genotypic\ndiﬀerences under diﬀerent levels of nitrogen fertilization (N0, N60,\
    \ N120) and under diﬀerent water\nregimes (supplementary irrigation and rainfed).\
    \ A model with a comparative ﬁt index (CFI) [42] with\nvalues > 0.9 was taken\
    \ as indicative of a good ﬁt. Data were analyzed using IBM, SPSS, Amos 21\n(SPSS\
    \ Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n3. Results\n3.1. Irrigation and Fertilization Eﬀects\
    \ on Grain Yield\nBoth irrigation and nitrogen fertilization signiﬁcantly aﬀected\
    \ the grain yield (GY) and the\nagronomic yield components (Table 1). The doubled\
    \ amount of supplemental irrigation (SI-2 with all\nnitrogen fertilization combined)\
    \ and the highest nitrogen fertilization N120 (120 kg N ha−1 of fertilizer\nwith\
    \ all irrigations combined) were the growing conditions that exhibited the highest\
    \ grain yield.\nSigniﬁcant interactions only existed for grain yield between genotype\
    \ and water regime (p = 0.049).\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 285\n6 of 23\nTable 1. Mean\

    \ Using Vegetation Indices and Canopy Temperature\nA general model using linear\
    \ regression of the NDVI, GA and CTD with GY in the 2012–2013 crop\nseason was\
    \ developed in this study to estimate GY in the two successive crop seasons (2013–2014\
    \ and\n2014–2015). Only the NDVI, GA and CTD were involved in this model because\
    \ they were the three\nvariables included in the stepwise models to explain the\
    \ diﬀerence in GY in the present study (see\nSection 3.9 below) and were signiﬁcantly\
    \ (p < 0.01) correlated with GY in the ﬁrst crop season [54].\nWith all growing\
    \ conditions and genotypes analyzed together, the predicted and measured grain\
    \ yields\nwere positively and highly signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01) correlated in 2013-2014\
    \ and 2014–2015 (Figure 2)\nusing any of the three parameters studied alone (NDVI,\
    \ GA, CTD). However, the range of normalized\nvalues predicted was smaller, in\
    \ general, using the NDVI (at 2014–2015 crop season) than either of the\nother\
    \ two indices. Predicted and measured GY for the 2013–2014 crop season was also\
    \ positively and\nhighly correlated using the NDVI, GA and CTD (Figure 3) under\
    \ irrigation (SI-2 and SI-1 combined)\nwith N fertilization (N120 and N60 combined)\
    \ and without N fertilization (N0). For the 2014–2015\ncrop season, predicted\
    \ and measured grain yields were also highly signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01) correlated\n\
    using either the NDVI, GA or CTD (Figure 3), but only under irrigation (SI-2 and\
    \ SI-1 combined) with\nN fertilizer (N120 and N60 combined) and with no correlation\
    \ under N0. In the absence of irrigation\n(rainfed conditions) and regardless\
    \ of the N fertilization conditions, we did not ﬁnd any association\nbetween the\
    \ predicted and the measured grain yields (Figure 3). Grain yield estimation was\

    \ levels)\nwere assessed through a stepwise model having GY as the dependent variable\
    \ and any of the vegetation\nindices and water status traits as independent variables.\
    \ The model identiﬁed at least one trait\npositively correlated with GY in only\
    \ four of the nine growing conditions (Table S4).\nAdditionally, a conceptual\
    \ model based on a path analysis was proposed (Figure S2) that separated\ndirect\
    \ acclimation responses in grain yield related to water status traits and vegetation\
    \ indices (through\nGA and GGA). The three water status traits were included in\
    \ the model because they represent\ndiﬀerent scales: Temporal (δ13C), individual\
    \ organ (gs) and canopy (CTD). Concerning the vegetation\nindices, the NDVI was\
    \ discarded because GA (whole photosynthetic biomass) and GGA (non-senescent\n\
    biomass) already tracked the same parameter. The ﬁnal objective of the model was\
    \ to dissect how\nthese physiological traits may have directly or indirectly assessed\
    \ GY performance within diﬀerent\ngrowing conditions. The four path models proposed\
    \ (Figure 4) provided an acceptable ﬁt to the\ndata (CFI > 0.9 in all cases).\
    \ Under irrigation and with and without N fertilizer, gs had a strong and\nnegative\
    \ association with δ13C and strong and positive associations with CTD and GA.\
    \ Signiﬁcant\npaths corresponding to a direct (negative) association of δ13C with\
    \ GY were also observed in irrigation\nconditions without N fertilizer and without,\
    \ while CTD had a positive association with GY only under\nirrigation with N fertilizer.\
    \ A direct positive and strong association of GA with GGA was observed\nunder\
    \ irrigation. GGA was in turn strongly and negatively associated with GY only\
    \ under irrigation\nwithout N fertilizer. Under rainfed conditions, GY was not\
    \ associated with δ13C, but was positively\nassociated with CTD and GGA with N\
    \ fertilizer, and negatively associated with GGA without fertilizer.\nAgronomy\

    \ indicated the dependence of grain yield on the \nwater status traits δ13C and\

    \ Discussion \nThe grain yields achieved, even under the best growing conditions\
    \ (SI-2 with N120) are below 3 \ntonnes per hectare, and this clearly corresponds\
    \ with moderate–low yielding conditions in the \nMediterranean [44,54]. The vegetation\
    \ indices tested in this study, generated either \nspectroradiometrically (NDVI)\
    \ or derived from RGB images, performed well when assessing \ndifferences in water\
    \ conditions. The efficacy of these indices in capturing differences in growth\
    \ and \nsenescence in response to water regime has been reported for wheat already\
    \ [32,33,54]. The choice of \nFigure 4. Path analyses of four wheat genotypes\

    \ conditions with and without N fertilization indicated the dependence of grain\
    \ yield\non the water status traits δ13C and CTD (and the latter also under rainfed\
    \ conditions with N fertilizer).\nIn the absence of N fertilization under both\
    \ irrigation and rainfed conditions, GY seemed strongly and\nnegatively dependent\
    \ on the vegetation index GGA.\n4. Discussion\nThe grain yields achieved, even\
    \ under the best growing conditions (SI-2 with N120) are\nbelow 3 tonnes per hectare,\
    \ and this clearly corresponds with moderate–low yielding conditions\nin the Mediterranean\
    \ [44,54].\nThe vegetation indices tested in this study, generated either\nspectroradiometrically\
    \ (NDVI) or derived from RGB images, performed well when assessing diﬀerences\n\
    in water conditions. The eﬃcacy of these indices in capturing diﬀerences in growth\
    \ and senescence in\nresponse to water regime has been reported for wheat already\
    \ [32,33,54]. The choice of anthesis as the\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 285\n15 of 23\n\
    phenological stage for the remote sensing measurements was decided based on the\
    \ results of Yousﬁ et al.\n(2016) [54] under similar agro-ecological conditions\
    \ as in the present study, together with an additional\nstudy under Mediterranean\
    \ conditions where NDVI and RGB indices were measured periodically\nduring the\
    \ crop cycle [22], with robust correlations between those indices measured at\
    \ anthesis and\ngrain yield being reported. While the argument may be valid that\
    \ any action on N management at\nanthesis is probably too late to signiﬁcantly\
    \ aﬀect yield, particularly for fully irrigated wheat, it may\nstill positively\
    \ aﬀect grain quality. More importantly, scheduling irrigation at anthesis may\
    \ be fully\nrelevant for cereals under Mediterranean conditions where drought\
    \ increases progressively during\nthe reproductive stage of the crop. Thus, following\
    \ previous reports in wheat [54–56], a signiﬁcant\nassociation between the NDVI,\
    \ GA and GGA vegetation indices and the water status parameters\n(δ13C, gs and\
    \ CTD) was also found in this study. The NDVI, GA and GGA were positively associated\n\
    with CTD and gs and negatively associated with δ13C. In this context, Lopes and\
    \ Reynolds (2012) [57]\nreported that the relationship observed between chlorophyll\
    \ retention or ‘stay-green’ (assessed via\nthe NDVI) and canopy temperature would\
    \ conﬁrm the functionality of stay-green in terms of gas\nexchange and would explain\
    \ a better capacity to use water by the stay-green genotypes under stressful\n\
    environments related to low fertilization and the lack of water. Our data conﬁrm\
    \ the close association\nbetween vegetation indices and water status parameters\
    \ and identiﬁed the canopy greenness as a good\nindicator of crop water status\
    \ and irrigation management.\n4.1. Vegetation Indices and Nitrogen Fertilization\n\
    Digital images have been used to evaluate the nitrogen status of crops [58,59].\
    \ Our results showed\nthat GGA was the only vegetation index exhibiting a signiﬁcant\
    \ diﬀerence between N treatments,\nwith lower values found under N0 compared with\
    \ N60 and N120. The absence of N fertilizer limits\nplant growth, whereas it may\
    \ accelerate plant senescence during the reproductive stage of the crop,\ntherefore\
    \ decreasing GGA compared to plants fertilized with nitrogen. In this context,\
    \ [31] described\nthe greener area index (GGA) derived from RGB images is a good\
    \ parameter for capturing active\nphotosynthetic area and plant senescence because\
    \ it is formulated with green pixels alone. Furthermore,\nthe NDVI failed to assess\
    \ diﬀerences under diﬀerent N treatments. Digital pictures provide information\n\
    that is not currently acquired through spectral reﬂectance measurements, such\
    \ as the portion of yellow\nleaves in wheat growing under ﬁeld conditions [31,32,52].\
    \ In the case of GA, this index, which takes\ninto account yellow/green pixels,\
    \ is less stringent in terms of excluding non-senescent parts of the\nplant. This\
    \ may explain why GA measured during anthesis was not aﬀected by N fertilization.\n\
    4.2. Canopy Temperature and Water Status in Wheat\nMany studies have recognized\
    \ canopy temperature depression (CTD) as an indicator of overall\nplant water\
    \ status [36,60] and a potential tool for irrigation management [9,61].\nIn our\
    \ study,\nCTD measured with an infrared thermometer was lower (and even negative)\
    \ under rainfed conditions\ncompared to support irrigation. A priori, a higher\
    \ CTD indicates a greater capacity for transpiration,\nfor taking up water from\
    \ the soil, and therefore for maintaining a better plant water status [36]. In\
    \ the\ncase of the rainfed trials, the fact that the leaf temperature was higher\
    \ than the air temperature indicates\nthat rainfed plants were subjected to severe\
    \ water stress that closed the stomata. In fact, the stomatal\nconductance measured\
    \ in the rainfed plants was very low and one third of that measured under the\n\
    best support-irrigation regime.\nIn addition, Gutierrez et al. (2010) [62] reported\
    \ that the association between canopy temperature\nand the normalized diﬀerence\
    \ water index conﬁrmed that canopy temperature is a good indicator of\nhydration\
    \ status. According to this, our results showed highly signiﬁcant associations\
    \ of CTD with\nδ13C (negative) and gs (positive). Furthermore, CTD seems to be\
    \ a better indicator of the water status\nat the crop level than other traits\
    \ related to water status, such as leaf gs [63]. In our study, CTD was\nstrongly\
    \ associated with δ13C (r = 0.84 ***) under SI-1 at N60, with the NDVI (r = 0.67\
    \ **) under rainfed\nconditions without N, and with grain yield (r = 0.66 **)\
    \ under rainfed conditions at N120, while gs\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 285\n16 of 23\n\
    was not correlated with any of these parameters. These results conﬁrm the close\
    \ association between\ncanopy temperature and other water status parameters and\
    \ identify the canopy temperature as a good\nindicator of crop water status.\n\
    4.3. Relationship of Vegetation Indices and Water Status Traits with GY\nAs found\
    \ in previous studies in wheat, the RGB canopy indices measured at ﬂowering were\n\
    strongly correlated with GY [31,32,64]. For wheat under Mediterranean conditions,\
    \ the reproductive\nstage is usually the best period for crop monitoring, since\
    \ the crop is exposed to increasing stress\n(drought) conditions during the last\
    \ part of the crop cycle. Following on from this, the present study\nrevealed\
    \ a positive relationship between GA and GGA with grain yield under irrigation.\
    \ Additionally,\nstepwise analysis reinforced the evidence for the usefulness\
    \ of the RGB vegetation indices to assess GY.\nThe GA vegetation index was chosen\
    \ by the model as the ﬁrst independent variable, explaining 66% of\nGY variability\
    \ under SI-2 without N fertilizer. Moreover, various studies have reported that\
    \ RGB-based\nindices may perform far better than the NDVI for GY prediction in\
    \ wheat [32,56,65]. In our study,\nthe NDVI failed to assess GY under irrigation.\
    \ In contrast, the NDVI was correlated (positively) with\nGY under rainfed conditions\
    \ and was also the only variable chosen by the stepwise model, explaining\n63%\
    \ of GY variation under rainfed conditions. In this context, Casadesus et al.\
    \ 2007 [18] reported that\nthe NDVI measured at anthesis in durum wheat correlated\
    \ positively with GY under severe water stress\nconditions, but failed to correlate\
    \ under well-watered conditions. Verhulst and Govaerts (2010) [66]\nhave also\
    \ reported that the NDVI has been correlated with long-term water stress. The\
    \ reason for\nthe low correlation of NDVI against GY under well-watered conditions\
    \ is because plant canopies\nduring anthesis are very dense and the measured NDVI\
    \ values become saturated. NDVI is an index\nbased on the strong contrast between\
    \ the near infrared and the red band reﬂectance of a vegetation\ncanopy, and this\
    \ diﬀerence becomes wider as the canopy cover increases. Thus, NDVI works better\n\
    with stress conditions where canopies are sparse and/or early senescence is present\
    \ [27,31]. In any\ncase, anthesis proved to be the correct phenological stage\
    \ for remote sensing evaluations when crops\nunder diﬀerent levels of stress were\
    \ compared, which may be the case for crops exposed to a range of\ndiﬀerent combinations\
    \ of water and nitrogen fertilization conditions.\nFurthermore, the water status\
    \ of plants can also be associated with grain yield. In our study,\nCTD (positively)\
    \ and δ13C (negatively) correlated with GY and both parameters were chosen by\n\
    the stepwise model as the ﬁrst variables to explain GY variation under diﬀerent\
    \ irrigated and\nrainfed growing conditions. In this context, previous studies\
    \ have shown that a higher CTD is\nassociated with increased wheat yield under\
    \ irrigated, hot environments [38,67], but also under\ndryland environments [68].\n\
    However, in our study, and regardless of the water regime (rainfed or irrigation),\
    \ neither the\nvegetation indices (NDVI, GA and GGA) nor the water status indices\
    \ (CTD and δ13C) were associated\nwith GY in the absence of N fertilizer. A lack\
    \ of variability in green biomass and grain yield associated\nwith the lack of\
    \ nitrogen fertilization might explain this outcome.\n4.4. Phenotyping Parameters\
    \ under Diﬀerent Water and N Supplies\nThe results of our study have shown the\
    \ usefulness of vegetation indices with low implementation\ncosts as a means to\
    \ identify genetic variability under diﬀerent growing conditions in the ﬁeld.\
    \ From nine\nof the growing conditions studied (resulting from the combination\
    \ of the three water regimes and the\nthree nitrogen fertilization levels), GY\
    \ was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between genotypes under only two\nof the growing conditions\
    \ (SI-2 at N120 and N60). In contrast, two of the vegetation indices (NDVI,\n\
    GGA) measured at anthesis were able to distinguish between the genotypes growing\
    \ under six of\nthe nine growing conditions (including rainfed), regardless of\
    \ the N fertilization conditions. In this\ncontext, multispectral ground-based\
    \ portable spectroradiometric devices have been used in wheat\nphenotyping [24,27].\
    \ The conventional RGB images have also been proposed as a selection tool for\n\
    cereal breeding [18–20].\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 285\n17 of 23\nThe genotypic diﬀerences\
    \ observed using vegetation indices possibly reﬂect diﬀerences in canopy\nstay\
    \ green during the reproductive stage. Lopes and Reynolds (2012) [57] reported\
    \ that stay-green\nis regarded as a key indicator of stress adaptation. Thus,\
    \ our study revealed the usefulness of the\nvegetation indices to select the most\
    \ tolerant genotypes in terms of retaining a greener biomass during\nthe last\
    \ part of the crop cycle. The three vegetation indices assayed were able to identify\
    \ genotypic\ndiﬀerences, even under the most severe growing conditions, such as\
    \ rainfed with and without N\nfertilizer and where GY failed to detect diﬀerences\
    \ among genotypes. Phenotyping wheat genotypes for\nwater and N fertilization\
    \ deﬁcit at anthesis using these vegetation indices should permit the formulation\n\
    of the best crosses between genotypes. However, by comparison, canopy temperature\
    \ performed much\nworse as a phenotyping parameter in our study. It has been reported\
    \ that CTD is a poor indicator of\nplant performance when the yield is highly\
    \ dependent on limited amounts of soil-stored water [69,70].\nMoreover, the canopy\
    \ in these trials, particularly during the reproductive stages, frequently leaves\n\
    areas of bare soil exposed that may aﬀect the canopy temperature readings. Leaf\
    \ chlorophyll content\nmeasured by a portable device was perfect for distinguishing\
    \ among genotypes, regardless of the water\nstatus (irrigation or rainfed), but\
    \ only when trials were provided with nitrogen fertilizer. Therefore,\nfor the\
    \ agronomic conditions of our study, the vegetation indices assessed at the canopy\
    \ level performed\nbetter as phenotyping tools than canopy temperature and chlorophyll\
    \ content measures.\n4.5. Grain Yield Prediction across Crop Seasons Using Low-Cost\
    \ Remote Sensing Techniques\nThe results of data combining the growing conditions,\
    \ genotypes and replicates support the use\nof diﬀerent aﬀordable remote sensing\
    \ techniques to estimate grain yield across crop seasons. However,\nin agreement\
    \ with Clevers (1997) [71], estimates of crop growth and yield using crop growth\
    \ models\noften lost accuracy as the growing conditions became more stressed.\
    \ The loss of accuracy may be the\nconsequence of a very narrow range of variability\
    \ in grain yield associated with stressed growing\nconditions. Moreover, vegetation\
    \ indices derived from RGB images performed comparatively better\nthan the NDVI,\
    \ probably because GA was less saturated than the NDVI. The application timing\n\
    could have played a critical role here—i.e., saturated NDVI at anthesis is indeed\
    \ not expected to\nperform well, while the saturation pattern of RGB indices is\
    \ less evident. In fact, the acquisition of\nhigh-resolution RGB images is fast\
    \ and its dependence on atmospheric conditions (e.g., sunny versus\ncloudy days)\
    \ is minimal [22,32]. Therefore, the availability, cost and practicality of digital\
    \ cameras\nmake them an ideal tool for the management of crop water and fertilization\
    \ status [19,22]. However,\nin agreement with previous reports, the relationships\
    \ between yield and vegetation were site and\nseason speciﬁc [20,21]. In our study\
    \ models were not able to predict absolute yields, but rather relative\ndiﬀerences\
    \ in yield, which makes the approach unfeasible for yield forecasting, but it\
    \ is still useful\nin terms of crop management and even phenotyping. The strong\
    \ relationships of these vegetation\nand water status indices with grain yield\
    \ expressed in relative units support the eﬀectiveness of these\nlow-cost indices\
    \ in crop management. Nevertheless, whereas the evaluations in the three successive\n\
    seasons were performed in the same region, crop management conditions (water and\
    \ fertilization\nregimes) aﬀected the performance of the models. Hence, to make\
    \ yield predictions more holistic and\neﬀective across diﬀerent environments,\
    \ it is necessary to use more robust calibration; for example,\nincorporating\
    \ site-year covariates or a multi sensor approach [21].\n4.6. An Integrated Model\
    \ to Predict Grain Yield That Combines Remote-Sensing Traits, Canopy Reﬂectance\n\
    Measurements and Grain δ13C\nIn this study, we performed a path analysis to dissect\
    \ how the vegetation indices (GA and GGA)\nand the water status (CTD, δ13C and\
    \ gs) indices directly or indirectly assessed GY performance within\neach of the\
    \ growing conditions assayed. The following parameters may provide suitable coverage\
    \ of\nthe factors aﬀecting GY performance under a given water regime and nitrogen\
    \ fertilization supply:\nVegetation indices as indicators of photosynthetic capacity\
    \ (GA) and the eﬀect of early senescence\n(GGA) on the canopy; CTD which informs\
    \ about the current water status of the canopy; the δ13C\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 285\n\
    18 of 23\nin mature grains as a time-integrated indicator of photosynthetic and\
    \ transpirative gas exchange of\nthe crop; and the water status at the single\
    \ organ level (assessed as the gs of the ﬂag leaf). Under\nirrigation and nitrogen\
    \ fertilization, both δ13C and CTD (indicators of photosynthetic and water status)\n\
    had a direct association with GY. Better grain yield performance is associated\
    \ with higher CTD and\nlower δ13C under supplementary irrigation. The association\
    \ of δ13C (negative) and CTD (positive)\nwith GY is probably due the higher stomatal\
    \ conductance and transpiration, (which increases CTD),\ntherefore increasing\
    \ the photosynthetic capacity even at the expense of a lower water use eﬃciency\n\
    (and thus δ13C) and the consequent increases in GY [47,72]. Under rainfed conditions\
    \ with N fertilizer,\nthe transpiration/water status (assessed through CTD) and\
    \ photosynthetic potential (evaluated through\nvegetation indices) aﬀected GY.\
    \ Under rainfed conditions with N120, CTD had a positive eﬀect on GY.\nWe suggest\
    \ that N fertilization only had a positive eﬀect on grain yield providing that\
    \ there was water\navailable to maintain transpiration (higher CTD), stomatal\
    \ conductance and thus photosynthesis in the\navailable canopy (higher vegetation\
    \ indices).\nIn the absence of nitrogen fertilization, and despite the water conditions\
    \ (irrigated or rainfed),\nthe total canopy area (evaluated through GA) has a\
    \ positive eﬀect on GY. However, an excess of\nyoung (not senescing) leaf area\
    \ (evaluated through GAA) had a strong negative association with GY.\nStay-green\
    \ character may have a negative eﬀect on GY in the absence of nitrogen fertilization\
    \ because\nit limits the retranslocation of N to the inﬂorescences and ultimately\
    \ aﬀects grain ﬁlling. In the case of\nthe rainfed crop fertilized with a limited\
    \ amount of nitrogen (N60), the active canopy area (evaluated\nthrough GGA) had\
    \ a positive eﬀect on grain yield, which may indicate that the limitation is imposed\n\
    by the amount of photosynthetic area rather than by the availability of N to reproductive\
    \ tissues.\nUnder conditions of high nitrogen fertilization (N120) and irrespective\
    \ of the water regime (irrigated\nor rainfed), GY is not aﬀected by the size of\
    \ the canopy or even by its greenness (assessed through GA\nor GGA), but by the\
    \ water status of the crop (evaluated through CTD and δ13C).\n5. Conclusions\n\
    This study demonstrated the potential of low-cost RGB vegetation indices and the\
    \ canopy\ntemperature for the management of growing conditions (essentially the\
    \ water and nitrogen regimes)\nunder Mediterranean conditions. Although the models\
    \ did not predict absolute yields, they are still\nuseful in terms of crop management\
    \ and even phenotyping. Nevertheless, grain yield estimation\nperforms better\
    \ under irrigation than under the low-yielding conditions of rainfed cultivation\
    \ in the\nabsence of nitrogen fertilization and this illustrates one of the potential\
    \ limitations associated with\nthe remote sensing-based yield predictions; they\
    \ are aﬀected by speciﬁc environmental conditions.\nEven though a multispectral\
    \ vegetation index, such as the NDVI is a widely accepted approach to\nmonitor\
    \ changes in growth under diﬀerent conditions, in this study we have shown that\
    \ vegetation\nindices derived from conventional images like the GA and GAA indices\
    \ provided a similar if not better\nprediction of grain yield and at a comparatively\
    \ lower cost than the NDVI. The use of vegetation indices\nderived from RGB images\
    \ to assess GY could be popularized in the near future via apps installed on\n\
    mobile phones.\nThe vegetation indices have also proven their suitability for\
    \ diﬀerentiating among genotypes.\nFurthermore, these traits may contribute through\
    \ path analysis to develop physiological models for\nassessing wheat ideotypes\
    \ best suited to diﬀerent water and nitrogen regimes. The models showed that\n\
    for nitrogen fertilized trials, and regardless of the water regime imposed, the\
    \ water status parameters\nwere the main factors determining GY performance. Moreover,\
    \ a larger green area at anthesis may\nalso contribute to a larger yield. In the\
    \ absence of nitrogen fertilization, a large greener canopy area\n(assessed through\
    \ GGA) at anthesis is a factor that negatively aﬀects grain yield.\nAgronomy 2019,\

    \ advanced remote sensing systems, more accurate retrievals of crop water\nstatus\
    \ are being made at the individual crop level to aid in precision irrigation.\
    \ This paper summarises\nthe use of remote sensing for the estimation of water\
    \ status in horticultural crops. The remote\nmeasurements of the water potential,\
    \ soil moisture, evapotranspiration, canopy 3D structure, and\nvigour for water\
    \ status estimation are presented in this comprehensive review. These parameters\n\
    directly or indirectly provide estimates of crop water status, which is critically\
    \ important for irrigation\nmanagement in farms. The review is organised into\
    \ four main sections: (i) remote sensing platforms;\n(ii) the remote sensor suite;\
    \ (iii) techniques adopted for horticultural applications and indicators of\n\
    water status; and, (iv) case studies of the use of remote sensing in horticultural\
    \ crops. Finally, the\nauthors’ view is presented with regard to future prospects\
    \ and research gaps in the estimation of the\ncrop water status for precision\
    \ irrigation.\nKeywords: UAS; UAV; drone; unmanned; satellite; water stress; irrigation;\
    \ vegetation index\n1. Introduction\nUnderstanding the water status of crops is\
    \ important for optimal management and application\nof water to accommodate for\
    \ inter and intra-ﬁeld variability to achieve a speciﬁc target, such as\nmaximum\
    \ water use eﬃciency, yield, quality, or proﬁtability [1,2]. The importance of\
    \ optimal water\nmanagement in agriculture in semi-arid or arid regions has become\
    \ increasingly important in light\nof recent water scarcities through reduced\
    \ allocations, as well as increased demand due to greater\nareas under production\
    \ [3,4]. Climate change is expected to further intensify the situation due to\n\
    the increased frequency of heatwaves and drought episodes [5]. Climate change\
    \ coupled with the\nnecessity to increase food production due to an increase in\
    \ global population has placed pressure on\nhorticultural sector to improve eﬃciencies\
    \ in resources use, e.g., water, for sustainable farming [6–10].\nHorticultural\
    \ crops will have to produce more ‘crop-per-drop’ in the face of limited water\
    \ resources.\nInformed management of water resources whilst maintaining or increasing\
    \ crop quality and yield are\nthe primary goals of irrigation scheduling in horticulture.\
    \ These goals can be achieved by improving\nour understanding of the water status\
    \ of the crops at key phenological stages of development.\nTraditional decision-making\
    \ for irrigation of horticultural crops includes using information from\na combination\
    \ of sources such as historical regimes, soil moisture measurements, visual assessments\
    \ of\nsoil and/or crop, weather data including evapotranspiration (ET), and measurements\
    \ of crop water\nstatus using direct-, proximal- or remote-sensing techniques\
    \ [11–13]. Some growers undertake routine\nground-based measurements, e.g., pressure\
    \ chamber, for estimation of crop water status to make\ndecisions on irrigation\
    \ [14–16]. These ground-based measurements are robust; however, destructive,\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140; doi:10.3390/agronomy10010140\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n2 of 35\ncumbersome, and expensive to acquire a reasonable\
    \ amount of data [14,16–18]. Consequently, the\nmeasured leaf is assumed to represent\
    \ the average population of leaves of the individual crop, and\na few crops are\
    \ assumed to represent the average population of the entire irrigation block.\
    \ As a\nresult, over- or under-watering can occur, which can lower yield and fruit\
    \ quality [19–22]. This is\nespecially evident for non-homogenous blocks where\
    \ spatial variability of soil and water status is\nexpected [23–25].\nTo address\
    \ some of the limitations of ground-based measurements, remote measurement\ntechniques\
    \ were introduced with capabilities to measure at higher spatial resolution, larger\
    \ area, and\non a regular basis [26–29]. Remote sensing, in particular, unmanned\
    \ aircraft systems (UAS), presents a\nﬂexible platform to deploy on-demand sensors\
    \ as a tool to eﬃciently and non-destructively measure\ncrop water status [30].\
    \ Using thermal and spectral signatures, remote sensing techniques can be used\n\
    to characterise a crop’s water status. Knowledge of crop water status allows growers\
    \ to more eﬃciently\nschedule irrigation (i.e., when and how much water to apply).\
    \ In this regard, UAS platforms provide a\nconvenient methodology to monitor the\
    \ water status across a farm, both spatially and temporally at\nthe canopy level\
    \ [31–33]. The spectral, spatial, and temporal ﬂexibility oﬀered by UAS-based\
    \ remote\nsensing may in future assist growers in irrigation decision-making [34,35].\n\
    This review provides an overview of the application of remote sensing to understand\
    \ the\ncrop’s water status (e.g., leaf/stem water potential, leaf/canopy conductance),\
    \ soil moisture, ET, and\nphysiological attributes, all of which can contribute\
    \ to understanding the crop’s water status to\nimplement precision irrigation.\
    \ Although the key focus of this review is UAS-based remote sensing,\na comparison\
    \ has been undertaken with other remote sensing platforms, such as earth observation\n\
    satellites, which are being increasingly used to acquire similar information.\
    \ In the following sections,\nwe provide an overview of the most common remote\
    \ sensing platforms in horticulture, various sensors\nused for remote sensing,\
    \ and several predictive indices of crop water status. Two case studies of remote\n\
    sensing in horticultural crops, grapevine and almond, are then presented followed\
    \ by an overview of\nthe current research gaps and future prospects.\n2. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms\nGround-based direct or proximal sensors acquire instantaneous\
    \ water status measurement from\na spatial location. For decision-making purposes,\
    \ the data is generally collected from multiple\nlocations across a ﬁeld, which\
    \ allows geospatial interpolation, such as kriging, to be applied [36–38].\nThis\
    \ scale of data collection is, however, cumbersome, ineﬃcient, and error-prone,\
    \ especially for water\nstatus measurements of large areas [17]. Monitoring and\
    \ observing farms at a larger spatial scale\nprompted the launch of several earth\
    \ observation satellite systems that typically operate at an altitude\nof 180–2000\
    \ km [39]. Manned high-altitude aircraft (operating within few km) and, more recently,\
    \ UAS\n(operating under 120 m) ﬁlled the spatial gap between high-resolution ground\
    \ measurements and\nrelatively low-resolution satellite measurements [40,41].\
    \ In the context of water status estimation for\nhorticultural crops, all the\
    \ aforementioned remote sensing platforms are utilised depending on the\nuser\
    \ requirements [23,42,43]. Each remote sensing platform has its own advantage\
    \ and shortcomings.\nThe decision to obtain remote sensing crop water status data\
    \ from one or more of these platforms will\ndepend on the spatial and temporal\
    \ resolution desired. Satellite and manned aircraft can be useful\nfor regional-scale\
    \ characterisation, whereas UAS can be more useful to map the intra-ﬁeld variability.\n\
    Vehicle-based ground systems also possess similar measurement capabilities, like\
    \ remote sensing,\nhowever, at a smaller scale [44,45]. These systems can move\
    \ within the horticultural rows obtaining\nwater status measurements of adjacent\
    \ plants while the vehicle is moving, enabling them to cover a\nrelatively larger\
    \ area as compared to ground-based direct measurements [46–48].\n2.1. Satellite\
    \ Systems\nThe use of satellite systems for remote sensing started with the launch\
    \ of Landsat-1 in 1972 [39,49].\nThe subsequent launch of SPOT-1 in 1986 and Ikonos\
    \ in 1999 opened the era of commercial satellite\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n3 of\
    \ 35\nsystems that resulted in rapid improvement in imaging performance, including\
    \ spatial and spectral\nresolution [50]. Continued launch of satellites from the\
    \ same families, with newer sensor models\nand improved capability, resulted in\
    \ the formation of satellite constellations (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel,\nSPOT, RapidEye,\
    \ GeoEye/WorldView families). The satellite constellation substantially improved\
    \ the\nrevisit cycle of the satellite system [51]. Recently, the miniature form\
    \ of the satellite termed Nanosat or\nCubesat has been developed, which can be\
    \ deployed on the same orbit in a large number (20s–100s),\nenabling frequent\
    \ and high-resolution data acquisition (e.g., Dove satellite from Planet Labs)\
    \ [52].\nThe earth observation satellite system, such as Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS,\
    \ RapidEye, and GeoEye,\nhave been used to study horticultural crops (Table 1).\
    \ These satellite system oﬀer camera systems\nwith spectral bands readily available\
    \ in visible, near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and\nthermal infrared\
    \ (TIR). The measurement in these bands provides opportunities to study a crop’s\
    \ water\nstatus indirectly via, for example, calculation of the normalised diﬀerence\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI),\ncrop water stress index (CWSI), and ET [8–10] at the\
    \ ﬁeld- and regional-scales.\nTable 1. Some satellite systems that have been used\
    \ to study the water status of horticultural crops.\nSatellites\nBand Numbers:\

    \ of bands; V = visible, NIR = near infrared, SWIR = short-wave\ninfrared, TIR\
    \ = thermal infrared, Pan = panchromatic, C = coastal, Ci = cirrus, RE = red edge,\
    \ WV = water vapour.\nThe reﬂected/emitted electromagnetic energy from the crop\
    \ reaching the sensor is recorded at a\nspeciﬁc wavelength. The width of the observed\
    \ wavelength expressed in full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) is called spectral\
    \ resolution. The number of observed bands and the spectral resolution\nindicates\
    \ the ability of the satellite to resolve spectral features on the earth’s surface.\
    \ Commonly used\nearth observation satellite systems possess between four and\
    \ 15 bands with approximately 20–200 nm\nFWHM spectral resolution. The bands are\
    \ generally designated for the visible and NIR region with\nextended capabilities\
    \ in SWIR, TIR, as well as red edge region (Table 1). The most widely used band\n\
    combinations to study the water status of vegetation are the visible, NIR and\
    \ TIR bands [23,25,53,54].\nWith the plethora of satellite systems currently available,\
    \ user requirements on band combination\nmay be achieved by using multiple satellites.\
    \ However, acquiring an extra or a narrower band to the\nexisting capabilities\
    \ is not possible.\nThe ground distance covered per pixel of the satellite image\
    \ is called the spatial resolution,\nwhereby, a higher spatial resolution indicates\
    \ a smaller ground distance. Existing satellite systems,\ndue to their lower spatial\
    \ resolution and large coverage, are suited to study larger regions [55]. For\
    \ a\nsmaller observation area, such as a farm block, an irrigation zone, a single\
    \ row of the horticultural crop,\nor a single canopy, this spatial resolution\
    \ is considered sub-optimal. Often, a pixel of the satellite image\ncomprises\
    \ of multiple rows and multiple canopies of horticultural crops [42,56]. Thus,\
    \ the spectral\nresponse on a single pixel of the satellite image includes a mixed\
    \ spectral signal from the canopy,\ninter-row vegetation and/or bare soil. The\
    \ mixed-pixel is particularly unavoidable in horticultural\ncrops with large inter-row\
    \ surfaces, introducing errors in satellite-based estimations [42,56]. Improving\n\
    the spatial resolution from freely available Landsat/Sentinel satellites (spatial\
    \ resolution 10–15 m) to\nsuch as WorldView-3 (spatial resolution 0.3 m), does\
    \ not necessarily resolve single canopies of many\nhorticultural crops.\nCurrent\
    \ satellite systems generally oﬀer a temporal resolution of about 1–2 weeks this\
    \ resolution\ncorresponds to the satellite’s revisit interval (Table 1). For example,\
    \ freely available Landsat-8 and\nSentinel-2 oﬀer revisit cycles of 16 and 5 days,\
    \ respectively. Although the MODIS sensor on NASA’s\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n\
    4 of 35\nTerra and Aqua satellites oﬀer a greater temporal resolution (1–2 days),\
    \ its spatial resolution is relatively\ncoarse (250 m–1 km) to be valuable for\
    \ horticulture [25]. The revisit cycle of satellites does not alone\nrepresent\
    \ the timeframe on which the data can be interpreted. For instance, post-data\
    \ acquisition,\nthere are often delays in data transfer to the ground station,\
    \ handling, and delivery to the end user.\nThe end user then needs to process\
    \ the data before making an interpretation. Such processing can\nbe a combination\
    \ of atmospheric, radiometric, and geometric corrections, where applicable [57,58].\n\
    Furthermore, as the agricultural applications of the satellite imagery are illumination\
    \ sensitive and\nweather dependent, conditions have to be optimal on the satellite\
    \ revisit day to avoid data corruption\ndue to, for example, cloud cover [23,53].\
    \ Cloud corrupted data (~55% of the land area is covered by\ncloud at any one\
    \ time [59]) will require users to wait for the next revisit to attempt the data\
    \ acquisition.\nTime-series image fusion techniques, such as the spatial and temporal\
    \ adaptive reﬂectance fusion\nmodel, can improve the spatial and temporal resolution\
    \ of the satellite data [60,61]. These fusion\ntechniques blend the frequent (however\
    \ low-resolution) with higher-resolution (but infrequent) satellite\ndata [62,63].\
    \ The result combines the best aspects of multiple satellite systems to produce\
    \ frequent and\nhigher-resolution data, which can be useful for timely monitoring\
    \ of water status.\nThe clear advantage of the satellite system is the ability\
    \ to capture data at a large scale and at an\naﬀordable cost (e.g., the user can\
    \ download Landsat and Sentinel data for free). The compromise with\nthe satellite\
    \ data is in spatial resolution, as well as the relatively long revisit cycle\
    \ (in the order of days\nto weeks), making the data less than ideal for speciﬁc\
    \ applications, e.g., irrigation scheduling.\n2.2. Manned Aircraft System\nOperating\
    \ within few kilometres above ground level, manned aircraft have been used to\
    \ remotely\nacquire agricultural data at higher spatial detail (compared to the\
    \ satellites) and over a larger region\n(compared to UAS) [42,64]. Light ﬁxed-wing\
    \ aircraft and helicopters are the commonly used manned\naircraft employed in\
    \ agricultural remote sensing. The ﬁxed-wing aircraft generally ﬂies higher and\n\
    faster, enabling the coverage of a larger area, whereas the helicopters are traditionally\
    \ ﬂown lower\nand slower, enabling a spatially detailed observation. A signiﬁcant\
    \ advantage of the manned aircraft,\ncompared to UAS, lies in their ability to\
    \ carry heavier high-grade sensors, such as AVIRIS, HyPlant,\nHySpex SWIR-384,\
    \ Specim AisaFENIX, and Riegl LMS Q240i-60 [65–67]. The use of manned aircraft\
    \ is,\nhowever, limited by high operational complexity, safety regulations, scheduling\
    \ inﬂexibility, costs, and\nproduct turnaround time. As a result, these platforms\
    \ are barely used as compared to the recent surge\nin the use of UAS, speciﬁcally\
    \ for horticultural crops [68–70].\nIn horticulture, manned aircraft was used\
    \ to characterise olive and peach canopy temperature\nand water stress using speciﬁc\
    \ thermal bands (10.069 µm and 12.347 µm) of a wideband (0.43–12.5 µm)\nairborne\

    \ = 0.45–0.57)\nof ground vs. aerial olive canopy temperature measurements [72],\
    \ and high correlations (R2 = 0.94)\nof canopy temperature vs. peach fruit size\
    \ (diameter) [71]. The advantage of manned aircraft for\nremote sensing of a large\

    3. Remote Sensor Types\n3.1. Digital Camera\nA digital camera typically incorporates\
    \ an RGB, modiﬁed RGB, and a monochrome digital camera.\nThe lens quality of the\
    \ camera determines the sharpness of the image, while the resolution of the\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n7 of 35\ncamera determines its spatial resolution and\
    \ details within an image. The RGB camera uses broad\nspectral bandwidth within\
    \ the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received at the\n\
    visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to retrieve\
    \ dimensional properties\nof the crop, terrain conﬁguration, macrostructure of\
    \ the ﬁeld, and the spatial information. Based on\nthe dimensional properties,\
    \ such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the resource need\n\
    practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to\
    \ more quickly use available\nwater resources, resulting in crop water stress\
    \ at a later stage of the season if irrigation is not suﬃcient.\nThe evolution\
    \ of canopy structure within and between seasons can be useful to understand the\
    \ spatial\nvariability within the ﬁeld and corresponding water requirements. The\
    \ macro-structure of horticultural\ncrops, such as row height, width, spacing,\
    \ crop count, the fraction of ground cover, and missing\nplants, can be identiﬁed\
    \ remotely, which can aid in the allocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain\n\
    conﬁguration in the form of a digital elevation model (DEM) generated from a digital\
    \ camera can also\nenable understanding of the water status in relation to the\
    \ aspect and slope conﬁguration of the terrain.\n3.2. Multispectral Camera\nA\
    \ multispectral camera oﬀers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum.\nMost common airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which include\
    \ rededge and NIR\nbands in addition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g., Figure\
    \ 3a,c). Conﬁgurable ﬁlter placement of\nthe spectral band is also available,\
    \ which can potentially target certain physiological responses of\nhorticultural\
    \ crops [102]. Spectrally, the airborne multispectral camera has been reported\
    \ to perform\nwith consistency, producing reliable measurements following radiometric\
    \ calibration and atmospheric\ncorrection [123–125].\nTheir spatial resolution\
    \ has been found to be suﬃcient for horticultural\napplications enabling canopy\
    \ level observation of the spectral response. For this reason, as well as\nrelatively\
    \ low cost, multispectral cameras are used more frequently in horticulture applications.\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n7 of 35 \n \nof the camera determines its spatial resolution\
    \ and details within an image. The RGB camera uses \nbroad spectral bandwidth\
    \ within the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received \n\
    at the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to\
    \ retrieve dimensional \nproperties of the crop, terrain configuration, macrostructure\
    \ of the field, and the spatial information. \nBased on the dimensional properties,\
    \ such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the \nresource need\
    \ practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to\
    \ more \nquickly use available water resources, resulting in crop water stress\
    \ at a later stage of the season if \nirrigation is not sufficient. The evolution\
    \ of canopy structure within and between seasons can be \nuseful to understand\
    \ the spatial variability within the field and corresponding water requirements.\
    \ \nThe macro-structure of horticultural crops, such as row height, width, spacing,\
    \ crop count, the \nfraction of ground cover, and missing plants, can be identified\
    \ remotely, which can aid in the \nallocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain\
    \ configuration in the form of a digital elevation model \n(DEM) generated from\
    \ a digital camera can also enable understanding of the water status in relation\
    \ \nto the aspect and slope configuration of the terrain. \n3.2. Multispectral\
    \ Camera \nA multispectral camera offers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum. Most \ncommon airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which\
    \ include rededge and NIR bands in \naddition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g.,\
    \ Figure 3a,c). Configurable filter placement of the spectral \nband is also available,\
    \ which can potentially target certain physiological responses of horticultural\

    \ between the red and NIR band is unique to live green vegetation\nand is captured\
    \ by vegetation spectral index called NDVI (Table 2, Equation (3)). Once the vegetation\n\
    starts to experience stress (biotic and abiotic), its reﬂectance in the NIR region\
    \ is reduced, while the\nreﬂectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress\
    \ is reﬂected in the vegetation proﬁle and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n8 of 35\n\
    easily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this reason, NDVI has shown correlations\
    \ with a wide\narray of crops response including vigour, chlorophyll content,\
    \ leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress,\nand occasionally yield [34,82–84,127].\n\
    The rededge band covers the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between the\
    \ red and NIR\nbands where reﬂectance increases drastically. Studies have suggested\
    \ that the sharp transition between\nthe red absorbance and NIR reﬂection is able\
    \ to provide additional information about vegetation and\nits hydric characteristics\
    \ [128]. Using the normalised diﬀerence red edge (NDRE) index, the rededge\nband\
    \ was found to be useful in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration\
    \ map [127]. Given the\nsensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications,\
    \ such as crops drought stress [107]. With regard to\nthe water use eﬃciency,\
    \ a combination of vegetation indices (VIs) along with structural physiological\n\
    indices were found to be useful to study water stress in horticultural crops [34,82,129].\n\
    3.3. Hyperspectral\nHyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled\
    \ at a narrower wavelength intervals\nspanning from visible to NIR spectrum at\
    \ a high to ultra-high spectral resolution (Figure 3d). Scanning\nat contiguous\
    \ narrow-band wavelengths, a hyperspectral sensor produces a three dimensional\
    \ (two\nspatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral\
    \ data cube. The hyperspectral\ndata cube is a hyperspectral image where each\
    \ pixel contain spatial information, as well as the entire\nspectral reﬂectance\
    \ curve [130]. Based on the operating principle and output data cube, hyperspectral\n\
    sensors for remote sensing can include a point spectrometer (aka spectroradiometer),\
    \ whiskbroom\nscanner, pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131].\
    \ A point spectrometer, samples\nwithin its ﬁeld of view solid angle to produce\
    \ an ultra-high spectral resolution spectral data of a\npoint [130,132]. A whiskbroom\
    \ scanner deploys a single detector onboard to scan one single pixel at a\ntime.\
    \ As the scanner rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of the data\
    \ cube, and as the\nplatform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a\
    \ hyperspectral image [133]. A pushbroom\nscanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous\
    \ detectors arranged in the perpendicular direction of\ntravel and scans the entire\
    \ row of pixels at a time. As the platform moves forward, the successive\nrows\
    \ form a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager using diﬀerent\
    \ scanning\ntechniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene\
    \ [135,136]. The point spectrometer\noﬀers the highest spectral resolution and\
    \ lowest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible\nhyperspectral sensors\
    \ [137,138].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n8 of 35 \n \nstarts to experience stress\
    \ (biotic and abiotic), its reflectance in the NIR region is reduced, while the\
    \ \nreflectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress is reflected in\
    \ the vegetation profile and \neasily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this\
    \ reason, NDVI has shown correlations with a wide \narray of crops response including\
    \ vigour, chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress, \nand\
    \ occasionally yield [34,82–84,127]. \nThe rededge band covers the portion of\
    \ the electromagnetic spectrum between the red and NIR \nbands where reflectance\
    \ increases drastically. Studies have suggested that the sharp transition \nbetween\
    \ the red absorbance and NIR reflection is able to provide additional information\
    \ about \nvegetation and its hydric characteristics [128]. Using the normalised\
    \ difference red edge (NDRE) \nindex, the rededge band was found to be useful\
    \ in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration \nmap [127]. Given the\
    \ sensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications, such as crops drought\
    \ stress \n[107]. With regard to the water use efficiency, a combination of vegetation\
    \ indices (VIs) along with \nstructural physiological indices were found to be\
    \ useful to study water stress in horticultural crops \n[34,82,129]. \n3.3. Hyperspectral\
    \ \nHyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled at a narrower\
    \ wavelength \nintervals spanning from visible to NIR spectrum at a high to ultra-high\
    \ spectral resolution (Figure \n3d). Scanning at contiguous narrow-band wavelengths,\
    \ a hyperspectral sensor produces a three \ndimensional (two spatial dimensions\
    \ and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral data \ncube. The hyperspectral\
    \ data cube is a hyperspectral image where each pixel contain spatial \ninformation,\
    \ as well as the entire spectral reflectance curve [130]. Based on the operating\
    \ principle \nand output data cube, hyperspectral sensors for remote sensing can\
    \ include a point spectrometer (aka \nspectroradiometer), whiskbroom scanner,\
    \ pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131]. A \npoint spectrometer,\
    \ samples within its field of view solid angle to produce an ultra-high spectral\
    \ \nresolution spectral data of a point [130,132]. A whiskbroom scanner deploys\
    \ a single detector onboard \nto scan one single pixel at a time. As the scanner\
    \ rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of \nthe data cube, and as\
    \ the platform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a hyperspectral\
    \ \nimage [133]. A pushbroom scanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous detectors\
    \ arranged in the \nperpendicular direction of travel and scans the entire row\
    \ of pixels at a time. As the platform moves \nforward, the successive rows form\
    \ a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager \nusing different\
    \ scanning techniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene\
    \ \n[135,136]. The point spectrometer offers the highest spectral resolution and\
    \ lowest signal-to-noise \nratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible hyperspectral\
    \ sensors [137,138]. \n \nFigure 4. The data cube structure of different spectral\
    \ sensors. The number of bands and resolution is \nshown as an example and does\
    \ not indicate true sensor capability (adapted from [130]). \nFigure 4. The data\
    \ cube structure of diﬀerent spectral sensors. The number of bands and resolution\
    \ is\nshown as an example and does not indicate true sensor capability (adapted\
    \ from [130]).\nIn horticultural applications, hyperspectral data, due to the\
    \ high resolution contiguous spectral\nsampling, possesses tremendous potential\
    \ to detect and monitor speciﬁc biotic and abiotic stresses [139].\nNarrowband\
    \ hyperspectral data was used to detect water stress using the measurement of\
    \ ﬂuorescence\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n9 of 35\nand PRI over a citrus orchard\
    \ [110]. PRI was identiﬁed as one of the best predictors of water stress for a\n\
    vineyard in a study that investigated numerous VIs using hyperspectral imaging\
    \ [140]. High-resolution\nthermal imagery obtained from a hyperspectral scanner\
    \ was used to map canopy stomatal conductance\n(gs) and CWSI of olive orchards\
    \ where diﬀerent irrigation treatments were applied [18]. With the\nlarge volume\
    \ of spatial/spectral data extracted from the hyperspectral data cube, machine\
    \ learning\nwill likely be adopted more widely in the horticultural environment\
    \ to model water stress [141].\nSee Reference [54] for a comprehensive review\
    \ of hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing to detect\nplant water status.\n\
    3.4. Thermal\nThermal cameras use microbolometers to read passive thermal signals\
    \ in the spectral range of\napproximately 7–14 µm (Figure 3b). Small UAS are capable\
    \ of carrying a small form-factor thermal\ncamera with uncooled microbolometers,\
    \ which does not use an internal cooling mechanism and,\ntherefore, does not achieve\
    \ the high SNR that can be found in cooled microbolometer-based thermal\ncameras.\
    \ An array of microbolometer detectors in the thermal camera receives a thermal\
    \ radiation\nsignal and stores the signal on the corresponding image pixel as\
    \ raw data number (DN) values.\nThe result is a thermal image where each pixel\
    \ has an associated DN value, which can be converted to\nabsolute temperature.\
    \ A representative list of commercial thermal cameras used on UAS platforms\n\
    and their applications with regard to agricultural remote sensing is found in\
    \ the literature [23,53,73].\nThermal imagery enables the measurement of the foliar\
    \ temperature of plants. The foliar temperature\ndiﬀerence between well-watered\
    \ and water-stressed crops is the primary source of information for\nwater stress\
    \ prediction using a thermal sensor [142]. When mounted on a remote sensing platform,\
    \ the\ncanopy level assessment of crop water status can be performed on a large\
    \ scale.\nThermal cameras are limited by their resolution (e.g., 640 × 512 is\
    \ the maximum resolution of\nUAS compatible thermal cameras in the current market)\
    \ and high price-tag [53]. The small number of\npixels results in low spatial\
    \ resolution limiting either the ability to resolve a single canopy or ability\
    \ to\nﬂy higher and cover a larger area. If ﬂown at a higher altitude, the eﬀective\
    \ spatial resolution may\nbe inadequate for canopy level assessment of some horticultural\
    \ crops. For example, a FLIR Tau2\n640 thermal camera with a 13 mm focal length\
    \ when ﬂown at an altitude of approximately 120 m\nresults in a spatial resolution\
    \ of 15.7 cm. For relatively large horticultural crops, such as grapevine,\nalmond,\
    \ citrus, and avocado, the resolution at a maximum legal ﬂying altitude of 120\
    \ m in Australia\n(for small-sized UAS) oﬀers an adequate spatial resolution to\
    \ observe a single canopy.\nAnother challenge with the use of thermal cameras\
    \ is the temporal drift of the DN values\nwithin successive thermal images, especially\
    \ with uncooled thermal cameras [143]. Due to the lack\nof an internal cooling\
    \ mechanism for the microbolometer detectors, DN values registered by the\nmicrobolometers\
    \ experience temporal drift i.e., the registered DN values for the same temperature\n\
    target will drift temporally. Thus, the thermal image can be unreliable especially\
    \ when the internal\ntemperature of the camera is changing rapidly, such as during\
    \ camera warmup period or during the\nﬂight when a gust of cool wind results in\
    \ cooling of the camera. To overcome this challenge, the user\nmay need to provide\
    \ suﬃcient startup time before operation (preferably 30–60 min) [102,143–145],\n\
    shield the camera to minimize the change in the internal temperature of the camera\
    \ [142], calibrate the\ncamera [146–153], and perform frequent ﬂat-ﬁeld corrections.\n\
    3.5. Multi-Sensor\nTo carry multiple sensors, the total UAS payload needs to be\
    \ considered that includes, in\naddition to the sensors, an inertial measurement\
    \ unit (IMU) and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) for the georeferencing\
    \ purpose [40,154]. Higher accuracy sensors tend to be heavier, and in\na multi-sensor\
    \ scenario, the payload can quickly reach or even exceed the payload limit. This\
    \ has\nlimited contemporary measurements in earlier multirotor UAS requiring separate\
    \ ﬂights for each of\nsensor [126]. The use of ﬁxed-wing UAS has allowed carrying\
    \ higher payloads due to the much larger\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n10 of 35\nthrust-to-weight\
    \ ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155]. Similarly, recent advancement\
    \ in\nUAS technology and lightweight sensors have enabled multirotor (payload\
    \ 5–6 kg readily available) to\nonboard multi-sensors.\nWater status of crops\
    \ is a complex process inﬂuenced by a number of factors including the\nphysiology\
    \ of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and vigour of the crop, and meteorological\n\
    factors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this reason, a multi-sensor platform is used\
    \ to acquire measurements\nof the diﬀerent aspects of the crop for water status\
    \ assessment [34,102,108]. The most common\ncombination of sensors found in the\
    \ literature is the RGB, multispectral (including rededge and NIR\nbands) and\
    \ thermal. Together, these sensors can be used to investigate the water status\
    \ of the crop\nusing various indicators, such as PRI, CWSI, ﬂuorescence, and structural\
    \ properties, with the aim of\nimproving the water use eﬃciency [102,110,158–160].\n\
    4. Techniques of Remote Sensing in Horticulture\n4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely\
    \ Sensed Images\nGeoreferencing provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed\
    \ images such that the pixels\nrepresenting crops or regions of interest on the\
    \ images are correctly associated with their position on\nEarth. The georeferencing\
    \ process generally uses surveyed coordinate points on the ground, known\nas ground\
    \ control points (GCPs), to determine and apply scaling and transformation to\
    \ the aerial\nimages [161]. Alternatively, instead of GCPs, the user can georeference\
    \ aerial images by using the\naccurate position of the camera, or by co-registration\
    \ with the existing georeferenced map [105,162].\nIn the case of UAS-based images,\
    \ the capture timing is scheduled to ensure a recommended\nforward overlap (>80%)\
    \ between successive images.\nThe ﬂight path is designed to ensure the\nrecommended\
    \ side overlap (>70%) between images from successive ﬂight strips. Thus, the captured\n\
    series of images are processed using the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) technique\
    \ to generate a 3D\npointcloud and orthomosaic [73,130] (see Figure 5). Commonly\
    \ used SfM software to process the\nremote sensing images are Agisoft PhotoScan\
    \ and Pix4D. The commonly retrieved outputs from the\nSfM software for assessment\
    \ of horticulture crops include the orthomosaic, digital surface model\n(DSM),\
    \ DEM, and 3D pointcloud [113,126,163]. This technique of georeferencing can be\
    \ applied to any\nsensor that produces images, e.g., RGB, thermal, or multispectral\
    \ cameras [126,164,165].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n10 of 35 \n \nsensor [126].\
    \ The use of fixed-wing UAS has allowed carrying higher payloads due to the much\
    \ larger \nthrust-to-weight ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155].\
    \ Similarly, recent advancement in \nUAS technology and lightweight sensors have\
    \ enabled multirotor (payload 5–6 kg readily available) \nto onboard multi-sensors.\
    \ \nWater status of crops is a complex process influenced by a number of factors\
    \ including the \nphysiology of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and\
    \ vigour of the crop, and meteorological \nfactors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this\
    \ reason, a multi-sensor platform is used to acquire measurements \nof the different\
    \ aspects of the crop for water status assessment [34,102,108]. The most common\
    \ \ncombination of sensors found in the literature is the RGB, multispectral (including\
    \ rededge and NIR \nbands) and thermal. Together, these sensors can be used to\
    \ investigate the water status of the crop \nusing various indicators, such as\
    \ PRI, CWSI, fluorescence, and structural properties, with the aim of \nimproving\
    \ the water use efficiency [102,110,158–160]. \n4. Techniques of Remote Sensing\
    \ in Horticulture \n4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely Sensed Images \nGeoreferencing\
    \ provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed images such that the pixels\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n11 of 35\nThe complexity of georeferencing of hyperspectral\
    \ observations depends on the sensor type, i.e.,\nimaging or non-imaging. A non-imaging\
    \ spectroradiometer relies on the use of a GNSS antenna and\nan IMU for georeferencing\
    \ the point observation [130,132,138,168]. An imaging hyperspectral camera,\n\
    generally, in addition to GNSS and IMU measurement, uses the inter-pixel relation\
    \ in SfM to produce a\ngeoreferenced orthomosaic [40,134,135,169,170].\n4.2. Calibration\
    \ and Correction of Remotely Sensed Images\nEnsuring consistency, repeatability,\
    \ and quality of the spectral observation requires stringent\nradiometric, spectral,\
    \ and atmospheric corrections [123,171–177]. Spectral and radiometric calibration\n\
    is performed in the spectral calibration facility in darkroom settings. The sensor’s\
    \ optical properties\nand shift in spectral band position are corrected during\
    \ the spectral calibration process. Radiometric\ncalibration enables conversion\
    \ of the recorded digital values into physical units, such as radiance.\nInﬁeld\
    \ operation of the spectral sensor is inﬂuenced by variations in atmospheric transmittance\n\
    from thin clouds, invisible to the human observer. Changes in atmospheric transmittance\
    \ aﬀect the\nradiance incident on the plant. As a result, the change in acquired\
    \ spectral response by the sensor\nmay not represent the change in plants response\
    \ but the change in incident radiation on the plant.\nThe most common method to\
    \ convert the spectral data to reﬂectance is by generating an empirical line\n\
    relationship between sensor values and spectral targets, such as a Spectralon®\
    \ or calibration targets.\nThe use of downwelling sensors, such as a cosine corrector\
    \ [137], or the use of a ground-based PAR\nsensor enables absolute radiometric\
    \ calibration to generate radiance [130].\nThe calibration of the broad wavelength\
    \ multispectral sensor is generally less stringent than\nthe hyperspectral. Generally,\
    \ multispectral sensors are used to compute normalised indices such\nas NDVI.\
    \ The normalised indices are relatively less inﬂuenced, although signiﬁcant, by\
    \ the change\nin illumination conditions which aﬀect the entire spectrum proportionally\
    \ [29,101]. In this regard,\nradiometric calibration of the multispectral camera\
    \ has used a range of stringent to simpliﬁed, and\nvicarious approaches [123,125,171,173,178–180].\
    \ Some multispectral cameras are equipped with a\ndownwelling light sensor, which\
    \ is aimed at correcting for variations in atmospheric transmittance.\nHowever,\
    \ the performance of such downwelling sensors (without a cosine corrector) on\
    \ multispectral\ncameras have been reported to have directional variation resulting\
    \ in unstable correction, indicating\nthe inability of the sensor to incorporate\
    \ the entire hemisphere of diﬀused light [124,137].\nThe radiometric calibration\
    \ of the thermal images is typically based on the camera’s DN to object\ntemperature\
    \ curve, which provides the relationship between the DN of a pixel and a known\
    \ object\ntemperature, usually of a black body radiator. Measurement accuracy\
    \ and SNR of the camera under\nvarying ambient temperatures can be improved by\
    \ using calibration shutters, which are recently\navailable commercially. Furthermore,\
    \ for low measurement errors (under 1 ◦C), thermal data requires\nconsideration\
    \ to the atmospheric transmittance [18,102]. Flying over a few temperature reference\n\
    targets placed on the ground reduces the temporal drift of the camera [142,143,181].\
    \ Temperature\naccuracy within a few degrees was achieved by ﬂying over the targets\
    \ three times (at the start, middle\nand end of UAS operation) and using three\
    \ separate calibration equations for each overpass [142].\nAdditionally, using\
    \ the redundant information from multiple overlapping images, drift correction\n\
    models have been proposed, which lowered temperature error by 1 ◦C as compared\
    \ to uncorrected\northomosaic [152]. The manufacturer stated accuracies (generally\
    \ ±5 ◦C) can be suﬃcient to access the\nﬁeld variability and to detect “hotspots”\
    \ of water status. However, the aforementioned calibration and\ncorrection of\
    \ the thermal cameras are required for quantitative measurement as a goal [143].\
    \ In this\nregard, current challenges and best practices for the operation of\
    \ thermal cameras onboard a UAS is\nprovided in the literature [143].\n4.3. Canopy\
    \ Data Extraction\nA key challenge in remote sensing of horticultural as compared\
    \ to agricultural crops arises due\nto the proportion of inter-row ground/vegetation\
    \ cover and resulting mixed pixels. The proportion\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n12\
    \ of 35\nof the mixed pixels increases with the decrease in spatial resolution\
    \ of the image. Most of the pixels\ntowards the edge of the canopy contain a blend\
    \ of information originating from the sun-lit canopy,\nshadowed leaves, and inter-row\
    \ bare soil/cover crop. A further challenge can arise for some crops,\nsuch as\
    \ grapevine, due to overlapping of adjacent plants.\nThe canopy data from orthomosaic\
    \ has been extracted using either a pixel-based or an object-based\napproach.\
    \ Earlier studies manually sampled from the centre of crop row which most likely\
    \ eliminated\nthe mixed pixels [182]. In the pixel-based approach, techniques,\
    \ such as applying global threshold\nand masking, have been used. Binary masks,\
    \ such as NDVI, eliminates non-canopy pixels from\nthe sampling [82,84]. Combining\
    \ the NDVI mask with the canopy height mask can exclude the\npixels associated\
    \ with non-vegetation, as well as vegetation that does not meet the height threshold.\n\
    The pixel-based approach, however, can result in inaccurate identiﬁcation of some\
    \ crops due to pixel\nheterogeneity, mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and crop\
    \ pattern variability.\nIn the object-based approach, using object detection techniques,\
    \ neighbouring pixels with\nhomogenous information, such as spectral, textural,\
    \ structural, and hierarchical features, are grouped\ninto “objects”. These objects\
    \ are used as the basis of object-based image analysis (OBIA) classiﬁcation\n\
    using classiﬁers, such as k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, support vector machine,\
    \ random forest,\nand maximum likelihood [122,183–185]. In the horticultural environment,\
    \ OBIA has been adopted\nto classify and sample from pure canopy pixels [119,122,186].\
    \ Consideration should be provided on\nthe number of features and their suitability\
    \ for a speciﬁc application to reduce the computational\nburden, as well as to\
    \ maintain the accuracies. The generalisation of these algorithms for transferability\n\
    between study sites usually penalises the achievable accuracy. For details in\
    \ object-based approach of\nsegmentation and classiﬁcation, readers are directed\
    \ to literatures [122,183,185,187–189].\nOther techniques found in the literature\
    \ include algorithms, such as ‘Watershed’, which has been\ndemonstrated in palm\
    \ orchards [82,190]. Vine rows and plants have been isolated and classiﬁed using\n\
    image processing techniques, such as clustering and skeletisation [188,191–193].\
    \ Similarly, the gridded\npolygon, available in common GIS software, such as ArcGIS\
    \ and QGIS, can be used in combination\nwith zonal statistics for this purpose.\
    \ When working with the low-resolution images, co-registration\nwith the high-resolution\
    \ images has been proposed, whereby, the high-resolution images enable better\n\
    delineation of the mixed pixels [194]. For this reason, spectral and thermal sensors,\
    \ which are usually\nlow in resolution, are generally employed along with high-resolution\
    \ digital cameras.\n4.4. Indicators of Crop Water Status\nA crop’s biophysical\
    \ and biochemical attributes can be approximated using diﬀerent indices and\n\
    quantitative products. For example, CWSI is used to proxy leaf water potential\
    \ (Ψleaf), stem water\npotential (Ψstem), gs, and net photosynthesis (Pn) [83,100,195].\
    \ With regard to horticultural crops, water\nstatus has been assessed using a\
    \ number of spectral and thermal indices (Table 2).\nTable 2. Commonly used vegetation\

    A plant maintains its temperature by transpiring through the stomata to balance\
    \ the energy\nﬂuxes in and out of the canopy. As the plant experience stress (both\
    \ biotic and abiotic), the rate of\ntranspiration decreases, which results in\
    \ higher canopy temperature (Tc), which can be a proxy to\nunderstand the water\
    \ stress in the plant [207]. In this regard, crop water stress showed a correlation\n\
    with canopy temperature extracted from the thermal image [208], which enables\
    \ mapping the spatial\nvariability in water status [209]. Leaf/canopy temperature\
    \ alone, however, does not provide a complete\ncharacterisation of crop water\
    \ status, for instance, an equally stressed canopy can be 25 ◦C or 35 ◦C,\ndepending\
    \ on the current ambient temperature (Ta). Thus, canopy-to-air temperature diﬀerence\n\
    (Tc − Ta) was proposed, which showed a good correlation with the Ψstem, Ψleaf,\
    \ and gs in horticultural\ncrops [85,99,182].\n4.4.2. Normalised Thermal Indices\n\
    The CWSI, the conductance index (Ig) and the stomatal conductance index (I3) are\
    \ thermal\nindices most commonly used to estimate crop water status and gs [210–212].\
    \ These indices provide\nsimilar information, however, use a diﬀerent range of\
    \ numbers to represent the level of water stress.\nThe CWSI is normalised within\
    \ zero and one, whereas Ig and I3 represent stress using numbers\nbetween zero\
    \ and inﬁnity. CWSI has been adopted most widely in horticultural applications\
    \ to\nassess the water status of crops, such as the grapevines [100,213], almond\
    \ [91,198], citrus [85,110], and\nothers [18,87,99,214]. By normalising between\
    \ the lower and upper limits of (Tc − Ta), the CWSI of the\ncanopy presents quantiﬁable\
    \ relative water stress. The formula for CWSI computation is deﬁned as in\nEquation\
    \ (1) [208,212].\nCWSI =\n(Tc − Ta) − (Tc − Ta)LL\n(Tc − Ta)UL − (Tc − Ta)LL\n\
    (1)\nwhere (Tc − Ta)UL and (Tc − Ta)LL represent the upper and lower bound of\
    \ (Tc − Ta) which are found in\nthe water-stressed canopy and well-watered canopy\
    \ transpiring at the full potential (or maximum) rate,\nrespectively. Assuming\
    \ a constant ambient temperature, Equation (1) can be simpliﬁed to Equation (2),\n\
    which is the most widely reported formulation of CWSI with regard to the horticultural\
    \ remote sensing.\nCWSI = (Tc − Twet)\n\x10\nTdry − Twet\n\x11\n(2)\nwhere Twet\
    \ is the temperature of canopy transpiring at the maximum potential, and Tdry\
    \ is the\ntemperature of the non-transpiring canopy. CWSI has been shown to be\
    \ well-correlated with direct\nmeasurements of crop water status in the horticultural\
    \ environment [18,31,32,90,99]. In this regard,\na correlation of CWSI with various\
    \ ground measurements, such as Ψleaf [18,31,197], Ψstem [33,90,194],\nand gs [18,90,100],\
    \ have been established. Diurnal measurements of CWSI compared with Ψleaf showed\n\
    the best correlation at noon [89,197,209].\nCWSI is a normalised index, i.e.,\
    \ relative to a reference temperature range between Twet and Tdry,\nwhich is speciﬁc\
    \ to a region and crop type; thus, CWSI is not a universal quantitative indicator\
    \ of crop\nwater status. For instance, a CWSI of 0.5 for two diﬀerent varieties\
    \ of grapevines at diﬀerent locations\ndoes not conclusively inform that they\
    \ have equal or superior/inferior water status. Furthermore,\nthe degree of correlation\
    \ can change depending on the isohydric/anisohydric response of crop [214]\nwhere\
    \ early/late stomatal closure aﬀects the indicators of water stress [110]. Moreover,\
    \ phenological\nstage aﬀects the relationship between remotely sensed CWSI and\
    \ water stress [197]. Thus, water stress\nin a diﬀerent crop, at a diﬀerent location\
    \ and at a diﬀerent phenological stage, will have a unique\ncorrelation with CWSI\
    \ and, therefore, needs to be established independently.\nThere are multiple methods\
    \ to measure the two reference temperatures, Twet and Tdry, which\ncould result\
    \ in variable CWSI values depending on the method used. The ﬁrst method is to\
    \ measure the\ntwo reference temperatures on the crop of interest. Tdry can be\
    \ estimated by inducing stomatal closure,\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n14 of 35\n\
    which is the leaf temperature approximately 30 min after applying a layer of petroleum\
    \ jelly e.g.,\nVaseline to both sides of a leaf. This eﬀectively blocks stomata\
    \ and, therefore, impedes leaf transpiration.\nTwet can be estimated by measuring\
    \ leaf temperature approximately 30 s after spraying water on the\nleaf, which\
    \ emulates maximum transpiration [23,83]. The advantage of this method is that\
    \ the stress\nlevels are normalised to actual plants response, whereas the necessity\
    \ to repeat the measurement for\nevery test site after each ﬂight can be cumbersome.\
    \ In an alternative (second) approach the range can\nbe established based on meteorological\
    \ data e.g., setting Tdry to 5 ◦C above air temperature and Twet\nmeasured from\
    \ an artiﬁcial surface. This method is also limited to local scale and presents\
    \ a problem\nregarding the choice of material, which ideally needs to have similar\
    \ to leaf emissivity, aerodynamic\nand optical properties [54,87]. The third method\
    \ uses the actual temperature measurement range\nof the remote sensing image [33,97].\
    \ This method is simple to implement, however, works on the\nassumption that the\
    \ ﬁeld contains enough variability to contain a representative Twet and Tdry.\
    \ Fourth,\nthe reference temperatures can be estimated by theoretically solving\
    \ for the leaf surface energy balance\nequations, however, are limited by the\
    \ necessity to compute the canopy aerodynamic resistance [87].\nStandard and robust\
    \ Twet and Tdry measurements are needed to characterize CWSI with accuracy,\n\
    especially for temporal analysis [85,87,211]. The level of uncertainty due to\
    \ the adaptation of diﬀerent\napproaches for Twet and Tdry determination in the\
    \ instantaneous and seasonal measurements of CWSI\nis not known. Nonetheless,\
    \ adopting a consistent approach, CWSI has been shown to be suitable for\nmonitoring\
    \ the water status and making irrigation decisions of horticultural crops [31,85].\n\
    4.4.3. Spectral Indices\nCrops reﬂectance properties convey information about\
    \ the crop, for instance, a healthier crop has\nhigher reﬂectance in the NIR band.\
    \ Most often, the bands are mathematically combined to form VIs,\nwhich provide\
    \ information on the crop’s health, growth stage, biophysical properties, leaf\
    \ biochemistry,\nand water stress [29,215–218]. Using multispectral or hyperspectral\
    \ data, several Vis, such as green\nnormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (GNDVI),\
    \ renormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI),\noptimized soil-adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (OSAVI), transformed chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance\nindex (TCARI),\
    \ and TCARI/OSAVI, amongst others [34,79,82], can be calculated that correlate\
    \ with the\nwater stress of horticultural crops (see Table 2). The most widely\
    \ studied VI in horticulture, in this\nregard, is the NDVI (Equation (3)).\nNDVI\
    \ = Rnir − Rr\nRnir + Rr\n(3)\nwhere Rnir and Rr represent the spectral reﬂectance\
    \ acquired at the NIR and red spectral regions,\nrespectively. In horticulture,\
    \ NDVI has been used as a proxy to estimate the vigour, biomass, and water\nstatus\
    \ of the crop. A vigorous canopy with more leaves regulates more water, therefore\
    \ remaining\ncooler when irrigated [200] and experiencing early water stress when\
    \ unirrigated. With regard to\nirrigation, the broadband normalised spectral indices\
    \ (such as NDVI) are suitable to detect spatial\nvariability and to identify the\
    \ area that is most vulnerable to water stress. However, these indices are\nnot\
    \ expected to change rapidly to reﬂect the instantaneous water status of plants\
    \ that are needed to\nmake decisions on irrigation scheduling.\nThe multispectral\
    \ indices along with complementary information in thermal wavelengths have\nproven\
    \ to be well suited to monitoring vegetation, speciﬁcally in relation to water\
    \ stress [219]. The ratio\nof canopy surface temperature to NDVI, deﬁned as temperature-vegetation\
    \ dryness index (TVDI),\nwas found to be useful for the study of water status\
    \ in horticultural crops. TVDI exploits the fact that\nvegetation with larger\
    \ NDVI will have a lower surface temperature unless the vegetation is under\n\
    stress. As most vegetation normally remains green after an initial bout of water\
    \ stress, the TVDI is\nmore suited than NDVI for early detection of water stress\
    \ as the surface temperature can rise rapidly\neven during initial water stress\
    \ [200].\nSimilarly, narrowband VIs that have been studied in relation to remote\
    \ sensing of water status are\nPRI and chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, which have been\
    \ directly correlated to the crop Ψleaf, gs [110,182,204].\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\
    \ 140\n15 of 35\nSeveral hyperspectral indices to estimate water status have been\
    \ identiﬁed [139]; however, their\napplication in remote sensing of horticultural\
    \ crops is at its infancy. Hyperspectral indices speciﬁc to\nwater absorption\
    \ bands around 900 nm, 1200 nm, 1400 nm, and 1900 nm may be used to detect the\n\
    water status of horticultural crops. The absorption features were found to be\
    \ highly correlated with\nplant water status [139]. Water band index (WBI), as\
    \ deﬁned in Equation (4), has been shown to closely\ntrack the changes in the\
    \ plant water status of various crops [202,203].\nWBI = R970\nR900\n(4)\nOther\
    \ water-related hyperspectral indices with potential application for horticultural\
    \ crops can\nbe found in the literature [139,202,203]. Hyperspectral data possess\
    \ the capability to reﬂect the\ninstantaneous water status of the plant, which\
    \ can be useful for quantitative decision-making on\nirrigation scheduling.\n\
    4.4.4. Soil Moisture\nThe moisture status of the soil provides an indication of\
    \ the available water resource to the crop.\nSoil moisture is traditionally measured\
    \ indirectly using soil moisture sensors placed below the surface\nof the soil.\
    \ A key challenge with using soil moisture sensors are the spatial distribution\
    \ of moisture,\nboth vertically and horizontally, to account for inherent ﬁeld-scale\
    \ variability. For instance, the root\nsystem of some horticultural crops, such\
    \ as grapevine, is capable of accessing water up to 30 m deep,\nwhile customer-grade\
    \ soil moisture probes generally extend to 1.5 m in depth or less. Thus, soil\n\
    moisture probes do not capture all the water available to the crop as they are\
    \ point measures and\nnot necessarily where the roots are located. Moreover, estimation\
    \ of soil moisture across spatial and\ntemporal scales is of interest for various\
    \ agricultural and hydrological studies. Optical, thermal, and\nmicrowave remote\
    \ sensing with their advantages relating to high spatial scale and temporal resolutions\n\
    could potentially be used for soil moisture estimation [220–222]. L-band microwave\
    \ radiometry,\na component of synthetic aperture radar systems, has been shown\
    \ to be a reliable approach to estimate\nsoil moisture via satellite-based remote\
    \ sensing [223], such as using the ESA’s Soil Moisture and\nOcean Salinity (SMOS)\
    \ [224] and NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites [225,226].\n\
    The limitation of the SMOS and SMAP missions, with regard to horticultural application,\
    \ is their\ndepth of retrieval (up to 5 cm) and spatial resolution (in the order\
    \ of tens of kilometre) [227–229].\nAs an airborne application, the volumetric\
    \ soil moisture has been estimated by analysing the SNR of\nthe GNSS interference\
    \ signal [230,231]. With aforementioned capabilities, a combination of satellite\n\
    and airborne remote sensing may, in the future, be a reliable tool to map soil\
    \ moisture across spatial,\ntemporal and depth scales.\n4.4.5. Physiological Attributes\n\
    Using the SfM on remotely-sensed images, 3D canopy structure, terrain conﬁgurations,\
    \ and canopy\nsurface models can be derived [113,114,119,186,232]. By employing\
    \ a delineation algorithm on the 3D\nmodels, the 3D attributes of the crops and\
    \ macrostructure are determined more accurately [120,122,233].\nCrop surface area\
    \ and terrain conﬁguration (e.g., slope and aspect) may help to develop an optimal\n\
    resource management strategy. For example, crops located at a higher elevation\
    \ within an irrigation\nzone may experience a level of water stress due to the\
    \ gravitational ﬂow of irrigated water.\nUsing the structural measurements, such\
    \ as the canopy height, canopy size, the envelope of each\nrow, LAI, and porosity,\
    \ among others, the water demand of the crop may be estimated. Generally,\nlarger\
    \ canopies tend to require more water than smaller canopies with less leaf area\
    \ [116,157]. Using\nthe temporal measurement of the plant’s 3D attributes, the\
    \ vigour can be computed. Monitoring\ncrop vigour over the season and over subsequent\
    \ years can provide an indication of its health and\nperformance, e.g., yield,\
    \ within an irrigation zone. Canopy structure metrics are closely related to\n\
    horticultural tree growth and provide strong indicators of water consumption,\
    \ whereby canopy size\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n16 of 35\ncan be used to determine\
    \ its water requirements [234]. Other 3D attributes, such as the crown perimeter,\n\
    width, height, area, and leaf density, have been shown to enable improved pruning\
    \ of horticultural\nplants [116,119].\nLAI can be estimated using the 3D attributes\
    \ obtained from remote sensing [114,157,201], whereby,\nhigher LAI is equivalent\
    \ to more leaf layers, implying greater total leaf area and, consequently, canopy\n\
    transpiration. Leaf density, LAI, and exposed leaf area of a crop drive its water\
    \ requirement and\nproductivity [235–237]. Knowledge of ﬁeld attributes, such\
    \ as row and plant spacing, may assist in\ninter-row surface energy balance to\
    \ determine the irrigation need of the plant [238]. Combining the\nstructural\
    \ properties with spectral VIs provide an estimation of biomass [239], which can\
    \ serve as\nanother indicator of the plant’s water requirements. Although physiological\
    \ attributes have been used\nto understand plant water status and its spatial\
    \ variability, they have not been directly applied to make\nquantitative decisions\
    \ on irrigation.\n4.4.6. Evapotranspiration\nThe estimation of ET via remote sensing,\
    \ numerical modelling, and empirical methods have been\nextensively studied and\
    \ reviewed in the literature [240–247]. These models are based on either surface\n\
    energy balance (SEB), Penman-Monteith (PM), Maximum entropy production (MEP),\
    \ water balance,\nwater-carbon linkage, or empirical relationships.\nSEB models\
    \ are based on a surface energy budget in which the latent heat ﬂux is estimated\
    \ as a\nresidual of the net radiation, soil heat ﬂux, and sensible heat ﬂux. The\
    \ models are either one-source\n(canopy and soil treated as a single surface for\
    \ the estimation of sensible heat ﬂux) or two-source\n(canopy and soil surfaces\
    \ treated separately). Improvements over the original one-source SEB models\n\
    were in the form of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) algorithm\
    \ [248,249] and\nMapping EvapoTranspiration with high Resolution and Internalized\
    \ Calibration (METRIC) [249,250].\nSEBAL oﬀers a simpliﬁed approach to collect\
    \ ET data at both local and regional scales thereby increasing\nthe spatial scope,\
    \ while METRIC uses the same (SEBAL) technique but auto-calibrates the model using\n\
    hourly ground-based reference ET (ETr) data [251]. As such, these and other (e.g.,\
    \ MEP) models rely\non accurate measurements of surface (e.g., canopy) and air\
    \ temperatures, which can be erroneous\nunder non-ideal conditions, e.g., cloudy\
    \ days. There is also a reliance on ground-based sensors to\ncapture ambient air\
    \ temperatures required by the model.\nAmong the existing methods, FAO’s PM is\
    \ the most widely adopted model to estimate reference\nET (ETref or ET0) [252].\
    \ The PM method uses incident and reﬂected solar radiation, emitted thermal\n\
    radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and vapour pressure to calculate ET0 [253].\
    \ Remote sensing\nprovides a cost-eﬀective method to estimate the ET0 at regional\
    \ to global scales [241] by estimating\nreﬂected solar and emitted thermal radiation.\
    \ One of the advantages of using the PM approach is\nthat it is parametrised using\
    \ micrometeorological data easily obtained from ground-based automatic\nweather\
    \ stations. However, PM suﬀers from the drawback that canopy transpiration is\
    \ not dynamic\nas inﬂuenced by soil moisture availability via stomatal regulation\
    \ [241]. From a practical standpoint,\nPM-derived ET0 estimates are used in conjunction\
    \ with crop factors or crop coeﬃcients (kc), which are\nclosely related to the\
    \ light interception of the canopy [254].\nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc) is deﬁned\
    \ as the product of kc and ET0. In the absence of accurate\nETc measurements,\
    \ kc is an easy and practical means of getting reliable estimates of ETc using\
    \ ET0 [255].\nIn this regard, studies have focused on the use of remote sensing\
    \ to study spatial variability in kc and\nETc [101,256–258]. Thermal and NIR imagery\
    \ can be used to compute kc and ETc as transpiration\nrate is closely related\
    \ to canopy temperature [259–261] and kc has been shown to correlate with\ncanopy\
    \ reﬂectance [101,255]. Various thermal indices, such as CWSI, canopy temperature\
    \ ratio, canopy\ntemperature above non-stressed, and canopy temperature above\
    \ canopy threshold, can be used to\nestimate ETc, where CWSI- based ETc was found\
    \ to be the most accurate [24].\nET at a larger scale is typically estimated based\
    \ on satellite remote sensing. The temporal resolution\nof satellites is, however,\
    \ low and inadequate for horticultural applications, such as irrigation scheduling\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n17 of 35\n(e.g., Landsat has a 16-day revisit cycle).\
    \ In contrast, high temporal resolution satellites are coarse in\nspatial resolution\
    \ for ﬁeld-scale observations [25]. The daily or even instantaneous estimation\
    \ of ETc at\nthe ﬁeld scale is crucial for irrigation scheduling and is expected\
    \ to have great application prospects\nin the future [240,259,262,263]. In this\
    \ regard, the future direction of satellite-based ET estimates\nmay focus on temporal\
    \ downscaling either by extrapolation of instantaneous measurement [264],\ninterpolation\
    \ between two successive observations [201], data fusion of multiple satellites\
    \ [25,260], and\nspatial downscaling using multiple satellites [265–268]. An example\
    \ of early satellite-based remote\nsensing for ET is the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration\
    \ Project (MOD16), which was established in\n1999 to provide daily estimates of\
    \ global terrestrial evapotranspiration using data acquired from a\npair of NASA\
    \ satellites in conjunction with Algorithm Theoretical Based Documents (ATBDs)\
    \ [269].\nThese estimates correlated well with ground-based eddy covariance ﬂux\
    \ tower estimates of ET despite\ndiﬀerences in the uncertainties associated with\
    \ each of these techniques.\nUASs are being increasingly utilised to acquire multi-spectral\
    \ and thermal imagery to compute\nET at an unprecedented spatial resolution [270,271].\
    \ Using high-resolution images, ﬁltering the\nshadowed-pixel is possible, which\
    \ showed signiﬁcant improvement in the estimation of ET in\ngrapevine [101]. Using\
    \ high-resolution thermal and/or multispectral imagery, ET has been derived for\n\
    horticultural crops, such as grapevines [270] and olives [271]. The seasonal monitoring\
    \ of ETc at high\nspatial and temporal resolutions is of high importance for precision\
    \ irrigation of horticultural crops in\nthe future [259].\n5. Case Studies on\
    \ the Use of Remote Sensing for Crop Water Stress Detection\nThe increasing prevalence\
    \ of UAS along with low-cost camera systems has brought about much\ninterest in\
    \ the characterisation of crop water status/stress during the growing season to\
    \ inform orchard\nor farm management decisions, in particular, irrigation scheduling\
    \ [272,273]. Traditional methodologies\nto assess crop water stress are constrained\
    \ by limitations relating to large farm sizes and accompanying\nspatial variability,\
    \ high labour costs to collect data, and access to instrumentation that is both\
    \ inexpensive\nand portable [272]. The beneﬁts of precision agriculture [274],\
    \ including through precision irrigation\npractices [1], result in higher production\
    \ eﬃciencies and economic returns through site-speciﬁc crop\nmanagement [275,276].\
    \ This approach has motivated the use of high-resolution imagery acquired\nfrom\
    \ remote sensing to identify irrigation zones [99,277]. The ﬁrst horticultural\
    \ applications of UAS\nplatforms for crop water status measurement were in orange\
    \ and peach orchards where both thermal\nand multispectral-derived VIs, speciﬁcally\
    \ the PRI, were shown to be well-correlated to crop water\nstatus [102]. Here,\
    \ we explore the use of remote sensing and accompanying image acquisition platforms\n\
    to characterise the spatial and temporal patterns of the water status of two economically\
    \ important\nhorticultural crops, grapevine and almond.\n5.1. Grapevine (Vitis\
    \ spp.)\nThe characterisation of spatial variability in vine water status in a\
    \ vineyard provides valuable\nguidance on irrigation scheduling decisions [82],\
    \ and this spatial variability can be eﬃciently\ncharacterised by the use of remote\
    \ sensing platforms [29]. The ﬁrst use of remote sensing in vineyards\nfor crop\
    \ water stress detection was using manned aircraft ﬂown over an irrigated vineyard\
    \ in Hanwood\n(NSW) Australia where CWSI was mapped at a spatial resolution of\
    \ 10 cm [278]. Subsequently, UAS\nplatforms began to be used in vineyards for\
    \ vine water stress characterisation. Early work in this\ncrop used a fuel-based\
    \ helicopter with a 29 cc engine and equipped with thermal (Thermovision\nA40M)\
    \ and multispectral (Tetracam MCA-6) camera systems [102]. The study observed\
    \ strong (inverse)\nrelationships between (Tc − Ta) and gs. A related study showed\
    \ strong correlations between thermal\nand multispectral VIs, and traditional,\
    \ ground-based measures of water status, such as Ψleaf and\ngs [182]. In this\
    \ study, normalised PRI was shown to have correlation coeﬃcients exceeding 0.8\
    \ versus\nboth Ψleaf and gs, indicating that remotely-sensed VIs can be reliable\
    \ indicators of vine water status.\nThermal indices, such as (Tc − Ta) and CWSI,\
    \ were also well-correlated to Ψleaf and gs at speciﬁc times of\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 140\n18 of 35\nthe day. The use of thermal indices, such as CWSI or Ig,\
    \ requires reference temperatures (Twet, Tdry) or\nnon-water stressed baselines\
    \ (NWSB) [279]. Due to the diﬃculty of obtaining reference temperatures or\nNWSB\
    \ using remote sensing, some authors have used the minimum temperature found from\
    \ all canopy\npixels as Twet [199], and Ta + 5 ◦C as Tdry [213,280]. NWSB is typically\
    \ obtained from well-watered\ncanopies, measuring (Tc − Ta) under a range of vapour\
    \ pressure deﬁcit conditions [279]. Thermal water\nstress indices have also shown\
    \ to be useful to distinguish between water use strategies of diﬀerent\ngrapevine\
    \ cultivars [83,281], which is useful for customising irrigation scheduling based\
    \ on the speciﬁc\nwater needs of a given cultivar. More recently, studies have\
    \ used UAS-based multispectral-based\nVIs to train an artiﬁcial neural network\
    \ (ANN) models to predict spatial patterns of Ψstem [84,282].\nUsing UAS-based\
    \ multispectral data, the authors showed that ANN estimated Ψstem with higher\n\
    accuracy (RMSE lower than 0.15 MPa) as compared to the conventional multispectral\
    \ indices based\nestimation (RMSE over 0.32 MPa).\n5.2. Almond (Prunus Dulcis)\n\
    Almonds are perennial nut trees grown in semi-arid climates and are reliant on\
    \ irrigation\napplications. Their water requirements are relatively high, with\
    \ seasonal ETc exceeding 1000 mm [283].\nThe requirement for prudent irrigation\
    \ management in the face of decreased water availability is\ncritical for maintaining\
    \ tree productivity, yield, and nut quality [284]. Towards this goal, UAS-based\n\
    remote sensing has been used to characterise the spatial patterns of tree water\
    \ status in almond\norchards. A UAS-based thermal camera was used to acquire tree\
    \ the crown temperature data from\na California almond orchard; this temperature\
    \ was used to determine the temperature diﬀerence\nbetween crown and air (Tc −\
    \ Ta) and compared to shaded leaf water potential (Ψsl) [92]. The study\nfound\
    \ a strong negative correlation (R2 = 0.72) between (Tc − Ta) and Ψsl. The same\
    \ authors conducted\na follow on study in Spain on several fruit tree species\
    \ including almond. The negative relationship\n(slope and oﬀset) between (Tc −\
    \ Ta) and Ψstem was observed to vary based on the time of observation;\nmorning\
    \ measurements had weak relationships, whereas afternoon measurements had stronger\n\
    relationships [99]. Their proposed methodology allowed for the spatial characterisation\
    \ of orchard\nwater status on a single-tree basis, demonstrating the utility of\
    \ UAS-based crop water stress data.\nBeyond the characterisation of crop water\
    \ stress for irrigation scheduling, there is an opportunity to\nuse this data\
    \ to quantify the economic impact at a spatial level.\n6. Future Prospective and\
    \ Gaps in the Knowledge\nPrecision irrigation is a promising approach to increase\
    \ farm water use eﬃciency for sustainable\nproduction, including for horticultural\
    \ crops [3,5,9,10,274,285]. It is envisioned that the future of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ will incorporate UAS, manned aircraft, and satellite-based remote sensing platforms\n\
    alongside ground-based proximal sensors coupled with wireless sensor networks.\
    \ The automation\nof UAS technology will continue to develop further to a point\
    \ that even novice users can adopt\nthe technology with ease. It is also expected\
    \ that the data processing pipeline of remote sensing\nimages will become automated\
    \ to be ‘ﬁt for purpose’ for crop water status measurements. The ideal\nsolution\
    \ may lie in the use of satellites (or sometimes manned aircraft) for regional\
    \ estimation and\nplanning [55,260], UAS for seasonal monitoring and zoning [32,100,197,286],\
    \ proximal sensors for\ncontinuous measurement [287], and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to derive decision-ready products [84,282]\nthat can be used for making irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [31,288–295]. Continued technological\ndevelopments in\
    \ this space will enable growers to acquire actionable data with ease, and eventually\n\
    transition towards semi-automated or fully-automated irrigation applications.\n\
    Remote sensing and current irrigation application technologies are limited in\
    \ temporal and\nspatial resolution, respectively. Although UAS technology can\
    \ deliver sub-plant level spatially explicit\ninformation of water status, the\
    \ size of the management block is much coarser, typically over 10 m.\nHence, further\
    \ improvements in variable rate application technologies, e.g., boom sprayers,\
    \ or zoned\ndrip irrigation, are required to fully exploit high-resolution UAS\
    \ measurements. Nonetheless, the\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n19 of 35\nrequired resolution\
    \ of remote sensing should be guided by the underlying spatial variability of\
    \ the crop.\nFor ﬁelds with relatively lower spatial variability, low/medium-resolution\
    \ remote sensing imagery\nmay suﬃce for crop water status assessment [278,296,297].\n\
    Remote sensing provides an indirect estimate of plant water status using the regression-based\n\
    approach through several calculated reﬂectance indices. In comparison, physical\
    \ and mechanistic\nmodels, e.g., radiative transfer models and energy balance\
    \ models, incorporate both direct and indirect\nmeasures of the canopy, therefore\
    \ establishing a basis for diﬀerences in plant water status. Using a\nsimilar\
    \ approach, predictions of crop water status using regression-based remote sensing\
    \ models can\nbe improved by incorporating some direct auxiliary variables.\n\
    Further developments in thermal remote sensing are also expected, speciﬁcally,\
    \ the advent of new\nthermal and hybrid thermal-multispectral water status/stress\
    \ indices that are more sensitive to canopy\ntranspiration. The most widely-adopted\
    \ thermal index, CWSI, is an instantaneous measure that is\nnormalised to local\
    \ weather conditions and inﬂuenced by genotype and phenotype. For example,\nthe\
    \ relationship between CWSI and crop water status is inﬂuenced by environmental\
    \ conditions\n(e.g., high incident radiation and low humidity vs low incident\
    \ radiation and high humidity) and\nphenological stage [197,214,298]. As a result,\
    \ corresponding ground-based measurements are required\nfor each temporal remote\
    \ measurement to determine the correlation with water status. Hence, temporal\n\
    assessments of water status using thermal cameras will require the incorporation\
    \ of meteorological\ndata along with the thermal response using novel indices.\n\
    In the area of satellite remote sensing, we foresee further developments on temporal\
    \ downscaling\nto achieve daily measurements. A higher temporal resolution may\
    \ be achieved by fusion of multiple\nsatellite observations, such as freely available\
    \ Landsat and Sentinel. Further reductions of temporal\nresolution will require\
    \ interpolation between two successive observations. Furthermore, temporal\nmodels\
    \ of water status could be developed to assist the interpolation to eventually\
    \ satisfy the\nrequirements for irrigation scheduling [25,201,263]. The continued\
    \ advancement and greater availability\nof Nanosat/Cubesat may provide an alternate\
    \ method to capture high-resolution data at a higher\na greater temporal resolution,\
    \ which can be suitable to study the water status of horticultural\ncrops [299–301].\n\
    Crop water status is a complex phenomenon, which can be interpreted with respect\
    \ to a\nnumber of variables. These variables can include spectral response, thermal\
    \ response, meteorological\ndata, 3D attributes of the canopy, and macrostructure\
    \ of the block (farm).\nClearly, there is\nan opportunity for a multi-disciplinary\
    \ approach, potentially incorporating artiﬁcial intelligence\ntechniques which\
    \ incorporate the aforementioned variables to provide a robust estimation of crop\n\
    water status [84,141,282,302,303]. Furthermore, with machine learning algorithms,\
    \ hyperspectral\nremote sensing will provide a wealth of data to estimate crop\
    \ water status. A quantitative product,\nsuch as SIF, derived from hyperspectral\
    \ data will have the potential for direct quantiﬁcation of water\nstress [204,205,304].\
    \ In this regard, the upcoming FLEX satellite mission [305,306] and recent advances\n\
    in aerial spectroradiometry [109,132,137,307–310] dedicated for observation of\
    \ SIF may be unique and\npowerful tools for high-value horticultural crops.\n\
    Multi-temporal images represent an excellent resource for seasonal monitoring\
    \ of changes in crop\nwater status. Five to six temporal points of data acquisition\
    \ at critical phenological stages of crop\ndevelopment have been recommended for\
    \ irrigation scheduling [31,32]. However, for semi-arid or arid\nregions, irrigation\
    \ is typically required multiple times per week. Acquisition and post-processing\
    \ of\nremote sensing data for actionable products multiple times a week is currently\
    \ logistically unfeasible.\nThe fusion of UAS-based remote sensing data, continuous\
    \ ground-based proximal or direct sensors,\nincluding weather station data, can\
    \ potentially inform daily estimates of water status at canopy level.\nThis approach\
    \ will require predictive models, such as those based on machine learning algorithms,\
    \ to\nestimate the current and future water status of the crop. Eventually, growers\
    \ would beneﬁt from the\nknowledge of crop water requirements for the determination\
    \ of seasonal irrigation requirements to\nsustainably farm into the future.\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n20 of 35\nOne vision for the future of precision irrigation\
    \ is in automated pipelines to explicitly manage\nirrigation water at the sub-block\
    \ level. This automated pipeline would likely include remote and\nproximal data\
    \ acquisition and processing, prediction and interpretation of crop water status\
    \ and\nrequirements, and subsequently, control of irrigation systems. Recent rapid\
    \ developments in cloud\ncomputing and wireless technology could assist in the\
    \ quasi-real-time processing of the remote sensing\ndata soon after acquisition\
    \ [311–313]. Eventually, automation and computational power will merge to\ndevelop\
    \ smart technology in which artiﬁcial intelligence uses real-time data analysis\
    \ for diagnosis\nand decision-making. Growers of the future will be able to take\
    \ advantage of precise irrigation\nrecommendations using information sourced from\
    \ a ﬂeet of UAS that map large farm blocks on a daily\nschedule, continuous ground-based\
    \ proximal and direct sensors, and weather stations. This data can be\nstored\
    \ on and accessed from the cloud almost instantaneously, used in conjunction with\
    \ post-processing\nalgorithms for decision-making on optimised irrigation applications\
    \ [311,314].\n7. Conclusions\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of the\
    \ use of remote sensing to determine the water\nstatus of horticultural crops.\
    \ One of our objectives was to survey the range of remote sensing tools\navailable\
    \ for irrigation decision-making. Earth observation satellite systems possess\
    \ the required bands\nto study the water status of vegetation and soil. Satellites\
    \ are more suitable for scouting, planning,\nand management of irrigation applications\
    \ that involve large areas, and where data acquisition is\nnot time-constrained.\
    \ Manned aircraft are sparingly used in horticultural applications due to the\n\
    cost, logistics, and speciﬁc expertise needed for the operation of the platform.\
    \ UAS-based remote\nsensing provides ﬂexibility in spatial resolution (crop level\
    \ observation achievable), coverage (over\n25 ha achievable in a single ﬂight),\
    \ spectral bands, as well as temporal revisit. Routine monitoring of\nhorticultural\
    \ crops for water status characterisation is, therefore, best performed using\
    \ a UAS platform.\nWe envision a future for precision irrigation where satellites\
    \ are used for planning, and UAS used in\nconjunction with a network of ground-based\
    \ sensors to achieve actionable products on a timely basis.\nThe plant’s instantaneous\
    \ response to water stress can be captured using thermal cameras (via\nindices,\
    \ such as CWSI) and potentially narrow-band hyperspectral sensors (via, for example,\
    \ SIF),\nmaking them suitable to draw quantiﬁable decisions with regard to irrigation\
    \ scheduling. Broadband\nmultispectral and RGB cameras capture the non-instantaneous\
    \ water status of crops, making them\nsuitable for general assessment of crop\
    \ water status. Integrated use of thermal and multispectral\nimagery may be the\
    \ simplest yet eﬀective sensor combinations to capture the overall as well as\n\
    instantaneous water status of the plant. With regard to irrigation scheduling,\
    \ further developments\nare required to establish crop-speciﬁc thresholds of remotely-sensed\
    \ indices to decide when and how\nmuch to irrigate.\nAuthor Contributions: Performed\

    \ and real-time estimation of crop coeﬃcients at the farm scale is one of\nthe\
    \ key prerequisites in precision agricultural water management. This study aimed\
    \ to map the maize\ncrop coeﬃcient (Kc) with improved accuracy under diﬀerent\
    \ levels of deﬁcit irrigation. The proposed\nmethod for estimating the Kc is based\
    \ on multispectral images of high spatial resolution taken using\nan unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicle (UAV). The analysis was performed on ﬁve experimental plots using\
    \ Kc\nvalues measured from the daily soil water balance in Ordos, Inner Mongolia,\
    \ China. To accurately\nestimate the Kc, the fraction of vegetation cover (fc)\
    \ derived from the normalized diﬀerence vegetation\nindex (NDVI) was used to compare\
    \ with ﬁeld measurements, and the stress coeﬃcients (Ks) calculated\nfrom two\
    \ vegetation index (VI) regression models were compared. The results showed that\
    \ the NDVI\nvalues under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation had no signiﬁcant\
    \ diﬀerence in the reproductive stage\nbut changed signiﬁcantly in the maturation\
    \ stage, with a decrease of 0.09 with 72% water applied\ndiﬀerence. The fc calculated\
    \ from the NDVI had a high correlation with ﬁeld measurement data,\nwith a coeﬃcient\
    \ of determination (R2) of 0.93. The ratios of transformed chlorophyll absorption\n\
    in reﬂectance index (TCARI) to renormalized diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI)\
    \ and TCARI to\nsoil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were used, respectively,\
    \ to establish two types of Ks regression\nmodels to retrieve Kc. Compared to\
    \ the TCARI/SAVI model, the TCARI/RDVI model under diﬀerent\nlevels of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation had better correlation with Kc, with R2 and root-mean-square error\
    \ (RMSE)\nvalues ranging from 0.68 to 0.80 and from 0.140 to 0.232, respectively.\
    \ Compared to Kc calculated from\non-site measurements, the Kc values retrieved\
    \ from the VI regression models established in this study\nhad greater ability\
    \ to assess the ﬁeld variability of soil and crops. Overall, use of the UAV-measured\n\
    multispectral vegetation index approach could improve water management at the\
    \ farm scale.\nKeywords: crop coeﬃcient (Kc); vegetation indices; deﬁcit irrigation;\

    \ scarcity is a major factor limiting irrigated agriculture, especially in arid\
    \ and semi-arid areas\nof the world. Due to global climate changes and the imbalance\
    \ between water supply and demand,\nit is particularly necessary to improve crop\
    \ water use [1]. Therefore, the regulated deﬁcit irrigation\n(RDI) strategy for\
    \ reducing water consumption is widely used in current agriculture [2]. In this\
    \ context,\nhow to accurately estimate and monitor crop water requirements is\
    \ not only the key for optimizing\nSensors 2019, 19, 5250; doi:10.3390/s19235250\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 5250\n2 of 17\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ and improving water use eﬃciency, but also essential research for enhancing\n\
    food production and SAVIng regional water resources [3,4].\nA common indicator\
    \ of crop water requirements is the crop coeﬃcient (Kc), which was presented\n\
    in FAO 56 [5] and is used to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) by multiplying\
    \ the reference crop\nevapotranspiration (ET0) [6]. The Kc primarily depends on\
    \ meteorological information, crop-speciﬁc\ncoeﬃcients, the lengths of crop growth\
    \ stages, and plant-available soil water [7]. It can be estimated\nusing single\
    \ and dual Kc approaches. The single approach is the averaging of Kc trends that\
    \ incorporate\nplant transpiration (Kcb) and soil evaporation (Ke).\nCompared\
    \ to the single approach, the dual\napproach improves the estimation accuracy\
    \ of ET by considering the plant transpiration and soil\nevaporation separately,\
    \ i.e., Kc = Kcb + Ke [8]. However, in practical crop conditions, the Kc needs\
    \ to be\nappropriately adjusted by using a stress coeﬃcient (Ks) for nonstandard\
    \ conditions, especially water\nstress conditions [6]. The dual approach has been\
    \ appropriately used for crops at a ﬁeld or regional\nscale [9–13].\nTo date,\
    \ several methods have been presented to monitor Kc, such as soil water balance,\
    \ eddy\ncovariance, Bowen ratio, lysimeter, and remote sensing [14–18]. In situ\
    \ measurements are likely to be\ntime-consuming and costly, and make it hard to\
    \ consider the spatial variability of crops and soil [19].\nTherefore, remote\
    \ sensing of Kc has become increasingly recommended in irrigation management.\
    \ One\nof the most common approaches is to estimate the real-time Kcb and Kc through\
    \ empirical equations\nof vegetation indices (VIs) such as the normalized diﬀerence\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI) derived from\nmultispectral images [20–23]. Such empirical\
    \ equations rely on the close relationship between the VIs\nand various actual\
    \ plant growth parameters, e.g., leaf area index [24,25], fraction of ground covered\
    \ by\nplants [26,27], and biomass [24,28]. However, Pereira et al. [7] noted that\
    \ NDVI-based methods can not\naccurately observe a decrease in Kc and Kcb when\
    \ crops are under water stress. Zhang and Zhou [29]\nproposed that crop water\
    \ status can be accurately monitored using the VIs which are not only sensitive\n\
    to water information but also contain vegetation growth status. Consequently,\
    \ partial VIs such as\nthe reﬂectance index (TCARI), optimization of soil-adjusted\
    \ vegetation index (OSAVI), soil-adjusted\nvegetation index (SAVI), and renormalized\
    \ diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI) can eﬀectively monitor\ncrop water status\
    \ [30]. For example, Haboudane et al. [31] utilized TCARI/OSAVI to predict maize\n\
    water status in Canada and reported a high correlation between TCARI/OSAVI and\
    \ chlorophyll content.\nZhang et al. [19] evaluated maize water stress and its\
    \ spatial variability by multispectral remote sensing.\nThe results showed that\
    \ two regression models based on TCARI/RDVI and TCARI/SAVI were able to\nmonitor\
    \ the crop water stress index (CWSI) with respective coeﬃcients of determination\
    \ (R2) of 0.81\nand 0.80 under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation.\nUnmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles (UAVs) in remote sensing have exponentially increased in applications\n\
    of precision agriculture over the past decade [32]. Compared to conventional data\
    \ acquisition methods\nfor remote sensing, such as satellites and spectrometers\
    \ [33,34], UAVs oﬀer many obvious advantages\nto support water resource management\
    \ and planning [35,36]. One of the most common advantages is\nthat UAVs can provide\
    \ high-quality data at the required scale and time, while conventional methods\n\
    have not been applied in practice at the farm scale due to their coarse spatial\
    \ resolution, infrequent\ncoverage, and high cost [37,38]. Additionally, UAVs\
    \ can be used to obtain low-cost data as frequently\nas necessitated by the monitoring\
    \ task because of their ease of operation and deployment, their high\nﬂexibility,\
    \ and the decreasing cost of the platform [39]. Thus, UAV-based monitoring has\
    \ become\nincreasingly pervasive in supporting the real-time control of irrigation\
    \ systems.\nIn recent works, the abovementioned Ks has usually been calculated\
    \ using the FAO-56 soil water\ndepletion method proposed by Allen et al. [5].\
    \ For example, Pôças et al. [6] estimated the actual Kc for\nmaize, barley, and\
    \ olive based on VIs and a soil water balance model under water stress conditions.\n\
    The results showed that the Ks computed using the soil water balance model could\
    \ accurately exhibit\nreductions in Kc due to water stress. Another method to\
    \ determine Ks is based on indications of the\ninfrared canopy temperature, such\
    \ as the CWSI. Kullberg et al. [40] compared the performance of\nseveral canopy\
    \ temperature methods converted into Ks. The results showed that the CWSI based\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 5250\n3 of 17\non infrared thermal radiometry (IRT) had the\
    \ best accuracy compared to other methods, and it is\ntypically considered to\
    \ be scalable to Ks. Bellvert et al. [41] stated that mapping CWSI from UAV\n\
    thermal imagery has the limitation of inevitable mixed temperatures coming from\
    \ both the soil and\nleaves due to bigger pixels and full cover. Considering the\
    \ relationship between VIs and the CWSI\ndiscussed above, VIs have been found\
    \ to have a comparable ability to monitor Kc under water stress\nconditions. However,\
    \ research using VIs derived from a UAV multispectral remote sensing system is\n\
    still relatively rare in Kc estimation at the farm scale under diﬀerent levels\
    \ of water stress.\nTherefore, in this study, we established a Kc empirical model\
    \ based on UAV multispectral remote\nsensing to represent the crop evapotranspiration\
    \ of summer maize under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit\nirrigation. The main objectives\
    \ were as follows:\n(1) To explore the diﬀerences in Kc with regard to the soil\
    \ water balance in response to water stress\ntreatments at diﬀerent growth stages;\n\
    (2) To establish Kc regression models based on UAV multispectral VIs that are\
    \ sensitive to maize\nwater stress and compare them with measured crop coeﬃcients;\n\
    (3) To obtain Kc maps derived from the Kc regression model with high spatial–temporal\
    \ resolution\nat the farm scale.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Area\n\
    The study was carried out on an experimental farm located in Zhaojun Town, southwest\
    \ Inner\nMongolia, China (40◦26′0.29′′ N, 109◦36′25.99′′ E). The experimental\
    \ area is approximately 1.13 ha at\n1010 m altitude above the sea level. The climate\
    \ is semi-arid, and the soil type is loamy sand with 80.7%\nsand, 13.7% powder,\
    \ and 5.6% clay. The average ﬁeld capacity (0–90 cm soil depth) is 0.169 m3·m−3,\n\
    and the average soil bulk density is 1.56 g·cm−3. The soil pH, C content, and\
    \ organic matter are 9.27,\n27.35 g/Kg, and 47.17 g/Kg, respectively. Maize (Junkai\
    \ 918) was sowed on 20 May 2017 (day of year\n(DOY) 140), with a 0.58 m planting\
    \ distance and 0.25 m plant spacing, and the row direction was from\neast to west.\
    \ The maize emerged on 1 June, headed on 20 July, and was harvested on 7 September\n\
    (silage), giving a 110-day lifespan [19].\n2.2. Experimental Design\nThere were\
    \ ﬁve diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation treatments for which we divided the\
    \ study\nﬁeld into treatment (TR) regions (Figure 1b). In order to eﬀectively\
    \ collect data and control irrigation\nwater, a 12 × 12 m2 experimental plot was\
    \ chosen in each treatment region. The ﬁve treatments\nwere full irrigation (TR1),\
    \ slight water stress (TR5), moderate water stress (TR2 and TR3), and severe\n\
    water stress (TR4). TR1 represented the total crop water requirement of fully\
    \ watered maize during\nthe whole growth period. The diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation were designed according to the\npercentages of applied water depth\
    \ of TR1 during the late vegetation, reproductive, and maturation\nstages. For\
    \ example, during the maturation stage, 52% of the applied water depth at TR1\
    \ was applied\nto TR2 (Table 1).\nA central pivot sprinkler system (Valmont Industries,\
    \ Inc., Omaha, NE, USA) was used for\nirrigation, and diﬀerent irrigation amounts\
    \ were processed in each treatment region by adjusting\nthe speed of the sprinkler\
    \ system. The test for water application uniformity of the central pivot\nirrigation\
    \ system was carried out in accordance with the standards ANSI/ASAE S436.1 and\
    \ ISO 11545.\nThe uniformity coeﬃcient for the ﬁrst span (research area) of the\
    \ R3000 sprinklers was calculated using\nthe modiﬁed formula by Heermann and Hein\
    \ [42], and the values were 82.7% and 88.3% under 20% and\n40% of full walking\
    \ speed, respectively. The amount of water applied to each treatment was measured\n\
    and recorded using a MIK-2000H ﬂow meter (Meacon Automation Technology co., Ltd.,\
    \ Hangzhou,\nChina). Due to the inﬂuence of rainfall, the actual applied water\
    \ depth (irrigation and rainfall amount)\nSensors 2019, 19, 5250\n4 of 17\nfor\
    \ each growth stage in each treatment region is shown in Table 1. In order to\

    \ 4 Pro with an 84◦ ﬁeld of view lens, an f/2.8 aperture, and a resolution of\
    \ 4864 ×\n3648 pixels was used to obtain crop coverage (fc). The ﬂights were conducted\
    \ every 3 to 7 days between\n11:00 and 13:00 local time, at 50 m altitude, and\
    \ with a ground sample distance of 1.4 cm. The overlap\nof imagery to the front\
    \ and side was 80%. The mosaic RGB images were acquired using Pix4DMapper\nsoftware\
    \ (Lausanne, Switzerland). The RGB images of each sampling plot were classiﬁed\
    \ into soil and\nvegetation using supervised classiﬁcation aided by ENVI 5.3 software.\
    \ The fc value was derived as the\npercentage detected as vegetation.\n2.5. Soil\
    \ Water Balance\nThe daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was obtained using the\
    \ soil water balance equation with\nsoil water content measured by TDR [5,43–45]\
    \ (Equation (1)):\nETc = P + I ± ∆SM − Dp − RO + CR\n(1)\nwhere ETc represents\
    \ crop evapotranspiration; P represents the precipitation; I represents the irrigation;\n\
    ∆SM represents the change in water content between two successive days, calculated\
    \ by TDR; DP\nrepresents deep percolation; RO represents surface runoﬀ; and CR\
    \ represents capillary rise from the\ndeep water table, which can be ignored due\
    \ to the shallow to deep water table depth (3–55 m) and\nalso due to no contribution\
    \ from groundwater with capillary rise into the root zone [46]. All terms\nin\

    \ UAV Multispectral Imagery Acquisition\nA multispectral camera (RedEdge, MicaSense,\
    \ Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) was installed on a UAV\nplatform (a six-rotor unmanned\
    \ aircraft S900, manufactured by DJI). The S900 six-rotor UAV has the\nadvantages\
    \ of stable ﬂight and takeoﬀ, strong wind resistance, and low cost. The maximum\
    \ take-oﬀ\nweight is 6 kg, the maximum payload is 2 kg, the maximum wind speed\
    \ it can withstand is 5 m/s, and\nits ﬂight time is 18 min. The RedEdge multispectral\
    \ camera consists of ﬁve bands in the VIS–NIR\nspectral range at 475, 560, 668,\
    \ 717, 840 nm, respectively; a 5.5 mm ﬁxed lens; image resolution of\n1280 × 960\
    \ pixels; and angle of view of 47.2◦ (H). The ﬂight control board used was a Pixhawk\
    \ autopilot\n(CUAV, Guangzhou, China), and the ground control station software\
    \ Mission Planner was used to\nconduct the ﬂight planning.\nUAV multispectral\
    \ data from fourteen ﬂights were acquired at a 70 m ﬂight height with 4.7 cm\n\
    spatial resolution during the study period (2017.06.26~08.29) between 11:00 and\
    \ 13:00 local time.\nThe heading and side overlap and speed of the UAV were 80%\
    \ and 5 m/s, respectively. The mosaic\nmultispectral images were acquired using\
    \ the photogrammetric software Pix4DMapper (Lausanne,\nSwitzerland). In order\
    \ to calibrate the multispectral images, a diﬀuse reﬂector (reﬂectivity 58%, size\n\
    3 × 3 m, Group VIII, Seattle, WA, USA) was used during the data collection. The\
    \ measured image\nradiances were later converted to reﬂectance values to obtain\
    \ spectral reﬂectance images.\n2.7. The Vegetation Index Approach for Crop Coeﬃcient\
    \ Estimation\nIn the present study, the calculation of Kc was made based on the\
    \ dual crop coeﬃcient approach.\nThis approach divides the total crop coeﬃcient\
    \ into crop transpiration (Kcb) and soil evaporation (Ke)\nfractions [47,48].\
    \ The Kc can be calculated as follows:\nKc = Kcb + Ke\n(2)\nwhere Kcb values were\
    \ estimated based on NDVI measurements developed in a modiﬁed approach\nby Er-Raki\
    \ et al. [49], who used 1.07 as the Kcb,max value for durum wheat in a semi-arid\
    \ climate in\nMorocco. In our study, we used 1.15 in Equation (3) as the Kcb,max\
    \ value for maize according to Allen\net al. [5]. In addition, Ke values were\
    \ calculated from the fraction of vegetation cover (fc), which is\nstrongly related\
    \ to the NDVI [50]. Therefore, Kcb and Ke in the NDVI approach were derived as\
    \ [5,51]\nfollows:\nKcb = 1.15 ∗ (1 − (NDVImax − NDVI)/(NDVImax − NDVImin))\n\
    (3)\nSensors 2019, 19, 5250\n7 of 17\nKe = 0.9 ∗ (1 − fc)\n(4)\nfc = 1.19 ∗ (NDVI\
    \ − NDVImin)\n(5)\nwhere NDVImax and NDVImin are the maximal and minimal measured\
    \ NDVI values during the growing\nperiod. We took values of 0.88 for NDVImax and\
    \ 0.14 for NDVImin according to the UAV map. The value\n0.9 in Equation (4) was\
    \ determined according to FAO 56 [5] based on the observed frequency of\nirrigation\
    \ and rainfall. The value 1.19 in Equation (5) was determined according to González-Piqueras\n\
    et al. [51], based on the fc being less than 80% for maize.\nHowever, the above\
    \ formulas represent potential crop evapotranspiration conditions. When\nwater\
    \ stress occurs, the stress coeﬃcient Ks should be considered. Ks (0 ≤ Ks ≤ 1)\
    \ is deﬁned as the ratio\nof actual evapotranspiration (ETa) to potential evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETp), proposed by Allen et al. [5].\nThe Ks can be calculated as follows:\n\
    Ks = ETa/ETp = Kc act/Kc.\n(6)\nBased on the principle of energy balance, Jackson\
    \ et al. [52] derived a calculation model for the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI)\
    \ depending on the canopy temperature. The model establishes the\nrelationship\
    \ between Ks and CWSI as\nCWSI = 1 − ETa/ETp = 1 − Ks.\n(7)\nAdditionally, CWSI\
    \ can be estimated by two VI regression models proposed by Zhang et al. [19]\n\
    under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation.\nCWSI-1 =\n\n0\n(TCARI/RDVI\

    \ between Kc and VIs for nonstressed\nconditions or for conditions of a dry soil\
    \ surface, which cannot appropriately depict the actual\nconditions of crop management\
    \ [6]. Crop coeﬃcients derived from VIs often do not consider the\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 5250\n12 of 17\nabovementioned Ks, which should be used to obtain the actual\
    \ Kc under water or salinity stress [7,21].\nStagakis et al. [67] found that most\
    \ optical indices such as NDVI are suitable for tracking the eﬀects of\nlong-term\
    \ water stress on crops, while they are not useful as indicators to detect and\
    \ monitor early\nwater stress conditions. In this work, we also found that the\
    \ NDVI values under diﬀerent levels of\ndeﬁcit irrigation did not signiﬁcantly\
    \ diﬀer in the reproductive stage, but they changed signiﬁcantly in\nthe maturation\
    \ stage, with a decrease of 0.09 in TR4 compared to TR1 (Figure 3a). This is because\
    \ crops\nmay prevent damage through photo-protection strategies to reduce the\
    \ leaf absorbance and reﬂectance\nchanges during short-term water stress [68].\
    \ Moreover, crops consume extra energy by reducing\nchlorophyll b and interconverting\
    \ xanthophyll cycle pigments [69]. Therefore, previous studies found\nthat VIs\
    \ are prone to reﬂecting the chlorophyll and xanthophyll content, which are commonly\
    \ used\nto monitor crop water stress status. For instance, Baluja et al. [70]\
    \ assessed vineyard water status by\nTCARI/OSAVI with R2 values of 0.58 and 0.84\
    \ (n = 10) when compared to stem water potential and\nstomatal conductance, respectively.\
    \ Here, the CWSI based on regression models was used to obtain Ks\nfrom UAV multispectral\
    \ orthomosaic images, and two CWSI estimation methods were derived from\nTCARI/RDVI\
    \ and TCARI/SAVI. These two indices were designed to detect crop water stress\
    \ status\nin a more robust and adequate manner. In a relevant study by Zhang et\
    \ al. [19], TCARI/RDVI and\nTCARI/SAVI were used to evaluate the water stress\
    \ status of maize under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit\nirrigation, with respective\
    \ R2 values of 0.81 and 0.80 at the late reproductive and maturation stages.\n\
    The fc calculated by NDVI and the fc based on ﬁeld measurement were compared.\
    \ It was\nclear that the fc calculated by NDVI had a high correlation (R2 = 0.93)\
    \ with the ﬁeld measurement.\nPrevious studies have shown that the relationship\
    \ between fc and NDVI shows good agreement [49,51].\nConsidering the relationship\
    \ between fc and Ke, we established the Ke regression model. Finally,\nwe obtained\
    \ two diﬀerent models for Kc estimation. Both approaches to Kc in all growth periods\
    \ agreed\nwith the measured Kc data, with R2 and RMSE values varying from 0.68\
    \ to 0.80 and from 0.140 to 0.322,\nrespectively (Table 3). Compared to TCARI/SAVI,\
    \ TCARI/RDVI can more accurately characterize maize\nconditions in each irrigation\
    \ treatment, with smaller estimated deviations. These results are likely\ndue\
    \ to the lower sensitivity of TCARI/SAVI to the inﬂuence of diﬀerent water treatments.\
    \ Therefore,\nwe chose TCARI/RDVI to establish models between VIs and Kc. When\
    \ the water stress conditions were\nmore serious, the Kc model based on TCARI/RDVI\
    \ was less accurate. For example, the R2 and RMSE\nvalues of the Kc model in TR1\
    \ were 080 and 0.140, while the R2 and RMSE values of the Kc model in\nTR4 were\
    \ 0.68 and 0.232, with 32% water applied diﬀerence. The reason for this phenomenon\
    \ may be\nthat optical VIs do not allow the precise detection of serious water\
    \ stress [65]. Similar phenomena\nwere also found by Zhang and Zhou [29], Espinoza\
    \ et al. [71], and Zulini et al. [72].\nThe relationship between the measured\
    \ Kc and predicted Kc based on vegetation indices under\ndiﬀerent water treatments\
    \ was compared in three diﬀerent growth stages. There was a rapidly\ndecreasing\
    \ trend in the slopes of the linear regression models between the measured Kc\
    \ and the\npredicted Kc throughout the growth phase (Figure 6), indicating that\
    \ the correlation of the measured\nKc with the predicted Kc obtained from vegetation\
    \ indices in the late vegetative stage was higher than\nthose in the two other\
    \ growth stages. It could be also observed that when water stress was more\nserious\
    \ in the maturation stage, a higher slope value was found, such as −0.17 in TR4.\
    \ The results\nshowed that UAV multispectral VIs could distinguish diﬀerent levels\
    \ of deﬁcit irrigation treatments.\nOverall, multispectral VIs (NDVI and TCARI/RDVI)\
    \ could be used to monitor the Kc of ﬁeld maize\nduring the whole growth period\
    \ and under diﬀerent water treatments.\nSensors 2019, 19, 5250\n13 of 17\nSensors\

    \ by visible and thermal proximal sensing\nsystems under different water stress\
    \ levels to evaluate the canopy water content (CWC). The oven-\ndrying method\
    \ was employed for assessing the canopy’s water state. This CWC is of great importance\n\
    for irrigation management decisions. The proposed framework is to integrate visible\
    \ and thermal\nimaging data using an artiﬁcial neural network as a valuable promising\
    \ implement for accurately\nestimating the water content of the plant. The RGB-based\
    \ features included 20 color vegetation indices\n(VI) and 6 gray level co-occurrence\
    \ matrix-based texture features (GLCMF). The thermal imaging\nfeatures were two\
    \ thermal indicators (T), namely normalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT)\n\
    and the crop water stress index (CWSI), that were deliberated by plant temperatures.\
    \ These features\nwere applied with a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for\
    \ training the samples with minimal\nloss on a cross-validation set. Model behavior\
    \ was affected by ﬁltering high-level features and\noptimizing hyperparameters\
    \ of the model. The results indicated that feature-based modeling from\nboth visible\
    \ and thermal images achieved better performance than features from the individual\n\
    visible or thermal image. The supreme prediction variables were 21 features: 14VI,\
    \ 5GLCMF,\nand 2T. The fusion of color–texture–thermal features greatly improved\
    \ the precision of water content\nevaluation (99.40%). Its determination coefﬁcient\
    \ (R2 = 0.983) was the most satisﬁed with an RMSE\nof 0.599. Overall, the methodology\
    \ of this work can support decision makers and water managers to\ntake effective\
    \ and timely actions and achieve agricultural water sustainability.\nKeywords:\

    \ of global water resources are consumed through agriculture [1]. Ex-\ntreme water\
    \ use in the agricultural sector also causes water scarcity in semi-arid and arid\n\
    regions [2]. Rice is one of the most economical crops that requires large amounts\
    \ of water.\nDecreasing water availability for agriculture threatens the productivity\
    \ of the irrigated\nrice ecosystem and ways to save water and increase the water\
    \ productivity of rice must\nbe found [3]. By optimizing the timing, duration,\
    \ and amount of irrigation and drainage,\nwater-saving irrigation practice has\
    \ been proven effective in saving water and increasing\nrice yield [4]. To improve\
    \ the water use efﬁciency of plants, it is important to accurately\nand timely\
    \ predict crop water status. Canopy water content (CWC) is a signiﬁcant factor\n\
    in regard to the water use efﬁciency of plants [5], drought assessment [6], a\
    \ key input\nvariable in irrigation management decisions, and crop ripening monitoring\
    \ [7]. Moreover,\nit is a vital parameter that reﬂects plant physiological status\
    \ and health [8]. It is one of the\nindicators widely used to evaluate a plant’s\
    \ water condition [9]. Traditionally, there are\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785.\
    \ https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13091785\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n2 of 23\nvarious manners of observing the water state\
    \ in a plant such as lab-based leaf water content\nanalysis [10], stomatal conductance\
    \ [11], and sap ﬂow measurement [12]. Despite the high\nprecision delivered by\
    \ these ways, they are time consuming, destructive and laborious,\nparticularly\
    \ in large-scale areas [13]. Moreover, the interest in monitoring the plant water\n\
    status has increased in the scientiﬁc community through remote sensing, which\
    \ is very\nwidely used to reliably retrieve leaf water content [8].\nWe focused\
    \ on modern procedures for estimation of the CWC from optical remote sens-\ning\
    \ data, especially from visible (RGB: red–green–blue) and thermal imaging. These\
    \ have\nseveral beneﬁts compared to hyperspectral sensors. Thermal sensing is\
    \ useful since it is\ncheap, non-destructive, convenient, and can be done remotely\
    \ [14]. Digital imaging may\nprovide a low-cost and easy-to-use alternative [15].\
    \ The hyperspectral camera is heavy,\nexpensive, and requires professional imaging\
    \ and data processing [16]. The superiority of\nproximity sensing technology with\
    \ regression algorithm relies on three major aspects: hand-\ncrafted feature selection,\
    \ data fusion for different sensors, and selecting the best model\nhyperparameters.\
    \ Elsherbiny et al. [17] explained that the regression algorithms could be\nupgraded\
    \ for robust prediction of rice water status through some actions, including high-\n\
    level features nominating, hyperparameters optimization, providing various alternatives\n\
    for the most sensitive features, and integrating the model with the best-combined\
    \ features.\nPrimary, common methods for extracting RGB-based features include\
    \ color vegetation\nindices (VI) and gray level co-occurrence matrix-established\
    \ texture features (GLCMF).\nSeveral studies have found that the crop water deﬁcit\
    \ will directly affect the biochemical\nprocesses and morphology of crops, and\
    \ this effect can be observed in the color changes of\nthe crop leaves. Digital\
    \ images are composited by pixels, which are a combination of the\ncolor channels\
    \ RGB. The VI can be calculated from these channels [18]. Wang et al. [19]\ngenerated\
    \ regression models using the G–R parameter of the RGB color system with the\n\
    moisture content of cotton and the moisture content index. The prediction accuracies\
    \ were\nup to 90.7% and 91.0%, respectively. Zakaluk and Sri [20] checked the\
    \ use of artiﬁcial neural\nnetworks (ANN) for digital images, taken by a 5 megapixel\
    \ RGB camera to predict the leaf\nwater potential of potato plants. Then, the\
    \ relationship between leaf water potential and\nimage features was determined.\n\
    Another variant of GLCMF was derived from RGB images to estimate the water\nsituation\
    \ in plants. Wenting et al. [21] concluded the relationship between GLCMF of the\n\
    RGB image of crop leaves and leaf water content at heading-stage maize with an\
    \ expected\nR2 value of 0.702 and the RMSE was within ±2%. Shao et al. [22] indicated\
    \ that GLCMF-\nbased partial least square regression model can predict water content\
    \ in grapevines with\nbetter performance. The prediction R2 was 0.833 with an\
    \ RMSE of 1.049. Additionally,\nthe thermal imaging system can provide an indication\
    \ of the water condition in the plant.\nLeaf temperature is an alternative measure\
    \ that is a suitable indicator of a plant’s water\nstate [23]. Moller et al. [24]\
    \ showed that thermal imagery can be used to accurately estimate\ncrop water status.\
    \ Ballester et al. [25] used a handheld infrared thermal imager to study\nleaf\
    \ moisture content in citrus trees and persimmon trees.\nThe integration of different\
    \ data sources was a vital component of this work to im-\nprove the quality and\
    \ robustness of the CWC prediction model. This has previously been\nused to evaluate\
    \ plant phenotypes. Moller et al. [24] elucidated that the fusion of visible\n\
    and thermal imaging could develop the accuracy of the crop water stress index\
    \ (CWSI) com-\nputation and provide accurate data on the crop water status of\
    \ grapevines. Shao et al. [22]\nclariﬁed that the incorporation of both GLCMF\
    \ and reﬂectance features could enable the\nprediction of water content of grapevines\
    \ and be beneﬁcial for grapevine management and\nachieved prediction R2 of 0.900\
    \ with an RMSE of 0.826.\nThe hyperparameter optimization of the model is another\
    \ factor that has a signiﬁcant\nimpact on the efﬁciency of water content prediction.\
    \ The performance of any machine\nlearning (ML) model is profoundly affected by\
    \ hyperparameter selection, which has several\nbeneﬁts: it can improve the performance\
    \ of ML algorithms [26] and improve the repro-\nducibility and fairness of scientiﬁc\
    \ studies [27]. Furthermore, it could perform a major role\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 1785\n3 of 23\nin improving the prediction model because of the direct control\
    \ of the behaviors of training\nalgorithms [28]. In this research, the ANN building\
    \ possibility was used as a tool to support\naccurate irrigation management decision\
    \ making by means of visible and thermal sensors.\nDawson et al. [29] developed\
    \ an ANN model for predicting water content in leaves de-\npending on single leaf\
    \ reﬂectance and transmittance, which are important input variables\nto vegetation\
    \ canopy reﬂectance models. The R2 was deﬁned as 0.86 with an RMSE of 1.3%.\n\
    Marti et al. [30] described the application of ANN to estimate stem water potential\
    \ from soil\nmoisture at different depths and standard meteorological variables,\
    \ such as temperature,\nrelative humidity, and solar radiation. The ANN presented\
    \ high-performance accuracy\nwith an optimum R2 of 0.926.\nTo maximize irrigation\
    \ in rice ﬁelds, the plant’s water content should be explored\naccurately via\
    \ proximal sensing systems. Although visible and thermal imagery are widely\n\
    used to estimate water content in plants, the best performing algorithm has a\
    \ high priority\nin research interests. Based on our knowledge, no prior research\
    \ has implemented the\nhybrid methodology of BPNN with features extracted from\
    \ thermal and RGB imaging to\ndevelop a predictive model for accurate estimation\
    \ of the water content status of rice under\ndifferent irrigation water treatments\
    \ and climate change. Hence, the main objectives of\nthis study were (i) to create\
    \ a well-structured CWC modeling of rice relying on high-level\nfeatures derived\
    \ from RGB and thermal images, (ii) to deﬁne the superior variants of\nthermal\
    \ and RGB features for robust CWC prediction, and (iii) to evaluate the performance\n\
    of BPNN models using the best-combined features and to adopt the ﬁnest model that\
    \ could\nbe recommended for precision irrigation in the future.\n2. Materials\
    \ and Methods\n2.1. Experimental Design\nThe experiment was conducted on 120 potted\
    \ plants of rice under natural conditions\nat Zhejiang University (120◦09′E, 30◦14′N),\
    \ Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, P.R. China.\nOften, a plastic cover was set\
    \ up over the plants during precipitation to control the water\nadded for them,\
    \ and to obtain the heterogeneous water condition from the tested leaves.\nTo\
    \ prepare the germination, the rice seeds (Xiushui 134) were submerged in the\
    \ water\nfor four days at a temperature of 28–30 ◦C, and the water was replaced\
    \ twice a day.\nThen, the 10 rice plants were sown into a single PVC (polyvinyl\
    \ chloride) pot, which had\ndimensions of 140 × 95 × 125 mm. Each pot was ﬁlled\
    \ with 300 g of black peat moss\n(HAWITA Gruppe GmbH, Germany) and was irrigated\
    \ to achieve saturation during\nthe ﬁrst growing month. The compound fertilizer\
    \ treatment, N–P2O5–K2O (15-15-15),\nwith a rate of 100 kg ha−1 was applied at\
    \ 10-day intervals, produced by Qingdao SONEF\nChemical Company. Potted rice plants\
    \ were transplanted on July 10, 2018 and divided into\n3 groups, each with 40\
    \ pots. It was harvested on August 12, August 30, and September 21,\n2018 for\
    \ the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd groups, respectively. Table 1 shows the summary statistics\n\
    of air temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD). The values\
    \ of\nVPD were determined from the formula stated by Abtew and Melesse [31]. In\
    \ this work,\nthere were three different growth stages of the rice plants: tillering,\
    \ stem elongation,\nand panicle initiation. The water deﬁcit was implemented within\
    \ a period of 27–34 days,\n34–52 days, and 52–74 days of plant life for the 1st,\
    \ 2nd, and 3rd groups, respectively.\nAs declared in Figure 1, an experiment was\
    \ carried out with a completely randomized\nblock design in a factorial experiment.\
    \ The experimental design was divided into three\ngroups, each comprising four\
    \ irrigation treatments: fully-irrigated (T1: 100%), mild (T2:\n80–70%), moderate\
    \ (T3: 60–50%), and severe water stress (T4: 40–30% ﬁeld capacity),\nrespectively.\
    \ The number of replicates (R1, R2, etc.) of treatment was 10 samples. Generally,\n\
    the gravimetric approach was used to measure the volume of water by manually weighing\n\
    pots twice a day, supplemented by replacing the transpiration of water to preserve\
    \ the\nrespective moisture stress conditions. Gross water applied volumes were\
    \ estimated for\neach group, 1st stage values were 44.35, 41.65, 39.4, and 37.15\
    \ L (liter) for well-controlled,\nmild, moderate, and severe stress conditions,\

    \ infrared camera is Tau2-640 (FLIR systems, Inc., USA), which had a\nresolution\
    \ of 640 × 512 pixels, and a focal length of 19 mm. The sensitivity of the Tau2-640\n\
    camera is 0.05 ◦C (50 mK), and the accuracy of the measurement is ±5% after calibration.\n\
    The thermal sensor has a spectral response in the range of 7.5–13.5 µm. The thermal\n\
    camera was mounted on a tripod at a distance of 1 m above the crop, and the angular\n\
    ﬁeld of view was perpendicular to the plants. The thermal images were taken from\
    \ the\ntop view of the plant canopy. The water status measurements were conducted\
    \ between\n12:00 and 13:00 local standard time on all plants, when the crop plants\
    \ had a maximum\ndaytime temperature, were in perfect sun, and with minimal wind\
    \ movement. The crops\nexhibit high emissivity as well as low reﬂectivity [32].\
    \ In the thermal images, a signiﬁcant\ndifference in soil temperature was noticed,\
    \ but when the soil was masked out, it was not\nimportant when remaining focused\
    \ on the crop. The thermal value obtained by thermal\ninfrared images was originally\
    \ stored in the raw image in which each pixel is 14 bits.\nThe raw format can\
    \ be converted to JPG ﬁle format to explain the temperature distribution\nof plants\
    \ in each part of the image. The following is the equation for calculating the\n\
    transformed temperature from the thermal raw image [33]:\nTem = [Thraw × 0.04]\
    \ − 273.15\n(1)\nwhere Thraw and Tem (◦C) represent the thermal value and the\
    \ corresponding pixel tem-\nperature, respectively. The ﬁrst constant (0.04) is\
    \ to calibrate the thermal camera and obtain\nthe image pixel temperature (◦K),\
    \ and the second value (−273.15) is to convert Kelvin\nto Celsius.\n2.4. Image\
    \ Segmentation\nVarious objects such as rice plants, soil, and pots were included\
    \ in the thermal and\nRGB images collected at the different growth stages of the\
    \ rice plants. It was necessary\nto separate the plants and backgrounds for the\
    \ efﬁcient computation of the canopy water\ncontent. Firstly, for the RGB images,\
    \ a thresholding technique was employed, which is a\nprocess of image segmentation\
    \ to convert the image to grayscale [34] and produce a binary\nimage [34], which\
    \ has two possible pixel values, namely the intensity value of the image\nthat\
    \ is more than or equal to the threshold value of 1 (white or foreground) and\
    \ when\nit is less than the threshold value or value 0 (black or background) that\
    \ can be removed.\nEach pixel in the binary image has a size of 1 bit. After separating\
    \ the rice pixels from the\nbackground objects, a set of candidate features, including\
    \ color and texture, were extracted\nfor further analysis. Secondly, for the thermal\
    \ images, python software was employed\nto generate a code for segmenting the\
    \ rice plants. The ground temperature was higher\nthan any parts in the image,\
    \ despite the soil and pot being lower than others. Accordingly,\nwe can separate\
    \ the temperature of the objects as either higher or lower than that of rice\n\
    plants. Average plant temperature was calculated for all pixels in each thermal\
    \ image.\nFigure 3 describes thermal image segmentation and canopy temperature\
    \ distribution\nduring the different irrigation treatments in the three growth\
    \ stages of the rice. At the 1st\nstage, the canopy temperatures were observed\
    \ in the ranges of 32–33.5 ◦C (well-watered),\n33.8–35.4 ◦C (mild stress), 35.75–36.5\
    \ ◦C (moderate stress), and 36.9–37.55 ◦C (severe stress).\nThe canopy temperature\
    \ ranges for such treatments at the 2nd stage were 37.5–39.1 ◦C,\n39.22–41.72\
    \ ◦C, 42.39–45.8 ◦C, and 46.24–48 ◦C, respectively. Their corresponding values\
    \ at\nthe 3rd stage were 22.85–24.5 ◦C, 25–27.7 ◦C, 28–30.1 ◦C, and 30.5–33 ◦C,\

    \ Extraction from RGB Images\nRGB images contain large amounts of data, thereby\
    \ analyzing the image requires a\nlarge volume of memory and leads to more time.\
    \ Consequently, to decrease the volume of\ndata, an image is depicted using a\
    \ series of features. The purpose is to capture the image’s\ncertain visual properties.\
    \ Feature extraction has a crucial role in different image processing\nsystems.\
    \ The most common ways to extract features from RGB images are RGB color space\n\
    percentage and GLCM-based texture features.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n7 of\
    \ 23\n2.5.1. RGB Color Space Percentage\nThe RGB imagery involves three bands\
    \ of red, green, and blue, where each band has\na value of each pixel [35]. The\
    \ rice plants modiﬁed the content of chlorophyll to balance\nphotosynthesis and\
    \ transpiration under conditions of water stress. The RGB channel values\nwere\
    \ affected, owing to different levels of canopy water content. The percentage\
    \ values of\nthe RGB color space were determined as typical features using the\
    \ following formulas:\nR=\n1\nSnum ∑\nSnum\ni=1 Ri\n(2)\nG=\n1\nSnum ∑\nSnum\n\
    i=1 Gi\n(3)\nB=\n1\nSnum ∑\nSnum\ni=1 Bi\n(4)\nwhere Ri, Gi, and Bi are the pixel\
    \ value for the red, green, and blue band in the digital\nimage, respectively;\
    \ i and Snum are the ﬁrst pixel and the maximum number of pixels,\nrespectively;\
    \ R, G, and B are mean values of RGB color space.\nAbout 20 color vegetation indices\
    \ for plant water status estimation were evaluated.\nTable 2 reveals RGB-based\
    \ vegetation indices as claimed by numerous previous studies.\nIn our study, these\
    \ indices were examined to explore their feasibility for CWC modeling\nand compared\

    \ Matrix-Based Texture Features (GLCMF)\nSeveral studies related to assessing\
    \ the water status of the plant have used GLCMF:\nWenting et al. [21], to predict\
    \ maize leaf moisture content, and Ushada et al. [46], to estimate\nthe moisture\
    \ content and leaf water potential of moss. This is based on the fact that changes\n\
    in the textural appearance of a plant canopy due to the water status reﬂects tonal\
    \ variations\nover the community of plants [47]. The co-occurrence matrix is a\
    \ statistical method for\nexamining the texture of a grayscale image [48]. The\
    \ GLCMF analyzes the grayscale rela-\ntionship between two pixels in the image\
    \ space that are separated by a certain distance and\nthen randomly extracts the\
    \ canopy texture feature information premised on probability\ncharacteristics.\
    \ There were six variants of GLCMF in this study such as contrast, dissimilar-\n\
    ity, homogeneity, angular second moment (ASM), energy, and correlation. The contrast\n\
    clearly represents the depth of the image and texture. Dissimilarity measures\
    \ the distance\nbetween pairs of pixels in the region of interest. Homogeneity\
    \ estimates the closeness of\nthe distribution of elements in the GLCMF. ASM discovers\
    \ the roughness distribution and\ntexture image. Energy measures textural uniformity.\
    \ The correlation ﬁnds out the degree of\ncorrelation in the local grayscale image.\
    \ The RGB-based GLCMF variables are explicated,\nas shown in Table 3.\nTable 3.\

    \ Thermal Images\nThermal indicators (T) are features extracted from thermal images\
    \ depending on the\nrice plant temperatures, which consist of two indices in this\
    \ study: the crop water stress\nindex (CWSI) and normalized relative canopy temperature\
    \ (NRCT).\n2.6.1. Canopy Temperature-Based Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI)\nThe\
    \ CWSI deduced from canopy temperature for many crops has been widely nom-\ninated\
    \ as an instrument to elucidate plant water conditions and schedule irrigation\
    \ [50].\nThe CWSI concept is linked to the standard in which the leaf surface\
    \ is cooled during the\ntranspiration process, and as soil moisture in the root\
    \ zone is also depleted, leaf temperature\nincreases and stomatal transpiration\
    \ and conductance decrease. An empirical approach\nwas proposed to determine crop\
    \ water stress as reported by Idso et al. [51]:\nCWSI =\n[(Tc − Ta) − (Tnws −\
    \ Ta)]\nh\x10\nTdry − Ta\n\x11\n− (Tnws − Ta)\ni\n(5)\nwhere Ta, Tc, Tnws, and\
    \ Tdry are air temperature (◦C), canopy temperature (◦C), non-water-\nstressed\
    \ canopy temperature (◦C), and water-stressed canopy temperature (◦C), respectively.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n9 of 23\n2.6.2. Normalized Relative Canopy Temperature\
    \ (NRCT)\nTo calculate the NRCT index, wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures were\
    \ suggested by\nJackson et al. [23] as the lower and upper baseline, respectively.\
    \ As stated in the formula\nby Elsayed and Darwish [9], the NRCT was computed\
    \ as follows:\nNRCT =\nTc − Tmin\nTmax − Tmin\n(6)\nwhere Tmin and Tmax are the\
    \ lowest and highest temperatures measured in the experiment\n(◦C), respectively.\n\
    2.7. Canopy Water Content Computation\nAfter scanning by the visible and thermal\
    \ imaging system, the plants in each pot were\npicked. The roots were removed\
    \ and the rest was studied to provide a reference for data\nanalysis. Thus, the\
    \ above-ground part of the plants in one pot was deﬁned as one sample\nin this\
    \ study. To obtain the fresh weight (FW), the samples were weighed before drying.\n\
    Then, the dry weight (DW) was obtained after drying the samples for 24 h in an\
    \ oven at\na temperature of 70 ◦C. The percentage of canopy water content was\
    \ estimated by the\nfollowing formula:\nCWC (%) = FW − DW\nFW\n× 100\n(7)\n2.8.\
    \ Dataset and Data Analysis Software\nA total of 120 readings were split into\
    \ training, validation, and testing, where 80%\n(96 samples) were used for the\
    \ training and validation process of the regression model,\nwhile the other 20%\
    \ (24 samples) were used to verify the model’s performance by com-\nparing the\
    \ expected CWC values with the calculated CWC values. A leave-one-out cross-\n\
    validation (LOOCV) approach was utilized to train and validate the model. LOOCV\
    \ ex-\ncludes one sample for validation and uses the rest of the samples for training\
    \ in every trial.\nThis method can decrease over-ﬁtting and permits a more accurate\
    \ assessment of model\nprediction strength [52]. The feature selection, model\
    \ establishment, and data analysis were\nimplemented using Python 3.7.3. The ANN\
    \ module from the Scikit-learn library version\n0.20.2 was used for the regression\
    \ task. The software was run on a PC with Intel Core\ni7-3630QM, 2.4 GHz CPU,\
    \ and 8 GB RAM.\n2.9. Implementation of a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN)\n\
    The BPNN employs the multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) as a supervised learning\n\
    algorithm that contains a ﬂexible function to train a speciﬁc data set [53]. MLP\
    \ is one of\nthe neural network models that has the same back-propagation structure\
    \ for supervised\ntraining. Typically, back-propagation is used for the training\
    \ of feed-forward. The neural\nnetwork is structured from 3 types of layers: (1)\
    \ the input layer is the primary data for the\nneural network, (2) the hidden\
    \ layer is an intermediate layer between the independent\ninputs layer and dependent\
    \ output layer, and (3) the output layer produces the results\nof the speciﬁed\
    \ inputs. Figure 4 displays the architecture of an artiﬁcial neural network,\n\
    which is a class of machine learning algorithms. It uses multiple layers to gradually\n\
    extract high-level features from the raw input. Five squares as input layers are\
    \ noted\nas vector I. The network contains two hidden layers, the number of nodes\
    \ determined\naccording to regression accuracy. Four squares as hidden layers\
    \ represent the “activation”\nnodes and usually are noted as weight; W, Wh, and\
    \ Wo are with layers 1–2, 2–3, and 3–4,\nrespectively. The ﬁnal square represents\
    \ the output layer that shows the predicted value\nof canopy water content. The\
    \ bias neuron (B) is a special neuron added to each layer in\nthe neural network,\
    \ which is usually taken to be 1 [54]. The artiﬁcial neural networks\nare generalized\

    Input variants involve RGB-based features (color: 20VI and texture: 6GLCMF) and\n\
    thermal properties (2T). To facilitate the model training process, a transformation\
    \ was\nperformed to rescale the features. Normalization is transformed across\
    \ individual features\n(f) to adjust for differences in magnitude between different\
    \ features. Feature normalization\n(fnorm) is computed by subtracting the minimum\
    \ image data (fmin) and by dividing the\ndifference between the maximum (fmax)\
    \ and the minimum feature value as shown by the\nfollowing formula:\nfnorm =\n\
    f − fmin\nfmax − fmin\n(8)\nThe neuron is the primary component of ANN, which\
    \ involves its elementary math-\nematical functions. The neuron output (y) can\
    \ be expressed by the following equation:\nwhere Wn indicates the nth weights\
    \ of the combination that produces the output, θ is the\nunit step function, W\
    \ is the weight related with the nth input, and µ is the average.\ny (θ) × ∑\n\
    n\nj=1(Wn − µ)\n(9)\nThe generalized weight (W) can be realized using the equation\

    \ outcome probability by covariate vector,\nand log-odds is a link function for\
    \ the neural network.\nW =\n∂log(\no(x)\n1−o(x))\n∂xi\n(10)\nAt training, the\

    the LOOV method was performed on the training dataset. The parameter of limited\n\
    memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (lbfgs) was used as a weight optimizer\
    \ to\nimplement the algorithm efﬁciently [56]. Otherwise, there are several methodologies\
    \ to\nselect premium features depending on feature selection algorithms that have\
    \ become an\nobvious requirement for prediction and modeling [57]. Glorfeld [58]\
    \ concluded that an\nindex, such as the following BPNN algorithm in this analysis,\
    \ can be used to select the\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n11 of 23\nmost important\

    \ Selection\nOne of the purposes of this research was to compare different features\
    \ during training\nthe BPNN model. The three types of the dataset (samples×features)\
    \ for analysis were\n120 × 20, 120 × 6, and 120 × 2. These data were employed\
    \ as input for the neural network.\nWe optimized the model by selecting the prominent\

    Various combinations of variables were examined to predict CWC, and the top neural\n\
    network architectures for hidden conﬁgurations were presented. The numbers of\
    \ hidden\nneurons were different due to the variations in the feature values extracted\
    \ from the\nvisible and thermal images. The proposed features of color indices,\
    \ texture characteristics,\nand thermal indicators were evaluated to adopt the\
    \ best-combined variants.\n3.1.1. Color Vegetation Indices (VI)\nThe optimal VI\
    \ identiﬁed in each loop during neural network training are clariﬁed in\nFigure\
    \ 6. The neural network performance was estimated with different VI. As explained\n\
    in Table 4, model performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, and MAPE) were evaluated through\n\
    training, cross-validation, and a test set. Moreover, the prediction accuracy\
    \ (Acc) was\ncalculated. The best hyperparameters such as hidden neurons, activation\
    \ function, and the\nmaximum number of iterations of the neural network were chosen.\
    \ Several architectures\nof the BPNN model relying on VI were collected. The best\
    \ neural network results were\nattained by fusing data of 14VI at the 7th loop,\
    \ as displayed in Figure 6. The ﬁnest\nhyperparameters of activation function,\
    \ hidden neurons, and maximum iterations were\nlogistic, (19,15), and 119 iterations,\
    \ respectively. The RMSECV decreased to 2.291 vs. 2. 444\ncompared to 14VI vs.\
    \ 20VI. The prediction ability of the BPNN-VI-14 model increased\nequivalent to\
    \ the model with full VI, with prediction R2 (0.632 vs. 0.556), MAPE (2.832% vs.\n\
    3.273%), RMSE (2.788 vs. 3.065), MSE (7.776 vs. 9.394), and Acc (0.972 vs. 0.967).\n\

    \ three growth stages, were grown with four levels of irrigation\nunder outdoor\
    \ conditions. The temperature of the rice canopy was affected by the water\nstress.\
    \ The temperatures of non-water stressed and water-stressed canopy were 31 ◦C\n\
    and 38 ◦C at the 1st stage, 37 ◦C and 49.1 ◦C at the 2nd stage, and 22 ◦C and\
    \ 34.07 ◦C at\nthe 3rd stage, respectively. We exploited the previous temperatures\
    \ for computing the\ntwo thermal indicators: CWSI and NRCT. The relationship of\
    \ both CWSI and NRCT with\nthe CWC of rice at each growth stage is designated\
    \ in Figure 8. It was observed to be\ninversely related, and the R2 at each stage\
    \ independently was higher than the R2 at three\nstages. By applying ANN with\
    \ thermal indicators, the prediction formula to compute the\nCWC at any stage\
    \ of rice growth was explored with high accuracy. The neural network\noutputs\
    \ with thermal indicators at the 1st and 2nd loop are illuminated in Table 6.\
    \ It depicts\nthe optimal parameters of the T-based BPNN model and its outputs\
    \ (R2, MAPE, RMSE,\nMSE, and Acc) through cross-validation, training, and test\

    \ for CWC computation (R2 = 0.803,\nMAPE = 1.989%, RMSE = 2.043, MSE = 4.172,\

    \ Features Extracted from Visible and Thermal Imagery\nThe ﬁndings inferred that\
    \ in comparison with the BPNN-GLCMF-5 and BPNN-VI-14\nmodels, the BPNN-T-2 model\
    \ had dependable foretelling. Further, the thermal indica-\ntors (T) were joined\
    \ with VI and GLCMF to improve the forecasting performance and\ndiscover the unmatched\
    \ model. The three approaches were espoused as a new expecta-\ntion procedure\
    \ of the rice water content, incorporating VI-T, GLCMF-T, and VI-GLCMF-T\nfeatures\
    \ with the BPNN model. Their outputs (MSE, RMSE, and MAPE) and notable\nparameters\
    \ are disclosed in Table 7. The order of the models was deﬁned by the smallest\n\
    RMSECV: the performance of BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T-21>BPNN-GLCM-T-7>BPNN-VI-T-16.\nTheir\
    \ corresponding values at cross-validation R2 were 0.984 (RMSECV = 0.361), 0.982\n\
    (RMSECV = 0.447), and 0.956 (RMSECV = 0.661), respectively. Their prediction outputs\n\
    with the R2, MAPE, RMSE, MSE, and Acc were 0.983, 0.564%, 0.599, 0.359, and 0.994;\
    \ 0.972,\n0.668%, 0.764, 0.583, and 0.993; and 0.978, 0.682%, 0.674, 0.455, and\
    \ 0.993, respectively.\nThe distinguishing parameters of the most robust model\
    \ were with hidden layer neurons\n(8,9), activation function (logistic), and maximum\
    \ iterations (422). The BPNN-VI-GLCM-T-\n21 model had quick predictive outcomes\
    \ within 31.911 s for a single sample compared to the\noven-drying method [17,60];\
    \ a test time of 24 h is required to dry the sample. The ﬁndings\nare in agreement\
    \ with Meeradevi et al. [61] who used ANN as a fast tool with a prediction\ntime\
    \ of 9.74 s. The results elucidated that the improvement in prediction accuracy\
    \ of CWC\ncan be fulﬁlled if adequate neural network parameters and higher variables\
    \ are assigned.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n16 of 23\nTable 7. Various architectures\

    \ (sec).\n3.2. Neural Network Learning Curves with Super Features\nThe learning\
    \ curve of the regression model was promoted in this study through the\nfollowing\
    \ considerations: (1) number and characteristics of nominated features, (2) pick-\n\
    ing the supreme parameters, and (3) neural network deﬁnite iterations to avoid\
    \ model\nover-ﬁtting. The ﬁrst two points are discussed in the previous sections.\
    \ The last factor\nrefers to the neural network stopping at speciﬁc iterations\
    \ that can progress the network\nperformance, as indicated in Figure 9. These\
    \ curves exhibit an evaluation of the model’s\nbehavior with the higher variants\
    \ at training, cross-validation, and testing. As the number\nof iterations increases,\
    \ the accuracies of training, cross-validation, and testing increase\ngradually\
    \ to reach a point where the learning curves show a good model. As publicized\n\
    in Figure 9a–d, the optimal repetitions of the BPNN training process through the\
    \ highest\nvariables (14VI, 5GLCMF, 2T, and VI-GLCMF-T-21) were 119, 175, 217,\
    \ and 422 steps,\nrespectively. The learning curves of the innovative models reached\
    \ a cross-validation\naccuracy of 0.625, 0.656, 0.851, and 0.984, respectively.\
    \ The learning outcomes veriﬁed that\nthe accuracy measure steadily increases\
    \ over iterations of training. When the permissible\niterations of the neural\
    \ network are exceeded, the model generally takes the form of making\nan overly\
    \ complex model. Moreover, training accuracy was usually higher than cross-\n\
    validation accuracy. The three-stage model of BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T was accomplished\
    \ with\n21 variables and 422 steps. Its prediction accuracy was 99.4% (R2 = 0.983\
    \ with an RMSE\nof 0.599), and the learning curve performance was impressive (Figure\
    \ 9d). The expected\nperformance was improved as said by Thawornwong and Enke\
    \ [62]; to avoid over-ﬁtting,\nthe network was trained by the back-propagation\
    \ algorithm with early stopping.\n3.3. Neural Network Topology with Higher Variants\n\
    The neural network architectures after gathering senior features are introduced\
    \ in\nFigure 10. This ﬁgure showed the best neural network structure with the\
    \ variants chosen.\nEach network topology offers basic information such as the\
    \ synaptic weights trained,\na range of hidden neuron layers, steps for converging,\
    \ and the overall errors. The network\ntopology is constructed with a speciﬁc\
    \ combination of input variables with a number of\nhidden neuron layers. For instance,\
    \ the model of BPNN-VI-14 had hidden neuron layers\n(19,15), BPNN-GLCMF-5 needed\
    \ (6,10), BPNN-T-2 required (19,18), and BPNN-VI-GLCMF-\nT-21 desired (8,9). The\
    \ layout presented in Figure 10a depicts the BPNN-VI-14 model;\nthe training process\
    \ needed 119 steps to achieve a lower error function. The process has\nan overall\
    \ error of roughly 2.358. The learning process of the BPNN-GLCMF-5 model\n(Figure\
    \ 10b) demands 175 steps, containing an overall error of about 3.130. At the BPNN-T-\n\
    2 model (Figure 10c), the training process obligated 217 steps with a total error\
    \ of about\n0.960. At the BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T-21 model (Figure 10d), the learning\
    \ process requested\n422 steps, and the overall error was 0.0317.\n3.4. Canopy\
    \ Water Content Prediction and Validation\nFrom the results, the thermal features\
    \ had a high ranking for measuring the CWC of\nrice in contrast to VI and GLCMF.\
    \ The super thermal variables were linked to acceptable-\nlevel features as follows:\
    \ VI-GLCMF-T, VI-T, and GLCM-T. The VI-GLCMF-T features\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13,\
    \ 1785\n17 of 23\nwere the premium integration to ﬁlter the uppermost variables.\
    \ The neural network\nwas trained with the previous features (independent variables)\
    \ for predicting the CWC\n(dependent variable). The expected CWC values were then\
    \ compared with the reserved\nvalues not implemented for the neural network. Figure\
    \ 11 illustrates the scatter plots of\nobserved and predicted CWC in rice exploiting\
    \ the proposed features. This study evaluated\nmultivariate methods and compared\
    \ the results clearly, so the use of multivariate methods\ngreatly enhances predictability.\
    \ Independent validation can also be considered the most\nrobust method for evaluating\
    \ the accuracy of the regression model since validation data\nare not involved\
    \ in the model development process. The BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T-21 was\nthe ﬁrst best\
    \ predictive model as evidenced by the performance and showed a stronger\nrelationship\
    \ between the superlative features and CWC. These features involved in this\n\
    model are of great signiﬁcance for predicting water content. Its outputs with\
    \ R2 were\n0.984 (cross-validation) and 0.983 (test set). The BPNN-GLCMF-T-7 model\
    \ ranked second\nin performance. The R2 value was 0.982 and 0.972 in the cross-validation\
    \ and test set,\nrespectively. The BPNN-VI-T-16 was the third highest accurate\
    \ model (R2 = 0.956 and\n0.978 for cross-validation and test set, respectively).\
    \ Models constructed with individual\nfeatures of either VI or GLCMF had lower\
    \ performance expectations, while these features\ncombined with 2T achieved robust\
    \ forecasting. Otherwise, the residual value plays a vital\nrole to validate the\
    \ obtained regression model. The difference between the actual CWC\nand the predicted\
    \ CWC value is the residual. We calculated the residual value with the\nﬁrst three\
    \ higher models. At BPNN-VI-GLCM-T-21, −1.223% and 1.916% were the lowest\nand\
    \ highest residuals for the CWC prediction, respectively. At BPNN-VI-T-16, the\
    \ lowest\nand highest residuals were −1.128% and 1.380%, while the lowest residuals\
    \ of −0.583%\nand highest of 2.859% were calculated with BPNN-GLCMF-T-7.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n\

    3.4. Canopy Water Content Prediction and Validation \nFrom the results, the thermal features had a high ranking for measuring the CWC of \n\
    rice in contrast to VI and GLCMF. The super thermal variables were linked to acceptable‐\n\
    level features as follows: VI‐GLCMF‐T, VI‐T, and GLCM‐T. The VI‐GLCMF‐T features \n\
    were the premium integration to filter the uppermost variables. The neural network was \n\
    trained with the previous features (independent variables) for predicting the CWC (de‐\n\
    pendent variable). The expected CWC values were then compared with the reserved val‐\n\
    ues not implemented for the neural network. Figure 11 illustrates the scatter plots of ob‐\n\
    served and predicted CWC in rice exploiting the proposed features. This study evaluated \n\
    multivariate methods and compared the results clearly, so the use of multivariate meth‐\n\
    ods greatly enhances predictability. Independent validation can also be considered the \n\
    most robust method for evaluating the accuracy of the regression model since validation \n\
    data are not involved in the model development process. The BPNN‐VI‐GLCMF‐T‐21 was \n\
    the first best predictive model as evidenced by the performance and showed a stronger \n\
    relationship between the superlative features and CWC. These features involved in this \n\
    model are of great significance for predicting water content. Its outputs with R2 were 0.984 \n\
    (cross‐validation) and 0.983 (test set). The BPNN‐GLCMF‐T‐7 model ranked second in \n\
    performance. The R2 value was 0.982 and 0.972 in the cross‐validation and test set, respec‐\n\
    tively. The BPNN‐VI‐T‐16 was the third highest accurate model (R2 = 0.956 and 0.978 for \n\

    the predicted CWC value is the residual. We calculated the residual value with the first \n\
    three higher models. At BPNN‐VI‐GLCM‐T‐21, −1.223% and 1.916% were the lowest and \n\
    highest residuals for the CWC prediction, respectively. At BPNN‐VI‐T‐16, the lowest and \n\
    highest residuals were −1.128% and 1.380%, while the lowest residuals of −0.583% and \n\

    Color and texture are two important aspects in digital imagery. Plant temperature is \n\
    also a remarkable tool in thermal imaging, which can be used as an indicator to identify a \n\
    plantʹs water condition. The plant color feature can be used for plant stress assessment \n\
    [63]. Texture analysis is significant in many areas such as remote sensing and its common \n\
    applications include image classification and pattern recognition [64]. These features of VI \n\
    and GLCMF were applied with a neural network for CWC quantification in rice. The re‐\n\
    sults confirmed that the neural network behavior with GLCMF was superior to VI for \n\
    predicting the water status of plants. This is similar to applying classification in the fol‐\n\
    lowing studies: Jana et al. [65], to classify eight varieties of fruits, and Dubey and Jalal [66], \n\
    to recognize diseases in fruits. Texture features performed better than color features for \n\
    classification via support vector machine algorithm with accuracy, 32.29% and 69.79% and \n\
    83.5% and 88.56%, respectively. Moreover, the thermal analysis results agreed with the \n\
    findings of Jones [67], who identified that water content or transpiration has an inverse \n\
    relationship with leaf temperature. The CWC values were highly influenced owing to the \n\

    4. Discussion\nColor and texture are two important aspects in digital imagery.\
    \ Plant temperature is\nalso a remarkable tool in thermal imaging, which can be\
    \ used as an indicator to identify a\nplant’s water condition. The plant color\
    \ feature can be used for plant stress assessment [63].\nTexture analysis is signiﬁcant\
    \ in many areas such as remote sensing and its common\napplications include image\
    \ classiﬁcation and pattern recognition [64]. These features of VI\nand GLCMF\
    \ were applied with a neural network for CWC quantiﬁcation in rice. The results\n\
    conﬁrmed that the neural network behavior with GLCMF was superior to VI for predicting\n\
    the water status of plants. This is similar to applying classiﬁcation in the following\
    \ studies:\nJana et al. [65], to classify eight varieties of fruits, and Dubey\
    \ and Jalal [66], to recognize\ndiseases in fruits. Texture features performed\
    \ better than color features for classiﬁcation\nvia support vector machine algorithm\
    \ with accuracy, 32.29% and 69.79% and 83.5% and\n88.56%, respectively. Moreover,\
    \ the thermal analysis results agreed with the ﬁndings of\nJones [67], who identiﬁed\
    \ that water content or transpiration has an inverse relationship\nwith leaf temperature.\
    \ The CWC values were highly inﬂuenced owing to the loss of water\nthrough transpiration;\
    \ CWSI and NRCT reﬂected normalized temperature values for the\ncrop. These results\
    \ are in agreement with Blum et al. [68], who indicated that the CWC\ndecreases\
    \ with increasing canopy temperature as a result of increased water stress.\n\
    The current work has allowed a more accurate determination of the water conditions\n\
    in rice, using the best-combined features extracted from RGB and thermal images.\
    \ The pro-\nposed approaches use all of the sensitive features to changes in the\
    \ CWC that greatly\nincrease the model performance. Our outcomes achieved greater\
    \ accuracy than those of\nAlchanatis et al. [69], who demonstrated that fusion\
    \ of thermal and visible imaging can\nprovide precise data on the crop water status\
    \ of grapevines, and the CWSI was highly\ncorrelated with measured stomatal conductance\
    \ with an R2 value of 0.97. The developed\nmodel outperformed Leinonen and Jones\
    \ [70], who stated that the combination of thermal\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n\
    20 of 23\nand visible imagery was a more accurate tool for estimating canopy temperature\
    \ and\ncould be used to identify water deﬁcit stress in a plant. They investigated\
    \ the relation-\nship between the measured stomatal conductance and the calculated\
    \ CWSI with an R2 of\n0.867. Likewise, the ﬁrst-order model of the BPNN-VI-GLCM-T-21\
    \ was very precise in\ncontrast to that of Sun et al. [71], who referred to a\
    \ reasonable model for computing CWC\nin wheat based on the ratio vegetation index\
    \ (RVI: 1605 and 1712 nm) and the normalized\ndifference vegetation index (NDVI:\
    \ 1712 and 1605 nm), having the highest R2 and lowest\nRMSE in model calibration\
    \ and validation (R2c = 0.74 and 0.73; RMSEC = 0.026 and 0.027;\nR2v = 0.72 and\
    \ 0.71; RMSEV = 0.028 and 0.029). Furthermore, the proposed model is better\n\
    than Ge et al. [72], who concluded that leaf water content in maize at a pot-scale\
    \ is success-\nfully predicted with the hyperspectral images using the PLSR model\
    \ for two genotypes\nin model cross-validation (R2 = 0.81 and 0.92; RMSE = 3.7\
    \ and 2.3; MAPE = 3.6 and 2.2).\nThe created model achieved high performance compared\
    \ to Pandey et al. [73], who reported\nthat PLSR analysis can be performed to\
    \ predict the leaf water content of pot-grown maize\nand soybean plants with the\
    \ highest accuracy (R2 = 0.93, RMSE = 1.62, and MAPE = 1.6%)\nfor validation.\
    \ In addition, this research is in agreement with the following study in that\n\
    the combination of color–GLCM–thermal features are high-quality variants in regression\n\
    or classiﬁcation applications. Bhole et al. [74] used different features such\
    \ as the color (CM:\ncolor moments and CCV: color coherence vector), texture (GLCMF),\
    \ and thermal (T) with a\nrandom forest for classiﬁcation of eleven categories\
    \ of fruits. The results showed that the\nmodel accuracies for integrating GLCM-T,\
    \ CM-T, CCV-T, and CM-CCV-GLCM-T features\nwere 84.26%, 91.17%, 92.95%, and 93.4%,\
    \ respectively.\nFinally, remote and proximal sensing images acquired with high-resolution\
    \ cameras,\nmounted at ground level or on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), have\
    \ spatial resolutions\nof a few centimeters. These images can provide sufﬁcient\
    \ accurate information for both\nassessing plant water status in the ﬁeld and\
    \ implementing appropriate irrigation man-\nagement strategies [75]. Thus, this\
    \ work can assist in improving inexpensive, effective\nhigh-throughput phenotyping\
    \ platforms for large numbers of breeding plants at different\nlevels of irrigation.\
    \ A practical sharing of research may improve site-speciﬁc rice irrigation\nmanagement\
    \ through designing an intelligent irrigation system based on the best-proposed\n\
    model. The methodology of this study that relied on ground-based cameras can be\
    \ scaled\nup to UAV-based applications to increase productivity [76] and monitor\
    \ the water condition\nof crops in large-scale areas.\n5. Conclusions\nEstimation\
    \ of canopy water content (CWC) is highly important in precision plant\nreproduction\
    \ and agricultural development. Low-cost outdoor cameras, such as visible\nand\
    \ thermal imaging systems, would be an applicable implement for predicting water\n\
    content in the plant. Therefore, the present study explored the ability to incorporate\
    \ top-\nlevel features retrieved from visible and thermal imaging with a back-propagation\
    \ neural\nnetwork (BPNN) to adopt a three-stage model of CWC for rice. Hand-crafted\
    \ features,\nincluding 20 vegetation indices (VI), 6 GLCM texture features (GLCMF),\
    \ and 2 thermal\nindicators (T), were identiﬁed for analysis. The experimental\
    \ results showed that the\nproposed model of BPNN-VI-GLCMF-T provided effective\
    \ recognition of CWC in the\nrice crop. Expectation accuracy increased to 99.4%\
    \ by conjoining 21 superlative features.\nAt hidden neuron layers (8,9), the R2\
    \ raised to 0.983 with an RMSE of 0.599. The models\nwith separate features performed\
    \ lower than the best built-in features. Their corresponding\nvalues with prediction\
    \ R2 were 0.632 (RMSE = 2.788), 0.679 (RMSE = 2.607), and 0.803\n(RMSE = 2.043)\
    \ using 14VI, 5GLCM, and 2T, respectively. Ultimately, the superlative model\n\
    has a high level of conﬁdence and reliable outcomes. In the future, this tool\
    \ may open an\navenue for rapid, high-throughput assessments of the water condition\
    \ of plants, as well as\nbeing equally important for procedures related to agricultural\
    \ water management.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 1785\n21 of 23\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ Introduction\nPrecision agriculture (PA) is becoming highly signiﬁcant in today’s\
    \ technologically\nadvanced world and has been considered as the farm for the\
    \ future [1]. This is a modern\nfarming management concept using digital techniques\
    \ to monitor and optimize agricul-\ntural production processes by using technological\
    \ advancements [2]. PA uses modern\ntechnology and principles to manage the spatial\
    \ and temporal variability in all aspects\nof agricultural production for the\
    \ goal of improving crop performance [3,4]. Spatial and\ntemporal variability\
    \ are terms used to describe variability that have signiﬁcant impacts\non agricultural\
    \ production. Examples of spatial and temporal variability include yield\nvariability\
    \ [5], ﬁeld variability [6], soil variability [7], crop variability [8], and management\n\
    variability [9]. The goal is to reduce economical costs, decrease the impact on\
    \ the envi-\nronment (e.g., by using less water and fertilizers), and increase\
    \ food production quality\nat the same time [10]. Typically, unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), sensor technologies,\nsatellite navigation and positioning technologies,\
    \ and the internet of things (IoT) are used\nto achieve these goals. PA is increasingly\
    \ aiding farmers with their job as it makes its way\ninto ﬁelds across Europe\
    \ [11]. Larger yields need greater ﬁnancial investment because a\nlarge amount\
    \ of fertilizers, pesticides, water, and other resources is required. However,\n\
    by their proper management, growers can achieve considerable saving on the expected\n\
    expenses [12–14]. Further, in addition to increasing the yield by proper monitoring,\
    \ the\nplants’ health and productivity can also increase at the same time, which\
    \ will allow growers\nto meet the demand. Figure 1 depicts the last ten years\
    \ of documents released by scien-\ntists, researchers, and growers, demonstrating\
    \ that the practice of PA is expanding day by\nday. PA has evolved on digital-based\
    \ farming management approach that monitors and\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604.\

    \ published in precision agriculture in the last 10 years (* prior to 15 November\n\
    2021).\nPrecision viticulture (PV) is a subset of PA, where the same technologies\
    \ are applied\nonly on grapevine care and development. In viticulture, the cultivation\
    \ and study of grapes\nare of concern, and it refers to a set of activities in\
    \ the vineyard [24]. Typically, viticultur-\nists are mainly interested in monitoring\
    \ and managing the vineyard [25], fertilizing, and\nwatering [26], canopy management\
    \ [27], monitoring fruit growth and characteristics [28],\nchoosing when to harvest\
    \ [29], and trimming during the speciﬁc months [30]. Viticulturists\nand winemakers\
    \ are commonly linked because vineyard management and grape char-\nacteristics\
    \ provide the basis for wine-making [31]. A vast range of varietals is presently\n\
    cultivated in the European Union as actual grapes for wine growing and viticulture\
    \ [32].\nViticulture is one of the major factors which plays an important role\
    \ in the economic\ndevelopments of majorly the European countries [33]. PV also\
    \ involves the practice of\ngrape farmers and winemakers employing a range of\
    \ information technologies to better\nsense and comprehend variability in their\
    \ production systems. Then, this information is\nused to better match production\
    \ inputs to desired or expected outputs [34]. Crop sensors\nand yield monitors,\
    \ remote sensors, geographic information system (GIS), and global\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 1604\n3 of 30\nnavigation satellite systems (GNSS) are some of the\
    \ components of the PV’s technological\nadvancements. Therefore, they are a rising\
    \ trend in the wine industry [35]. Furthermore, PV\nis growing substantially because\
    \ of the improved and cost-effective sensors, methodologies,\nand equipment for\
    \ data acquisition from drones [36].\nThis bibliometric study presents the analysis\
    \ on the usage of UAVs in PA and more\nspeciﬁcally in PV, and presents the analyzed\
    \ results. Readers can ﬁnd other bibliometric\nreviews dedicated to PA and PV,\
    \ such as research evolution on PA [37], advances in\nprecision coffee growing\
    \ research [38], wireless sensor networks in agriculture [39], IoT\nin PA [40],\
    \ digital agriculture [41,42], an investigation of PV production, impact, and\n\
    interdisciplinary collaboration involved in viticulture [43], a bibliometric analysis\
    \ of PV in\nItaly [44], Mexican academicians’ contribution to viticulture [45],\
    \ to gain further information\non PA and PV. Although numerous reviews have been\
    \ published, to our knowledge, no\nbibliometric study has explored on the use\
    \ of UAVs in PV. The current article ﬁlls this gap\nin the literature by identifying\
    \ the important concerns and potential associated with the use\nof UAVs in PV.\
    \ The remaining sections of this manuscript are as follows: Section 2 discusses\n\
    the materials and methods used for the bibliometric analysis, Section 3 discusses\
    \ brieﬂy\nwhy the UAV is needed in PA, Section 4 discusses why the UAV is needed\
    \ in PV, Section 5\npresents the analyzed results, and Section 6 summarizes the\
    \ ﬁndings and future scope.\n2. Materials and Methods\nThe usage of UAVs in PA\
    \ (UAV-PA) and usage of UAVs in PV (UAV-PV) are undeniably\ntransforming traditional\
    \ agricultural operations. The number of contributions is constantly\nrising throughout\
    \ the years. In 2020 alone, the number of publications using the terms\nUAV-PA\
    \ and UAV-PV reached 224 and 40, respectively. It is difﬁcult to maintain track\
    \ of\nkey developments in the area at such a rapid rate of publishing. By statistically\
    \ evaluating\npublished data, bibliometric analytic tools can assist speed up\
    \ the review process in this\ncontext [41]. Authors working in the use of UAVs\
    \ in PA research ﬁeld use a variety of\nterminologies to refer to the same ideas.\
    \ In such a fragmented subject, bibliometric analysis\nbecomes very important.\
    \ So, to ﬁnd the most important publications, the most inﬂuential\nsources, institutions,\
    \ and nations, we have used bibliometrics tools.\n2.1. Materials\nIn this bibliometric\
    \ review, the articles from the Scopus database have been considered.\nScopus\
    \ is an online database that contains nearly all signiﬁcant research publications\
    \ and\nhas built-in analytical capabilities for generating representative data.\
    \ Additionally, the\nsearch results from Scopus can be exported to other software,\
    \ for additional post process-\ning. For instance, the targeted study used VOSviewer\
    \ [46] that provides algorithms for\nbibliometrics-based analysis of publishing\
    \ datasets. Co-citation, network analysis, collab-\noration, coupling, and co-word\
    \ information fetching are also possible. A publication is\nindeed the dataset’s\
    \ base element. Authors, document type, document title, keywords, cited\nreferences,\
    \ source, year, author address, times cited, and others are connected with each\n\
    publication. The targeted study also used the science mapping analysis software\
    \ tool (Sci-\nMAT). SciMAT has been chosen because it facilitates all stages of\
    \ scientiﬁc mapping, from\ndata preparation to the development of ﬁeld maps [42,47],\
    \ and also has a comprehensive\npreparation module that veriﬁes the quality of\
    \ the data [42].\nThe quality and thoroughness of the outcomes in this work may\
    \ still be hampered by\nconstraints in the analysis tools and data ﬁltering procedure.\
    \ To begin with, the retrieved\ndata could have left out certain publications.\
    \ Some publications that did not contain the\nsought keywords in the title, abstract,\
    \ author keywords may have been excluded from the\nrecords because we used a search\
    \ strategy presented in Table 1. Some publications may be\nincorrectly eliminated\
    \ as a result of manual selection. Finally, we want to express our grati-\ntude\
    \ to the VOSviewer tool and SciMAT for offering the data visualization functionalities\n\
    utilized in this study.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604\n4 of 30\n2.2. Methods\n\
    Research towards the application of UAV-PA and UAV-PV is trending, and further\n\
    knowledge should be obtained to progress in these ﬁelds, which is why bibliometric\n\
    analysis is vital. As a result, this review is conducted at the appropriate moment\
    \ to give\na comprehensive knowledge of the utilization of UAV-PA and UAV-PV,\
    \ as well as future\nresearch possibilities.\n2.2.1. Design of the Study\nWe deﬁned\
    \ and explored the following questions in order to correctly gain signiﬁcant\n\
    knowledge and conduct a bibliometric study on UAV-PA and UAV-PV:\n1.\nWhy are\
    \ UAVs required in PA? Section 3 of this review study explored the solution to\n\
    this question. The purpose of this research question is to examine the developments\n\
    in the use of UAV-PV.\n2.\nWhat technologies are employed in UAV-PA and UAV-PV?\
    \ The answer to this question is\nexplored in further detail in Sections 4 and\
    \ 5 of this review study.\n3.\nWhat nations are pioneering research on the use\
    \ of UAV-PA and UAV-PV? Sections 4.1 and 5.1\nshow the solution with their respective\
    \ publications.\n4.\nWhich journals are chosen by researchers for publication,\
    \ which funding agencies are accessible,\nwhich prominent researchers are active\
    \ in the ﬁeld, and which universities/institutions are\nactive in the ﬁeld of\
    \ UAV-PA and UAV-PV? The answers to these concerns can be found\nin subsections\
    \ of Sections 4 and 5, respectively. Section 6 contains information about\nmajor\
    \ universities/institutions active in the area of UAV-PA and UAV-PV. In addition,\n\
    the future scope towards the PV’s technological development is also reported in\n\
    this section.\n2.2.2. Data Collection\nTo address the questions of Section 2.2.1,\
    \ we examined the publications between 1\nJanuary 2006 and 15 November 2021. The\
    \ most widely utilized publishing databases are\nWeb of Science (WoS) and Scopus\
    \ and there were no other options available in the past [48]\nabout what databases\
    \ to choose for the bibliometric analysis. However, WoS and Scopus\ncontinue to\
    \ have the highest data quality and completeness across several categories [49],\n\
    and as a result, they are the most commonly employed for bibliometric analysis.\
    \ Scopus\ndemonstrated that it has a wider coverage than WoS, which justiﬁes our\
    \ choice to use only\nthe ﬁrst.\nThe data are accessed on 15 November 2021 with\
    \ keywords reported in Table 1. The\ntable also reports the type of database used,\
    \ how many documents have been considered,\ntime-span of the data collection,\
    \ the criteria for inclusion and the software used to analyze\nthe results.\n\
    2.2.3. Data Preparation\nThe data fetched have not been used directly because\
    \ of missing values in relevant\nﬁelds. Thus, a manual checking has been carried\
    \ out in order to remove the articles\nwith incomplete information. Then, the\
    \ ﬁltered data have been uploaded to SciMAT and\nVOSviewer for generating results.\n\
    The strategic diagram, thematic network structure and thematic evolution structure\n\
    for the most signiﬁcant themes have been generated via SciMAT. The evolutionary\
    \ map\nwas constructed using the equivalence index, with solid lines indicating\
    \ that clusters have\na common theme (Figure 2). In comparison, dashed lines indicate\
    \ a connection between\nnon-major terminologies, whereas in some cases, the absence\
    \ of lines indicates that the\ntopic gradually ceased to exist from one period\
    \ to the other [42].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604\n5 of 30\nFigure 2. Thematic\
    \ evolution structure. This demonstrates that the evaluation and association of\n\
    keywords increased from 5 to 17 between 2006 and 2021.\nIn total, 1084 documents\
    \ were exported from Scopus related to use of UAV-PA with\nduplicates being deleted\
    \ from the list. The phrases that indicated the same thing were then\ngrouped\
    \ together, and the data were preprocessed before being entered into software\
    \ to\ncreate a strategic picture of the topic of research. To achieve the evolutionary\
    \ map, data\nwere divided into three sub-periods (2006–2013, 2014–2018, and 2019–2021).\
    \ Using SciMAT,\nit is not possible to create super-periods automatically; thus,\
    \ it required a manual entry for\nthe sub-periods. It can be seen that, in the\
    \ third sub-period (2019–2021), a large number of\narticles were published, providing\
    \ a good indication of what the study ﬁeld would look\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14,\
    \ 1604\n6 of 30\nlike in the future (as pictorially shown in Figure 1). To determine\
    \ which topics were most\nessential and which clusters they were in, we used the\
    \ keyword co-occurrence matrix. Data\nwere normalized and clustered into groups\
    \ based on the simple centers algorithm using\nthe equivalence index (EI) to create\
    \ a network of links between the themes. We compress\nthe data to a frequency\
    \ resolution of 2 to create the diagrams. We established a maximum\nand minimum\
    \ network size of 14 and 3, respectively, when we examined the ﬁeld of study.\n\
    In the strategic diagram, the horizontal axis (centrality) depicts the importance\
    \ of each\nsubject and the number of links it has with other themes, while the\
    \ vertical axis (density)\ndepicts the number of connections between each cluster.\
    \ This graph depicts the relationship\nbetween two or more topics throughout time,\

    \ the strategies for data analysis is divided into the follow-\ning categories:\n\
    •\nWorldwide published documents based on year-wise and country-wise on adopting\
    \ UAV-PA\nand UAV-PV: Under this analysis, we analyzed the documents published\
    \ during the\nconsidered time-span that are fetched from the database, and arranged\
    \ them according\nto the year of publication and presented in graphical form.\
    \ We applied the same\nmethods for country-speciﬁc publications.\n•\nInﬂuenced\
    \ authors world wide on adopting UAV-PA and UAV-PV: The world recognizes\nexcellent\
    \ research, and hence, we chose three different categories to identify leading\n\
    authors on adopting UAV-PA and UAV-PV. These are: (i) on the basis of author’s\n\
    citation count, (ii) on the basis of most cited documents, and (iii) on the basis\
    \ of the\nnumber of documents produced by an author, and accordingly, we presented\
    \ the\nresults in this manuscript.\n•\nMost preferred journals and popular funding\
    \ sponsors: To choose most preferred journals, it\nis obvious to go for the number\
    \ of articles published in the speciﬁc journals on adopting\nUAV-PA and UAV-PV,\
    \ and the same we applied to the popular funding sponsors.\n•\nLeading institutions\
    \ based on the citation counts on adopting UAV-PA and UAV-PV: To\nidentify leading\
    \ institutions, we again focused on the citation count of the articles\npublished\
    \ by an institute on adopting UAV-PA and UAV-PV.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604\n\
    7 of 30\n2.2.5. Evaluation of the Terminologies towards the Use of UAV-PA\nThe\
    \ evaluation of PA terminologies since 2006 is shown in Figure 2 based on their\n\
    h-index. These terms can be found by looking at the strategic diagram (Figure\
    \ 3) with the\nhelp of SciMAT, a software that proved to be the most efﬁcient\
    \ in determining the trending\nkeywords (themes). A few of the most frequently\
    \ used terms (h-index more than 10) and\nrelevant to this bibliometric study have\
    \ been extracted from the strategic diagram, and their\nthematic network structures\
    \ are shown in Figure 4, and also, they are brieﬂy introduced\nbelow.\nFigure\
    \ 3. Strategic diagram shows keywords of (a) 2006–2013, (b) 2013–2018 and (c)\
    \ 2018–2021. The\nhorizontal axis (centrality) depicts the importance of each\
    \ subject and the number of links it has\nwith other themes, while the vertical\
    \ axis (density) depicts the number of connections between each\ncluster.\n1.\n\
    Vegetation Index (VI): VI is a common term for a class of indices that are used\
    \ in\nagriculture to derive a plant’s status via the observation of their reﬂected\
    \ spectrum in\nmultiple bands [50]. Plants take in these lights and reﬂect near\
    \ infrared (NIR), which a\nhuman eye cannot see. Stressed or dead leaves will\
    \ show more red light than healthy\nleaves. Another term associated with VI is\
    \ the Normalized Difference VI (NDVI),\nwhere the health status is derived by\
    \ considering a plant’s reﬂected spectrum in the\nnear-infrared and that in the\
    \ visible range (red wavelengths). It is good to use the\nNDVI index to ﬁgure\
    \ out how healthy the plants are and how much biomass they\nhave. When the ﬁeld\
    \ is covered in healthy leaves, the NDVI index goes up. If an\narea is there with\
    \ a lot of vegetation, then NDVI may not be able to see very small\nchanges in\
    \ the plants. Other approaches based on spectral indices are available and\nare\
    \ quite commonly employed, for more details on indices, one may consult [51].\n\
    In addition to monitoring plant health, VI is very important in determining canopy\n\
    height, chlorophyll content, when to start fertilizer, and when to start irrigation.\n\
    2.\nUAVs: UAVs are now becoming more popular when it comes to monitoring, not\n\
    only when applied to agriculture but also the other important aspects, such as\
    \ power-\nline inspection, pipeline monitoring, building and structure monitoring\
    \ etc. UAVs\ncan ﬂy autonomously over the area and take images of the various\
    \ regions. The\ninformation regarding where the vulnerabilities are present in\
    \ the ﬁeld is extracted\nfrom these snapshots using standard tools. A decision\
    \ support system uses this\ninformation to determine how much fertilizer, water,\
    \ or other resources are essential\nand in what quantities. UAVs are becoming\
    \ increasingly popular for monitoring,\nnot just in agriculture, but also in other\
    \ critical areas, such as power-line inspection,\npipeline monitoring, construction\
    \ and structural monitoring, and so on.\n3.\nUnmanned Aerial Systems (UAS): The\
    \ term UAS refers to the ensemble drones,\nground control systems, the cameras,\
    \ GNSS, the software, maintenance tools that are\nrequired to operate and enable\
    \ UAVs to ﬂy autonomously or remotely. UAS gives\nfreedom to the growers to make\
    \ the decision online and, as an example of UAS system,\nthe article [52] can\
    \ be followed to see how the UAV and the associated sensory devices\nwork in decision\
    \ making.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604\n8 of 30\nIt is critical to note that the\
    \ term remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) systems has been\nused multiple times to\
    \ refer to UAS systems. A review of RPA applications in PA\nis provided in [53],\
    \ where the authors use the term RPA to refer to UAVs or drones.\nAdditionally,\
    \ the review article [54] discussed drones and RPAs as well as those with\nthe\
    \ same name as RPAs that have been used in agriculture. In [55], a technique\n\
    for developing and constructing a prototype of a low-cost quadcopter-type RPA\
    \ for\nprecision agriculture applications is described.\n4.\nSensors: Sensors\
    \ are becoming less expensive and more advanced as technology\nadvances. The sensors\
    \ are the backbone of the PA, providing vital information about\nvariability in\
    \ farm areas. Sensors are also utilized to determine the viability of a given\n\
    crop being grown on farm area. Wireless sensors have been widely used to collect\
    \ data\nfrom farm ﬁelds and interact with UASs for further processing and decision\
    \ making.\nIt is a good to follow [56] for additional information on sensors and\
    \ sensory devices.\n5.\nDetection Methods: There are various kinds of detection\
    \ methods from the farm\navailable in the literature that talk about, for example,\
    \ disease detection [57], crop\nrow detection [58], fruit detection [59], tree\
    \ detection [60], weed detection [61], etc.,\nusing UAV. These detection methods\
    \ further help in the decision making process in\nthe farm.\n6.\nSoils: The ﬁrst\
    \ and utmost importance is given to soil management for PA [7]. Soil\nmanagement\
    \ is a way of bifurcating the ﬁeld into different categories depending on\nsoil\
    \ content. The soil samples can be collected from different points/locations from\n\
    the ﬁeld. The soil quality can be measured in the laboratories using the collected\n\
    samples and, depending on the categorization, it can be implemented [62]. The\
    \ color\nvariations in the images of the soil acquired by drones after plowing\
    \ the ﬁelds play\nan important role in segregating the ﬁelds [7]. However, soil\
    \ management is usually\nvery expensive and time-consuming since, in order to\
    \ be effective, it has to be run\ncontinuously. Similar outcomes but with very\
    \ less effort can be obtained using UAVs\nequipped with RGB cameras: through the\
    \ acquisition of several RGB images from\nthe ﬁeld, it is possible to infer whether\
    \ the soil is sunny-wet, sunny-dry, shadow-wet,\nshadow-dry and also other decisions\
    \ via an off-line image processing [63].\n7.\nNeural Networks (NNs): PA practices\
    \ rely on accurate mapping of farmlands. A\nneural network is a system for managing\
    \ and mapping UAV remote sensing for the\nbest outcomes. When applied to UAVs\
    \ for PA, NNs proved to be the best in remote\nsensing in several situations.\
    \ A multispectral camera along with the NNs has shown\nthat a semantic segmentation\
    \ of citrus orchards is highly achievable with deep neural\nnetworks [64]. Based\
    \ on an NN technique, a methodology given in [65] proposes an\nautomatic strategy\
    \ for the large-scale mapping of date palm trees from very-high-\nspatial-resolution\
    \ UAV images. NNs also played an important role in spraying UAVs.\nFor example,\
    \ Khan et al. in [66] proposed an accurate real-time recognition method\nbased\
    \ on NNs which is critical for UAV-based sprayers.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604\n\

    \ UAV in PA?\nIt is convincing that as the world’s population grows, there is\
    \ a need to enhance\nwhat is done on the farm, and UAVs are a reasonable extension\
    \ of improving productivity\nand quality of the crops that will be cultivated\
    \ [67]. The UAVs should hover over the\nﬁeld and detect areas that have a signiﬁcant\
    \ infestation that cannot be seen from a distant\nlocation, allowing a range of\
    \ pesticides to be applied exclusively to smaller regions where\nthe infections\
    \ are present [68]. The objective of these efforts is to achieve productivity\n\
    gains of 70% by 2050 to satisfy the growing requirements of the Earth’s population\
    \ while\ndecreasing the area under agriculture [69]. UAVs fall under the category\
    \ of aerial robotics,\nwhich is the deployment of devices to perform beneﬁcial\
    \ tasks, including agriculture which\nis the focus of this review study. The designed\
    \ UAV system should have the required\npayload capacity [70] and can ﬂy to survey\
    \ the area being monitored [71]. In addition (but\nnot limited to), the system\
    \ may include near-infrared, visible cameras aboard, the potential\nto use thermal\
    \ cameras [72], and multispectral and hyperspectral cameras.\nTechnologies of\
    \ UAV in PA\nUAVs have recently been employed in agriculture for large-scale inspections\
    \ as well\nas irrigation [73] and fertilization [74]. A drone’s payload is made\
    \ up of all the sensors and\nactuators attached to it, i.e., (i) multispectral\
    \ and hyperspectral cameras, (ii) infrared cam-\neras and RGB cameras, (iii) light\
    \ detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems [75], and global\nnavigation satellite\
    \ system (GNSS). More research into the integration of multi-sensors on\na UAV\
    \ platform, such as RGB cameras, LiDAR, thermal cameras, and multi/hyperspectral\n\
    cameras, is needed to improve PA estimate accuracy [76]. The necessity for a thermal\n\
    camera aboard a UAV can be reduced by using the technique outlined in [77]. Due\
    \ to\nthe restricted area available for picture collection, UAV photos seldom\
    \ catch well-watered\nplants or arid areas. The thermal camera is not required\
    \ in the approach such as the one\ndescribed in [77], which focuses on certain\
    \ mapping using just multispectral pictures, might\nconsiderably decrease operating\
    \ and investment expenses. A good quality image can be\nachieved utilizing the\
    \ suggested methods and control approaches of [78]. This research\nalso shows\
    \ that the suggested methods can handle various image datasets, such as those\n\
    acquired by frame cameras with variable sensor-to-object distances over some crop\
    \ ﬁelds.\nWhen evapotranspiration is involved, it is sometimes apparent to utilize\
    \ thermal\ncameras. The current conventional technique for aligning thermal imaging\
    \ employs GPS\nlogger data for the initial imagery spot; however, it does not\
    \ account for changes in\nmeteorological conditions during the ﬂight, leading\
    \ to unsatisfactory outcomes. To improve\nthis scenario, three alignment and calibration\
    \ techniques based on RGB image alignment\nwere developed in [79]. According to\
    \ the ﬁndings of [80], the suggested thermal calibration\ntechnique based on temperature-controlled\
    \ standards can provide appropriate precision\nand accuracy for UAV-based canopy\
    \ temperature estimates applied to PA.\n4. Why UAV in PV?\nThe key to success\
    \ for any PV strongly depends on the collection of the maximum\namount of geo-referenced\
    \ information of the whole vineyard and the technologies used\nto monitor. Since\
    \ the late twentieth century, UAVs have advanced quickly. UAV remote\nsensing\
    \ has been swiftly put into reality as agricultural remote sensing has improved.\n\
    Vegetation coverage monitoring, growth tracking, and yield estimates are among\
    \ the most\ncommon types of ﬁeld growth data collected using UAV platforms [81].\
    \ In addition, UAVs\nhave partially solved terrestrial and high-altitude remote\
    \ sensing shortcomings, offering\nsubstantial support for PA crop information\
    \ monitoring technologies [82].\n4.1. Technologies of UAV in PV\nThe initial phase\
    \ in the wine-making process is viticulture. The circumstances of the\nvineyard\
    \ and human decisions in the vineyard determine the quality of wine [83]. The\n\
    human decision for PV is based on the data received from the UAV sensors and attached\n\
    Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604\n11 of 30\ntools [84]. The location of the vineyard\
    \ inﬂuences the ﬂavor of the grapes grown. The\nmajority of PV research is focused\
    \ on vegetation index information [85]. The vegetation\nindex data may be gathered\
    \ using multispectral cameras placed on the UAVs [86]. Changes\nin items that\
    \ affect our environment, such as water quality and plant cover, are measured\n\
    using these cameras. It is now feasible to build maps of vegetation coverage for\
    \ the whole\nregion under examination using these cameras on UAVs. Using remotely\
    \ sensed data, the\nNDVI has been utilized to reveal discrepancies in grapevine\
    \ performance. The NDVI is\ncalculated using the formula\nNDVI = ρnir − ρred\n\
    ρnir + ρred\n,\n(1)\nwhere ρnir and ρred are the reﬂectance levels in the near-infrared\
    \ and in the red spectrum,\nrespectively [87]. In numerous investigations, NDVI\
    \ readings in vineyards have been\nrelated to leaf area index (LAI). The relationship\
    \ between NDVI and vineyard LAI is well\nknown because NDVI is strongly linked\
    \ to the gross quantity of chlorophyll. Increasing\nleaf area leads to a higher\
    \ gross quantity of chlorophyll per unit area of the vineyard. LAI\nis a major\
    \ physiological component for characterizing crop growth models and vegetation\n\
    indices for expressing crop growth status. The NDVI does not have a linear connection\
    \ with\nLAI. Using UAV platforms, many studies on spectral data monitoring growth\
    \ indicators\nsuch as LAI [88,89] have been conducted. Authors in [90] describe\
    \ three models that use\na quad-rotor UAV platform with a digital camera to examine\
    \ the link between LAI and\ncanopy coverage. A UAV ﬁtted with hyperspectral cameras\
    \ was deployed to evaluate\ndifferent cultivars to illustrate the feasibility\
    \ of LAI monitoring in the context of PA [91].\nVarious methods of calculating\
    \ vegetation indices have been used throughout history;\nhowever, the most often\
    \ researched vegetation indices are given in [92].\nMultispectral cameras collect\
    \ data from the electromagnetic spectrum across different\nbands, or frequency\
    \ intervals [93]. In particular, they are used for the NIR spectrum,\nspeciﬁcally\
    \ in the range 800–850 nm, since this band is important for determining the health\n\
    of plants [94]. In the NIR spectrum, plants emit up to 60% of their total electromagnetic\n\
    radiated energy [95]. For measuring vegetation on the ground, differences in reﬂected\n\
    light in the NIR part of the spectrum are critical. Multispectral remote sensing\
    \ datasets\nare used to detect light energy reﬂected from objects on the earth’s\
    \ surface and estimate\nvarious physical and chemical characteristics of things\
    \ that are not visible to the naked\neye. Following that, the measurements provide\
    \ us with information about what is on the\nground. For example, vegetation is\
    \ typically indicated by pixels with a spectrum containing\nmuch NIR light energy.\n\
    The growers starts with the grape variety, and once that is achieved, understanding\n\
    the soil for them becomes important. Figure 5 shows a block diagram of the decision\n\
    making process for the categorization of the soil (mainly the ﬁeld of plots on\
    \ which the\ngrapevine is cultivated). The acquisition of aerial photographs takes\
    \ place in the ﬁrst block.\nThe photographs are used in the second block to create\
    \ a mosaicked image of the site under\nconsideration [96]. This mosaicked image\
    \ is also used to analyze the relationship between\nvarious surface soil properties,\
    \ such as organic matter, moisture, clay, silt, sand, and other\nsoil content,\
    \ and then, the soil is categorized accordingly. When the vegetation indices value\n\
    were utilized as input data in trained techniques, the best performance in the\
    \ categorization\nof vineyard soil RGB pictures was obtained, with overall accuracy\
    \ values around 0.98 and\nhigh sensitivity values for the soil [97]. To monitor\
    \ farmland soil parameters and crop\ngrowth, the UAV’s remote sensing have been\
    \ equipped with high-resolution hyperspectral\nsensors [98].\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 1604\n12 of 30\nImage from UAV\nImage Processing Unit\nSoil Analysis\nSoil\
    \ Categorization\nFigure 5. Decision on soil categorization.\nThe use of UAVs\
    \ equipped with RGB cameras has some limitations; indeed, during\nthe ﬁrst tillage\
    \ process when the ﬁelds are usually covered in vegetation and/or crop\nleftovers,\
    \ soil images cannot be shot. In addition, sometimes it is challenging to take\n\
    photographs in uneven terrain that affects the grape production. Elevation, latitude,\
    \ slope,\nand aspect are among the geographical elements that inﬂuence grape production\
    \ [99]. For\ninstance, in many of the world’s best wine areas, nearby water and\
    \ mountains have a strong\nimpact [100] as also temperature, sunshine, and wind\
    \ [36]. Degree days are used to quantify\nthe amount of heat that accumulates\
    \ over the course of the growing season [101]. The\namount of heat necessary for\
    \ grapes to reach maturity varies depending on the grape type.\nPhotosynthesis\
    \ and taste development require sunlight [102]. However, too much\nexposure to\
    \ sunlight might result in sunburn and shriveling of grapes. So, when planning\n\
    a vineyard, row orientation and sunshine are critical considerations. It is required\
    \ to make\nsure the afternoon sun is shining on the non-exposed section of the\
    \ fruit [103]. In [104], a\ntechnique for evaluating heat and radiative stress\
    \ impacts in terms of temperature at the\ncluster and canopy level is suggested.\
    \ A high-resolution thermal monitoring method is\ndescribed, which uses a UAV\
    \ and a wireless sensor network (WSN) to integrate remote\nand proximal sensing.\n\
    Irrigation is required frequently in the summer due to dry weather or a lack of\
    \ water-\nholding capacity while, on the other hand, it is a common practice to\
    \ give a vine as little\nwater as possible once it has reached full maturity [105].\
    \ In this regards, the amount of\nwater stress is crucial in order to decide when\
    \ the irrigation should start, as well as its\nduration. Furthermore, in this\
    \ case, UAV-endowed image acquisition equipment can be\nfruitfully exploited for\
    \ the inspection of the targeted area, as sketched in Figure 6. For\nexample,\
    \ in [106], a model utilizing UAVs is developed to evaluate on a plant-by-plant\n\
    basis stress sectors within the vineyard for optimal irrigation management and\
    \ to detect\ngeographic variability within the vineyards.\nThe quantity of water\
    \ accessible to the vine and the nutrients it requires are determined\nby the\
    \ soil type [107]. The macronutrients that we require are mostly nitrogen, phospho-\n\
    rus, and potassium [108]. From vineyard architecture to clonal and rootstock selection,\n\
    viticultural decisions are made to suit the speciﬁc characteristics of each location\
    \ [109].\nFor example, because grapevines are sensitive to phylloxera, a soil\
    \ parasite, the resistant\nrootstock is frequently utilized to protect the vine\
    \ [110].\nGrowers must consider vine density, row spacing, and direction while\
    \ creating a\nnew vineyard so that distant sensing would be simple [111]. Canopy\
    \ management is\none of the important measures to take by the growers. It requires\
    \ continuous inspection\nthroughout the year. However, these operations are time-consuming\
    \ and difﬁcult for the\nentire vineyard. The use of photogrammetric methods has\
    \ shown to be effective to this\naim [27]. Increased airﬂow and sunshine in the\
    \ fruiting zone and lower disease pressure\nmay be achieved by canopy management\
    \ [112]. By maintaining the vineyard ﬂoor, farmers\nmay impact soil fertility\
    \ and water availability [113]. Cover crops are mowed to limit\ncompetition or\
    \ used to reduce surplus soil moisture. Plants that affect the growth of the\n\
    vine are removed by tilling nitrogen-rich cover crops into the soil [114]. In\
    \ [30], a novel\napproach for assessing vineyard trimming is suggested, wherein\
    \ UAV technology is used\nto produce photogrammetric point clouds, which are then\
    \ analyzed using object-based\nimage analysis algorithms.\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 1604\n13 of 30\nFigure 6. A schematic of inspection from the drone.\nThe\
    \ biggest obstacle for viticulturists is the weather, also because they have no\
    \ control\non it. In a particular year, hail, spring frost, drought, extreme heat,\
    \ and rain can lower\nyields or degrade fruit quality. Pests and diseases also\
    \ pose a danger to the vineyard’s\nlong-term viability. Powdery mildew is the\
    \ most prevalent illness in most cases. In [115],\nthe authors propose a spatial-spectral\
    \ segmentation technique for analyzing hyperspectral\nimaging data obtained from\
    \ UAVs and applying it to predicting powdery mildew infection\nlevels in undamaged\
    \ grape bunches before veraison. Beginning with bud break, farmers\nmust be proactive\
    \ in planning for and responding to this situation. Grapes are ﬁlled with\nsugar\
    \ as they get closer to ripeness, and when the fruit ripens, the sugar will leak\
    \ through\nthe skin, providing a valuable food supply for the naturally existing\
    \ fungus in the vines.\nWhen this happens, it gets a disease called Botrytis bunch\
    \ rot [116]. Grapevine viruses such\nas leafroll, and bacterial infections like\
    \ Pierce’s are spread by insects and require special\ncare [117]. It is required\
    \ to employ integrated pest management to identify the appropriate\ntreatment\
    \ approach. Control measures include anything from cultural techniques to canopy\n\
    management, vineyard ﬂoor operations, and perhaps, pesticides.\nOne of the most\
    \ severe obstacles to present grapevine farming practices is a lack\nof personnel.\
    \ As technology develops and labor prices rise, we may expect increased\nmechanization\
    \ in the vineyard. As a result, growers must now address the problem of\nsustainability\
    \ and consider using an alternate strategy that incorporates UAVs to save time.\n\

    6. Findings and Discussion\nThis bibliometric analysis is intended to provide\
    \ scholars working in this ﬁeld with\nan update on UAV-PA and UAV-PV. This survey\
    \ also recommended the popular journal\nfavored by researchers to publish their\
    \ work, the popular funding agencies accessible,\npopular nations, and popular\
    \ authors based on their citations leading the research in using\nUAVs for PA.\
    \ This survey revealed the use of UAV-PA and UAV-PV plays an essential\nrole in\
    \ increasing crop quality and yield by remote sensing the farm’s health and status.\n\
    This approach greatly reduces labor costs, manpower, and time for growers and\
    \ vineyard\nmanagers. Growers increase their production potential by using this\
    \ approach since it\nkeeps the plants healthier and longer, allowing them to supply\
    \ to the world, which is\nthe primary goal of using UAVs in PA. Viticulture is\
    \ a key economic element in several\nEuropean nations. PV refers to the practice\
    \ of grape growers and winemakers of using\nvarious information technology tools.\
    \ These tools required to better sense and grasp\nvariability in their production\
    \ systems and then using that knowledge to better match\nproduction inputs to\
    \ desired or expected outputs. Crop sensors and yield monitors, remote\nsensors,\
    \ GIS, and GNSS systems rely on PV technical advances, which is a growing trend\n\
    in the wine business. The enhanced and cost-effective sensors, methods, and equipment\
    \ for\ndata gathering from UAVs are driving signiﬁcant growth in PV. In a sense,\
    \ the UAVs are\nproving to be the backbone of PA. Furthermore, there are many\
    \ other options of sensors for\nvineyards available. Especially, the proximal\
    \ sensors that have proved to be one of the key\nelements for the management of\
    \ treatments and interventions within the vineyards. For\nexample, tractors and\
    \ also unmanned ground vehicles have been designed to be able to\nperform site-speciﬁc\
    \ tasks without human intervention, credit to sensors that can keep an\neye on\
    \ the plant’s health on-the-go [130]; an experiment was carried out without human\n\
    intervention during the night using an all-terrain vehicle developed in [131]\
    \ to which\nvarious sensors were attached to obtain an image of the vine in order\
    \ to identify the berries;\nin [132], a technique based on optical sensors is\
    \ proposed for different irrigation treatments\nto vineyards, allowing a non-invasive\
    \ evaluation of plant water stress dynamics in a timely\nmanner; in [133], an\
    \ experiment is conducted on 21 individual branches under various\ncanopy treatments,\
    \ utilizing the proximal sensor to improve the accuracy of vineyard\nyield estimation.\n\
    In the ﬁeld of PV, there have been numerous developments in the use of UAV-PV.\
    \ A\nfew of these are mentioned here, although there are more throughout the paper.\n\
    •\nSoil categorization: When the vegetation indices values were utilized as input\
    \ data in\ntrained techniques, the best performance in the categorization of vineyard\
    \ soil RGB\npictures was obtained, with overall accuracy values around 0.98 and\
    \ high sensitiv-\nity values for the soil [97]. To monitor farmland soil parameters\
    \ and crop growth,\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604\n22 of 30\nthe UAV’s remote sensing\
    \ have been equipped with high-resolution hyperspectral\nsensors [98].\n•\nWeed\
    \ detection and control: In vineyards, bermudagrass is a major issue. The spectral\n\
    closeness of grapevines and bermudagrass makes it tough to distinguish the two\n\
    species using just spectral information from a multi-band image sensor. Using\
    \ ultra-\nhigh spatial resolution UAV pictures and object-based image analysis,\
    \ this problem has\nbeen solved and the accuracy of this approach to distinguishing\
    \ between grapevines\nand bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) is better than 97.7%\
    \ [134]. Additionally, an al-\ngorithm is proposed in [135] for detecting and\
    \ mapping the presence of bermudagrass\nbased on spatial information, as well\
    \ as for accurately mapping the presence of vines,\ncover crops, Cynodon dactylon,\
    \ and bare soil in order to apply site-speciﬁc treatment\nto the vegetation. Furthermore,\
    \ this research claims to be effective in controlling\nbermudagrass in a short\
    \ amount of time. As a result, the combination of UAV imagery\nand the algorithm\
    \ would enable farmers to continue cover crop-based management\nschemes in their\
    \ vineyards while also controlling bermudagrass.\n•\nDisease detection: Disease\
    \ detection is essential in preventing the disease from spreading\nfurther in\
    \ the vineyard. If the disease spreads in vineyards, it has severe economic\n\
    effects for the growers, and detecting the disease in the vineyard is one of the\
    \ most\ndifﬁcult tasks for viticulturists. A deep learning technique was reported\
    \ in [136] to\nidentify areas of infection in the grapevine using the UAV by taking\
    \ images in the\nvisible domain and then processing them with convolution neural\
    \ networks to detect\nthe symptoms. This paper also claims that the technique\
    \ used is more than 95.8%\naccurate in detecting the infection. Flavescence dorée,\
    \ a form of grape vine disease,\nthat can be identiﬁed using UAV multispectral\
    \ data as reported in [57]. This study also\nexamines the potential for 20 variables,\
    \ i.e., 11 related to vegetation indices, 5 depend\non spectral bands, and 4 associated\
    \ with biophysical parameters, to be computed\nfrom UAV multispectral imagery\
    \ in order to remotely identify symptomatic from\nasymptomatic areas in a vineyard.\n\
    •\nMonitoring the vegetation and irrigation control: Due to the direct relation\
    \ between ra-\ndiation interception and evaporative surface, the canopy cover\
    \ maps are used for\nirrigation management primarily in order to calculate the\
    \ basic evapotranspire coefﬁ-\ncient. Crop size and temporal development rely\
    \ on the water supply, and crop canopy\nmaps are accordingly measured to identify\
    \ spatial irrigation system consistency. The\nresults of [137] showed that the\
    \ green-red vegetation index (GRVI) is appropriate for\nassessing vegetation cover.\
    \ When it came to recognizing phenological crop changes\nand detecting variety\
    \ in ﬁeld irrigation, the GRVI outperformed the NDVI. Motohka\net al. [138] suggested\
    \ the usage of GRVI, which may be calculated using the formula\nGRVI = ρgreen\
    \ − ρred\nρgreen + ρred\n,\n(2)\nwhere ρgreen is green reﬂectance, and ρred is\
    \ reﬂectance of visible red. This GRVI is\nused to determine (i) Green vegetation:\
    \ ρgreen is higher than ρred, (ii) Soils: ρgreen is\nlower than ρred, and (iii)\
    \ Water or snow: ρgreen and ρred are almost the same.\n•\nGrapevine maturity:\
    \ It was discovered in [139] that by using spectral information\ngathered from\
    \ a UAV, it is possible to distinguish between vines of various vigor in\na Guyot-trained,\
    \ mature vineyard of ‘Sangiovese’ located in Tuscany. A system for\ndetermining\
    \ the ripeness of grape clusters has been developed by the researchers in\nSpain\
    \ [140]. When a grape begins to become bluish, it is presumed to be ripe, and\n\
    using simple image processing and ﬁltering, it is possible to identify mature\
    \ grape\nclusters in a short amount of time.\n•\nYield estimation: Forecasting\
    \ yields is critical for harvest management and scheduling\nwine-making activities.\
    \ Traditional yield prediction approaches are time-consuming\nand depend on manual\
    \ sampling, making it challenging to account for vineyards’\ninherent geographical\
    \ variability. In [140], an unsupervised and automated method for\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 1604\n23 of 30\ndetecting grape clusters in red grapevine types is\
    \ established using UAV photogram-\nmetric technique and color indices, with R2\
    \ values greater than 0.82. This precision\ngained in grape detection opens the\
    \ door to red grape vineyard production prediction.\nEvery farmer aspires to forecast\
    \ their vineyard’s yield estimation in advance, and\nhence yield prediction is\
    \ an important issue in vineyard management in order to\nachieve the required\
    \ grape production and quality. In [141], an automated system is\nbeing developed\
    \ that can predict yield estimation (5 weeks before harvest) using high-\nresolution\
    \ RGB photos and a UAV platform throughout the vineyard. A technique\nhas also\
    \ been developed in [142] for capturing multispectral imagery through UAV,\nwhich\
    \ is then processed together with artiﬁcial neural networks to create a relationship\n\
    between the vegetation index, vegetated fraction cover, and yield. This technique\n\
    demonstrates that when machine learning is used, the outcomes are signiﬁcantly\n\
    more accurate. Although promising results were obtained earlier in the development\n\
    process, more exact yield forecasts were achieved when images were captured nearer\n\
    to the harvest date.\nDuring the study and utilizing the Scopus database, it was\
    \ discovered that more than\n80 countries are working on UAV adoption in PA as\
    \ of 15 November 2021, with a large\nnumber of articles relevant to the use of\
    \ UAVs for PA having been published internationally.\nThe United States have provided\
    \ the most papers and is the country that has released\nthe most documentation\
    \ on the use of UAVs for PA, followed by China, Italy, Spain, and\nBrazil. The\
    \ top three publications favored by researchers working on UAV adoption for\n\
    PA are (i) Remote Sensing, (ii) Computers and Electronics in Agriculture, and\
    \ (iii) Nongye\nGongcheng Xuebao Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural\
    \ Engineering. There\nare three major funding agencies in this ﬁeld: China’s National\
    \ Science Foundation, the\nEuropean Commission, and China’s Ministry for Science\
    \ and Technology.\nPV is becoming more popular internationally as well. Globally,\
    \ the use of UAV-PV is\ntrending towards Italy, where many researchers and academicians\
    \ are working, followed\nby Spain, and ﬁnally, the United States. Researchers\
    \ preferred journals on using UAV-PV\nare (i) Remote Sensing, (ii) Acta Horticulturae,\
    \ and (iii) Computers and Electronics in\nAgriculture. Two primary ﬁnancing agencies\
    \ for this area are (i) the European Commission\nand (ii) the European Regional\
    \ Development Fund.\nThe major institutions working in this ﬁeld are also worth\
    \ mentioning (based on their\ncitations), which are included in Table 6.\nTable\

    \ Lights on Economic Analysis\nThis section reports some costs that small growers\
    \ can incur in case they want to\nuse/implement UAV-PA technologies, such that\
    \ a rough idea of a possible investment can\nbe inferred. In particular, we brieﬂy\
    \ discuss the economic analysis in [36], where typical\ncosts of service providers\
    \ are given, and we also add further information regarding the\ncosts in case\
    \ an ad hoc custom solution is going to be implemented.\nFarmers using UAVs to\
    \ perform PA are aiming for high-quality images with high\nprecision, as well\
    \ as the ability to take measurements from the ﬁeld at any time they choose.\n\
    Due to high spatial resolution of imagery, high operational ﬂexibility, and low\
    \ operational\ncosts, UAVs have demonstrated that they can compete with traditional\
    \ acquisition plat-\nforms (such as satellites and aircraft). It has been observed\
    \ that for small landholders with\nan area of around 5 ha, UAVs appear to be the\
    \ most cost-effective solution due to their\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 1604\n24 of\
    \ 30\nlow cost in data acquisition and use of advanced sensor technologies [36].\
    \ In [36], three\nbroad categories of cost analysis were considered with 100 images\
    \ of the crop captured\nby UAVs, and this service was purchased from a third party,\
    \ namely data acquisition,\ngeoreferencing and orthorectiﬁcation, and image processing.\
    \ The cost of data acquisition is\ne1500, which includes the cost of organizing\
    \ and carrying out the acquisition campaign\nto obtain the raw images; the cost\
    \ of georeferencing and orthorectiﬁcation is e500; and\nthe cost of image processing\
    \ is e200. Depending on where you live, services from UAV\nproviders can cost\
    \ anywhere from $12 per hectare for raw image ﬁles to $70 per hectare\nfor an\
    \ orthomosaic image in the United States [143]. If one does not wish to use a\
    \ service\nprovider, another viable option is the AgriQ [144], which is a $1400\
    \ UAV that is developed\nfor PA. AgriQ consists of three subsystems: the drone,\
    \ the multispectral imaging system,\nand the open-source software that computes\
    \ useful information for farmers [145]. The\nauthors approached the problem from\
    \ four angles: (1) the drone’s construction; (2) the\nvision algorithms; (3) the\
    \ autonomous trajectory taking into account all parameters in\norder to properly\
    \ recover all of the crops’ visual information; and (4) the development of a\n\
    low-cost multispectral imaging system with multiple bands.\n6.2. Future Possibilities\n\
    Acquiring and analyzing spectral data requires considerable additional cost and\n\
    skill sets that are frequently unavailable; therefore, the identiﬁcation of geometric\
    \ indices\nthat enable the monitoring of spatial variability using low-cost instruments\
    \ based on\nphotogrammetry techniques and high-resolution RGB cameras will be\
    \ critical in future.\nThere is a need for the rapid evolution of a yield forecast\
    \ methodology based on UAV data\nand machine learning techniques in order to avoid\
    \ routine human engagement. Various\ntechniques for irrigation monitoring in a\
    \ vineyard using UAVs have been developed, but\nresearch is still lagging, and\
    \ future research directions could include automated irrigation\nbased on crop\
    \ water needs and monitoring of vines based on their physiology, more\nprecisely,\
    \ control of grapevine irrigation based on plant-based models. It is now necessary\n\
    to develop a web-based one-stop service for UAV adoption in PV (and PA), which\
    \ will\nassist in providing information related to supporting ﬁeld operations\
    \ in the vineyard,\nhealth monitoring of the vines and grapes, canopy management,\
    \ and other key areas, as\nwell as providing online digital content that is accessible\
    \ from any location. Finally, but\ncertainly not least, a UAV system with the\
    \ bare minimal payload required for maximum\nsurveillance of the vineyards should\
    \ be designed so as to make it cost effective and that can\nbe frequently used\
    \ by the growers.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.P.S. and L.G.; methodology,\

    \ remote sensing images to detect \nwater stress in maize. Visible and near infrared\
    \ CASI (Itres Research Ltd., Calgary, AL, \nCanada) and thermal AHS-160 (Sensytech\
    \ Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) data were acquired at \nthree different times during\
    \ the day on a maize field (Zea mays L.) grown with three different \nirrigation\
    \ treatments. An intensive field campaign was also conducted concurrently with\
    \ \nimage acquisition to measure leaf ecophysiological parameters and the leaf\
    \ area index. The \nanalysis of the field data showed that maize plants were experiencing\
    \ moderate to severe \nwater stress in rainfed plots and a weaker stress condition\
    \ in the plots with a water deficit \nimposed between stem elongation and flowering.\
    \ Vegetation indices including the normalized \ndifference vegetation index (NDVI)\
    \ and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) computed \nfrom the CASI images,\
    \ sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F760) and canopy temperature \n(Tc) showed\
    \ different performances in describing the water stress during the day. During\
    \ the \nOPEN ACCESS\nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n627 \n \n \nmorning overpass,\
    \ NDVI was the index with the highest discriminant power due to the \nsensitivity\
    \ of NDVI to maize canopy structure, affected by the water irrigation treatment.\
    \ As \nthe day progressed, processes related to heat dissipation through plant\
    \ transpiration became \nmore and more important and at midday Tc showed the best\
    \ performances. Furthermore,  \nTc retrieved from the midday image was the only\
    \ index able to distinguish all the three \nclasses of water status. Finally,\
    \ during the afternoon, PRI and F760 showed the best \nperformances. These results\
    \ demonstrate the feasibility to detect water stress using thermal \nand optical\
    \ airborne data, pointing out the importance of careful planning of the airborne\
    \ \nsurveys as a function of the specific aims of the study. \nKeywords: diurnal;\
    \ temperature; fluorescence; PRI; water stress; corn \n \n1. Introduction \nThe\
    \ prospects of water scarcity are increasing in many world areas [1] stimulating\
    \ the development \nof techniques enabling an efficient use of water in agriculture.\
    \ The minimization of water losses in \nagriculture is in fact a requisite to\
    \ release water resources to other sectors of society where demand is \nincreasing\
    \ [2]. In Italy, maize (Zea mays, L.) is a crop widely cultivated and with large\
    \ irrigation \nrequirements. The timely assessment of maize water status is important\
    \ for accurate irrigation scheduling \nand to avoid both waste of water and loss\
    \ of crop yield. \nPhotosynthesis is among the primary processes affected by water\
    \ stress as a result of both stomatal \nand non-stomatal (biochemical) limitations\
    \ [3]. Stomata closure is a common mechanism used by plants \nto prevent leaf\
    \ desiccation in response to water stress conditions. It generally occurs due\
    \ to a decline in \nleaf turgor and atmospheric vapor pressure along with root-generated\
    \ chemical signals causing a \nmeasurable reduction of leaf stomatal conductance\
    \ to water vapor [4] and transpiration rate. The decrease \nin evaporative cooling\
    \ causes an increase of vegetation temperature that can be tracked using thermal\
    \ \nimagery [5,6]. The relationship between vegetation temperature and transpiration\
    \ rates is affected by \nwater stress experienced by the plants but also by environmental\
    \ parameters, as the vapor pressure deficit \nof the air (VPD). The crop water\
    \ stress index (CWSI) [7] has been proposed to normalize the difference \nbetween\
    \ canopy temperature and air temperature (ΔT) by the evaporative demand. The CWSI\
    \ can be \ncomputed based on an empirical approach relating ΔT to the VPD of a\
    \ “non-water-stressed baseline” \nreferring to a well-watered crop transpiring\
    \ at the potential rate (for a recent review refer to [8]). \nAdditionally, when\
    \ photosynthesis is inhibited, as it is in water stress conditions, plants absorb\
    \ more \nenergy than can be used for photosynthesis. Plants react to such conditions\
    \ activating protective \nmechanisms to avoid light-induced oxidative damage.\
    \ These mechanisms consist in the dissipation of \nexcess excitation energy as\
    \ chlorophyll fluorescence and/or heat. Since these two occur in competition \n\
    with photosynthesis, variations of the yield of chlorophyll fluorescence and heat\
    \ dissipation have been \nexploited to detect stress-induced variations in photosystem\
    \ II efficiency [9]. Both sun-induced \nchlorophyll fluorescence (F760) and heat\
    \ dissipation can in principle be retrieved using hyperspectral \noptical data.\
    \ The heat dissipation can be detected using the Photochemical Reflectance Index\
    \ (PRI), \noriginally proposed [10] to track changes in the de-epoxidation state\
    \ of the xanthophyll cycle pigments, \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n628 \n\
    \ \n \nrelated to heat dissipation. PRI has been used to track photosynthesis\
    \ changes caused by water stress \nconditions with varying degrees of success\
    \ [11–14]. In particular, PRI has been shown to be able to track \nthe evolution\
    \ of maize water stress from the early phase when only the plant physiology is\
    \ affected [12] \nto the later ones when also plant structure changes [11], showing\
    \ higher potentiality than the traditional \ngreenness indices that hardly detect\
    \ early stress conditions. More recently, the estimation of sun-induced \nchlorophyll\
    \ fluorescence in the far-red region (at 760 nm) has been proven feasible from\
    \ remote sensors, \nand fluorescence has been evaluated as a novel remote measure\
    \ to detect plant physiological changes \ndue to environmental constraints [15,16].\
    \ \nIn this study, we used thermal and optical remote sensing imagery collected\
    \ from an airborne platform \nat three different times during the day (morning,\
    \ midday and afternoon) to detect maize water stress. An \nairborne campaign was\
    \ conducted with the visible and near infrared CASI 1500 (Itres Research Ltd.)\
    \ \nand thermal AHS-160 (Sensytech Inc.) sensors over an experimental maize field\
    \ treated with three \ndifferent irrigation regimes. As far as the authors know,\
    \ a comparison of the performances of different \nwater stress indicators derived\
    \ from both optical and thermal high resolution data during the day has not \n\
    been fully explored yet. A better understanding of the performances of different\
    \ remotely sensed water \nstress indicators is essential for farmers and service\
    \ providers to support agricultural management. \nThe specific objectives were\
    \ to: (i) determine the potential of using airborne optical and thermal image\
    \ \nacquisitions to detect different levels of water deficit in a maize field;\
    \ (ii) assess the performances of \neach radiometric quantity derived from the\
    \ images analyzed separately; (iii) compare different \nvegetation indices, canopy\
    \ temperature and CWSI to identify the best indicator of water stress at \ndifferent\
    \ times of the day and; (iv) the best time of the day for data collection and\
    \ mapping. \n2. Materials and Methods \n2.1. Experimental Area and Field Campaigns\
    \ \nThe study was conducted at the “Vittorio Tadini” experimental farm located\
    \ in Northern Italy at \nlatitude 44°58ʹ49.00ʹʹN, longitude 9°40ʹ48.50ʹʹE, elevation\
    \ 87 m a.s.l. Maize plants were sown on  \nJune 3, 2010 over an area of about\
    \ 1.2 ha. The field campaign was conducted between July 19 and 22, \n2010 (between\
    \ 46 and 49 days after sowing). Plants were in their pre-flowering stem elongation\
    \  \nstage [17] with an average of 10 leaves emerged. This timing was selected\
    \ for the survey because maize \nis more sensitive to water stress between the\
    \ elongation and flowering stage [18]. \nThree water regimes were randomly assigned:\
    \ rainfed, water deficit imposed between stem elongation \nand flowering and full\
    \ irrigation (Irr0, Irr1 and Irr2, respectively). Water regimes were applied according\
    \ \nto a split-plot experimental design with four blocks (Figure 1), being the\
    \ water regime, the whole-plot \ntreatment, crop species (maize and sorghum) and\
    \ the split-plot treatment. Irrigation requirements were \ncalculated from a daily\
    \ soil water balance: Irr2 plots were supplied with the volume of water needed\
    \ to \nbring Available Water Content (AWC) back to field capacity, whenever it\
    \ dropped below 70%; Irr1 \nplots were supplied with the volume of water needed\
    \ to keep AWC between 30% and 60%. Each subplot \nwas then divided into two more\
    \ plots, 15 × 16.5 m each, the first one not fertilized, the second one \nfertilized\
    \ with 100 kg·ha−1 to enhance the variability of the biophysical parameters. The\
    \ results shown \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n629 \n \n \nin the study refer\
    \ only to maize plots and include both nitrogen treatments. Further details about\
    \ the \nstudy site are reported in Panigada et al. [11] and Cilia et al. [19].\
    \ \n \nFigure 1. Experimental field location in Northern Italy and treatment scheme.\
    \ The irrigation \nlevels are shown as small circles in rainfed plots (Irr0),\
    \ medium circles in water deficit plots \n(Irr1) and large circles in full irrigation\
    \ plots (Irr2). Red circles indicate the position of the \ntwo infrared radiometer\
    \ sensors in the maize field. \n2.2. Canopy Temperature \nThermal data were taken\
    \ continuously on two maize plots, a rainfed (Irr0, plot 29) and a fully irrigated\
    \ \n(Irr2, plot 28) plot (Figure 1). The instruments used were two infrared radiometer\
    \ sensors SI-111 \n(Apogee, UT, USA) with a 22° half-angle field of view positioned\
    \ 3 m above the ground with an \ninclination of 45°. These measurements were collected\
    \ every 5 min and stored in a datalogger  \n(model CR10X, Campbell Sci., Logan,\
    \ UT, USA). The single-band infrared temperature sensors covered \nthe range between\
    \ 8 and 15 μm with an accuracy of ±0.2 °C. Air temperature (Ta) and relative humidity\
    \ \n(RH) were measured above the canopy with a portable weather station equipped\
    \ with Vaisala sensors. \nThe difference between crown and air temperature (ΔT)\
    \ was calculated using temperature data measured \nat the same time. ΔT was calculated\
    \ because it provides the gradient for the flow of sensible heat toward \nor away\
    \ from a vegetal surface, regulated by plant evapotranspiration [20]. Positive\
    \ values of ΔT \ncorrespond to flow of sensible heat away from the canopy, indicating\
    \ a reduction of transpiration rates. \n2.3. Field Data \nLeaf measurements were\
    \ collected between 11:00 and 12:30 UTC on July 19 and 20 on maize plots \nto\
    \ track the effects of water stress on crop condition and functioning. Measurements\
    \ were conducted on \nthe youngest fully expanded leaf. \n \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf.\
    \ 2015, 4 \n630 \n \n \nThe efficiency of light reactions of photosynthesis was\
    \ measured on single leaves using the miniaturized \nFluorescence Yield Analyser\
    \ (Mini-PAM) (H. Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) with a leaf clip holder \ndescribed\
    \ in Bilger et al. [21]. Measurements were conducted on 45 plants per treatment\
    \ (15 leaves from \nfifteen different plants in each plot, n = 360). The steady-state\
    \ value of fluorescence (Ft) was measured \nunder incident photosynthetic photon\
    \ flux density (PPFD) conditions and a saturating light pulse  \n(800 ms duration,\
    \ intensity ~4000 µmol·m−2·s−1) was superimposed on the prevailing environmental\
    \ \nlight level to measure the maximum light adapted fluorescence yield (F'm).\
    \ The effective quantum yield \nof photosystem II (ΔF/F'm), reflecting the fraction\
    \ of light utilized in photosystem II photochemistry at \na given light intensity,\
    \ was then calculated as (F'm − Ft)/F'm. \nLeaf CO2 exchanges were measured with\
    \ an open infrared gas exchange system (CIRAS-1, PP-Systems, \nStotfold, UK).\
    \ Measurements were performed at ambient CO2 concentrations and illumination using\
    \ a \nParkinson leaf chamber clamped to single leaves. Instantaneous net assimilation\
    \ (Ai) and stomatal \nconductance to water vapor (Gi) were recorded simultaneously\
    \ on three leaves from different plants from \nsix plots (block 2). \nThe relative\
    \ chlorophyll content (Chl) was measured with a SPAD 502 meter (Minolta, Tokyo,\
    \ Japan) \non 10 leaves from 10 different plants for each plot. The SPAD is a\
    \ non-destructive, hand-held instrument \nthat measures light attenuation at 650\
    \ nm (i.e., close to the maximum total chlorophyll absorption) and \n950 nm from\
    \ a 0.06 cm2 leaf area. Differences in light attenuation are converted in SPAD\
    \ unit, \nproportional to leaf chlorophyll concentration. \nLeaf samples for the\
    \ estimation of water content were collected in the twelve fertilized plots (four\
    \ \nleaves from different plants for each plot). The leaf equivalent water thickness\
    \ (EWT) and the relative \nwater content (RWC) were calculated according to the\
    \ following equations: \nܧܹܶ=ܨܹ−ܦܹ\nܣ (1)\nܴܹܥ=ܨܹ−ܦܹ\nܹܶ−ܦܹ (2)\nwhere FW is the\
    \ fresh weight of leaf disks with an area (A) of 3.8 cm2; DW is the dry weight\
    \ of the leaf \ndisks dried at 80 °C in an oven until constant weight; TW is the\
    \ turgid weight measured on the leaf disks \nimmersed for 72 h in distilled water,\
    \ blotted and weighed. \nFinally, the leaf area index (LAI, m2 m−2) and the photosynthetically\
    \ active radiation absorbed by \nvegetation (APAR) were measured in each plot\
    \ using a linear ceptometer in the PAR (Photosynthetically \nActive Radiation)\
    \ domain (SunScan Canopy Analysis System, Delta-T devices, Burwell, UK). \nMeasurements\
    \ were conducted according to the SunScan user manual [22]: incident and reflected\
    \ \nradiation was measured from about 0.5 m above the top of the canopy in each\
    \ plot; the direct to diffuse \nradiation ratio was estimated by conducting a\
    \ second incident radiation measurement after shadowing \nabout 1/4 of the probe\
    \ sensors (100 cm long); seven readings of transmitted solar radiation at ground\
    \ \nlevel were collected and averaged along a transect crossing two consecutive\
    \ crop rows. LAI was then \nestimated exploiting the SunScan internal software.\
    \ Leaf absorption in the PAR domain was assumed to \nbe equal to 0.85, while the\
    \ ellipsoidal leaf angle distribution parameter was set to 1.37 [23]. The APAR\
    \ \nwas computed as: \nܣܲܣܴ=ܲܣܴ௜−ܲܣܴ௧−ܲܣܴ௥(3)\nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4\

    \ and ߝௌ(ߣ௜) are the \nemissivities of the vegetation canopy and soil components\

    \ according to Planck’s emission law and ݁(ߣ௜) is the residual error term in each\
    \ band i. \nWith ݂ܿ௏  and ݂ܿௌ estimated from the visible and near infrared CASI\
    \ data and ߝ௏(ߣ) and ߝௌ(ߣ) \nknown, the system of Equation (4) for each band can\
    \ be solved with respect to ܶ஼ and ܶௌ using the \nTruncated Newtonian minimization\
    \ algorithm (TNMIN-Markwardt IDL library), for each pixel of the \nexperimental\
    \ site. \nCanopy temperature (Tc) and air temperature (Ta) were used to calculate\
    \ the CWSI with Equation (5): \nܥܹܵܫ=(ܶ஼−ܶ௔)−(ܶ஼−ܶ௔)௅௅\n(ܶ஼−ܶ௔)௎௅−(ܶ஼−ܶ௔)௅௅\n\
    \ (5)\nwhere (Tc − Ta)LL is the lower limit of the difference between canopy and\
    \ air temperature and  \nit corresponds to the ΔT value of the “non-water-stressed\
    \ baseline” for a given evaporative demand \n(potential crop). (Tc − Ta)UL corresponds\
    \ to the upper limit of the ΔT value of a canopy where \ntranspiration is completely\
    \ halted (dry crop). \nThe lower and upper baselines were established using Tc\
    \ measurements obtained from thermal \nimages collected with a portable FLIR thermocamera\
    \ (model i60, FLIR® Systems, Inc., Wilsonville, OR, \nUSA) measuring in the range\
    \ from 8–13.5 µm. Thermal images have been collected at regular time \nintervals\
    \ between 10:30 and 14:30 UTC in the days close to the overpass on well watered\
    \ maize plants \n(potential crop) and standing cut plants (dry crop). The difference\
    \ between Tc values extracted only from \nthe vegetated components of the collected\
    \ images and corresponding Ta values measured by a portable \nweather station\
    \ have been related to VPD to define the lower and upper baselines. ΔT values\
    \ are \nsignificantly linearly related to VPD in well watered plants (R2 = 0.64,\
    \ p < 0.001) confirming that plants \nregulate their temperature in response to\
    \ variation in the evaporative demand. On the contrary,  \nthe relation between\
    \ ΔT and VPD in dry plants is not significant and the UL baseline was calculated\
    \ as \nthe average ΔT of dry plants as suggested in [25]. The resulting lower\

    \ value is similar to the average ΔTUL of 4.6 °C, measured over a severely stressed\
    \ maize plot \nunder a Mediterranean semi-arid climate [27]. The calculation of\
    \ CWSI was restricted to flights \nconducted at 11:04 and 14:01 UTC, coinciding\

    \ the data variance is explained by the factor \nirrigation. A high correlation\
    \ ratio (close to 1) means that the factor irrigation explains all the data variance.\
    \ \nThe relationships between field measurements and vegetation indices have been\
    \ assessed extracting \nmean reflectance spectra from an area centered in each\
    \ of the 24 maize plots (3 × 3 pixels for AHS and \n9 × 9 pixels for CASI corresponding\
    \ to 56 m2 and 81 m2, respectively). The analysis of the sensitivity \nof different\
    \ indices to the applied water regimes has been conducted extracting mean spectral\
    \ data from \nthe same areas. The effect of the irrigation treatment on the radiometric\
    \ quantities investigated in this \nstudy was tested with the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis\
    \ test. \n3. Results and Discussion \n3.1. Field Data \nThe deficit irrigation\
    \ regimes applied in this experiment caused a general decrease of different leaf\
    \ \nparameters as compared to the full irrigation regime. The percentage variation\
    \ of each parameter \ncompared to the value measured in the Irr2 plots is reported\
    \ in Table 4 together with the correlation ratio \ndescribing the effect of the\
    \ irrigation treatment on the measured parameters. \nThe CO2 instantaneous assimilation\
    \ (Ai) and instantaneous stomatal conductance (Gi) were the \nparameters most\
    \ affected by water regimes, with a decrease in Irr0 plots greater than 20% compared\
    \ to \nIrr2 plots. This is not surprising because stomatal conductance is one\
    \ of the most reliable indicators of \nwater stress as water stress induces stomatal\
    \ closure to reduce the transpiration rate and therefore the \nCO2 assimilation\
    \ rate. ΔF/Fm' showed a decrease of 15% in Irr0 plots, while leaf biochemical\
    \ parameters \n(Chl, EWT and RWC) showed a reduced variation caused by water regimes\
    \ with a maximum decline of \n6%. Plants reacted to water stress also by reducing\
    \ LAI. In fact, a reduction of 20.7% was observed from \nIrr2 to Irr1 and a reduction\
    \ of 31% from Irr2 to Irr0. However, LAI measurements were characterized \nby\
    \ a higher within-treatment variability (coefficient of variation of 17%, 30%\
    \ and 35% for Irr2, Irr1 and \nIrr0 plots, respectively) compared to leaf measurements,\
    \ lowering the amount of LAI variance explained \nby the factor irrigation (η2\
    \ = 0.42). It is interesting to note that the coefficient of variation of LAI\
    \ within \ntreatments increased as the water stress increased. \n \n \nISPRS Int.\

    \ positive values only for about six hours during the day, \nfrom 9:00–15:00 local\
    \ solar time. Furthermore, the maximum ΔT value (0.9 °C) was considerably lower\
    \ \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n636 \n \n \nthan the maximum value recorded\
    \ in the Irr0 plot. In the first part of the morning and late afternoon, \nfully\
    \ irrigated maize plants had lower Tc than Ta due to the cooling effect of transpiration.\
    \ \nThe difference between canopy and air temperature is a reliable indicator\
    \ of water status [7] and  \nthe observed ΔT difference between the two plots\
    \ can be attributed to restricted transpiration due to \nwater limitation in Irr0\
    \ causing an increase in canopy temperature. The relationship between plant water\
    \ \nstress and Tc is well known, due to the fact that water deficit induces a\
    \ decrease of leaf stomatal \nconductance, as observed in Table 4, with a consequent\
    \ reduction of the evapo-transpiration rate and  \nan increase of leaf/canopy\
    \ temperature [37]. The close link between ΔT and stomatal conductance is \nconfirmed\
    \ by the significant relationship between the average ΔT values extracted from\
    \ the AHS map \nand field measurements of Gi collected simultaneously to the midday\
    \ airborne overpass (R2 = 0.58,  \np < 0.05, n = 6) (Figure 3a). ΔT showed the\
    \ best fitting with ΔF/Fm' (R2 = 0.66, p < 0.001, n = 24)  \n(Figure 3b). ΔF/Fm'\
    \ is related to plant photosynthetic efficiency and it has been often used as\
    \ indicator \nof plant status. In this study, ΔF/Fm' is highly correlated with\
    \ Gi (r = 0.96) thus can be regarded as an \nindicator of leaf photosynthetic\
    \ efficiency due to water stress comparable to Gi. However, we are aware \nof\
    \ the fact that for a wider range of values, the relationship between ΔF/Fm' and\
    \ Gi would not be linear, \ncompromising the possibility to use ΔF/Fm' as indicator\
    \ of water stress. A strong relationship between \nΔT and leaf EWT was also observed\
    \ (R2 = 0.52, p < 0.01, n = 12). \n \nFigure 3. Relationship between image-based\

    \ temperatures corresponded to rainfed plots reaching values of 40 °C at midday.\
    \ \nThe temperature of the stressed canopies was greater than Ta by a maximum\
    \ difference of about 11 °C. \nWell-watered plots had lower Tc than Ta, particularly\

    \ with the mean \ntemperature of the rainfed plots being from 3 °C–4.7 °C warmer\
    \ than the irrigated treatment Irr2 in the \nmorning and at midday, respectively.\
    \ \nThe difference between water treatments was maximized at midday with all three\
    \ treatments being \nstatistically different according to the Kruskal–Wallis test.\
    \ On the contrary, the intermediate treatment \nIrr1 was not distinguishable from\
    \ the other two during the morning and afternoon overflights. Even \nthough Tc\
    \ and ΔT have been considered reliable indicators of water stress starting from\
    \ 1970–1980 [7], \nchanges in Tc during the day only recently have been proposed\
    \ as an indicator [38]. The change between \nthe morning and midday Tc was found\
    \ here to correlate with Gi with an R2 of 0.65, while the change \nbetween midday\
    \ and afternoon Tc yielded to a weaker relation (R2 = 0.22, n = 6). Thus, careful\
    \ planning \nof the time of acquisition of thermal images is essential when the\
    \ slope of Tc as a function of time is \nused as a stress indicator. Promising\
    \ results using images collected between 9:00 and 13:00 have been \nobtained as\
    \ well in three Prunus species [38]. More studies are needed to evaluate the best\
    \ suited time \nintervals for the slope calculation and to assess the robustness\
    \ of the approach. \n \nFigure 6. Time courses of average Tc (°C) (a) and ΔT (b)\

    \ Parameters Measured at Midday \nThe performances of the relationships between\
    \ optical hyperspectral indices and passive fluorescence \nF760 derived from the\
    \ second CASI flight and field parameters collected between 11:00 and 12:30 UTC\
    \ \nhave been evaluated. \nNDVI was the index best related to LAI (R2 = 0.63,\
    \ p < 0.001, n = 24) and TCARI/OSAVI to leaf \nChl content (R2 = 0.65, p < 0.001,\
    \ n = 24) confirming previous results [11] obtained on the same study \nsite using\
    \ the AISA Eagle hyperspectral airborne sensor (Specim, Finland). \nPRI and F760\
    \ were significantly related to leaf ΔF/Fm' measurements (R2 = 0.46, p < 0.001\
    \ and R2 = 0.39, \np = 0.004, n = 24, for PRI and F760, respectively), while the\
    \ relationship with Gi was significant only \nwith PRI (R2 = 0.65, p = 0.05, n\
    \ = 6). Interestingly, the relationships between ΔF/Fm' and Gi and Fy760 \nare\
    \ both significant and with higher determination coefficients compared to those\
    \ between ΔF/Fm' and \nGi and F760 (R2 = 0.44, p < 0.001 and R2 = 0.51, p = 0.11\
    \ for ΔF/Fm' and Gi, respectively). It is worth \nnoting that while F760 was positively\
    \ related to ΔF/Fm', the sign of the relationship changes when we \nnormalize\
    \ F760 by APAR (Fy760). This means that stressed plants emitted more fluorescence\
    \ per unit of \nabsorbed PAR radiation. Further studies are needed to confirm\
    \ this observation for different species, \nphenological stages and experimental\
    \ conditions and to assess the best quantities to be used to normalize \nthe F760\
    \ signal and make the use of F760 as a stress indicator easier. \n3.4. Diurnal\
    \ Variations of Optical Indices and Fluorescence \nThe temporal variations of\
    \ different indices grouped by water treatment are shown in Figure 8. \nWhereas\
    \ none of the investigated indices was able to statistically distinguish all three\
    \ water treatments, \nall the indices except TCARI/OSAVI allowed the separation\
    \ of the well irrigated plots (Irr2) and those \nmore severely affected by water\
    \ stress (Irr0). VARI is the only index able to detect a significant \nISPRS Int.\
    \ J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n640 \n \n \ndifference between moderate and severe water\
    \ stress (Irr1 and Irr0 plots) in the midday flight, confirming \nsome potential\
    \ of this index to track water stress as already shown in previous studies [39,40].\
    \ \n \nFigure 8. Time courses of NDVI (a); TCARI/OSAVI (b); VARI (c); PRI (d);\
    \ F760 (e) and \nFy*760 (f) for the three water treatments. Vertical bars are\
    \ ± one standard deviation. \nVegetation indices and fluorescence were analyzed\
    \ with the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis \ntest. The results of the test are evidenced\
    \ by letters on the plots. Statistically different (p < 0.05) \nmeans are designated\
    \ with different letters. \nNDVI showed a diurnal course with minimum values at\
    \ midday and comparable values in the \nmorning and afternoon. Irr2 plots had\
    \ always higher NDVI values followed by Irr1 and Irr0 plots.  \nOnly Irr0 and\
    \ Irr2 plots were statistically different. NDVI diurnal course is similar between\
    \ the three \ntreatments and can be explained by variations in the sun-target-sensor\
    \ geometry during the day affecting \nthe bidirectional reflectance distribution\
    \ function (BRDF) and by the canopy elements in the sensor field \nof view. TCARI/OSAVI\
    \ related to Chl content showed a reduced variability between treatments \n(differences\
    \ not statistically significant) and also an almost absent diurnal shape. The\
    \ weak relationship \nbetween TCARI/OSAVI and water stress is in agreement with\
    \ results of the field data analysis showing \nthat plants reacted to water stress\
    \ by reducing LAI rather than Chl that was in fact weakly affected by \nthe irrigation\
    \ level (maximum reduction of 5.7% compared to Irr2 plots). This can be explained\
    \ \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n641 \n \n \nconsidering that leaf elongation\
    \ is among the plant processes most sensitive to water shortage [41]. Water \n\
    deficit induces a reduction of plant growth rate, and consequently LAI, before\
    \ triggering the degradation \nof leaf pigments. VARI showed a behavior similar\
    \ to that of NDVI. The main differences are that VARI \nenhanced differences between\
    \ Irr0 plots and the other two groups at midday and differences between \nIrr2\
    \ and the other two groups during the afternoon. \nThe diurnal changes of PRI\
    \ are expected to be affected by both BRDF and absorption changes due to \nxanthophyll\
    \ pigments depoxidation caused by diurnal water stress changes. Even if previous\
    \ studies \nhave demonstrated that the PRI index is sensitive to water stress\
    \ levels, they also report that it is  \naffected by the confounding effects of\
    \ absorption of photosynthetic pigments, canopy structure, and \nbackground [12,42,43].\
    \ \nF760 showed a diurnal trend mirroring the one of the incident photosynthetically\
    \ photon flux density \nwith higher values in Irr2 plots followed by Irr1 and\
    \ then Irr0 plots. On the contrary, Fy*760 shows a \nmore stable daily course\
    \ (Figure 8f) with the lowest values observed in Irr0 and the highest in Irr2\
    \ plots. \nThis confirmed results obtained in previous studies where the F760\
    \ was lowered in plots with deficient \nwater supply [11]. Again, only Irr0 and\
    \ Irr2 plots were statistically different in terms of both F760 and \nFy*760.\
    \ However, the spectral resolution of the CASI sensor is not optimal for the estimation\
    \ of F760 and \nwe cannot exclude that the lower performances of F760 in stress\
    \ detection compared to Tc could be \npartially explained by F760 estimations\
    \ not accurate enough. A new airborne sensor specifically intended for \nsun-induced\
    \ chlorophyll fluorescence estimation has been recently developed by the Forschungszentrum\
    \ \nJülich (Germany) in cooperation with the Finnish company Specim [44] and will\
    \ open the possibility to \nfully verify the potential of fluorescence for stress\
    \ detection with the best currently available spectral \nand radiometric resolution\
    \ in the red and far-red regions. \n3.5. Synthesis of Thermal and Optical Data\
    \ \nResults obtained from both the AHS and CASI images at different times of the\
    \ day have been \nsummarized in Table 5 where the indices previously analyzed\
    \ separately have been listed according to \ntheir non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis\
    \ statistic. Indices listed first are those showing variations attributed \nto\
    \ water stress the most. NDVI performs better in discriminating different water\
    \ stress levels during the \nmorning flight. We propose the following explanation\
    \ for this finding. NDVI has been shown to be \nsensitive to LAI; thus, the highest\
    \ ranking observed during the morning can be attributed to differences \nin LAI\
    \ values between plots irrigated with different water regimes. Structural LAI\
    \ differences are the \nmost evident during the morning because plants have not\
    \ yet completely activated the dynamic \nmechanisms to cope with water stress.\
    \ Thus, differences in biophysical and structural characteristics of \nthe maize\
    \ canopy due to the long term stress imposed have the strongest influence on the\
    \ measured \nsignal. As the day progresses, differences due to the regulation\
    \ of evapotranspiration driven by water \navailability become predominant and\
    \ ΔT performs better in discriminating different water levels. This \nreasoning\
    \ is corroborated by the fact that the performance of NDVI is not lowered dramatically\
    \ during \nthe day, while the performance of other indicators (ΔT at noon, PRI\
    \ in the afternoon) that is improved \nwith respect to the morning overpass. During\
    \ the afternoon, irrigated plants may have reduced their \nregulation capacity\
    \ through evapotranspiration due to high Ta and potential limitations in water\
    \ \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n642 \n \n \navailability typical of a full,\
    \ sunny day. At this time, PRI and F760 are the parameters differing the most\
    \ \namong treatments. \nTable 5. Ranking of different indices derived from both\
    \ the AHS and CASI indices for  \nthe three overpasses based on the non-parametric\
    \ Kruskal–Wallis test. The value of the \nKruskal–Wallis statistic is reported\
    \ within brackets. \nMorning \nMidday \nAfternoon \nNDVI (11.045) \nTc and ΔT\
    \ (14.060) \nPRI (13.815) \nPRI (10.085) \nNDVI (13.265) \nF760 and Fy*760 (13.715)\

    \ ΔT (10.205) \nTCARI/OSAVI (2.195) \nTCARI/OSAVI (1.34) \nTCARI/OSAVI (0.32)\
    \ \nThe ranking of best performing indices can be used to empirically identify\
    \ the most suitable time \ninterval for obtaining airborne images to be used to\
    \ monitor crop water status. The optimum time to \nacquire thermal images is around\
    \ noon, confirming previous results obtained by Bellvert et al. [45]  \nin vineyards.\
    \ Better performances of ΔT around noon can be also partially explained considering\
    \ that in \nthe morning and afternoon images, the mutual shading of leaves increases\
    \ causing different degrees of \nstomatal conductance within the canopy and lowering\
    \ the relationship between ΔT and water stress. \nNDVI performed evenly during\
    \ the course of the day. This is because it tracked variations induced by \nwater\
    \ stress on canopy structure and green biomass that are expected not to vary during\
    \ the course of \none day. However, NDVI is expected to work only when the stress\
    \ induces a variation in canopy biomass \nand structure. In a previous study by\
    \ the authors [12], NDVI was not able to detect a moderate water \nstress condition,\
    \ affecting the plant physiological status but not the canopy structure. PRI and\
    \ fluorescence \nappears to be more discriminant in the afternoon overpass. \n\
    We cannot exclude though, a superimposed effect of changing illumination geometry\
    \ during the day, \nnot easily quantified, which could partially explain the changes\
    \ in the relative performances of optical \nindices, fluorescence and temperature\
    \ observed during the day. \n4. Conclusions \nWith increasing water scarcity in\
    \ many areas of the world, suitable indicators of crop water status are \nbecoming\
    \ more and more relevant to assist in precision irrigation management. In this\
    \ study, airborne \nremote sensing data acquired with the hyperspectral CASI and\
    \ AHS sensors were used to detect water \nstress in maize at three different levels\
    \ of irrigation. \nField data showed that at the time of the overpasses maize\
    \ plants were experiencing a mild to severe \nwater stress in rainfed plots and\
    \ a weaker stress condition in the plots with water deficit imposed between \n\
    stem elongation and flowering. The performances of different vegetation indices,\
    \ F760 and ΔT in water \nstress detection were evaluated using three airborne\
    \ overpasses conducted in the morning, midday  \nand afternoon. \nThe study demonstrated\
    \ the feasibility of using high resolution optical and thermal images to detect\
    \ \nconditions of water deficit in a maize field. The optimum time to differentiate\
    \ different water stress \nISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf. 2015, 4 \n643 \n \n \nconditions\
    \ was around noon using thermal images. PRI and F760 (Fy*760) showed the best\
    \ performances \nin the afternoon. NDVI performed evenly throughout the day, being\
    \ able to detect differences among \nplots due to canopy biomass and structure\
    \ and not due to leaf physiology. The slope of the evolution of \nTc during the\
    \ morning was well correlated with stomata conductance and is proposed as a promising\
    \ \nindicator to track water status. Its main advantage relative to single-time\
    \ measurements of temperature \nis that it encompasses stomatal behavior in response\
    \ to the evolution of meteorological variables during \nthe day. \nAcknowledgments\

    \ strategies are often implemented to control vine canopy\ngrowth and to impose\
    \ stress at critical stages of vine growth to improve wine grape quality.\nTo\
    \ support deﬁcit irrigation scheduling, remote sensing technologies can be employed\
    \ in the mapping\nof evapotranspiration (ET) at the ﬁeld to sub-ﬁeld scales, quantifying\
    \ time-varying vineyard water\nrequirements and actual water use. In the current\
    \ study, we investigate the utility of ET maps derived\nfrom thermal infrared\
    \ satellite imagery over a vineyard in the Central Valley of California equipped\n\
    with a variable rate drip irrigation (VRDI) system which enables diﬀerential water\
    \ applications at\nthe 30 × 30 m scale. To support irrigation management at that\
    \ scale, we utilized a thermal-based\nmulti-sensor data fusion approach to generate\
    \ weekly total actual ET (ETa) estimates at 30 m\nspatial resolution, coinciding\
    \ with the resolution of the Landsat reﬂectance bands. Crop water\nrequirements\
    \ (ETc) were deﬁned with a vegetative index (VI)-based approach. To test capacity\n\
    to capture stress signals, the vineyard was sub-divided into four blocks with\
    \ diﬀerent irrigation\nmanagement strategies and goals, inducing varying degrees\
    \ of stress during the growing season.\nResults indicate derived weekly total\
    \ ET from the thermal-based data fusion approach match well\nwith observations.\
    \ The thermal-based method was also able to capture the spatial heterogeneity\n\
    in ET over the vineyard due to a water stress event imposed on two of the four\
    \ vineyard blocks.\nThis transient stress event was not reﬂected in the VI-based\
    \ ETc estimate, highlighting the value\nof thermal band imaging. While the data\
    \ fusion system provided valuable information, latency in\ncurrent satellite data\
    \ availability, particularly from Landsat, impacts operational applications over\
    \ the\ncourse of a growing season.\nKeywords: evapotranspiration; remote sensing;\

    1. Introduction\nEﬃcient use of agricultural water resources through irrigation\
    \ scheduling is predicated on the\naccurate prediction and constant monitoring\
    \ of evapotranspiration (ET) at the ﬁeld or sub-ﬁeld scale.\nRemote Sens. 2019,\
    \ 11, 2124; doi:10.3390/rs11182124\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2019, 11, 2124\n2 of 20\nThis is especially true in viticulture, where\
    \ both the amount and timing of irrigation applications are\nspeciﬁcally used\
    \ to control vine growth and manage grape yield and quality [1–7]. Consequently,\n\
    growers closely monitor vineyard water status relative to a phenologically varying\
    \ target water status\ngoal, modifying irrigation amounts accordingly. Numerous\
    \ methods exist to determine vineyard ET\nand to infer water status/use, including\
    \ both ground- and satellite-based remote sensing solutions.\nGround-based solutions\
    \ can oﬀer reliable, localized ET estimates; however, their utility is limited\n\
    by high maintenance cost and challenges in upscaling to the vineyard or multi-vineyard\
    \ scale.\nSatellite-based remote sensing methods, on the other hand, routinely\
    \ provide spatial information\nuseful for determining regional to ﬁeld scale heterogeneity\
    \ in vine conditions and water status, making\nthem more suitable for large-area\
    \ management. Given the free and open data access policies applicable\nto many\
    \ earth-observing satellites, growers understand the potential of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing\nfor eﬀective assessment of water status at serviceable spatial\
    \ and temporal scales and are beginning to\napply these technologies operationally.\n\
    In addition to actual water consumed, irrigation scheduling also requires an estimate\
    \ of the water\nrequired to maintain optimal crop health. One common and practical\
    \ approach for the estimation of\ncrop water requirements is the application of\
    \ the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Irrigation\nand Drainage Paper\
    \ No. 56 [8] method. This method has been widely used to estimate water use\n\
    and schedule irrigation [8,9] and is often preferred due to its simplicity and\
    \ ability to be applied\noperationally. The FAO-56 method derives an estimate\
    \ of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) under standard\nconditions (i.e., well-watered,\
    \ well-fertilized and disease-free) from the product of the reference ET\n(ETo)\
    \ and a crop coeﬃcient (Kc). Kc represents characteristics that distinguish the\
    \ crop from grass\nreference, including crop height, albedo, canopy resistance\
    \ and evaporation from the soil. Depending\non the accuracy required and/or data\
    \ availability, the crop coeﬃcient can represent the time averaged\ncombined eﬀects\
    \ of crop transpiration and soil evaporation (Kc), or separated into two coeﬃcients,\n\
    the basal crop coeﬃcient (Kcb; describing plant transpiration) and soil evaporation\
    \ coeﬃcient (Ke;\ndescribing soil evaporation) [8]. ETo is often calculated using\
    \ the FAO-Penman Monteith equation,\nwhich is recommended by the FAO as the standard\
    \ method [8], and represents the eﬀects of weather\nconditions on the evapotranspiration\
    \ process.\nStandard values and temporal evolution of Kc values have been investigated\
    \ for diﬀerent crops and\nunder diﬀerent climate conditions [8,10]. However, because\
    \ of dependencies on local climate and crop\nconditions, the implementation of\
    \ generalized Kc values recommended by FAO-56 can lead to errors\nin estimated\
    \ ET. In response, satellite-based remote sensing in the visible and near-infrared\
    \ ranges\nhave been shown to provide an indirect estimate of Kc over many surfaces\
    \ [3,4,11–20]. Speciﬁcally,\nReference [3] applied vegetation indices (VI)-based\
    \ Kc values to determine actual ET (ETa) based on\nthe FAO-56 approach within\
    \ a vineyard located in southeastern Spain. However, the determination of\nETa\
    \ (and not ETc) through the FAO-56 approach requires an additional adjustment\
    \ to Kc to account for\nwater stress in the root zone. This adjustment is dependent\
    \ on irrigation and precipitation information,\nas well as soil physical water\
    \ retention properties. Calculating such an adjustment and scaling it to\nmultiple\
    \ vineyards from an operational standpoint is challenging as detailed soil and\
    \ rooting depth\ninformation is not reliably available over the landscape. Moreover,\
    \ prior irrigation information is very\ndiﬃcult to obtain, particularly over multiple\
    \ vineyards and in near real time for making operational\ndecisions. In addition,\
    \ satellite-derived VIs are slow to respond to plant stress, making them less\
    \ useful\nfor monitoring rapid changes in crop water use [21,22]. This is especially\
    \ pertinent in a vineyard setting,\nwhere vines are purposely being grown in a\
    \ semi-stressed state during certain phenological stages.\nIn contrast, thermal\
    \ infrared (TIR) imagery and derived land-surface temperature (LST) conveys\n\
    spatially explicit signals of actual water use and stress without the need for\
    \ a priori information on\nsoil water retention properties, rooting depth, precipitation\
    \ or irrigation [23,24]. LST also provides\na faster response signal of incipient\
    \ stress than VI methods, allowing for timely mapping of transient\nstress signals\
    \ [25]. The TIR-based Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) [26–28] surface\
    \ energy\nbalance model and associated ﬂux disaggregation technique (DisALEXI)\
    \ [29,30] uses LST derived\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2124\n3 of 20\nfrom TIR imagery\
    \ to map ETa. The regional ALEXI model is run operationally over CONUS at\n4-km\
    \ resolution, exploiting the sub-hourly TIR imagery collected by the Geostationary\
    \ Operational\nEnvironmental Satellites (GOES). DisALEXI can be used to downscale\
    \ the ALEXI ﬂuxes over target areas\nof interest at high-spatial/low-temporal\
    \ (e.g., using Landsat) and at moderate-spatial/high-temporal\n(e.g., using the\
    \ Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; MODIS) resolution. Landsat and\n\
    MODIS ETa retrievals are then merged using a data fusion methodology (Spatial\
    \ and Temporal\nAdaptive Reﬂectance Fusion Model; STARFM) [31] to create ET datacubes\
    \ with both high spatial (30 m)\nand temporal (daily) resolutions [32]. In this\
    \ approach, the MODIS ET retrievals are eﬀectively used to\ninform interpolation\
    \ between Landsat overpasses and, in operational mode, extrapolation beyond the\n\
    last available overpass.\nThis thermal-based approach has been successfully applied\
    \ over multiple landcover types [23,32–38],\nincluding vineyards [39,40]. The\
    \ vineyard-specific applications of the ALEXI/DisALEXI modeling\nscheme demonstrated\
    \ utility in monitoring vine water use and stress, capturing within-vineyard spatial\n\
    heterogeneity of ETa and matching tower observations. An additional benefit of\
    \ the ALEXI/DisALEXI\napproach for irrigation operational management is that it\
    \ does not require ground-based or site-specific\ndata, making it scalable to\
    \ surrounding vineyards. However, applications of ALEXI/DisALEXI to date\nhave\
    \ been conducted in a retrospective manner, meaning all required satellite-remote\
    \ sensing data were\navailable up to and beyond the final modeling date. This\
    \ allows the use of reprocessed and evaluated\nsatellite imagery that meets defined\
    \ quality standards. For operational applications, the lag time in\nsatellite-remote\
    \ sensing data availability (latency) needs to be addressed.\nSatellite-based\
    \ remote sensing of ETa at 30-m resolution can facilitate precision irrigation\n\
    management. Typically, a vineyard block is irrigated to the demands of a desirable\
    \ part of the\nblock, meaning the remaining vines may be over- or under-irrigated.\
    \ New irrigation technology,\nsuch as variable rate drip irrigation (VRDI) systems,\
    \ provide diﬀerential water delivery to sub-blocks\nwithin the ﬁeld, allowing\
    \ the tailoring of irrigation amounts to the speciﬁc water demands of each\nsub-block.\
    \ Remote sensing enables mapping of the spatial variability in water demand, allowing\
    \ better\nregulation of vine growth via irrigation over smaller areas. The goals\
    \ of VRDI are to produce more\nhomogeneous yields over a vineyard, to improve\
    \ grape quality by reducing over/under irrigation, and\nto reduce overall water\
    \ use.\nIn the current study, we investigate the capabilities of currently operational\
    \ VI-based ETc (FAO-56\nmethod) and the thermal-based ETa (ALEXI/DisALEXI + STARFM\
    \ method) for operational irrigation\ndecision support at sub-ﬁeld scales. The\
    \ thermal-based ETa approach is run for the ﬁrst time in\nan operational setting\
    \ permitting an evaluation of its capability to detect stress, the timeliness\
    \ of the ETa\nproduct, and what the current limitations that need to be addressed\
    \ are for future operational water\nuse monitoring applications using satellite\
    \ data. This study was conducted over a VRDI-equipped\nvineyard divided into four\
    \ sections, each receiving diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation to induce varying\n\
    levels of stress. During the 2018 growing season, both ETa and ETc were computed\
    \ at weekly time\nsteps every week over the vineyard and compared with ﬂux observations\
    \ collected at ﬂux tower\nsites installed within each section. In addition, the\
    \ spatiotemporal responsiveness of ETa and ETc to\nimposed stress patterns was\
    \ evaluated considering known satellite data latencies.\n2. Materials and Methods\n\
    2.1. Study Domain\nThe study was conducted between the months of May and October\
    \ of 2018 over a vineyard located\n25 km west of Fresno, California, using data\
    \ collected as part of the USDA-ARS grape remote sensing\natmospheric proﬁle and\
    \ evapotranspiration experiment (GRAPEX) [41]. The vineyard was planted in\n2010\
    \ with Merlot (Vitis vinifera L.) vines trained to quadrilateral cordons on a\
    \ horizontally split trellis.\nVines were spaced 1.5 m apart with 3.35 m row spacing\
    \ and east-west row orientation. The vineyard has\nan area of 16 ha and experiences\
    \ a warm Mediterranean climate characterized by abundant sunshine\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2019, 11, 2124\n4 of 20\nand large day-to-night temperature diﬀerences. Degree\
    \ day (DD) accumulations for the growing\nseason are typically 4200 DD. Total\
    \ precipitation and average air temperature measured between May\nand October\
    \ of 2018 were 12 mm and 22 ◦C, respectively. The entire vineyard is characterized\
    \ by sandy\nloam and a 0–1 percent slope. The vineyard is equipped with a variable\
    \ rate drip irrigation (VRDI)\nsystem (black grid; Figure 1) capable of applying\
    \ speciﬁc amounts of irrigation on a 30 × 30 m gridded\nbasis [42]. This grid\
    \ was designed to have a symmetrical arrangement from the middle North-South\n\
    line of the ﬁeld so that each multi-tube drip irrigation bundle would span six\
    \ pixels either from the west\nor from the east edges, where the valve boxes were\
    \ located. We further divided the vineyard into four\nseparate sections (blue\
    \ grid; Figure 1), each equipped with a dedicated easy covariance ﬂux tower (red\n\
    dots), to test model response to varying stress levels within the vineyard. Flux\
    \ tower placement was\ndetermined through footprint analysis, outlined in Reference\
    \ [43], using data from a nearby vineyard\nalso part of the GRAPEX project [41].\
    \ Speciﬁcally, daytime data collected during the growing season\nindicated wind\
    \ from the northwest quadrant nearly 95% of the time with a median wind direction\n\
    of 317◦. The median upwind extent of the footprint was 48 m, while the maximum\
    \ upwind extent\nwas 78 m. Therefore, ﬂux towers were placed in the southeast\
    \ corner of each block to maximize fetch\nwithin the block. More details pertaining\
    \ to treatment selection are presented in the following section.\nRemote Sens.\

    \ to maximize fetch within the block, with winds predominantly from\nthe northwest.\
    \ Data collected include high frequency (20 Hz) and mean (half-hourly) measurements\n\
    of three-dimensional wind, temperature water vapor and CO2. Net radiation and\
    \ soil heat ﬂux\nmeasurements, together with sensible and latent heat (turbulent)\
    \ ﬂuxes derived from the 20 Hz data,\nprovided surface energy balance observations.\
    \ Volumetric water content was also measured at three\ndepths (30 cm, 60 cm and\
    \ 90 cm) along two transects perpendicular to vine row. One transect was\nlocated\
    \ 25 cm east of the irrigation line emitter, and the other was 25 cm west. Reported\
    \ soil moisture\nestimates are the average of the two transects.\nRemote Sens.\

    \ ﬂuxes were made by a Campbell Scientiﬁc,\nInc. (Logan, USA) IRGASON water vapor/carbon\

    \ EC systems were mounted 4 m above local ground level (a.g.l.)\nfacing due west\
    \ and collect data at 20 Hz producing 30 min averages. The EC data were processed\n\
    using the CSI EasyFlux software producing 30 min fully processed turbulent ﬂuxes\
    \ of sensible and\nlatent heat. Additional instrumentation included: An NR01 net\
    \ radiometer (Campbell Scientiﬁc, Inc.)\nmounted 4.35 m a.g.l.; an EE08 temperature\
    \ and relative humidity sensor in aspirated shield (Apogee)\nmounted 4 m a.g.l.;\
    \ and ﬁve HFT3.1 soil heat ﬂux plates (Radiation and Energy Balance Systems)\n\
    at −8 cm depth, with soil thermocouples at 2 and 6 cm depth and volumetric water\
    \ content using\nStevens Hydra-probe (see Reference [41] for details of the eddy\
    \ ﬂux system design). The soil proﬁle\nmeasurements were made using water content\
    \ reﬂectometers (Campbell Scientiﬁc model CS655) and\nsampled every 15 min. Comparisons\
    \ of water content derived from gravimetric samples indicated that\nthe CS655\
    \ measurements were reliable for the soils that existed in the VRDI vineyard.\
    \ In 2018, soil\nmoisture proﬁles measurements were made in blocks 1, 2 and 4,\
    \ but not in block 3. The use of trade,\nﬁrm, or corporation names in this article\
    \ is for the information and convenience of the reader. Such\nuse does not constitute\
    \ oﬃcial endorsement or approval by the US Department of Agriculture or the\n\
    Agricultural Research Service.\nDuring the period of study, average energy balance\
    \ closure ratios (H + LE)/(Rn-G) were on the\norder of 0.91. Despite low closure\
    \ errors, crop water use in irrigated areas in semi-arid regions can be\ninﬂuenced\
    \ by advective conditions. Horizontal advection of hot/dry air can increase the\
    \ evaporative\ndemand over an irrigated vineyard, causing latent heat ﬂux values\
    \ to exceed the available energy\n(Rn-G). Consequently, the additional energy\
    \ required to meet atmospheric demand is extracted from\nthe air above the canopy,\
    \ resulting in negative sensible heat. Additionally, horizontal advection\ncomplicates\
    \ the eddy covariance measurements by providing a horizontal contribution to the\
    \ ﬂux\nmeasurements [44]. Therefore, daily latent heat estimates with closure\
    \ errors on the order of 20% or\nmore are omitted from the analysis. Observed\
    \ latent heat ﬂuxes were corrected for closure errors using\nthe residual (RE)\
    \ method described in Reference [45].\n2.3. ET Remote Sensing Framework and Irrigation\
    \ Strategy\n2.3.1. Vineyard Irrigation Strategy\nTo test the sensitivity of the\
    \ satellite ET retrievals to diﬀerences in canopy stress, the northern\nblocks\
    \ (blocks 1 and 2) in the experimental vineyard were subjected to a controlled\
    \ stress event.\nThis was accomplished by withholding irrigation during a portion\
    \ of the early growing season until the\nsoil water in the root zone was depleted,\
    \ and there were visible and measurable signs of stress observed\non the ground,\
    \ such as repressed shot tip growth, leaf water potentials below −1.5 MPa, and\
    \ leaf\nsenescence. Shortly after this stress was accomplished, irrigation recommenced\
    \ at a rate roughly equal\nto a grass reference ET to avoid major negative impacts\
    \ on vine and berry health. The southern blocks\n(blocks 3 and 4) were chosen\
    \ to receive normal deﬁcit irrigation amounts and to experience typical\ntarget\
    \ stress conditions as supported by leaf water potential measurements. Irrigation\
    \ amounts within\nthese blocks were determined through a combination of visual\
    \ and locally-sourced data techniques by\nresident vineyard managers. This experimental\
    \ setup allows comparison between stressed vines and\nirrigated vines following\
    \ common practices, i.e., a business-as-usual approach.\n2.3.2. Thermal-Based\
    \ ETa Estimation\nThroughout the growing season, weekly ETa estimates were delivered\
    \ to the VRDI irrigation\nmanager each Friday morning (product delivery date),\
    \ representing the summation of daily ETa from\nthe prior Friday to Thursday.\
    \ The Thursday end of the weekly compositing interval is hereafter referred\n\
    to as the eﬀective weekly product date.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2124\n6 of 20\n\
    Routine spatial information from satellite remote sensing techniques was used\
    \ to generate daily\n30 m ET estimates over the study domain. Modeled ET estimates\
    \ were updated each Friday during\nthe growing season using the latest available\
    \ satellite imagery and techniques to project forward to\nthe eﬀective product\
    \ date. Weekly sums of ET were then computed and sent to vineyard managers\nfor\
    \ assessment. While the projection technique used to project forward ET data where\
    \ satellite data\nwere absent is standard, quality and responsiveness are strongly\
    \ dependent on the latency of the last\navailable satellite image used.\nThe current\
    \ study utilized the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) surface energy\n\
    balance model [26] and the associated disaggregation algorithm (DisALEXI) [29,30]\
    \ in combination\nwith the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reﬂectance Fusion Model\
    \ (STARFM) [31] to generate high\nspatiotemporal resolution ET time series maps.\
    \ ALEXI is driven by time-diﬀerential land surface\ntemperature (LST) observations\
    \ acquired from geostationary satellites (GOES-East and GOES-West\nImager instruments).\
    \ Daily coarse-scale (4 km) ET ﬂuxes from ALEXI are spatially downscaled\n(DisALEXI)\
    \ to ﬁner scales using higher resolution LST information from polar-orbiting systems\
    \ MODIS\n(1 km) and Landsat (30 m). STARFM then combines the spatial resolution\
    \ of Landsat with the temporal\nfrequency of MODIS to produce the high spatiotemporal\
    \ (30 m, daily) resolution ET time series.\nThe reader is referred to References\
    \ [23,31–33,35,40] for detailed descriptions of the components of\nthis system.\
    \ Previous applications of the DisALEXI and STARFM modeling framework have been\n\
    completed in a retrospective manner; meaning all required datasets are available\
    \ up to and beyond\nthe ﬁnal modeling date. In the current study, the DisALEXI\
    \ and STARFM models were completed\nonce a week, every week, during the growing\
    \ season, requiring address of issues related to latency in\nsatellite retrieved\
    \ datasets.\nAt present, the ALEXI model is run operationally over the continental\
    \ United States (CONUS) at\n4 km resolution using LST retrieved using 11 µm brightness\
    \ temperature observations from the GOES\nsatellites. Raw brightness temperature\
    \ observations are atmospherically corrected using atmospheric\nproﬁles of temperature,\
    \ as outlined in Reference [46]. ALEXI also uses daily 4 km leaf area index (LAI)\n\
    estimates interpolated and aggregated from the 500 m MODIS MCD15A3H 4-day product,\
    \ governing\npartitioning of LST between soil and canopy temperature components.\
    \ These 4-km daily ALEXI\nproducts are generated with a latency of two days.\n\
    In this study, the 4 km ALEXI products were spatially disaggregated with the DisALEXI\
    \ algorithm to\ngenerate moderate (500 m) and high (30 m) resolution maps of ET\
    \ using TIR imagery from MODIS (Terra\nsatellite) and Landsat, respectively. Specifically,\
    \ moderate resolution maps are generated by combining\nmultiple standard MODIS\
    \ products, including instantaneous swath products MOD11_L2 (LST) and\nMOD03 (geolocation).\
    \ Bowtie effects due to off-nadir pixel smearing were reduced by applying the\n\
    DMS procedure [47] using the MODIS 500 m composite MOD13A1 NDVI product [32,39].\
    \ In addition,\nDisALEXI-MODIS used daily LAI maps created using MODIS 4-day composite\
    \ (MCD15A3H, Collection\n6) products and a procedure outlined in Reference [48].\
    \ Composite images are smoothed and gapfilled to\ndaily timesteps using the TIMESAT\
    \ algorithm [49]. Input MODIS albedo maps were generated from the\nMODIS daily\
    \ composite Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) 500-m spatial\
    \ resolution\n(MCD43A3, Collection 6) product. MODIS LAI and albedo products have\
    \ a typical latency of 2–6 or\n9–10 days, respectively. These inputs were held\
    \ constant at values derived from last available images to\nthe date of the most\
    \ recent thermal product (MOD11_L2), which has a current latency of fewer than\n\
    two days, aligning with latency on the ALEXI ET dataset. Therefore, DisALEXI-generated\
    \ moderate\nresolution maps of ET also have an effective two-day latency.\nDisALEXI\
    \ was also used to create high spatial resolution (30 m) maps of ET on Landsat\
    \ 8 overpass\ndates. Landsat thermal band data at a native resolution of 100 m\
    \ were atmospherically corrected\nusing MODTRAN [50] then sharpened to 30 m resolution\
    \ to match Landsat optical bands using the\ndata mining sharpener (DMS) approach\
    \ [47]. In the current study, we used Landsat 8 (L8) tier 1 (T1)\ndata within\
    \ one scene (path 43, row 34). Landsat 7 data were not used in this study due\
    \ to image\ngaps caused by the scan-line corrector failure that occurred in 2013,\
    \ which cross directly through the\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2124\n7 of 20\nvineyard\

    computed once a week. The current study utilizes the modiﬁed Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization\n(FAO-56) [8] method based on satellite-derived vegetation indices\
    \ to derived daily 30 m resolution\nmaps of ETc.\nETc = Kc × ETo\n(1)\nIn Equation\
    \ (1), ETo is a grass reference ET obtained from a local CIMIS (California Irrigation\n\
    Management Information System) weather station. Speciﬁcally, we use the Fresno\
    \ State #80 station\nlocated near Fresno, CA (36.8208, −119.7423). CIMIS was developed\
    \ by the California Department\nof Water Resources (DWR) and the University of\
    \ California, Davis (UC Davis) to assist irrigators in\nmanaging their water resources\
    \ more eﬃciently, with more than 140 automated weather stations located\nthroughout\
    \ California. CIMIS ETo is calculated using a modiﬁed Penman-Monteith equation\
    \ [51] that\nassumes a well-watered grass surface. It also uses a wind function\
    \ developed at UC Davis, and unique\ncloud factor values speciﬁc to each station.\n\
    Here we used a reﬂectance-based estimate of the crop coeﬃcient, Kc, modulated\
    \ by NDVI to\ncapture seasonal variations in biomass and transpiration [52–54]\n\
    Kc = Ko × NDVI,\n(2)\nwhere Ko was determined empirically using ﬂux observations\
    \ collected within the VRDI vineyard and\nETo obtained from the Fresno State CIMIS\
    \ station. Tower ﬂux observations in block 4 were used for this\npurpose as this\
    \ block experienced the least amount of stress under the experimental design.\
    \ Ko was\ncomputed using linear regression between Kc (the ratio of observed closure\
    \ corrected ET, and CIMIS\nderived ETo; Equation (1)) and NDVI values averaged\
    \ over a 3-by-3 pixel area (90 × 90 m) shifted\nnorthwest from the tower center\
    \ to approximate the tower upwind fetch/footprint (see Figure 1) [12].\nAnalysis\
    \ of linear regression forced through the origin reported a correlation coeﬃcient\
    \ of 0.59 and slope\nof 1.19 between NDVI and observed Kc values on Landsat overpass\
    \ dates for block 4. Consequently,\na Ko of 1.2 is used to calculate ETc via Equations\
    \ (1) and (2). This value of Ko yields mid-season Kc\nvalues consistent with FAO-56\
    \ recommendations for wine grapes. Applying Equation (2) on Landsat\noverpass\
    \ dates during the months of July and August resulted in Kc values between 0.78\
    \ and 0.82,\nwhile the FAO-56 mid-season Kc value (Kc-mid), adjusted for semi-arid\
    \ conditions with an average\nwind speed of 3 m s−1, is 0.80. For more information\
    \ into the determination of Kc, the reader is referred\nto References [3,17].\n\
    Equations (1) and (2) are becoming a common and convenient tool in viticulture\
    \ to describe crop\nwater requirements and to deﬁne an additional management factor\
    \ required to reach a target stress\nlevel [3,55]. Its usage in the current study\
    \ is to replicate standard practice through the utilization of\nNDVI from the\
    \ most recent clear Landsat overpass combined with CIMIS ETo measurements. Although\n\
    simple to implement and maintain, this standard practice can introduce errors\
    \ by neglecting changes in\ncanopy biomass that might occur between overpasses.\
    \ These errors are likely to be exacerbated during\nthe period of rapid vine growth\
    \ that typically starts in early May and lasts through June. Furthermore,\nCIMIS\
    \ ETo values are often from stations far removed from the vineyard site. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the Fresno\nState CIMIS station is located roughly 30 km from the vineyard.\
    \ It is also important to note that CIMIS\nstations can and have gone oﬄine mid-season,\
    \ creating a void in ETo data, especially if the next closest\nCIMIS station to\
    \ a vineyard of interest is much further away.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2124\n\

    by Reference [56] for operational ET use. These errors also align with [39,40],\
    \ where results from\na baseline (retrospective) version of the ET fusion model\

    \ total ETa-OP, ETa-retro, ETc and observed weekly total ET for the 2018\ngrowing\

    \ is\nthe daily amount of applied irrigation within each block and daily measurements\
    \ of soil moisture\n(volumetric water content, VWC; top panels) at 30 cm, 60 cm\
    \ and 90 cm depth. Figure 4 highlights\nthe general agreement between modeled\
    \ weekly total ETa and observations and the decline of soil\nwater availability\
    \ during June and July. According to the experimental design, an additional stress\
    \ was\ninduced in the northern blocks (blocks 1 and 2) by withholding irrigation\
    \ during an early portion of\nthe growing season (14th June–23rd July) (Figure\
    \ 4; top panels, yellow transparent rectangle). Blocks\n3 and 4 received more\
    \ uniform irrigation throughout the season, representing “business-as-usual”\n\
    irrigation strategies. As previously mentioned, soil moisture sensors were not\
    \ installed in block 3.\nObserved and modeled weekly total ET estimates are lower\
    \ at blocks 1 and 2 during the early\nportion of the growing season when compared\
    \ to blocks 3 and 4, as expected. This diﬀerence is most\npronounced during the\
    \ months of June and July, as water availability decreased rapidly within the\
    \ soil\ncolumn due to the induced stressed. VWC progressively declined from June\
    \ into July until all depths\nconverged around 0.1 m3 m−3 at blocks 1, 2 and 4.\
    \ Between weeks 19 July and 26 July, ETa-OP weekly\ntotal estimates decreased\
    \ from 45 to 35 mm week−1 at blocks 1 and 2. ETa-retro weekly total estimates\n\
    show a similar magnitude of decline, only two weeks prior. Conversely, ETc estimates\
    \ remain relatively\nunchanged at 40 mm week−1 during the same period. The sharp\
    \ decline in ETa-OP at the end of\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2124\n11 of 20\nJuly\
    \ aligns with observations of vine stress at the northern blocks by vineyard managers.\
    \ However,\nthe early detection in ETa-retro estimates agrees with the increased\
    \ LST apparent in a Landsat scene\non 12 July which was not available until the\
    \ 27 July product delivery date in the operational runs.\nThis may indicate a\
    \ thermal stress signal occurring prior to the manifestation of visible eﬀects.\
    \ This is\ndiscussed in detail below. Following this stress event and the depletion\
    \ of soil water availability,\nirrigation in blocks 1 and 2 was resumed (Figure\

    \ ETc estimates \nremain relatively unchanged at 40 mm week−1 during the same\
    \ period. The sharp decline in ETa-OP \nat the end of July aligns with observations\
    \ of vine stress at the northern blocks by vineyard managers. \nHowever, the early\

    Retrospective spatial analysis over Landsat overpass dates provides clear evidence\
    \ that the\nALEXI/DisALEXI modeling scheme, through the utilization of TIR imagery,\
    \ is capable of detecting\nstress conditions at the ﬁeld scale. Conversely, ETc\
    \ estimates, derived using VNIR imagery, fail to\ncapture the diﬀerences between\
    \ the northern and southern blocks in the vineyard during the period of\nmaximum\
    \ stress. However, in operational applications, satellite data latency may obscure\
    \ or delay\ndetections of rapid stress onset.\nFigure 6 depicts weekly total ET\
    \ estimates derived from the ETa-OP, ETa-retro and ETc daily time\nseries, along\
    \ with the irrigation amounts applied with the VRDI system during each week. The\
    \ date\nlabels indicate the eﬀective weekly product date (e.g., 14 June is the\
    \ weekly total from 8 June to\n14 June). Comparison between ETa-OP and ETa-retro\
    \ provides evidence of issues related to latency\nin satellite data delivery.\
    \ Most notably, indications of diﬀerential stress between north and south\nblocks\
    \ of the vineyard are readily apparent on the 12 July weekly model run for ETa-retro,\
    \ driven\nby the Landsat retrieval on that date (Figure 5). However, the same\
    \ spatial diﬀerentiation between\nnorth and south portions of the vineyard is\
    \ not realized in ETa-OP until the 26 July model run. This is\nbecause the 12\
    \ July Landsat 8 T1 image did not become available until 20 July—an 8-day lag\
    \ between\nimage acquisition and image download. This image was ﬁrst incorporated\
    \ in the July 26 weekly\noperational run. The net eﬀect was an overall two-week\
    \ latency in reported stress over the vineyard\nwhen compared to ETa-retro.\n\
    No considerable diﬀerence between northern and southern blocks is present in the\
    \ weekly\nNDVI-driven ETc data during this period, although vineyard-wide average\
    \ ETc slightly decreased for\nthe 26 July model run when the 12 July Landsat NDVI\
    \ image became available. The 16-day acquisition\ncycle of Landsat 8, combined\
    \ with the 21.6-day latency in T1 product delivery (when measured from\nproduct\
    \ delivery date), was not suﬃcient for timely capture of vegetation response to\
    \ stress onset in\nthis case.\nAdditional evidence for the need for timelier thermal\
    \ image delivery is presented in Figure 7,\nshowing the time variation in absolute\
    \ error (orange triangles) between ETa-OP (average at all blocks)\nand observed\
    \ weekly total ETa (average at all blocks) for each weekly model run. Transparent\
    \ boxes\nindicate the dates when a new Landsat image became available in the operational\
    \ model run. Model\nerrors in ETa-OP generally increase between transparent boxes,\
    \ as the last available Landsat image\nbecomes more out of date. Updating the\
    \ Landsat image (transparent boxes) typically leads to a notable\ndecrease in\

    \ and Data Latency \nAlthough the thermal-based ETa-OP retrievals were successful\
    \ in capturing spatial \nheterogeneity in ETa caused by local stress conditions,\
    \ satellite revisits intervals and latency in data \ndelivery remain an issue\
    \ in an operational setting. Based on flux tower time series, Reference [57] \n\
    suggest a return interval of five days or less is necessary to provide daily ET\
    \ estimates with a relative \nerror lower than 20% even if the retrievals are\
    \ perfect. References [23] and [58] recommend a four-\nday or lower revisit cycle\
    \ for improved temporal sampling to monitor ETa. Meeting these revisit \ntargets\
    \ will require integration of TIR data from multiple satellite platforms, and\
    \ a reduction in data \ndelivery latency must be realized. \nBased on these results\
    \ from 2018, modifications to the ETa data fusion processing stream in \nsupport\
    \ of VRDI are being implemented in the 2019 growing season. Landsat 7 data are\
    \ gapfilled and \ncombined with Landsat 8 to reduce the potential interval for\
    \ an update from 16 to 8 days. In addition, \nthe real-time (RT) L8 thermal band\
    \ products (typically available a few days after acquisition) have \nbeen downloaded\
    \ and compared to the T1 products. The RT products are provisional, generated\
    \ with \nestimated parameters for TIRS scene correction. While this will not always\
    \ be so, the RT products \ncompared well with the T1 products in these cases and\
    \ could be used interchangeably without loss \nof fidelity. \nLandsat 9, projected\
    \ to launch no later than 2020, will follow the Landsat 7 orbit and will be \n\
    capable of delivering corrected thermal products within a few days after acquisition\

    \ after acquisition [59]. NASA’s ECOsystem\nSpaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment\
    \ on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) [60], deployed in July of\n2018, collects multispectral\
    \ thermal infrared data at 70 m resolution with an average revisit time of four\n\
    days, providing a useful testbed for assessing the value of applying high spatiotemporal\
    \ resolution TIR\nimaging. Future applications of the ETa-OP model will incorporate\
    \ these new thermal image sources\nto improve operational capabilities and to\
    \ create a more robust and reliable ETa toolkit for irrigation\nmanagement and\
    \ scheduling.\n4.2. Value of Actual ET for Irrigation Management\nCurrent viticultural\
    \ irrigation practices are based on ETc and locally applied ‘management factors’\n\
    (Ko), which are specific to regions and varieties, and are used to control vegetative\
    \ growth and apply some\nlevel of stress to meet fruit quality and yield targets.\
    \ The ETa-OP model provides an improvement to\nthis approach by measuring actual\
    \ plant water use at sub-field resolutions. Quantifiable and direct water\nuse\
    \ estimates will offer a better way of determining available plant water and can\
    \ act as an important\ncheck on applied irrigation. Also, ETa-OP will be used\
    \ in conjunction with remotely-sensed reference ET\nto provide a spatially varying\
    \ metric of vine stress. The ratio of ETa over reference ET will be used to\n\
    Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 2124\n16 of 20\naccount for changes in atmospheric demand,\
    \ as well as to determine a level of vine water deficit and\ndesired water stress\
    \ levels. Because of its resolution, ETa data would be especially valuable in\
    \ VRDI\nsystems, where irrigation is applied differentially to each irrigation\
    \ zone in order to decrease variability\nin vine vigor, fruit yield and quality.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nIrrigation decision support driven by timely and accurate moderate\
    \ resolution (30 m) satellite\nretrievals of actual ET have the potential for\
    \ reducing water consumption in irrigated vineyards, while\nsimultaneously improving\
    \ yield and grape quality. This study explored the operational capabilities of\n\
    a thermal-based (ETa-OP) ET data fusion model to reliably estimate ETa and determine\
    \ associated\nwater use and stress within a vineyard. Irrigation was withheld\
    \ over the northern half of the vineyard\nto induce stress and to determine whether\
    \ the ET models could detect this stress operationally. Each\nmodel was completed\
    \ once a week, every week, during the growing season and validated against four\n\
    ﬂux tower stations installed within the vineyard.\nResults of the study indicate\
    \ the potential for operational applications of the DisALEXI + STARFM\nfusion\
    \ model (ETa-OP). ETa-OP estimates had an average RMSE and MBE of 0.95 mm day−1\
    \ and\n−0.17 mm day−1, respectively, between blocks. Percent error values were\
    \ less than 20% at all blocks,\ndespite the greater than 4-day thermal image update\
    \ cycle as recommended by Reference [23,58]. Daily\nMAE values were also on par\
    \ with the target error of 0.80 mm day−1 suggested by Reference [56]\nfor operational\
    \ ET uses. Estimates of crop water requirements (ETc) developed from a modiﬁed\n\
    NDVI-based FAO method were unable to capture the rapid decline in vineyard ETa\
    \ over blocks 1 and\n2 during the stress event that took place in late July. In\
    \ contrast, ETa-OP could detect the rapid decline\nin vineyard ETa at both daily\
    \ and weekly time steps; but the response was delayed, due to latencies in\nthe\
    \ availability of key Landsat 8 products.\nSpatial analysis between ETa-OP and\
    \ ETc showed similar results. The ETa-OP model could\ndetect the spatial heterogeneity\
    \ between north and south portions of the vineyard caused by delayed\nirrigation\
    \ and induced stress. ETc estimates, predicated on NDVI imagery for spatial diversity,\
    \ could\nnot. This is likely due to reliance on satellite-derived vegetation indices\
    \ which are slow to respond to\nindicators of stress and are only available on\
    \ Landsat overpass dates. Landsat currently provides global\ncoverage every 16\
    \ days, but depending on cloud coverage, can be much lower. This is insuﬃcient\n\
    to reliably derive ETa information for water resources management, especially\
    \ for a vineyard, where\nvines are typically managed at a semi-stressed state\
    \ during certain phenological stages via deﬁcit\nirrigation, and irrigation amounts\
    \ are speciﬁc to local water use conditions. Also, a delayed or absent\nresponse\
    \ to stress indicates visible/near-infrared approaches may not suﬃce when monitoring\
    \ water\nuse in near-real-time, especially in areas where surface conditions can\
    \ change quickly. Consequently,\nthe use of thermal infrared systems becomes paramount\
    \ in real-time applications of stress detection\nand irrigation scheduling. While\
    \ ETa-OP produces valuable spatial information, latency in current\nsatellite\
    \ data availability, particularly Landsat, impact operational applications over\
    \ the course of\na growing season. Current spaceborne missions are addressing\
    \ this issue, providing the foundation\nfor operational thermal infrared capabilities\
    \ that will support agricultural management services and\nprovide data for operational\
    \ management-appropriate ET estimates.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization:\

    \ As competition for water resources increases\ndue to growth in population, California’s\
    \ tree nut farmers are committed to improving the efﬁciency\nof water used for\
    \ food production. There is an imminent need to have reliable methods that provide\n\
    information about the temporal and spatial variability of crop water requirements,\
    \ which allow\nfarmers to make irrigation decisions at ﬁeld scale. This study\
    \ focuses on estimating the actual\nevapotranspiration and crop coefﬁcients of\
    \ an almond and pistachio orchard located in Central Valley\n(California) during\
    \ an entire growing season by combining a simple crop evapotranspiration model\n\
    with remote sensing data. A dataset of the vegetation index NDVI derived from\
    \ Landsat-8 was used\nto facilitate the estimation of the basal crop coefﬁcient\
    \ (Kcb), or potential crop water use. The soil water\nevaporation coefﬁcient (Ke)\
    \ was measured from microlysimeters. The water stress coefﬁcient (Ks) was\nderived\
    \ from airborne remotely sensed canopy thermal-based methods, using seasonal regressions\n\
    between the crop water stress index (CWSI) and stem water potential (Ψstem). These\
    \ regressions were\nstatistically-signiﬁcant for both crops, indicating clear\
    \ seasonal differences in pistachios, but not in\nalmonds. In almonds, the estimated\
    \ maximum Kcb values ranged between 1.05 to 0.90, while for\npistachios, it ranged\
    \ between 0.89 to 0.80. The model indicated a difference of 97 mm in transpiration\n\
    over the season between both crops. Soil evaporation accounted for an average\
    \ of 16% and 13%\nof the total actual evapotranspiration for almonds and pistachios,\
    \ respectively. Veriﬁcation of the\nmodel-based daily crop evapotranspiration\
    \ estimates was done using eddy-covariance and surface\nrenewal data collected\
    \ in the same orchards, yielding an R2 ≥ 0.7 and average root mean square\nerrors\
    \ (RMSE) of 0.74 and 0.91 mm·day−1 for almond and pistachio, respectively. It\
    \ is concluded\nthat the combination of crop evapotranspiration models with remotely-sensed\
    \ data is helpful for\nupscaling irrigation information from plant to ﬁeld scale\
    \ and thus may be used by farmers for making\nday-to-day irrigation management\
    \ decisions.\nKeywords: remote sensing; evapotranspiration; CWSI; thermal images;\

    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n2 of 22\n1. Introduction\nThe State of California\
    \ (CA) has the greatest production of tree nut crops worldwide. Among\nthem, almond\
    \ acreage is estimated at 940,000 bearing acres and represents a 5.2-billion-dollar\
    \ industry,\nwith around 1 million tons produced in 2016. CA also produces 98%\
    \ of the pistachios in the United\nStates and is the second largest producer worldwide\
    \ with more than 240,000 acres planted producing\nover 0.27 million tons of pistachios\
    \ per year [1,2]. Most of these two nut crops are planted in the\nCentral Valley,\
    \ a region with a hot Mediterranean climate in which agricultural and environmental\n\
    needs, along with the increasing demand of a growing population, to compete for\
    \ their share of the\nlimited water resources.\nAlmonds and pistachios are two\
    \ high-value crops that have a reputation of being drought tolerant,\nproducing\
    \ modest yields with very little water [3,4]. However, irrigation is critical\
    \ in producing high\nyields of top quality nuts [5,6]. Some research studies agreed\
    \ that water productivity in almond and\npistachio is around 2.4 and 3.6 kg·m3,\
    \ respectively [7,8]. To produce just these two crops, California\nneeds around\
    \ 1.7 billion m3 of water per year. Because water resources are becoming scarce\
    \ in CA\nand drought periods trend to be more frequent and of longer duration\
    \ [9], there is an urgent need\nto continue to reduce water use during agricultural\
    \ production. The historic drought from 2012 to\n2016 increased grower awareness\
    \ of efﬁcient water use practices and therefore forced them to put\ninto practice\
    \ irrigation water-saving strategies (e.g., regulated deﬁcit irrigation). However,\
    \ in order\nto determine optimal irrigation scheduling and to adopt such strategies\
    \ efﬁciently, it is necessary to\nhave reliable methods that provide information\
    \ about the temporal and spatial variability of crop\nwater requirements and,\
    \ to understand the seasonal physiological responses to water stress. Therefore,\n\
    the need for developing simple crop evapotranspiration (ET) modeling approaches\
    \ with the inclusion\nof water stress indicators is required to quantify stress\
    \ under deﬁcit irrigation (DI) applications and for\nscheduling irrigation [10].\n\
    Remote sensing data has been widely used in the assessment of crop ET and crop\
    \ water stress\nto obtain spatial information. Reﬂectance-derived vegetation indices\
    \ (VI) such as the normalized\ndifference vegetation index (NDVI), have been empirically\
    \ regressed with basal crop coefﬁcients (Kcb)\nand applied to a reference ET (ETo)\
    \ to estimate crop water use, such as with FAO56 [11,12]. Although\nsimple and\
    \ widely-applied, this method may be too simplistic for crops undergoing deﬁcit-irrigation\n\
    scheduling because it only accounts for the potential evapotranspiration that\
    \ a crop would have with\nno modiﬁcation in stomatal conductance or crop coefﬁcient\
    \ (Kc) due to water stress. In addition, these\ntechniques assume that variations\
    \ in potential crop evapotranspiration (ETc) are linearly related to\ncanopy size,\
    \ and are not sensitive to crop phenology and canopy architecture [13]. Other\
    \ techniques\nare based on combining both thermal and optical data to directly\
    \ obtain actual crop evapotranspiration\n(ETa) through energy balance models [14–16].\
    \ Although these models are able to estimate ETa\nwith ﬁne accuracy, they have\
    \ limitations because they require the retrieval of a large number of\nphysical\
    \ parameters and modeling options. In addition, some of these models, such as\
    \ mapping\nevapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration\
    \ (METRIC) [17] or the simpliﬁed\nsurface energy balance (SEBAL) [18] model are\
    \ sensitive to the deﬁnition of hot (zero transpiration) and\ncold (potential\
    \ transpiration) pixels, which can lead to user subjectivity in deﬁning those\
    \ anchor pixels.\nWhen moderate crop water stress is imposed, ETa drops below\
    \ ETc. Traditionally, the adoption\nof DI strategies have been beneﬁcial for fruit\
    \ and nut tree species to increase water productivity and\nfruit quality [8,19–21].\
    \ DI aims at the partial replacement of water lost to ETc in order to reach speciﬁc\n\
    water deﬁcit thresholds in the soil and plant. However, when dealing with DI in\
    \ commercial orchards,\nimplementing a water deﬁcit based solely on the ETa/ETc\
    \ ratio may contain signiﬁcant errors. These\nerrors are due to (a) possible inaccuracies\
    \ on ETa and ETc estimations, (b) the lack of knowledge on\nthe particular thresholds\
    \ below which there is a reduction of transpiration due to water stress, and (c)\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n3 of 22\nthe difﬁculty of achieving a spatially-homogenous,\
    \ targeted soil, or plant water status across the\norchard [22]. Spatial differences\
    \ in soil type and depth, canopy architecture, and fruit load contribute\nto variations\
    \ in plant water status within the orchard. In addition, the relative insensitivity\
    \ of canopy\nETa to stomatal closure suggests that approaches based on energy\
    \ balance models currently used to\nestimate ETa may fail to detect plant water\
    \ stress [23]. Therefore, a sensitive physiological indicator\nthat integrates\
    \ both soil and climatic conditions, and can quantify the impact of stomatal closure\n\
    on ETa is required in order to determine the inﬂuence of environmental and cultural\
    \ conditions on\nplant water status. For this reason, some researchers argue that\
    \ plant-based approaches, whereby\nplant water status threshold values are imposed,\
    \ are preferable to ET-based approaches. Among\nthem, midday stem water potential\
    \ (Ψstem) has been commonly used as a precise plant water status\nindicator [24–26].\
    \ Nevertheless, due to major inconveniences in measuring Ψstem manually at large\n\
    scales, new approaches based on thermal remote sensing imagery have been successfully\
    \ developed\nto estimate Ψstem in woody crops [27–29]. These approaches regress\
    \ Ψstem with the crop water stress\nindex (CWSI), which is a function of leaf\
    \ temperature and can also be deﬁned as (1 − ETa/ETc) [30,31].\nTherefore, our\
    \ hypothesis is that since Ψstem has been successfully regressed with CWSI in\
    \ many\ndifferent crops, the seasonal regressions of CWSI-Ψstem for almond and\
    \ pistachio trees, obtained from\nairborne thermal imagery, can be used to assess\
    \ a water stress coefﬁcient (Ks) that can be assimilated\ninto an empirically-based\
    \ ET model. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility\n\
    of using this simple ET-based model to estimate ETa of an almond and pistachio\
    \ orchard during an\nentire growing season by combining multispectral and thermal\
    \ remote sensing imagery. Veriﬁcation of\nthe estimates of Kc and ETa will be\
    \ achieved using data obtained with the eddy covariance and surface\nrenewal methods.\n\
    2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Site\nThe study site was located in Madera\
    \ County, Central Valley, California, a few kilometers north of\nthe San Joaquin\
    \ River (36◦49′15.85”N, 120◦12′1.20”W; Figure 1). The climate in the region is\
    \ typically\nMediterranean with average annual high and low temperatures of 24.2\
    \ and 9.2 ◦C, respectively,\nand an average precipitation (1928–2010) of 311 mm\
    \ that falls predominantly during the winter season\n(November–March). In 2016,\
    \ the mean annual temperature, accumulated precipitation and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo) were 16.7 ◦C, 300 and 1357 mm, respectively. Daily maximum solar radiation\n\
    (Rs) in the area was 347 W·m−2 (DOY 187). Soil is classiﬁed as a deep sandy loam\
    \ (6–14% clay,\n67–78% sand), moderate to well drained soils that formed in sandy\
    \ alluvium from dominantly granitic\nrocks [32].\nTwo commercial nut orchards\
    \ were chosen to estimate crop evapotranspiration during the entire\ngrowing season\
    \ by using remote sensing. The ﬁrst, was an 18 year-old, 16-ha commercial almond\n\
    orchard. The orchard was planted with cv. Nonpareil and cv. Carmel, on alternating\
    \ rows with a dense\ncanopy and high coverage. Trees were planted at a spacing\
    \ distance of 5.5 m apart and with 7.3 m\ninter-row. Trees in adjacent rows were\
    \ offset by one half of the spacing distance. The irrigation system\nconsisted\
    \ of a single dripline connected to micro-sprinklers (Fan-Jet, Bowsmith, USA),\
    \ with a 3.5 m\nwetting radius. Each tree was irrigated at a rate of 38–45 L·h−1.\
    \ The second orchard was a 14-year-old,\n16 ha cv. Kerman cultivar pistachio orchard.\
    \ Trees were planted at a spacing distance of 5.2 m apart\nwith 5.8 m driveways\
    \ between tree rows. The irrigation system consisted on two drip lines of eight\n\
    drippers per tree with a discharge rate of 3.8 L·h−1. The amount of irrigation\
    \ water applied in the\nalmond and pistachio orchards during the growing season\
    \ was 898.0 and 762.5 mm, respectively.\nIrrigation in both orchards was scheduled\
    \ following the protocol of the nut company. The almond\norchard was irrigated\
    \ weekly with a timing ranging from 2 (beginning of the season) to 70 hours/week\n\
    (after harvest of cv. Nonpareil). From August through mid-September, the almond\
    \ orchard was dried\nfor periods of 14 days to enable harvest. In pistachio, irrigation\
    \ periods ranged from 5 (beginning of\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n4 of 22\n\
    the season) to 50 hours·week−1 (late July) and the orchard was dried for a period\
    \ of 13 days before\nharvest (early October).\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, x FOR PEER\

    \ campaign days, an additional plot was set up. This additional plot consisted\
    \ of 10 trees (2 \nrows of 5 trees) and irrigation was interrupted a week before\
    \ each image acquisition in order to \nincrease water stress. We also established\
    \ four plots outside of, but in orchards adjacent to, the \nprimary orchard study\
    \ plots; two plots each in younger almond and pistachio orchards that \ncontained\
    \ canopies with a low and medium canopy cover. These adjacent plots were in addition\
    \ to \nthe higher canopy coverage of the primary orchard study plots and allowed\
    \ us to better understand \nthe relationship between the NDVI and canopy light\
    \ interception over a range of canopy sizes. \nThe volume of water applied in\
    \ the orchard was measured daily by installing into the dripline of \neach plot\
    \ a water meter pulse sensor connected to a CR1000 (Campbell Scientific, UT, USA)\
    \ \ndatalogger. Soil water content was determined with a neutron probe (Hydroprobe\
    \ 503DR; CPN \nInternational, Inc., Martinez, CA, USA). In each plot, three boreholes\
    \ perpendicular to the row \ndirection were augured between trees at a distance\
    \ of 0.9 m each to a depth of 3.0 m using a soil hand \nauger (AMS, American Falls,\
    \ ID, USA) and PVC neutron probe access tubes were installed. Readings \nwere\
    \ taken at 0.3 m depth intervals from the soil surface to a depth of 3.0 m, every\
    \ one to two weeks. \nNeutron probe readings for the top 0.9 m, which corresponded\
    \ to the active root zone observed on \nexcavation, were converted to volumetric\
    \ soil water content (θv) using a calibration curve that was \ndetermined in a\

    \ portable plant water \nstatus console; Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara,\

    \ carry out ﬁeld measurements. Each plot contained\nfour rows of six trees, and\
    \ measurements were taken from the four central trees in the two middle rows\n\
    of each plot (Figure 2). All the other trees in the plot were guard trees. During\
    \ the thermal airborne\ncampaign days, an additional plot was set up. This additional\
    \ plot consisted of 10 trees (2 rows of\n5 trees) and irrigation was interrupted\
    \ a week before each image acquisition in order to increase water\nstress. We\
    \ also established four plots outside of, but in orchards adjacent to, the primary\
    \ orchard study\nplots; two plots each in younger almond and pistachio orchards\
    \ that contained canopies with a low\nand medium canopy cover. These adjacent\
    \ plots were in addition to the higher canopy coverage of the\nprimary orchard\
    \ study plots and allowed us to better understand the relationship between the\
    \ NDVI\nand canopy light interception over a range of canopy sizes.\nThe volume\
    \ of water applied in the orchard was measured daily by installing into the dripline\
    \ of\neach plot a water meter pulse sensor connected to a CR1000 (Campbell Scientiﬁc,\
    \ UT, USA) datalogger.\nSoil water content was determined with a neutron probe\
    \ (Hydroprobe 503DR; CPN International, Inc.,\nMartinez, CA, USA). In each plot,\
    \ three boreholes perpendicular to the row direction were augured\nbetween trees\
    \ at a distance of 0.9 m each to a depth of 3.0 m using a soil hand auger (AMS,\
    \ American\nFalls, ID, USA) and PVC neutron probe access tubes were installed.\
    \ Readings were taken at 0.3 m depth\nintervals from the soil surface to a depth\
    \ of 3.0 m, every one to two weeks. Neutron probe readings for\nthe top 0.9 m,\
    \ which corresponded to the active root zone observed on excavation, were converted\
    \ to\nvolumetric soil water content (θv) using a calibration curve that was determined\
    \ in a previous study\nconducted in the same orchards [33].\nMidday stem water\
    \ potential (Ψstem) was measured every one to two weeks during the\ngrowing season\
    \ in both orchards following the protocols described by McCutchan and Shackel\
    \ [34].\nAll measurements were taken within one hour of solar noon, with four\
    \ trees measured in each plot,\nas well as two additional measurements in the\
    \ almond trees where canopy temperature (Tc) was\ncontinuously monitored with\
    \ non-contact thermal infrared radiometers (IRTs) (Apogee Instruments\nInc., Logan,\
    \ USA). During the days of the thermal airborne campaigns, Ψstem was also measured\
    \ in\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n5 of 22\nten trees in the additional water-stressed\
    \ plot. A pressure chamber (3005 series portable plant water\nstatus console;\
    \ Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) was used. Shaded leaves\
    \ were\nwrapped in plastic bags covered with aluminum foil for one hour prior\
    \ to the Ψstem measurement.\nThe fraction of the intercepted PAR (photosynthetically\
    \ active radiation) solar radiation (fIPAR) and\nleaf area index (LAI) were measured\
    \ following identical protocols for both orchards. Measurements\nwere conducted\
    \ at solar noon every two to four weeks throughout the year during the growing\
    \ season\nusing a portable ceptometer (AccuPAR model LP-80, Decagon Devices Inc.,\
    \ Pullman, WA, USA).\nIncident PAR above and below the canopy were measured for\
    \ each tree. The PAR intercepted by the\ncanopy (fIPAR) was calculated dividing\
    \ the averaged below canopy PAR (fIPAR below) by the incident\nPAR taken in full\
    \ sunlight at an open site with no interference from the canopy (fIPAR above).\
    \ Daily fIPAR\n(fIPARd) was calculated by using the hourly model of light interception\
    \ [35]. The parameter of porosity\nof Oyarzun’s model was estimated so that the\
    \ noon fIPAR value of the hourly simulation was equal to\nthat measured in the\
    \ ﬁeld. Tree structural parameters such as tree height, crown width perpendicular\
    \ to\nand along rows, and branch insertion height were also measured. fIPARd was\
    \ calculated by integrating\nthe diurnal course of simulated fIPAR. LAI was also\
    \ obtained from fIPARd, using the approach presented\nby Campbell and Norman [36]\
    \ and setting a leaf absorptivity for light at 0.9.\n2.3. Remote Sensing Data\n\
    A data set consisting of 25 dates of Landsat-8 Level 1 product images for atmospherically-corrected,\n\
    top of the canopy normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) covering both\
    \ orchards was acquired\nfrom the USGS. The study orchards fall on two scenes,\
    \ path/row 42/35 and 43/34, which provided L8\ncoverage four times each month\
    \ for the period February to December 2016. The NDVI for each plot\nand date were\
    \ extracted from each image using the ArcGIS software (version 10.5.1). Then,\
    \ in order to\nremotely estimate fIPARd, the NDVI was regressed against fIPARd\
    \ and LAI measurements. In addition,\nthe NDVI of the adjacent orchards with younger\
    \ trees was also obtained and regressed with in-situ\nmeasurements of fIPARd.\
    \ These regressions were used to estimate the daily fraction of intercepted\n\
    radiation (fIPARd est) over a wider range of canopy closures throughout the growing\
    \ season and used as\ninput to the model.\nThe airborne thermal campaign consisted\
    \ of four ﬂights conducted on 17 May 2016 (DOY 138), 22\nJune 2016 (DOY 174),\
    \ 21 July 2016 (DOY 203) and 11 August 2016 (DOY 224). Image acquisition and\n\
    pre-processing were managed by Ceres Imaging (Oakland, CA, USA; www.ceresimaging.net).\
    \ Images\nwere acquired between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m. (Paciﬁc Time, PST) (GTM-7)\
    \ with the thermal sensor FLIR\nA65 (FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, OR, USA). The\
    \ image resolution is 640 × 512 pixels, with a ﬁeld of\nview (FOV) of 45◦ × 37◦\
    \ using 13 mm lens. Spectral response was in the range of 7.5–13 µm. The spatial\n\
    resolutions differ between ﬂights and pixel size ranged from 0.6 to 1.5 meters,\
    \ due to differences in the\nﬂight altitude between dates, which varied from 500\
    \ to 1000 meters. These differences in pixel size\ndid not affect the extraction\
    \ of pure vegetation pixels, since crown area of both crops was signiﬁcantly\n\
    greater than the pixel size (Figure 2). In-situ temperature was measured for ground-based\
    \ calibration\ntargets with a portable IR-gun (Fluke 572 infrared thermometer,\
    \ Everett, WA, USA). As targets, we\nused black and white 2.4 × 2.4 m painted\
    \ panels and 2.0 × 2.0 m inexpensive textile sheets of cotton.\nIn addition, concurrent\
    \ with image collection, we took temperature measurements of asphalt, concrete,\n\
    bare soil, and a tomato ﬁeld located adjacent to the almond orchard. Image orthorectiﬁcation\
    \ was\ncompleted using ground control points (GCP). The GCP panels were divided\
    \ into quadrants and\npainted black and white in opposite corners. The position\
    \ of the center of each GCP was acquired\nwith a handheld GPS (Global Positioning\
    \ System) (Geo7x, Trimble GeoExplorer series, Sunnyvale, CA,\nUSA) and pixel-based\
    \ geo-rectiﬁcation was done with the software package ENVI 4.7.\nRemote Sens.\

    2.4. Evapotranspiration Measurements \nCrop evapotranspiration was measured with\
    \ an eddy-covariance (EC) and surface renewal (SR) \nsystems. In both orchards,\
    \ the flux towers were located close to the experimental plots and facing \ninto\
    \ the predominant wind direction (west). Both the EC and SR systems were installed\
    \ in the \npistachio orchard, while only a SR was installed in the almond orchard.\
    \ In the pistachio orchard, the \nflux tower included the following instrumentation\
    \ at 6 m over the soil surface: Infrared Gas Analyzer \nIRGA (LI-7500, LI-COR\
    \ Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), three-dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT3, \nCampbell\
    \ Scientific Inc. Logan, UT, USA); a REBS Q7.1 net radiometer (Campbell Sci.,\
    \ Logan, UT, \nUSA); and two FW3 Type-E fine-wire thermocouples (Campbell Sci.,\
    \ Logan, UT, USA). In addition, \nthe ground heat flux was measured using three\
    \ sets of HFP01-SC soil heat flux plates (Campbell Sci., \nLogan, UT, USA) and\
    \ soil temperature averaging sensors (TCAV, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, \n\
    UT, USA). The sensible heat flux (H) was obtained from the 3D sonic anemometer\
    \ on a half-hour \nbasis. Instrumentation in the almond orchard was installed\
    \ at 9 m above the ground and consisted of \nthe following: Kipp & Zonen NR Lite\
    \ 2 net radiometer, two FW3 Type-E fine-wire thermocouples \n(Campbell Sci., Logan,\
    \ UT, USA) and two non-contact SI-121 thermal-infrared radiometer sensors \n(IRTs)\
    \ (Apogee Instruments Inc., Logan, USA). The latter were installed at 1.5 m above\
    \ the canopy of \ntwo almond trees, positioned with a 45˚ angle and ensuring that\
    \ the targeted area was pure canopy \nvegetation. The sensor has a narrow 18˚\
    \ half-angle field of view and a response time of 0.6 seconds. \nWe used the same\
    \ instrumentation as in the pistachio orchard to measure the ground heat flux\
    \ in the \nalmond orchard. \nThe SR is an alternative and inexpensive approach\
    \ to EC for measuring sensible heat flux density \n(H) [37,38]. Although this\
    \ system requires only a fast-response air temperature sensor, it needs to be\
    \ \ncalibrated [37]. The calibration factor alpha is obtained from the slope of\
    \ the regression between a \nstandard H (generally taken as eddy covariance measurements)\
    \ forced through the origin versus \nuncalibrated surface renewal sensible heat\
    \ flux measurements [39]. In this study, the alpha weighting \nfactors (α) were\
    \ obtained from another flux tower installed in an almond orchard located in Belridge\
    \ \n(CA, USA) (35º30’25.47’’N, 119º40’04.99’’W). Almond tree from that orchard\
    \ were of similar age and \nstructural properties as those from our study site,\
    \ and α was obtained from available data of both EC \nand SR [23,40]. Monthly\
    \ averaged data for the period 2008–2011 was used to calibrate the H obtained\
    \ \nfrom the SR system installed in the almond orchard (Table 1). Latent heat\
    \ flux (LE) of both orchards \nwas then estimated as a residual of the energy\
    \ balance (LE=Rn-G-H). The averaged values of H and \nLE were calculated and recorded\
    \ with an output frequency of 30 min and converted to ETa (ETaobs) by \nFigure\

    Crop evapotranspiration was measured with an eddy-covariance (EC) and surface\
    \ renewal (SR)\nsystems. In both orchards, the ﬂux towers were located close to\
    \ the experimental plots and facing into\nthe predominant wind direction (west).\
    \ Both the EC and SR systems were installed in the pistachio\norchard, while only\
    \ a SR was installed in the almond orchard. In the pistachio orchard, the ﬂux\
    \ tower\nincluded the following instrumentation at 6 m over the soil surface:\
    \ Infrared Gas Analyzer IRGA\n(LI-7500, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), three-dimensional\
    \ sonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell\nScientiﬁc Inc. Logan, UT, USA); a REBS Q7.1\
    \ net radiometer (Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA); and two\nFW3 Type-E ﬁne-wire\
    \ thermocouples (Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA). In addition, the ground heat\n\
    ﬂux was measured using three sets of HFP01-SC soil heat ﬂux plates (Campbell Sci.,\
    \ Logan, UT, USA)\nand soil temperature averaging sensors (TCAV, Campbell Scientiﬁc\
    \ Inc., Logan, UT, USA). The sensible\nheat ﬂux (H) was obtained from the 3D sonic\
    \ anemometer on a half-hour basis. Instrumentation in the\nalmond orchard was\
    \ installed at 9 m above the ground and consisted of the following: Kipp & Zonen\n\
    NR Lite 2 net radiometer, two FW3 Type-E ﬁne-wire thermocouples (Campbell Sci.,\
    \ Logan, UT, USA)\nand two non-contact SI-121 thermal-infrared radiometer sensors\
    \ (IRTs) (Apogee Instruments Inc.,\nLogan, USA). The latter were installed at\
    \ 1.5 m above the canopy of two almond trees, positioned with\na 45◦ angle and\
    \ ensuring that the targeted area was pure canopy vegetation. The sensor has a\
    \ narrow\n18◦ half-angle ﬁeld of view and a response time of 0.6 seconds. We used\
    \ the same instrumentation as\nin the pistachio orchard to measure the ground\
    \ heat ﬂux in the almond orchard.\nThe SR is an alternative and inexpensive approach\
    \ to EC for measuring sensible heat ﬂux density\n(H) [37,38]. Although this system\
    \ requires only a fast-response air temperature sensor, it needs to\nbe calibrated\

    \ ﬂux tower installed in an almond orchard located in Belridge\n(CA, USA) (35◦30′25.47”N,\

    \ properties as those from our study site, and α was obtained from available data\
    \ of both\nEC and SR [23,40]. Monthly averaged data for the period 2008–2011 was\
    \ used to calibrate the H\nobtained from the SR system installed in the almond\
    \ orchard (Table 1). Latent heat ﬂux (LE) of both\norchards was then estimated\
    \ as a residual of the energy balance (LE=Rn-G-H). The averaged values\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n7 of 22\nof H and LE were calculated and recorded with\
    \ an output frequency of 30 min and converted to ETa\n(ETaobs) by dividing LE\

    validate the empirically-based ET-model approach developed in this study to estimate\
    \ almond and\npistachio ETa.\nAgrometeorological data was acquired from the CIMIS\
    \ network of weather stations of\nCalifornia [41]. The study site is located between\
    \ two weather stations in the San Joaquin Valley:\nMadera (#188; Lat/Long: 37.02◦N,\
    \ 120.15◦W), and Westlands (#105; Lat/Long: 36.63◦N, 120.38◦W).\nThus, data from\
    \ both stations was averaged to provide the weather input data sets and reference\n\
    ETo. In addition, air temperature (Ta) for each orchard was obtained from the\
    \ FW3 type-E ﬁne-wire\nthermocouples, installed in each ﬂux tower.\nTable 1. Monthly\

    2.5. Estimates of Actual Crop Evapotranspiration (ETa) and Coefﬁcients\nThe actual\
    \ crop evapotranspiration (ETa) was calculated as\nETa = ETo (Kcb Ks + Ke + Kcc)\n\
    (1)\nwhere, Kcb is the basal crop coefﬁcient from the dual crop coefﬁcient approach,\
    \ which essentially\nrepresents transpiration under non-water limited conditions\
    \ [42]; Ks is a water stress coefﬁcient, Ke is\nthe soil water evaporation coefﬁcient,\
    \ and Kcc is the crop cover coefﬁcient. The actual crop coefﬁcient\n(Ka), which\
    \ is considered as the ratio of actual to reference evapotranspiration, was calculated\
    \ as\nKa = Kcb Ks + Ke + Kcc\n(2)\nIt is widely acknowledged that the fraction\
    \ of crop intercepted radiation (fIPAR) is a major\ndeterminant of the basal crop\
    \ coefﬁcient (Kcb) [43,44]. As previously described in Section 2.3, fIPARd was\n\
    derived throughout the growing season by regressing it with the reﬂectance vegetation\
    \ index NDVI,\nwhich was acquired from Landsat-8. Since we could not ﬁnd any study\
    \ that presented the fIPARd-Kcb\nresponse for almonds, it has been assumed in\
    \ this study that this regression is similar to that developed\nfor peach trees,\
    \ another Prunus species [44]. Marsal et al. [44] used Cropsyst to simulate the\
    \ seasonal\npatterns of fIPARd, ETc, Kcb and Ψstem for peach trees; we borrowed\
    \ Equation 4 from Marsal et al. to\nestimate almond Kcb from fIPARd. For pistachio,\
    \ Kcb was empirically derived using the crop coefﬁcients\n(Kc) from Goldhamer\
    \ et al. [45] and deducting the weekly averaged Ke derived in this study. Then,\n\
    to obtain the Kcb as function of fIPARd, we used the relationship between crop\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET)\nwith the percent area shaded by the canopy developed\
    \ by Fereres et al. [46], and assuming that fIR was\nequivalent to shaded proportion.\
    \ An empirical polynomial relationship relating fIPAR with fIPARd was\ndeveloped\
    \ (R2 = 0.57, n = 93) using all measurements conducted in the pistachio plots\
    \ throughout the\ngrowing season (Equation 3).\nfIPARd_pist = −2.981 (fIPAR)2\
    \ + 3.452 (fIPAR) − 0.37\n(3)\nThen, Kcb for both crops was calculated as\nKcb_alm\
    \ = −0.982(fIPARd)2 + 2.559(fIPARd) − 0.474\n(4)\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n\
    8 of 22\nKcb_pist = −0.324 (fIPARd_pist)2 + 1.721(fIPARd_pist) + 0.045\n(5)\n\
    The water stress coefﬁcient (Ks) was retrieved from canopy thermal-based methods.\n\
    The methodology consisted on the seasonal estimation of Ks from measurements of\
    \ Ψstem, which\nwere conducted in each plot every one to two weeks, and using\
    \ the seasonal regressions obtained\nbetween the remotely sensed crop water stress\
    \ index (CWSI) and Ψstem. Then, the Ks was obtained as\nKs = 1 − CWSI\n(6)\nIn\
    \ order to calculate the CWSI for almonds, canopy temperature (Tc) of two almond\
    \ trees was\ncontinuously monitored from mid-April to October 2016 with two infrared\
    \ radiometer (IRT) sensors.\nTc was recorded every minute and stored as 30-min\
    \ averages and these data were used to calculate the\nalmond baseline of the CWSI.\
    \ The empirical CWSI was calculated as [30], which can be represented as\nCWSI\
    \ =\n(Tc − Ta) − (Tc − Ta)LL\n(Tc − Ta)UL − (Tc − Ta)LL\n(7)\nwhere Tc − Ta is\
    \ the difference between canopy and air temperature; (Tc − Ta)LL is the lower\
    \ limit of\n(Tc − Ta) of a canopy which is transpiring at the potential rate,\
    \ and (Tc − Ta)UL the expected differential\nin the case of a non-transpiring\
    \ canopy.\nThe non-water stressed baseline (NWSB) was obtained by regressing half-hourly\
    \ values of\n(Tc − Ta) against vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD) from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m.\
    \ Only data within two days\nafter each irrigation event, which had wind speed\
    \ below 6 m·s−1, were used in the assessment of\nthe NWSB. The (Tc − Ta)LL was\
    \ then obtained taking the minimum values of Tc − Ta for each VPD.\nThe upper\
    \ limit (Tc − Ta)UL was obtained by solving the NWSB regression equation for VPD=0,\
    \ then\ncorrecting for the difference in vapor pressure induced by the difference\
    \ in temperature Tc − Ta.\nAs previously reported by Bellvert et al. [28], a phenological\
    \ response was identiﬁed in the NWSB.\nTherefore, data was separated between early\
    \ phenological stages (from April to beginning of July)\nand late stages (from\
    \ early July to harvest at the end of August). In pistachio, CWSI was calculated\n\
    using the baselines developed by Testi et al. [47]. Air temperature (Ta) was obtained\
    \ from the ﬁne-wire\nthermocouples and relative humidity (RH) was obtained using\
    \ a Watchdog 1000 series micro station\n(Spectrum Technologies, 3600, IL, USA)\
    \ installed in each orchard. On the four dates of the thermal\nairborne campaign,\
    \ the CWSI was then calculated in those trees where Ψstem was measured and the\n\
    regression between both parameters was acquired for each day. Crown-averaged temperatures\
    \ for\neach tree were extracted and converted to CWSI by using image processing\
    \ methods.\nSoil evaporation was measured with simple microlysimeters (ML). ML\
    \ were made by cutting\ncommercial PVC pipe and closing the bottom end with caps.\
    \ These were positioned in a PVC pipe\nouter casing installed into the soil. Dimensions\
    \ of each ML were 0.12 m in height and 0.0974 m\nof internal diameter. Three and\
    \ four ML were installed in the soil wetted area of each plot of the\nalmond and\
    \ pistachio orchard, respectively. In the almond orchard, microlysimeters were\
    \ positioned\nhalf-way between a tree and micro-sprinkler, separated by a distance\
    \ of 0.92 m from each. In the\npistachio orchard, two ML were positioned on either\
    \ side of the middle tree, between drip emitters.\nMeasurements were conducted\
    \ seven times throughout the growing season and each time, the ML\nmeasurements\
    \ were weighted for two to three consecutive days. The procedure consisted on\
    \ removing\nthe ML from the soil taking care to preserve the structure of the\
    \ extracted and remaining soil. Then,\nin order to ensure that only water evaporation\
    \ from the ML was measured, soil clinging from the\nexternal surfaces of the ML\
    \ was removed. Soil evaporation (Esoil) and the soil water evaporation\ncoefﬁcient\
    \ (Ke) were calculated by the relationship\nEsoil = ∆MML\nAML\n× Awet mm·day−1\n\
    (8)\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n9 of 22\nKe = Esoil\nETo\n(9)\nwhere, ∆MML is\
    \ microlysimeter daily variation of mass (grams); AML is microlysimeter surface\
    \ area\nwith a value of 74.55 cm2 (1 mm of evaporation corresponded therefore\
    \ to 0.007455 liters or 7.455 g of\nwater evaporated); Awet is wetted soil area\
    \ (%); and ETo is daily evapotranspiration (mm).\nThe wetted soil area around\
    \ a tree was measured using a measuring tape. The procedure consisted\nof dividing\
    \ the tree spacing area into four quadrants and measuring the percentage of wetted\
    \ area in\neach quadrant. Ke was calculated during the growing season based on\
    \ the number of days after each\nirrigation event. Evaporation after a rainfall\
    \ event was considered in the same way as an irrigation\nevent, but where the\
    \ entire soil surface was completely wetted, Awet was considered equal to the\n\
    spacing per tree.\nThe cover crop coefﬁcient (Kcc) was obtained as\nKcc = CCw\n\
    SD (GC)\n(10)\nwhere, CCw is cover crop width (m), which was measured every two\
    \ to three weeks, SD represents the\nspacing distance, and GC is the percentage\
    \ of green cover, which was estimated visually.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1.\
    \ Stem Water Potential and Volumetric Soil Water Content\nThe seasonal pattern\
    \ of stem water potential (Ψstem) and volumetric soil water content (θv) is\n\
    presented in Figure 3. Before harvest, Ψstem values ranged between −0.8 to −1.6\
    \ MPa and between\n−0.5 to −1.4 MPa for almond and pistachio, respectively (Figure\
    \ 3a). Ψstem of both crops decreased\nthrough the season, reaching minimum values\
    \ at harvest. Minimum Ψstem values for almonds were\n−3.3 MPa, coinciding with\
    \ the end of the drying period. Ψstem of both crops also showed a clear\nresponse\
    \ to θv, yielding coefﬁcients of determination (R2) of 0.89 and 0.74 for almonds\
    \ and pistachios,\nrespectively. Soil texture in both orchards was sandy loam,\
    \ with 19.5% and 10.3% of soil water content\nrespectively at ﬁeld capacity and\
    \ wilting point across the entire soil proﬁle [48]. Similarly to Ψstem,\nθv across\
    \ both sites decreased throughout the season, except for a slight increase in\
    \ the θv just before\nharvest due to an irrigation event, which increased the\
    \ Ψstem values to the same level as those measured\nin pistachios (Figure 3b).\
    \ The θv in the pistachio orchard at the top 0.9 m was slightly higher than in\n\
    the almond orchard throughout the growing season. Therefore, the lower θv in the\
    \ almond orchard\nmay explain, in part, the reason why Ψstem values were lower.\n\

    \ Figure 4b). The little shift in this regression indicated that,\nfor any given\
    \ value of the fIPARd, the NDVI was slightly higher in almonds than in pistachios.\
    \ This\ncan probably be explained by a cover crop or even a leaf angle effect.\
    \ While the pistachio orchard had\nbare soil, most of the almond orchards had\
    \ cover crop (i.e., weeds) between rows, in part, because\nthe almond orchard\
    \ was irrigated by micro-sprinklers, whereas the pistachio orchard was irrigated\n\
    via drip irrigation under the trees. The regression with LAI, however, was non-linear\
    \ and, above LAI\nvalues of ~2, the NDVI tended to saturate and became less sensitive\
    \ to variations in LAI (Figure 4c).\nThis saturation effect has been widely reported\
    \ in many studies.\n3.3. Soil Water Evaporation Coefﬁcient (Ke)\nKe was measured\
    \ from mid-April to mid-August, when tree foliage had reached full development.\n\
    Data showed that Ke was dependent on the irrigation frequency and system. In both\
    \ orchards, irrigation\nwas scheduled on a weekly basis and particularly during\
    \ the summer, with long irrigation events\nranging from 24 to 36 consecutive hours.\
    \ Therefore, Ke declines daily following each irrigation event\n(Figure 5). On\
    \ the same day of an irrigation event, Ke corresponded to maximum values of 0.24\
    \ and\n0.18 for almond and pistachio, respectively. The shifting of soil evaporation\
    \ between both orchards\nwas explained by the irrigation system. The micro-sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system installed in the almond\norchard corresponded with a higher\
    \ wetted soil surface, and consequently, a higher soil evaporation\nRemote Sens.\

    \ the pistachio orchard. Comparing the accumulated\nsoil evaporation on a weekly\
    \ basis, it was estimated that the pistachio orchard evaporated up to 35%\nless\
    \ than the almond orchard. Some studies have found that Esoil in a drip-irrigated\
    \ almond orchard\n(canopy cover (CC) = 63%, irrigation at full replacement of\
    \ ET) accounted for 23.6% of ETc, on average,\nduring the growing season [54].\
    \ On the other hand, Iniesta et al. [55] reported Esoil losses that amounted\n\
    to 30% of seasonal ETc for fully-irrigated pistachios (CC = 57%) with a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system. In our\nstudy, Esoil for the growing season accounted for an average\
    \ of 16.1 and 13.1% of ETa for almonds and\npistachios, respectively (Table 2).\
    \ Overall, Esoil depends on the type of irrigation system, irrigation\nfrequency,\
    \ fraction of radiation reaching the soil surface, atmospheric evaporative demand\
    \ (ETo) and\nsoil inﬁltration rate [56]. Therefore, variations in reported Esoil\
    \ values can be explained by variations in\nthese parameters. For instance, dissimilarities\
    \ in Esoil comparing our almond orchard and results of\nthe pistachio orchard\
    \ reported by Iniesta et al. [55] might be explained by differences in canopy\
    \ cover.\nBoth orchards were irrigated with a micro-sprinkler system, but the\
    \ almond average canopy cover\n(~85%) was higher than the pistachios, reducing\
    \ therefore the amount of radiation reaching the soil\nsurface, and thus Esoil.\n\
    \ \np\np\nq\ny\ny\norchards, irrigation was scheduled on a weekly basis and particularly\
    \ during the summer, with long \nirrigation events ranging from 24 to 36 consecutive\
    \ hours. Therefore, Ke declines daily following each \nirrigation event (Figure\
    \ 5). On the same day of an irrigation event, Ke corresponded to maximum \nvalues\
    \ of 0.24 and 0.18 for almond and pistachio, respectively. The shifting of soil\
    \ evaporation \nbetween both orchards was explained by the irrigation system.\
    \ The micro-sprinkler irrigation system \ninstalled in the almond orchard corresponded\
    \ with a higher wetted soil surface, and consequently, a \nhigher soil evaporation\
    \ rate in comparison to the drip irrigation system in the pistachio orchard. \n\
    Comparing the accumulated soil evaporation on a weekly basis, it was estimated\
    \ that the pistachio \norchard evaporated up to 35% less than the almond orchard.\
    \ Some studies have found that Esoil in a \ndrip-irrigated almond orchard (canopy\
    \ cover (CC) = 63%, irrigation at full replacement of ET) \naccounted for 23.6%\
    \ of ETc, on average, during the growing season [54]. On the other hand, Iniesta\
    \ et \nal. [55] reported Esoil losses that amounted to 30% of seasonal ETc for\
    \ fully-irrigated pistachios (CC = \n57%) with a micro-sprinkler system. In our\
    \ study, Esoil for the growing season accounted for an \naverage of 16.1 and 13.1%\
    \ of ETa for almonds and pistachios, respectively (Table 2). Overall, Esoil \n\
    depends on the type of irrigation system, irrigation frequency, fraction of radiation\
    \ reaching the soil \nsurface, atmospheric evaporative demand (ETo) and soil infiltration\
    \ rate [56]. Therefore, variations in \nreported Esoil values can be explained\
    \ by variations in these parameters. For instance, dissimilarities \nin Esoil\
    \ comparing our almond orchard and results of the pistachio orchard reported by\
    \ Iniesta et al. \n[55] might be explained by differences in canopy cover. Both\
    \ orchards were irrigated with a micro-\nsprinkler system, but the almond average\
    \ canopy cover (~85%) was higher than the pistachios, \nreducing therefore the\
    \ amount of radiation reaching the soil surface, and thus Esoil. \n \nFigure 5.\

    \ related to a seasonal decrease in transpiration rate, controlled by \nstomatal\
    \ closure, and associated with changes in the hormonal balance, leaf aging or\
    \ the loss of leaf \nhydraulic functioning [58–60]. Espadafor et al. [59] showed\
    \ a slight drop in the ratio between daily \ntranspiration and fraction of intercepted\

    \ \nprobably decreased the transpiration rate of the tree. A decrease in the gas\
    \ exchange rate in fully-\nirrigated almonds during kernel-filling stage was also\
    \ reported in different studies [54,61]. It seems, \ntherefore, that the stomatal\
    \ response can be dependent on the phenological stage, and that the kernel-\n\
    filling stage typically follows a more conservative strategy, which avoids high\
    \ water loss due to \npartial stomatal closure [62]. Nevertheless, more studies\

    \ Nevertheless, more studies are necessary to get better understanding of\nthe\

    \ the period mid-June to the end of September: Tc − Ta= −1.33VPD + 2.44. Therefore,\n\
    in contrast to the seasonal response detected in the almond NWSB’s, a single baseline\
    \ was used in\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n13 of 22\npistachio throughout the\
    \ season, which had an y-intercept in between those seasonal relationships\ndeveloped\
    \ for almonds in this study.\nThe seasonal pattern of the CWSI, which was calculated\
    \ using Tc from the two IRTs installed\non the almond trees, can be observed in\
    \ Figure 7. CWSI ranged from zero to one throughout the\ngrowing season, with\
    \ sharp peaks before irrigation events and dropping close to zero once irrigation\n\
    was applied. The sandy loam soils of this orchard have little capacity to retain\
    \ water, thus the low\nfrequency of irrigation events caused large oscillations\
    \ of water status within a week. At the beginning\nof the season, CWSI was unreasonably\
    \ high for some speciﬁc days and there were large differences\nbetween both IRTs.\
    \ On those days, VPD was low, and because under these circumstances the difference\n\
    between (Tc − Ta)UL and (Tc − Ta)LL is very small, the signal-to-noise ratio to\
    \ calculate CWSI is small,\nso CWSI at these times may contain signiﬁcant sources\
    \ of error. The CWSI reached maximum values in\nmid-July, when the atmospheric\
    \ demand was high and for a few weeks, the amount of water applied\nwas not enough\
    \ to supply all crop water demand. Also, during the drying period prior to harvest,\n\
    irrigation was intentionally cut off for 14 days and CWSI peaked at a maximum\
    \ value of 0.8. Upon the\nresumption of irrigation during the post-harvest stage,\

    \ 224).\nIn contrast, the pistachio regressions between CWSI and Ψstem followed\
    \ a curvilinear response\n(Figure 8b). R2 ranged from 0.61 to 0.77 and clear seasonal\
    \ differences were detected in the CWSI-Ψstem\nregressions, which might probably\
    \ be explained by hydraulic conductance and leaf osmotic potential\nchanges [67–70].\
    \ As this crop developed, a given value of CWSI corresponded to more negative\n\
    Ψstem values. The ﬂight conducted in DOY 138 showed the highest Ψstem values,\
    \ indicating, at that\nperiod, a low osmotic adjustment for recently expanded\
    \ leaves. The Ψstem required to close stomata\n(−1.73 MPa) was also higher than\
    \ in later stages. On the other hand, a completely different response\nwas detected\
    \ for the other three image acquisition dates (DOY 174, 203, and 224), characterized\n\
    by a more anisohydric behavior, due to a lower efﬁciency at controlling Ψstem\
    \ through stomatal\nclosure. The estimated minimum Ψstem at which stomatal conductance\
    \ (gs) approached or equaled\nzero (CWSI = 1) were −3.40, −4.60 and −5.00 MPa,\
    \ respectively for DOY 174, 203, and 224. In this\nrespect, these values were\
    \ similar to those reported by Behboudian et al. [71], who also established\n\
    that when Ψleaf reached extremely low values of −5.0 to −6.0 MPa, leaves were\
    \ still able to continue\nphotosynthetic activity. Germana [72] reported the outstanding\
    \ capacity of pistachio trees for leaf\nthermoregulation and signiﬁcant transpiration\
    \ of water at higher levels of water stress. Other studies\nhave also described\
    \ a seasonal stomatal response in pistachio trees, where at the shell hardening\
    \ stage,\nthe stomatal opening is substantial and prolonged during the day, and\
    \ a more conservative strategy\nlater in the season which reduces water loss due\
    \ to partial stomatal closure during the kernel ﬁlling\nstage [62]. Similarly,\
    \ Gijón et al. [73] indicated a higher degree of osmotic adjustment during the\
    \ shell\nhardening stage, suggesting that some physiological changes are occurring\
    \ at that stage. These trends\ncould not be conﬁrmed with our data, where the\
    \ CWSI-Ψstem regressions at shell hardening (DOY 174)\nand kernel ﬁlling (DOY\
    \ 203 and 224) had similar slopes and different y-intercepts.\nRemote Sens. 2018,\

    \ actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) water consumption during the growing\n\
    season, from DOY 61 to DOY 335, was 1194.9 and 1021.5 mm for almond and pistachio,\
    \ respectively\n(Table 2); the cumulative ETo and rainfall were 1242 and 156.2\
    \ mm for the same period. The difference\nbetween water used through evapotranspiration\
    \ and that applied through irrigation and rainfall\naccounted for 140.7 and 102.8\
    \ mm for almond and pistachio, respectively. This corresponded to the\naveraged\
    \ amount of water stored in a sandy loam soil for all of the growing season. As\
    \ previously\nmentioned, the amount of water loss due to soil evaporation (Esoil)\
    \ accounted for 16.1% and 13.1%\nfor almond and pistachio, respectively. On the\
    \ other hand, the water consumption coming from\nvegetation ground cover (CC)\
    \ was almost negligible, being 2.20% and 0.84% of total ETa for almond\nand pistachio,\
    \ respectively.\nThe seasonal trend of both modelled and observed (ﬂux tower data)\
    \ actual crop\nevapotranspiration (ETamodel, ETaobs) is shown for the almond (Figure\
    \ 9a) and pistachio (Figure 10a)\norchards. In almonds, crop evapotranspiration\
    \ increased sharply from early March to mid-July,\nwhen maximum values of ~8.5\
    \ mm·day−1 were achieved. After mid-July, ETamodel, ETaobs, and\nETo dropped progressively\
    \ until the end of the season. The decrease in ETa starting on DOY 226\ncorresponded\
    \ with the drying period at harvest. During that period, transpiration declined\
    \ to\nminimum values of 2.2 mm day−1 when the cv. Nonpareil and cv. Carmel were\
    \ harvested, which\ncorresponded to a measured Ψstem of −3.3 MPa. Although both\
    \ ETamodel and ETaobs dropped during\nperiods of low Ψstem, values of modelled\
    \ ET (ETamodel) were lower than ETaobs. This phenomenon was\nobserved to occur\
    \ several times throughout the growing season (i.e., DOY 99, 100, 126, 162, 172,\
    \ 193,\n205, and 220), suggesting that either the model exaggerates water stress,\
    \ or that it may be difﬁcult to\nquantify water stress in almond using energy\
    \ balance techniques. Spinelli et al. [23] suggested a similar\nconclusion. They\
    \ argued that the unresponsiveness of LE to reductions in canopy conductance during\n\
    periods of low Ψstem could be due to the inﬂuence of aerodynamic conductance (ga)\
    \ [74], as well as\nthe overriding contribution of LE coming from shaded leaves\
    \ within a canopy, which respond less\ndramatically to water stress. The same\
    \ study also indicated that because the response of LE to gs\ndepends on ga, stress-related\
    \ reductions in ET are more likely on a high wind speed day (high ga),\nthan during\
    \ a low ga (calm) day. Although these hypotheses may offer potential insights,\
    \ this aspect\ndeserves more attention in further studies. Moreover, this singularity\
    \ was not seen in pistachios,\nthough unfortunately we did not have the ﬂux data\
    \ needed throughout the growing season to conﬁrm\nit, particularly during the\
    \ drying harvest period. Crop evapotranspiration in pistachios followed\nthe same\
    \ trend as almonds, but ETa was slightly lower (Figure 10a). Maximum values reached\
    \ to\n~7.5 mm·day−1 (DOY 179).\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 2001\n16 of 22\nRemote\

    status of an entire orchard, we have shown that thermal-based remote sensing can\
    \ be successfully used\nto determine the water stress coefﬁcient (Ks). The CWSI-Ψstem\
    \ relationship (where Ks = 1 − CWSI)\nshowed a temporally-variable seasonal response\

    \ of water resources is one of the major methods of water conservation.\nThere\
    \ are signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the irrigation needs of diﬀerent agricultural ﬁelds\
    \ because of their\nspatial variability. Therefore, a decision support system\
    \ for variable rate irrigation (DSS-VRI) by\ncenter pivot was developed. This\
    \ system can process multi-spectral images taken by unmanned\naerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) and obtain the vegetation index (VI). The crop evapotranspiration model\n\
    (ETc) and crop water stress index (CWSI) were obtained from their established\
    \ relationships with the\nVIs. The inputs to the fuzzy inference system were constituted\
    \ with ETc, CWSI and precipitation.\nTo provide guidance for users, the duty-cycle\
    \ control map was outputted using ambiguity resolution.\nThe control command contained\
    \ in the map adjusted the duty cycle of the solenoid valve, and then\nchanged\
    \ the irrigation amount. A water stress experiment was designed to verify the\
    \ rationality of\nthe DSS-VRI. The results showed that the more severe water stress\
    \ is, the more irrigation is obtained,\nconsistent with the expected results.\
    \ Meanwhile, a user-friendly software interface was developed to\nimplement the\
    \ DSS-VRI function.\nKeywords: decision support system (DSS); variable rate irrigation\
    \ (VRI); fuzzy logic system; UAV\nmulti-spectral image; duty-cycle control map\n\
    1. Introduction\nChina is a country with a water shortage, especially in its northwest\
    \ regions. The shortage of\nwater resources restricts agricultural development\
    \ in many provinces, while the need for food has\ndramatically increased with\
    \ the growth of the population. Agriculture is facing more serious challenges\n\
    and requires eﬀective ways for water-saving irrigation. Variable rate irrigation\
    \ (VRI) is distinguished\nfrom traditional precision irrigation and provides such\
    \ a solution. Previous VRI research has focused\non quantitative decision-making\
    \ models, partition management, decision support systems (DSS) and\nvariable outputs\
    \ [1]. There among, the quantitative decision-making model and partition management\n\
    are key parts of VRI, variable output plays the role of executor, and DSS connected\
    \ all parts of VRI.\nThe DSS has been discussed as a popular topic in the VRI\
    \ system. Navarro [2] developed\na DSS for estimating weekly irrigation needs\
    \ on the basis of soil measurements and climatic variables\nwhich were gathered\

    \ eﬃciency of irrigation\nwater usage (http://mz.agroclimate.org/) with its irrigation\
    \ decision made on the basis of daily crop\nevapotranspiration calculated by the\
    \ Hargreaves equation and crop coeﬃcients [5]. Most DSSs are\ngenerally designed\
    \ for speciﬁc crops or farmlands; it is diﬃcult to apply them in other crops or\
    \ the\nsame crop planted in diﬀerent districts. In view of this, Yang [6] developed\
    \ a decision support system\nfor ﬂexible irrigation scheduling (DSS-FIS), in which\
    \ users can modify its input parameters through\na software interface to adapt\
    \ it to various environments.\nThe use of DSSs for irrigation ties in implementing\
    \ a reliable decision method and using decision\ndata sources. Weather forecast\
    \ information can be a way to estimate the water requirements of the\ncrops [7].\
    \ However, this method is unilateral, since it ignores the impact of crop characteristics\
    \ and\nspatial variability. Some studies have used sensors and the global positioning\
    \ system (GPS) to collect\ninformation about speciﬁc soil and plant conditions\
    \ for irrigation scheduling. Sui [8] built a wireless\nsensor network to monitor\
    \ soil water content and collect weather data. O’Shaughnessy [9] used\ninfrared\
    \ temperature (IRT) sensor nodes mounted on masts at the edge of each concentric\
    \ treatment\narea to measure crop canopy temperature. Morari [10] used time domain\
    \ transmissometry (TDT)\nsensors to measure soil moisture content. Since these\
    \ sensors are immobile, the irrigation decision\naccuracy depends on the number\
    \ of sensors in the large-scale planting area or on the truss of the\nsprinkle\
    \ irrigation machine, and large-scale deployment of these sensors is not economical\
    \ for a moving\nsprinkler irrigation system. Also, the sensors mounted in the\
    \ ﬁeld are harmful to the farmland\nsoil ecosystem.\nIn recent years, irrigation\
    \ scheduling could be obtained from some schemes based on various\nremote sensing\
    \ imagery platforms. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of good real-time\n\
    performance and wide coverage on cropland, and makes up for the defects of immobile\
    \ sensors.\nThe development of aerospace technology makes it possible for irrigation\
    \ scheduling to use remote\nsensing imagery platforms, with unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) and satellites as common tools.\nHowever, satellites can be inhibited\
    \ by clouds and/or may not be in orbital position during crop\ndevelopment stages\
    \ [11]. Zhang [12] suggested that canopy temperature from UAV thermal infrared\n\
    images could be a way to evaluate the crop water stress state. The thermal infrared\
    \ sensors currently\nmounted are mostly lightweight and uncooled thermal infrared\
    \ cameras. Compared to multispectral\nremote-sensing systems, thermal imagery\
    \ has the advantage of higher reliability, but the multispectral\nremote-sensing\
    \ system has better performance in terms of information acquisition stability\
    \ and mosaic\ntechnology maturity. Meanwhile, canopy temperature measured by thermal\
    \ infrared camera is easily\naﬀected by air temperature and human activity [13].\
    \ Recently, many studies use UAV spectral images\nto mark crop water status through\
    \ the optimization of the vegetation index (VI) and crop water stress\nindex (CWSI)\
    \ model [14]. The VI-CWSI model, as the main index of the DSS, is usually used\
    \ as\nevidence for irrigation dispatching. Zhang [15] used high-resolution UAV\
    \ multispectral imagery to\nmap maize water stress status. The crop evapotranspiration\
    \ model (ETc) is also used as evidence for\nirrigation dispatching. Calera [16]\
    \ reviewed the crop evapotranspiration model (ETc) on optical remote\nsensing\
    \ for the assessment of crop water requirements, and demonstrated that ET can\
    \ be a reliable\nindicator for irrigation assessment. This approach is based on\
    \ the Food and Agriculture Organization’s\n(FAO) method for estimating crop evapotranspiration,\
    \ in which reference evapotranspiration values\nare multiplied by crop coeﬃcients\
    \ (Kc).\nThe coeﬃcient may be derived from multispectral VI.\nSome approaches\
    \ have employed signals in the thermal band obtained from remote sensors as inputs\n\
    for energy balance equations that are solved to estimate ETc [17]. The multispectral\
    \ VI approach for\nestimating crop evapotranspiration requires fewer inputs and\
    \ theoretical background knowledge,\nand is thus simpler than the energy balance\
    \ equations approach. In this paper, multispectral VIs were\nused to calculate\
    \ crop coeﬃcients.\nWater stressed crops manifest symptoms such as leaf wilting,\
    \ stunted growth, and leaf area\nreduction [18]. VI can be used to monitor surface\
    \ vegetation conditions. The structure indices\nbased on visible, near infrared\
    \ and red-edge bands are more widely used, such as the normalized\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 2880\n3 of 15\ndiﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (SAVI), enhanced vegetation index\n(EVI), simple ratio (SR) and green\
    \ normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (GNDVI), and visible\natmospherically\
    \ resistant index (VARI). The NDVI is the most often used, partly due to its “ratio”\n\
    properties, which enable the NDVI to cancel out a large proportion of the noise\
    \ caused by changing\nsun angles, topography, clouds or shadow, and atmospheric\
    \ conditions [19]. The SAVI was established\nto improve the sensitivity of the\
    \ NDVI to soil backgrounds [14]. The EVI has thus been considered\na modiﬁed NDVI\
    \ with improved sensitivity to high biomass regions and improved vegetation\n\
    monitoring capability through a de-coupling of the canopy background signal and\
    \ a reduction in\natmospheric inﬂuences [19]. The SR can monitor changes in vegetation\
    \ cover and works best when\nvegetation is densely covered [20]. The GNDVI is\
    \ sensitive to crop pigment changes [21]. The VARI can\nreduce the eﬀects of illumination\
    \ and atmospheric conditions [22]. This paper measured reﬂectance\nindices within\
    \ multispectral ranges (NDVI, SAVI, EVI, SR, GNDVI, VARI) to indicate canopy changes\n\
    due to water stress.\nThe DSS has been used in many cases. The constraints of\
    \ some kinds of DSSs widely used\nin agricultural applications have not been eliminated.\
    \ Firstly, the output of the DSS is the input\ninformation of the control system.\
    \ The actual amount of irrigation is based on the crop’s water\nrequirement, which\
    \ is not the only factor in practical irrigation scheduling. The DSS should be\n\
    combined with a VRI control system. Common methods of control systems include\
    \ zone control and\nspeed control [23]. Speed control varies the moving speed\
    \ of the center pivot to accomplish the desired\nirrigation depth, while the duty-cycle\
    \ control changes the on-oﬀ time of individual sprinklers or groups\nof sprinklers\
    \ to achieve the desired irrigation depth. Generally, the VRI control system provides\n\
    opportunities to apply water to management zones by diﬀerent moving rates or diﬀerent\
    \ solenoid\nvalve duty-cycles. Secondly, the CWSI/Kc inversion model (VI-Kc/VI-CWSI)\
    \ is built for speciﬁc districts\nand crops. Diﬀerent crops have diﬀerent optimization\
    \ VI-Kc/VI-CWSI model [24,25]. Diﬀerent districts\nwith the same crop also have\
    \ diﬀerent VI-Kc/VI-CWSI [26]. The DSS based on the ﬁxed model is\nunsuitable\
    \ for other applications. Third, the irrigation amount is the result of a multifactorial\
    \ decision.\nActually, precise measurement of the irrigation requirement is complicated,\
    \ whose implementation\nneeds a lot of funds and time.\nThe concept of a fuzzy\
    \ system has been used for a realistic decision support model. For the\nirrigation\
    \ mission, the interaction between the crop water requirement and irrigation amount\
    \ is not\nalways accurately deﬁned. Therefore, the fuzzy model can be a viable\
    \ alternative [27]. The fuzzy\nsystem has the characteristics of simple rules\
    \ and wide applicability [28], and can analyze the inaccurate\ninformation and\
    \ receive irrigation guidance from complex farming sites [29]. So it is easier\
    \ for users to\naccept DSSs based on fuzzy logic.\nThis study developed a DSS\
    \ for variable rate irrigation (DSS-VRI) that serviced a center-pivot\nirrigation\
    \ system. The function of the DSS integrated image processing and data analysis\
    \ for UAV\nremote sensing. By using the DSS, users can easily process the image\
    \ and obtain a duty-cycle control\nmap of variable irrigation. The speciﬁc objectives\
    \ of this research were:\n(i) To develop a widely applicable DSS-VRI, which mainly\
    \ embodies the user to change some\nconditional parameters and to construct a\
    \ partial decision model to work in diﬀerent cases.\n(ii) To achieve expected\
    \ irrigation amounts in diﬀerent management areas, by using the duty-cycle\ncontrol\
    \ map generated from the DSS-VRI, which combines the UAV multispectral remote\
    \ sensing\nsystem and fuzzy inference system.\n2. System Description and Operation\n\

    \ function, bell function, Sigmoid function and Z-type\nfunction [32]. This study\
    \ chose the triangular function and ladder function, because the two functions\n\
    were simple to use and calculate. Fuzzy inputs were ETc, CWSI, precipitation.\
    \ Fuzzy output was the\nsolenoid valve duty-cycle, which was obtained by defuzziﬁcation.\
    \ In this study, the defuzziﬁcation\nmethod was centroid.\nFuzzy inputs were deﬁned\
    \ as three linguistic variables and fuzzy outputs were deﬁned as ﬁve\nlinguistic\
    \ variables: very low (ML), low (L), normal (N), high (H), and very high (MH).\
    \ According\nSensors 2019, 19, 2880\n7 of 15\nto the basic knowledge of irrigation,\
    \ 27 fuzzy rules were set for the duty-cycle of the solenoid valve\n(Table 2).\n\

    (ETc==Low) & (Precipitation==Low) & (CWSI==F) => (Duty-cycle=ML)\n2\n(ETc==Low)\
    \ & (Precipitation==Low) & (CWSI==S) => (Duty-cycle=N)\n3\n(ETc==Low) & (Precipitation==Low)\

    \ => (Duty-cycle=L)\n27\n(ETc==High) & (Precipitation==High) & (CWSI==ES) => (Duty-cycle=N)\n\
    Note: “Low” is interpreted as less rainfall or evapotranspiration in the coming\
    \ week, “average” and “Normal” as\nnormal rainfall and evapotranspiration in the\
    \ next week, “High” as rainy or high evapotranspiration in the coming\nweek, F\
    \ as crop water stress in the current state. S as mild water stress, and ES as\
    \ most severe stress.\nThese rules were represented with logical operator ‘&’.\
    \ For example, the ﬁrst rule is expressed as\n‘(ETc==Low) & (Precipitation==Low)\
    \ & (CWSI==F)=>(Duty-cycle=ML)’, and is interpreted as less\nrainfall and less\
    \ evapotranspiration in the coming week, low crop water stress in the current\
    \ state,\nso implies lower duty cycle. The duty cycle is the ratio of the ‘on’\
    \ time to the ‘on-oﬀ’ period. Lower\nduty cycles represent lower amounts of water\
    \ application.\n2.3. DSS-VRI Software Design and Operation\nA software was designed\
    \ to implement the proposed methodology. The application system was\nprogrammed\
    \ in Python (python 3.6.2). The DSS-VRI software generally needs about ﬁve minutes\n\
    to get duty-cycle control map, depending on the input data scale. The user interface\
    \ was designed\nand organized into several frames. Figure 4a gives the data input\
    \ interface, which allow the users\nto input multispectral image and to set some\
    \ basic parameters, including geographic coordinates\nand Moving rate of sprinkler\
    \ irrigation machine, parameters of zone management, application depth\nunder\
    \ the 100% moving rate, saving path of duty-cycle control command. Among all parameters,\n\
    geographic coordinates can be used to ﬁnd the center position of the machine in\
    \ remote sensing image.\nZone management parameters are used to set the number\
    \ of electromagnetic valve groups and the\ndistance between the sprinkler center\
    \ and each management group boundary. Moving speed is related\nto the maximum\
    \ crop water requirement. The relationship can be expressed as ‘the more crop\
    \ water\nis required, the slower the speed is’. After all parameter values are\
    \ entered, the user can click the\n“Update” button to get band information and\
    \ header ﬁle of the image. The interface for calculation of\nCWSI, ETc and precipitation\
    \ is shown in Figure 4b. Users can select the VI-Kc model and VI-CWSI\nmodel,\
    \ and enter weather forecast data of the next week to calculate ET0 and rainfall.\
    \ Figure 4c shows\nthe irrigation duty-cycle control map and NDVI map interface.\
    \ Users click the “Irrigation map” and\n“Spectral map” button to get a variable\
    \ irrigation duty-cycle control map and a NDVI map, respectively.\nThe NDVI map\
    \ has the information interaction function, which can display VIs and ETc of the\
    \ mouse\nlocation. Figure 4d shows the local data analysis interface, which can\
    \ assist users to observe local\nvariation of VI by using 3D-bar plot. Figure\
    \ 4d presents NDVI examples, including the coordinates,\nNDVI value and spatial\
    \ distribution. Users click the “User manual” button to get help page and\n“Control\
    \ system” to open control system software. In addition, the help page of the DSS-VRI\
    \ can guide\nusers to learn about the system’s structure and function descriptions.\n\

    \ was obtained through the fuzzy inference system. To \nour best knowledge, there\
    \ is no similar study reported in the previous literature. Fuzzy logic is the\
    \ \ncore of DSS-VRI. The crop water evapotranspiration model (ETc), precipitation,\
    \ and the real-time \ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used as an effective\
    \ basis for irrigation management, and they \nare inputs to the fuzzy inference\
    \ system. The water supply changes along with the duty cycle when \nthe moving\
    \ rate is fixed, so the duty cycle can be used as the output of the fuzzy inference\
    \ system. A \nuser-friendly software interface has been developed to implement\
    \ the DSS-VRI function. The DSS-\nVRI output was verified through experiments\
    \ with realistic irrigation consistent with the model’s \nexpected results. \n\
    The DSS-VRI was successful in providing a duty-cycle control map for a central\
    \ pivot variable \nrate irrigation system. According to the shape of the management\
    \ area, the DSS-VRI can also be used \nfor other irrigation systems. For example,\
    \ for a laterally moving sprinkler system, the DSS-VRI can \nprocess remote sensing\
    \ data through establishing a two-dimensional coordinate system, and obtain \n\

    \ surface temperature (LST) is a fundamental parameter within the system of the\
    \ Earth’s\nsurface and atmosphere, which can be used to describe the inherent\
    \ physical processes of energy and\nwater exchange. The need for LST has been\
    \ increasingly recognised in agriculture, as it affects the\ngrowth phases of\
    \ crops and crop yields. However, challenges in overcoming the large discrepancies\n\
    between the retrieved LST and ground truth data still exist. Precise LST measurement\
    \ depends mainly\non accurately deriving the surface emissivity, which is very\
    \ dynamic due to changing states of land\ncover and plant development. In this\
    \ study, we present an LST retrieval algorithm for the combined\nuse of multispectral\
    \ optical and thermal UAV images, which has been optimised for operational\napplications\
    \ in agriculture to map the heterogeneous and diverse agricultural crop systems\
    \ of a\nresearch campus in Germany (April 2018). We constrain the emissivity using\
    \ certain NDVI thresholds\nto distinguish different land surface types. The algorithm\
    \ includes atmospheric corrections and\nenvironmental thermal emissions to minimise\
    \ the uncertainties. In the analysis, we emphasise that\nthe omission of crucial\
    \ meteorological parameters and inaccurately determined emissivities can lead\n\
    to a considerably underestimated LST; however, if the emissivity is underestimated,\
    \ the LST can be\noverestimated. The retrieved LST is validated by reference temperatures\
    \ from nearby ponds and\nweather stations. The validation of the thermal measurements\
    \ indicates a mean absolute error of\nabout 0.5 K. The novelty of the dual sensor\
    \ system is that it simultaneously captures highly spatially\nresolved optical\
    \ and thermal images, in order to construct the precise LST ortho-mosaics required\
    \ to\nmonitor plant diseases and drought stress and validate airborne and satellite\
    \ data.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075; doi:10.3390/rs12071075\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\

    \ temperature (LST) is the primary driving force of the exchange between turbulent\n\
    heat ﬂux and long-wave infrared (LWIR) radiation (8–15 µm) at the interface of\
    \ the Earth’s surface and\natmosphere. Therefore, the LST is a key parameter for\
    \ the physical description of the surface energy\nand water balance processes\
    \ at the local to global scale [1,2]. The potential of this crucial parameter\n\
    has been repeatedly demonstrated in various thermal infrared-based studies and\
    \ applications, such as\nevapotranspiration [3,4], hydrological modelling [5],\
    \ vegetation monitoring [6], ‘urban heat island and\nurban development’ [7–9],\
    \ climate change and weather conditions [1,10], agriculture [3,11], and the\n\
    monitoring of land use changes in wetlands [12]. In agricultural applications,\
    \ precision farming has\nincreasingly required thermal remote sensing techniques\
    \ to detect water-stressed crops [3,13,14], plant\ndiseases [13,15], and for irrigation\
    \ management [13,14].\nHowever, LST signiﬁcantly varies, both temporally and spatially\
    \ (about 10 K), during the\ndaytime depending on the present weather conditions\
    \ and the solar irradiation that warms the\nland surface [1]. Surfaces with high\
    \ spectral differentiated emissivities, such as bare soil surfaces and\nrocks\
    \ (inhomogeneous heating) and sealed areas (‘urban heat islands’) have shown particularly\
    \ large\nsurface temperature amplitudes in the diurnal cycle [1,16,17]. Water-stressed\
    \ vegetation also depicts\nthis phenomenon, due to the rapidly changing transpiration\
    \ rate resulting in a strongly ﬂuctuating\nplant canopy temperature [18]. Therefore,\
    \ high repetition rates (depending on water supply and\nweather conditions) or\
    \ even continuous temperature measurements are required to account for the\ndetailed\
    \ and accurate thermal mapping of water-stressed crops or in irrigation management.\n\
    Satellite-based LST retrieval methods have been reviewed and compared in several\
    \ case\nstudies [1,19,20], but depending on the retrieval algorithm, large discrepancies\
    \ between the retrieved\nLST and ground truth data can occur. Even the same sensor,\
    \ such as a high precision satellite instrument\n(i.e., the Spinning Enhanced\
    \ Visible and Infrared Imager—SEVIRI—aboard Meteosat-9) using different\nLST algorithms\
    \ has featured discrepancies of about 6 K [21]. The reason for this is often an\
    \ inaccurate\nor even erroneously estimated surface emissivity [1], which has\
    \ a great impact on the accuracy of\nLST [19,20]. The lower the emissivity, the\
    \ higher the impact of environmental thermal emissions\non the LWIR radiation\
    \ (Section 2.1), which needs to be considered to avoid errors in LST retrieval\n\
    (Section 2.1.3). Moreover, the results also depend on properly performing atmospheric\
    \ corrections\nbecause of changing weather conditions: A rise in relative humidity\
    \ leads to decreasing transmittance,\nwhich attenuates the thermal signal’s path\
    \ through the atmosphere [1]. In terms of the great land\nsurface heterogeneity,\
    \ the central issue is an incorrectly estimated emissivity. Land surface emissivity\n\
    (LSE) is highly dynamic, particularly in the mid and high latitudes with seasonally\
    \ changing vegetation\ncover of miscellaneous landscape types, such as mixed forests,\
    \ grasslands, wetlands, and in agricultural\nareas with short-term land use and\
    \ land cover (LULC) changes [1,10,12,22]. This makes the precise\nretrieval of\
    \ LST difﬁcult, as LSE depends on changes in both natural and man-made land surface\n\
    properties. Hence, an accurate and relatively timely LSE estimation is necessary\
    \ for the retrieval of\ncorrect LST results.\nIn addition, a scale effect, due\
    \ to different pixel resolutions when using the same LST algorithm\nfor observations\
    \ with different spatial scales at different altitudes, must be taken into account.\
    \ For\ninstance, a pixel might only contain a part of the plant at the leaf level,\
    \ whereas the same pixel scene\nmight represent a mixture of multiple information\
    \ of bare soil and overlapping leaves at the canopy\nlevel [1,10,17]. Resolution\
    \ cells of mixed pixels increase the uncertainty if they are not taken into\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n3 of 27\naccount. With respect to airborne and satellite\
    \ sensed data, this inﬂuencing factor becomes more\nimportant, due to the lower\
    \ spatial resolution at regional scales [1,17]. Therefore, high-contrast and\n\
    highly spatially resolved thermal infrared mapping is urgently needed (e.g., by\
    \ airborne campaigns)\nto investigate the mentioned scale effects and to overcome\
    \ the large discrepancies observed between\nremotely sensed data and ﬁeld measurements.\n\
    The use of thermal and multispectral optical sensors on board an unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicle (UAV)\nhas started with very simple conﬁgurations (e.g., [23]). Although\
    \ some parameters in UAV-based LST\nretrievals are often simpliﬁed due to low\
    \ ﬂight altitudes (e.g., atmospheric transmittance). Ref. [24]\nperformed a land\
    \ use classiﬁcation and assigned speciﬁc emissivity values from reviewed literature\
    \ to\neach class in order to derive the actual temperature of different target\
    \ surfaces. Sagan et al. [25] used\nenvironmental parameters measured at nearby\
    \ ground stations to correct air temperature, humidity,\nand emissivity using\
    \ linear calibration equations. Similarly, Si et al. [26] determined a single\
    \ emissivity\nvalue that was applied to the entire study area. They measured the\
    \ emissivity at a certain temperature\nand integrated it with the spectral response\
    \ function of the thermal imager [26]. Malbéteau et al. [27]\nestimated emissivity\
    \ in terms of vegetation cover, expressed by vegetation index values [17,19].\
    \ Some\nstudies, however, do not take emissivity into account and therefore provide\
    \ results that should be\nviewed as qualitative rather than quantitative [14,28].\
    \ To overcome the challenges mentioned, we have\nintroduced a dual sensor system\
    \ that was combined with a thermal imager that had a much higher\nsensor resolution\
    \ than those available off-the-shelf. A multispectral optical sensor was used\
    \ to provide\nvegetation indices to estimate emissivities, whereas, thermal images\
    \ were captured almost without\ndistortion due to the slow ﬂight speed of the\
    \ ﬁxed-wing glider.\nFor LWIR applications, universal emissivity (ϵ) for dense\
    \ and healthy vegetation surfaces of\nϵ = 0.985 [29] has typically been assumed,\
    \ although the emissivities of different landscape types,\nsuch as forests, grasslands,\
    \ and agricultural areas, are diverse [17,30,31]. Additionally, the vegetation\n\
    density has a direct impact on LSE; for instance, when there is a soil background\
    \ within a resolution\ncell. Hence, this assumption is valid only under certain\
    \ conditions. The emissivity also depends on the\nstate of the plant, and can\
    \ signiﬁcantly decrease (e.g., for dry vegetation) [31]. Generally, an error in\
    \ ϵ\nof 1% corresponds to a value of 0.75 K [32].\nIn the thermal spectrum, fully\
    \ vegetated canopies show LAMBERTIAN behaviour, where angular\ndependence on emissivity\
    \ is negligible [33]. Accordingly, the thermal anisotropy can be disregarded for\n\
    high emissivities [33,34]. However, the prerequisite for this is that the radiative\
    \ transfer model has been\napplied (Section 2.1). Nevertheless, thermal measurements\
    \ are affected by water vapour absorption.\nTherefore, an atmospheric correction\
    \ is reasonable to consider the water vapour. In particular, at higher\nrelative\
    \ humidities (>50%), it is expedient to determine tropospheric transmittance,\
    \ even for a ﬂight\naltitude (sensor-target distance) of 50 meters [35]. Thus,\
    \ we performed an atmospheric correction in\nthis study.\nIn summary, if an incorrect\
    \ speciﬁc emissivity is assumed and environmental thermal emissions\n(background\
    \ temperature) and tropospheric transmittance are disregarded, a potential error\
    \ of about 9\nK can arise (Section 3). Eventually, retrieval of the precise LST\
    \ (or the kinetic temperature) is necessary;\nfor instance, to assess evapotranspiration\
    \ or to calculate agricultural indices such as the Crop Water\nStress Index (CWSI).\
    \ This is an indicator for the water supply status of plants, which is required\
    \ in\nprecision farming (e.g., for irrigation management) [36]. An accurate estimation\
    \ of LSE to generate\nprecise LST maps remains a key prerequisite.\nThermal remote\
    \ sensing provides complete spatially averaged and highly temporally resolved\n\
    information about speciﬁc radiation characteristics to describe the intricacies\
    \ of the LST, rather than\npoint values by ﬁeld measurements over large areas\
    \ [1]. Hence, we have investigated various\nalgorithms using an LWIR thermal camera,\
    \ as well as a multispectral sensor covering the visible\nand near infrared (VNIR)\
    \ domain, to identify the method with the highest potential in terms of\nretrieving\
    \ LST. Multispectral VNIR data were used to derive the Normalised Difference Vegetation\n\
    Index (NDVI) [37]. We chose predeﬁned NDVI thresholds, where we constrained the\
    \ emissivity\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n4 of 27\nper pixel to distinguish between\
    \ bare soil surfaces, dense plant canopies, and mixed surface types\n(Section\
    \ 2.1.2).\nThe present research is focused on agricultural areas, which entail\
    \ highly dynamic LSE values,\ndue to the varying phenological statuses of the\
    \ crops. Besides the natural ripening stages, this is mainly\ncaused by external\
    \ impacts, such as water stress, plant diseases, or frost damage. The objective\
    \ of this\nstudy is to retrieve precise LST, taking into account the highly variable\
    \ LSE derived by using an NDVI\nthreshold approach, as well as the atmospheric\
    \ impacts. For this purpose, we equipped a UAV with\na multispectral sensor and\
    \ a thermal camera to simultaneously capture VNIR and LWIR imagery of\nthe entire\
    \ study site. Based on the acquired VNIR and LWIR images, we generated corresponding\n\
    ortho-mosaics to retrieve and quantify the LST values. Finally, we have developed\
    \ a standardised\nLST retrieval algorithm which is optimised for ﬁxed-wing UAV\
    \ applications, in order to enable\nsemi-supervised thermal mapping in agricultural\
    \ areas. The study site of the UAV campaigns (April\n2018) was an agricultural\
    \ research ﬁeld in Rheinbach (North Rhine-Westphalia), which is afﬁliated\nwith\
    \ the Agricultural Faculty of Bonn University in Germany.\n2. Methodology of the\
    \ LST Retrieval Algorithm Using UAV-Based Multispectral Data\nThe following sections\
    \ describe the UAV-based LST retrieval methodology in detail. The various\nprocessing\
    \ steps required to retrieve precise LST values are illustrated in Figure 1:\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n5 of 27\nFigure 1. Flowchart of the proposed Unmanned\
    \ Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based method to retrieve\nprecise Land Surface Temperature\
    \ (LST): (i) Visible and near infrared (VNIR) and long-wave infrared\n(LWIR) data\
    \ acquisition; (ii) Reference measurements for VNIR and LWIR data during the ﬂights;\n\
    (iii) Preprocessing of the acquired data; (iv) Atmospheric correction for the\
    \ thermal domain; (v)\nOrtho-mosaic generation; (vi) Co-registration, resampling\
    \ and layer stacking of the VNIR and\nbrightness temperature (BT) maps; (vii)\
    \ Computation of the Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) and\nLST maps.\nFor this approach,\
    \ we developed a dual sensor system to simultaneously acquire multispectral\n\
    VNIR and LWIR thermal imagery from a ﬂight altitude of 77 meters, resulting in\
    \ a spatial resolution\nof 7 cm per pixel (px) and 10 cm/px, respectively (Figure\
    \ 1i). Different reﬂectance panels were\ncaptured during the ﬂights for subsequent\
    \ calibrations of the VNIR and LWIR data. The background\ntemperature was incorporated\
    \ by using a panel of crumpled aluminium foil and quantiﬁed with\na pyrometer\
    \ [29], which was sensitive at similar wavelengths as the thermal camera (Appendix\n\
    A.1). Due to its high speciﬁc heat capacity, the water temperature of a nearby\
    \ pond was used as a\nreference for validation of the thermal observations (Figure\
    \ 1ii). The advantage of a water surface\nreference is its quite stable and homogeneous\
    \ temperature distribution during the recording time and\nits constant emissivity\
    \ (Section 2.2.3). VNIR and LWIR digital numbers (DN) were then converted\ninto\
    \ reﬂectance and brightness temperature (BT), respectively. Further preprocessing\
    \ steps that we\nperformed on the VNIR data included reﬂectance calibration and\
    \ band sensitivity normalisation. LWIR\nimages were removed, regarding their contrast\
    \ applying a 2D FOURIER transform (Appendix A.2);\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n\
    6 of 27\nafterwards, we conducted drift compensation and non-uniformity correction\
    \ (Figure 1iii). Subsequent\natmospheric correction for the thermal data was based\
    \ on the radiative transfer model (Figure 1iv).\nBefore constructing the ortho-mosaic,\
    \ additional calibration of the lens parameters to rectify the LWIR\nimagery was\
    \ necessary (Appendix A.2). For both data sets, the same tools (with adapted parameters)\n\
    to generate the ortho-mosaics were chosen: aligning imagery, then dense cloud\
    \ and mesh building\n(Appendix A.2). Then, we calculated the NDVI to constrain\
    \ the LSE per pixel, based on predeﬁned\nNDVI thresholds. Co-registration and\
    \ resampling of the VNIR and BT maps was needed for pixelwise\ncalculation of\
    \ the stacked layer (Figure 1vi). Finally, we computed the LSE, based on the proposed\n\
    methods, and retrieved the LST, considering the speciﬁc emissivity, transmittance,\
    \ and background\ntemperature (Figure 1vii).\n2.1. Lst Retrieval Methodology\n\
    Based on the radiative transfer model (RTM), the radiation path through the troposphere\
    \ can be\nwritten as [17,29]:\nLsens = (Lsur f + Lre f l) · τ + Latm,\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ Lsens is the at-sensor radiance, Lsur f the surface radiance attenuated by the\
    \ atmosphere, and\nLatm the upwelling radiance emitted by the atmosphere. Lre\
    \ f l describes the downwelling radiance\nemitted by the atmosphere (e.g., by\
    \ water vapour re-emission), which is reﬂected at the surface (ϵ − 1)\nand attenuated\
    \ by the atmosphere. The atmospheric transmittance (τ) is dimensionless (deﬁned\
    \ in\nthe range of 0–1) and for the radiances, the unit W m−2 sr−1 is used. As\
    \ Lsens depends on both the\nwavelength and sensor-speciﬁc properties, the inverse\
    \ PLANCK function must be used to convert\nfrom the raw at-sensor radiance (Lsens)\
    \ into the at-sensor brightness temperature (BTsens). Planck’s law\n(1900) describes\
    \ the spectral density of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody at\
    \ a given\ntemperature [1]. However, the LWIR detector does not cover the entire\
    \ thermal wavelength range.\nThus, the camera manufacturer has used a modiﬁed\
    \ PLANCK function [38], which is based on the\nsensor-speciﬁc spectral response\
    \ curve and laboratory-derived PLANCK constants (Appendix A.1).\nBTsens is automatically\
    \ calculated by the thermal camera software, with parameters of transmittance\n\
    and emissivity set to one.\nDue to the reﬂections of natural surfaces (ϵ < 1)\
    \ in the thermal domain, the radiometric\ntemperature or brightness temperature\
    \ sensed by the sensor is always lower than the equivalent\nmeasured absolute\
    \ (kinetic) temperature (T). Radiant and kinetic temperatures are two different\n\
    quantitative terms in thermodynamics [34,39,40], which can be equal in no way,\
    \ and simply provide\nthe best approximations to describe the temperatures [41].\
    \ The thermodynamic relationship for ϵ < 1\ncan be described, by the STEFAN–BOLTZMANN\
    \ law (1884), as [34,40,42]:\nM = ϵ · σ · T4 ⇔ T =\n4\nr\nM\nϵ · σ,\n(2)\nwhere\
    \ M is the irradiance (W m−2), ϵ is the emissivity (ranging from 0–1; dimensionless),\
    \ σ is the\nSTEFAN–BOLTZMANN constant (5.67 × 10−8 W m−2 K−4), and T is the absolute\
    \ temperature (K).\nAccording to [29,43], based on RTM (Equation (1)) and using\
    \ the STEFAN–BOLTZMANN law\n(Equation (2)), the LST retrieval (Equation (3)) can\
    \ be written as (Appendix A.3):\nLST := Tsur f (ϵ, τ) =\n4\ns\nBT4sens − (1 −\
    \ ϵ) · τ · T4\nbkg − (1 − τ) · T4\nair\nϵ · τ\n,\n(3)\nwhere Tsur f (ϵ, τ) is\
    \ the retrieved surface temperature, BTsens the at-sensor brightness temperature,\
    \ Tbkg\nthe background temperature, and Tair the air temperature (K, respectively);\
    \ and emissivity (ϵ) and\ntransmittance (τ) range from 0–1 (dimensionless). From\
    \ Equation (Equation (3)), it is obvious that an\natmospheric correction (Section\
    \ 2.1.1) considering τ, Tair, Tbkg, and the corresponding emissivity are\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n7 of 27\nneeded to retrieve a precise and correct absolute\
    \ temperature (T) at the surface. At altitudes above\n100 meters, we recommend\
    \ considering the (dry) adiabatic lapse rate to correct the air temperature\n\
    to the appropriate UAV height. The background temperature was incorporated using\
    \ a panel of\ncrumpled aluminium foil (Appendix A.1). Equation (3) has been described\
    \ by [43] and was used in an\nanalogous way in [29], where we included the parameter\
    \ τ to make the use of an additional commercial\nsoftware for atmospheric correction\
    \ unnecessary. The standard software (e.g., FLIR Thermal Studio\nPro, FLIR Systems,\
    \ Inc., Wilsonville, OR, USA; IRBIS 3 professional, InfraTec GmbH, Infrarotsensorik\n\
    und Messtechnik, Dresden, Germay) uses Equations (4) and (5) (Section 2.1.1) to\
    \ perform atmospheric\ncorrection. To validate the retrieved LST (Section 3),\
    \ we used the water temperature (as measured by\nthermocouples) of a nearby pond\
    \ as relative constant temperature reference (Section 2.2.3). In order\nto account\
    \ for small spatial temperature variation, we measured the air temperature at\
    \ two different\nlocations. Finally, we used the estimated emissivity (ϵ) to retrieve\
    \ the precise LST (Section 2.1.2), as\nproposed by [17,44].\n2.1.1. Impacts of\
    \ Atmospheric Conditions on Thermal Measurements\nIn this subsection, we address\
    \ several complex inﬂuencing factors that can affect thermal\nmeasurements during\
    \ data acquisition:\nInfrared thermography must be executed in thermal\nequilibrium\
    \ to obtain physically correct data. However, changing the ambient conditions\
    \ of the\ncamera (FLIR Tau 2 640), can affect the thermal measurements and reduce\
    \ the radiometric accuracy by\nup to ±5 ◦C [45], because uncooled thermal sensors\
    \ (without thermo-electric cooler) cannot maintain\na stabilised constant temperature\
    \ of the microbolometer (focal-plane array, FPA). The accuracy of the\nmeasured\
    \ BTsens is dependent on the internal FPA (detector) temperature and housing temperature,\n\
    as well as external effects caused by the UAV system itself. These parameters\
    \ ﬂuctuate throughout a\nﬂight (e.g., from shaded to unshaded conditions) and\
    \ should, therefore, be taken into account [46]. The\nissue of ﬂuctuating detector\
    \ and housing temperatures has been solved by the ‘Advanced Radiometry’\ntool\
    \ (FLIR) using a built-in shutter to calibrate itself. Before and after changing\
    \ temperature events, ﬂat\nﬁeld correction (FFC) is performed by submitting a\
    \ uniform temperature (a ﬂat ﬁeld) to the detector.\nDuring the FFC process, the\
    \ internal shutter of the camera is closed and quickly reopened to estimate\n\
    the shutter temperature. Therefore, each FFC event was detected during the data\
    \ acquisition and\ntagged in the recordings. Then, the ThermoViewer 2.1.6 software\
    \ (TeAx Technology GmbH, Wilnsdorf,\nGermany) was used to perform ‘Drift compensation’\
    \ (for temperature ﬂuctuations) with appropriate\ncorrection coefﬁcients. Drift\
    \ of the housing temperature was also compensated by permanent cooling\nwith an\
    \ adjacently mounted fan. However, sensory effects can also lead to non-uniformity\
    \ in thermal\nimagery, such as ‘cold corners’ (vignetting). The same software,\
    \ hence, was used for a motion-based\n‘Non-Uniformity Correction (NUC)’ ﬁlter,\
    \ which distinguished constant errors by shifts within the\nframes.\nFurthermore,\
    \ thermal measurements are affected by water vapour absorption.\nTherefore,\n\
    atmospheric correction in the thermal spectrum was performed to consider tropospheric\
    \ conditions\n(Section 1). The required parameters were obtained from the in situ\
    \ weather station and a microclimatic\nstation in the ﬁeld (Section 2.2.3). Initially,\
    \ the present water vapour content (WVC) was computed\nusing parameters such as\
    \ the air temperature and relative humidity:\nω = ω% · exp\n\x10\nh1 · T3\nair\
    \ + h2 · T2\nair + h3 · Tair + h4\n\x11\n,\n(4)\nwhere ω is the water vapour content\
    \ (mm), ω% is the relative humidity (ranging from 0–1;\ndimensionless), Tair is\
    \ the air temperature (◦C), and h1, h2, h3, and h4 are speciﬁc parameters for\n\
    a temperature range of −40 to +120 ◦C in the LWIR domain (h1 = 6.8455 × 10−7,\
    \ h2 = −2.7816 ×\n10−4, h3 = 6.939 × 10−2, and h4 = 1.5587) [43,47]. Subsequently,\
    \ the transmittance was estimated using\nparameters such as the ﬂight altitude\
    \ (distance) and WVC:\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n8 of 27\nτ = Katm · exp\n\
    h\n−\n√\nd\n\0α1 + β1\n√\nω\n\x01i\n+ (1 − Katm) · exp\nh\n−\n√\nd\n\0α2 + β2\n\
    √\nω\n\x01i\n,\n(5)\nwhere τ is the transmittance (0–1; dimensionless), d is the\
    \ distance (m), along with speciﬁc parameters\nsuch as the scaling factor of atmospheric\
    \ damping (Katm = 1.9), the attenuation of the atmosphere\nwithout water vapour\
    \ (α1 = 0.0066, α2 = 0.0126), and the attenuation of water vapour (β1 = −0.0023,\
    \ β2\n= −0.0067) [43,47]. Atmospheric damping is caused by absorption by gaseous\
    \ components and the\nturbidity of the troposphere, which decrease the amplitude\
    \ of the electromagnetic radiation [48]. From\nthis equation, it is obvious that\
    \ the transmittance depends mainly on the distance and the WVC.\n2.1.2. Lse Estimation\
    \ Based on NDVI Thresholds\nRemotely sensed spectral vegetation indices, such\
    \ as the NDVI, allow a more representative\nspatial estimation of the emissivity\
    \ than point measurements [30,37]:\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR + R,\n(6)\nwhere NIR and\
    \ R are the reﬂectances in the near-infrared and red spectra, respectively (−1...+1).\n\
    Moreover, NDVI thresholds provide a reasonable way to differentiate the emissivities\
    \ of various land\nsurface types. This is particularly necessary for dynamic land\
    \ surfaces, such as seasonally varying\nnatural vegetation and agricultural areas.\n\
    The ﬁrst predictions of LSE from NDVI values were made in [30,44]. For estimating\
    \ the emissivity\ndetermined by NDVI thresholds, the vegetation cover method was\
    \ initially proposed in [49,50]. Using\ninformation of the fractional vegetation\
    \ cover or vegetation proportion (Pv), along with knowledge\nof the emissivities\
    \ of full vegetation and bare soil surfaces, this method produces effective LSE.\
    \ The\nNDVI threshold method (NDVI-THM), using certain NDVI thresholds, was ﬁrst\
    \ introduced in [51],\nwhere it was applied to Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer\
    \ (AVHRR) satellite data. For\napplications in agriculture, we identiﬁed this\
    \ method as the most suitable, as it classiﬁes the emissivity\ninto three different\
    \ surface types: bare soil (NDVI < NDVIsoil), full vegetation (NDVI > NDVIveg),\n\
    and mixed areas (composed of both attributes). Using information from Pv and NDVI\
    \ histograms to\nidentify the convenient NDVI thresholds is acutely beneﬁcial:\
    \ No accurate atmospheric correction is\nessential, because corrected and uncorrected\
    \ NDVI are similar [17,52]. For known emissivities of full\nvegetation and bare\
    \ soil surfaces, Pv (Equation (7)) can be obtained, according to [17,52], by:\n\
    Pv =\n\x12 NDVI − NDVIsoil\nNDVIveg − NDVIsoil\n\x132\n,\n(7)\nwhere NDVIsoil\
    \ and NDVIveg are the NDVI of bare soil and full vegetation, respectively. The\
    \ Pv values\ncan, then, be used to compute the emissivity of mixed pixels (ϵ):\n\
    ϵ = ϵveg · Pv + ϵsoil · (1 − Pv) + C,\n(8)\nwhere ϵveg (=0.988) and ϵsoil (=0.935)\
    \ are the mean emissivities (in the LWIR spectrum) of dense plant\ncanopy [30,31]\
    \ and bare soil (of loamy to silty texture) [31,53], C is the term of cavity effect\
    \ due to\nsurface roughness (C = 4 · dϵ · Pv · (1 − Pv)), and dϵ is a revised\
    \ parameter (dϵ ≈ 0.01). For ﬂat areas\n(C\n!= 0), the formula (Equation (8))\
    \ simpliﬁes to:\nϵ = ϵveg · Pv + ϵsoil · (1 − Pv).\n(9)\nFinally, we constrain\
    \ the emissivity per pixel based on certain NDVI thresholds to distinguish\nbetween\
    \ three different surface types, as proposed by [17]. The following NDVI thresholds\
    \ were used\nto reclassify the LSE (ϵ), based on the emissivities of bare soil,\
    \ full vegetation, and mixed states:\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n9 of 27\n•\
    \ bare soil:\nNDVI < NDVIsoil\n⇒ NDVI < 0.157\n→ ϵsoil = 0.935\n• dense canopy:\n\
    NDVI > NDVIveg\n⇒ NDVI > 0.905\n→ ϵveg = 0.988\n• mixed pixels:\nNDVIsoil ≤ NDVI\
    \ ≤ NDVIveg\n→ ϵ (Equation (9)),\nwhere ϵveg is maintained as the global emissivity\
    \ of dense canopies [30,31] and ϵsoil is assumed for\nloamy to silty (moisture)\
    \ soil [31,53]. For loamy sand soil, we suggest a lower emissivity of 0.914,\n\
    as proposed by [30]. A NDVIsoil value of 0.157 (standard deviation, SD = 0.227)\
    \ was derived by the\nmeans of four samples from the rapeseed ﬁeld studied. A\
    \ NDVIveg value of 0.905 (SD = 0.111) was\nestablished by the means of four rape\
    \ plots (healthy varieties). However, for different crops (i.e., corn,\nwheat,\
    \ barley, and rape), we recommend a global NDVIveg value of 0.814 (as observed\
    \ in summer\n2018); or around 0.8, as proposed by [17]. Nevertheless, the NDVI\
    \ thresholds for soil and vegetation\nneed to be recalculated before using NDVI-THM\
    \ to estimate the LSE.\nFor open canopies, ref. [30] have postulated a logarithmic\
    \ relationship (ϵ′) between the mean\nemissivity and the mean NDVI, which ﬁts\
    \ best to NDVI values between 0.157 and 0.727 (Equation\n(10)):\nϵ′ = a + b ·\
    \ ln(NDVI),\n(10)\nwith a = 1.0010 and b = 0.047 (level of signiﬁcance: 0.99).\
    \ To analyse the results of the emissivity\napproach from information derived\
    \ from Pv (Equation (9)), we used the logarithmic relationship\n(Equation (10)).\
    \ Finally, we performed a comparison of both approaches to determine their selectivities,\n\
    as well as to study their beneﬁts for applications in agriculture (Section 3).\n\
    2.1.3. Consequences of Omitting Essential Parameters\nSubsequent assumptions were\
    \ made to emphasise the importance of considering essential\nparameters, such\
    \ as transmittance, air temperature, emissivity, and background temperature. In\n\
    our ﬁrst assumption, we set the emissivity to one (ϵ != 1), which simpliﬁes the\
    \ formula (Equation (3))\nto:\nLST(τ) := Tsur f (τ) =\n4\ns\nBT4sens − (1 − τ)\
    \ · T4\nair\nτ\n.\n(11)\nIn our second assumption, which presupposes a completely\
    \ transmissive atmosphere, we set the\ntransmittance to one (τ != 1). This simpliﬁes\
    \ the same initial formula to:\nLST(ϵ) := Tsur f (ϵ) =\n4\ns\nBT4sens − (1 − ϵ)\
    \ · T4\nbkg\nϵ\n.\n(12)\nBased on these limiting assumptions (Equations (11) and\
    \ (12)), we made the following two case\ndistinctions: Case i: LST(τ) includes\
    \ the atmospheric transmittance, but does not take into account\nthe emissivity\
    \ or background temperature (Equation (11)); and case ii: LST(ϵ) includes the\
    \ emissivity\nand background temperature, but omits the transmittance (Equation\
    \ (12)). In summary, we have\nhighlighted the potential implications of omitting\
    \ these parameters, which should be considered in\norder to minimise the uncertainties\
    \ in retrieving precise LST values. The deviations between the\nuncorrected BTsens\
    \ and LST(τ) or LST(ϵ) are shown in the results (Section 3).\n2.2. Study Site\
    \ and Data Sets\n2.2.1. Agricultural Research Campus\nThe study site of the UAV\
    \ campaigns was the northern part of agricultural research ﬁelds of\n‘Campus Klein-Altendorf’\
    \ (CKA) in Rheinbach (North Rhine-Westphalia), which is afﬁliated with the\nAgricultural\
    \ Faculty of Bonn University, Germany (Figure 2). The total agricultural area\
    \ of CKA was\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n10 of 27\nabout 181 ha, mainly cultivated\
    \ with barley, wheat, corn, and sugar beet; moreover, rapeseed, potatoes\nand\
    \ renewable resources (e.g., Miscanthus) were also cultivated. CKA had two weather\
    \ stations that\ncontinuously recorded meteorological data, such as air temperature\
    \ and humidity, as well as the\nsurface temperature in the northern and southern\
    \ part of the campus. In the ﬁelds, air temperature\nand humidity were measured\
    \ continuously by data loggers (Section 2.2.3). This study was focused\non the\
    \ rapeseed ﬁeld within the ‘Common Experiment’ (Figure 2) during the springtime\
    \ in 2018.\nThe maintenance of crop rotation and working on homogeneous ﬁelds\
    \ was part of this experiment.\nThe rapeseed ﬁeld experiment consisted of 63 plots\
    \ (and border plots), each with dimensions of 3 ×\n6 meters and planted with 10\
    \ different genotypes with a minimal repetition of 6 plots (the present\ngenotypes\
    \ were Alaska, Pirola, DH5, Markus, Expert, Olympiade, Wotan, Major, Groß Lüsewitzer,\
    \ and\nSensation NZ).\nFigure 2. VNIR-generated colour infrared (CIR) map (NIR-red-green\

    \ Experiment (yellow border) with bare soil patches,\nat recording time (11 April\
    \ 2018, 13:42 CET), prepared for maize and summer wheat experiments.\nThe Common\
    \ Experiment follows crop rotation with homogeneously planted crops; in this image,\n\
    summer barley (dotted yellow margin) is planted every two years. Furthermore,\
    \ south of the Common\nExperiment, sugar beet and, to the north, barley were grown,\
    \ according to standard agricultural\npractice. A data logger was placed within\
    \ the rapeseed ﬁeld (yellow x; 50.6237N, 6.9873E). The spatial\nresolution of\
    \ the CIR map is 7 cm per pixel.\n2.2.2. Fixed-Wing Uav System\nA ﬁxed-wing UAV\
    \ (Figure 3) was used to map the heterogeneous and diverse agricultural\ncropping\
    \ systems and to efﬁciently cover the large ﬁelds of the campus.\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2020, 12, 1075\n11 of 27\nFigure 3. The ﬁxed-wing UAV used during our thermal\
    \ campaigns (left). The sensor platform of the\nUAV consists of a dual sensor\
    \ system with a multispectral VNIR sensor, including an irradiance sensing\nelement\
    \ and a thermal camera (right). The LWIR camera is connected to the autopilot\
    \ of the UAV to\nrecord GPS data and heading information, stored as metadata.\n\
    The special features of the UAV are the novel sensor platform (Figure 3) and a\
    \ slow ﬂight speed\nover ground (Appendix A.4), which is particularly important\
    \ for thermal mapping, in order to avoid\nblurry images. The UAV was mounted with\
    \ a dual sensor system, consisting of both a multispectral\nVNIR sensor (Parrot\
    \ Sequoia; Parrot Drones SAS, Paris, France) and a LWIR thermal camera (FLIR Tau\n\
    2 640), attached to a ThermalCapture 2.0 module (TeAx Technology) to simultaneously\
    \ capture the images\n(Table 1). The accuracy of the thermal camera (dTcam) under\
    \ stable ambient conditions was dTcam =\n±0.50 ◦C, which has been laboratory-conﬁrmed\
    \ by [45]. However, in changing ambient conditions, the\nradiometric accuracy\
    \ can be reduced by up to ±5.0 ◦C [45].\nTable 1. Details of the thermal camera\
    \ (uncooled microbolometer, thermal resolution: 0.04 K) and the\nmultispectral\
    \ sensor used. According to the spatial resolution of the sensors, the pixel size\

    \ was used to account for the present\nlighting conditions. This sensor was ﬁxed\
    \ on the UAV and oriented towards the sky. Both sensors\ncovered the optical spectrum,\
    \ separated into four bands (centre wavelength): green/G (550 nm), red/R\n(660\
    \ nm), red edge/RE (735 nm), and NIR (790 nm). Moreover, the sensor platform was\
    \ equipped\nwith an internal fan to cool the devices and to provide a stable ambient\
    \ temperature, which is relevant\nfor proper thermal imaging. An advanced autopilot\
    \ (Pixhawk 4) connected to a GPS antenna for\npositioning and a pitot tube (a\
    \ device measuring the ﬂight speed with respect to wind speed) on the\nwing were\
    \ built-in to automatically ﬂy the programmed routes. Generally, we conducted\
    \ the UAV\ncampaigns once or twice times per month during the growing season.\
    \ The ﬂights were split into\nthree parts (approximately 60 ha per section), due\
    \ to the limited power supply of the UAV batteries,\nwhich were generally scheduled\
    \ at 10:00 (focused study ﬁeld), 12:00, and 14:00 (CET), to minimise the\ninﬂuence\
    \ of shadows in the imagery. Every ﬂight took approximately 30–45 minutes.\n2.2.3.\
    \ Meteorological Data and Reference Measurements\nA weather station (GWU-Umwelttechnik\
    \ GmbH) was situated in the northern part of the campus\n(near the pond), which\
    \ recorded the following parameters (at 2 m above the ground): wind speed, air\n\
    temperature (Tair), relative humidity (ω%), surface temperature (Tsur f ) at 0.05\
    \ m, and net radiation\n(Table 2 and Table 3, respectively). Within the rapeseed\
    \ ﬁeld, a microclimatic station continuously\nrecorded (at 1 min intervals) the\
    \ air temperature and relative humidity (HMP110) as shown in Table 3.\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n12 of 27\nA pull-up resister (DS18B20) measured the (bare\
    \ soil) surface temperature with an accuracy of ±0.5 ◦C.\nIn addition to the water\
    \ surface temperature of the pond, Tsur f was used to validate the retrieved LST\n\
    from the thermal camera (Section 3).\nTable 2. Meteorological data (as means)\

    \ stress), no further reference measurements\n(aside from the water temperature)\
    \ were carried out with thermocouples to validate the surface\ntemperatures [29].\
    \ However, weather conditions have a direct impact on the surface temperature:\n\
    increasing Tair will directly increase Tsur f in analogical degree, but also change\
    \ the net radiation,\naffecting the surface temperature. The interdependence of\
    \ Tair and Tsur f as an approach to surface\ntemperature correction (Tsur f_c)\
    \ has been proposed by [29]:\nTsur f_c = Tsur f − Tair + Tair_mean,\n(13)\nwhere\
    \ Tsur f_c is the corrected surface temperature, Tsur f , Tair = <Tair>, and Tair_mean\
    \ is the mean of\n<Tair> (◦C). The correction of Tsur f compensates for the noise\
    \ caused by drifts in air temperature\n(Figure 4).\nFigure 4. From air temperature\

    \ is higher than\nthe corrected surface temperature due to increasing air temperature\
    \ is compensated by the mean air\ntemperature (Tair_mean).\nThis approach (Equation\
    \ (13)) was used to account for small discrepancies (dTsur f ) in the thermal\n\
    measurements caused by the impact of <Tair>. We calculated the differences of\
    \ Tsur f and Tsur f_c, which\nwere deﬁned as dTsur f . There were no signiﬁcant\
    \ changes in <Tair> and Tsur f during the campaign\nand, so, dTsur f = 0.28 ±\

    \ (Table 2), the averaged values of Tbkg (from before, during, and\nafter the\
    \ ﬂights) were used (Appendix A.1) to consider the background temperature [29].\
    \ Moreover,\nfor cloudy conditions (diffuse scattering), the background temperature\
    \ is quite similar to the measured\nair temperature (Table 3). Flight 3 showed\
    \ a much lower background temperature (Tbkg), due to (‘cold’)\nclear sky conditions.\
    \ The transmittance (τ) was always about 0.95. Both Tbkg and τ were used to\n\
    perform atmospheric correction.\nIn addition, during the ﬂights, data at a nearby\
    \ pond were captured, which were used as reference\nfor the temperature validation\
    \ (Section 3). The Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) was\napplied to locate\
    \ the surface of the pond [54,55]:\nNDWI = G − NIR\nG + NIR,\n(14)\nwhere G and\
    \ NIR are the reﬂectances in the green and near-infrared spectra, respectively\
    \ (−1...+1).\nAccording to [56], we used an NDWI threshold of NDWI ≥ 0.3 to detect\
    \ the water surface and to\nreclassify the corresponding emissivity ϵw (ϵw = 0.985)\
    \ [31,34]. Water surfaces almost totally absorb\nLWIR at a layer thickness of\
    \ >1 mm and show a constant emissivity [40].\nIn terms of the water surface temperature\
    \ (Tpond) measurements, we constructed a ﬂoating triangle\nout of bamboo poles\
    \ (with a side length of 3 m each) for the thermocouples, which were mounted at\n\
    each corner and in the middle. The thermocouples were placed at depths of 3.0–30\
    \ mm (the dimensions\nof a thermocouple element is 5.1 × 33 mm). Tpond was measured\
    \ directly under the surface layer by\nfour thermocouples, using a data logger\
    \ with an accuracy of ±0.36 ◦C. The mean temperature of the\nfour thermocouples\
    \ was used to validate the retrieved camera temperature (LSTpond). According to\n\
    Equation (3), the captured thermal images of the pond were used to retrieve LSTpond.\
    \ Before and after\nthe ﬂight over the Common Experiment (Figure 2), each set\
    \ of 24 suitable thermal images of the pond\nwas selected for validation. Both\
    \ Tpond and LSTpond were used to calculate the temperature deviations\n(dTpond)\
    \ during the ﬂight.\n3. Results\nThe CIR composite (Figure 5a) enhanced the visibility\

    \ with 10 different genotypes with\na minimal repetition of 6 plots. Differences\
    \ between the varieties are highlighted by the CIR map (a);\nthe NDVI (b) and\
    \ Pv (c) maps were used to estimate the emissivity (11 April 2018, 13:42 CET).\n\
    Similar reddish colours showed the same varieties, depending on their biomass,\
    \ and dark green\nplots were plants damaged by frost due to cold spells in the\
    \ springtime. These plants belonged to the\nsame genotype and turned out to be\
    \ less resilient against frost. Plants affected by frost were inhibited\nin their\
    \ growth or entirely perished. Striking greenish patches depicted bare soil areas\
    \ around the\nplots. These patterns continued in the subsequent maps. The NDVI\
    \ map (Figure 5b) was generated to\nﬁnd certain NDVI thresholds of bare soil (NDVIsoil\
    \ = 0.157; SD = 0.227) and full vegetation (NDVIveg\n= 0.905; SD = 0.111), which\
    \ were used to compute the vegetation proportion (Pv) and to estimate the\nLSE\
    \ (Section 2.1.2). The Pv map (Figure 5c) was used to compute the LSE (Equation\
    \ (9)), whereas LSE’\nwas calculated based on the logarithmic relationship (Equation\
    \ (10)). High NDVI values represent\na healthy and dense canopy; corresponding\
    \ to Pv = 1 for full vegetation. Both the NDVI and the Pv\nmaps conﬁrm the lack\
    \ of biomass for the withered varieties, resulting in low NDVI. The latter map\n\
    even indicated a marginal vegetation proportion (Pv = 0) for the affected plots,\
    \ similar to that of bare\nsoil surfaces.\nThe LSE (Figure 6a) and LSE’ (Figure\
    \ 6b) maps were computed using certain NDVI thresholds\nfor bare soil, dense canopy,\
    \ and mixed states (Section 2.1.2). For mixed pixels, LSE was estimated by\ninformation\
    \ from Pv (Equation (9)) and LSE’ by using the logarithmic relationship (Equation\
    \ (10)).\nComparison of LSE and LSE’ was performed to study the selectivity of\
    \ both approaches and to evaluate\nthe accuracy of the NDVI-THM approach (Figure\
    \ 6c). The minimum emissivity was 0.935, representing\nloamy to silty soil, and\
    \ the maximum emissivity was 0.988, representing dense canopy. The LSE (Figure\n\
    6a) map, derived by the Pv approach, shows detailed information of the open canopy,\
    \ such as withered\nplants and plot edges (white areas with an emissivity of about\
    \ 0.96). The LSE’ map (Figure 6b), based\non the logarithmic relationship (ϵ’)\
    \ between the mean emissivity and the mean NDVI, ﬁts for NDVI\nvalues between\
    \ 0.157 and 0.727 better than for NDVI thresholds of up to 0.905 (i.e., for dense-canopied\n\
    rapeseed).\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n15 of 27\nFigure 6. The LSE map (a) represents\
    \ the emissivity considering Pv; whereas the LSE’ map (b) depicts\nthe emissivity\
    \ derived by the logarithmic relationship. The dLSE map (c) accentuates the selectivity\
    \ of\nboth approaches.\nIn contrast, the Pv approach could be adjusted to determine\
    \ the certain NDVI values of different\ncereals. The comparison (Figure 6c) of\
    \ both approaches shows a selectivity of dLSE = 0.03, especially\nfor plants affected\
    \ by frost and plot edges (red areas). This fact could be an indication of a discrepancy\n\
    in the estimation of lower emissivities (i.e., for dry vegetation). For dense\
    \ canopy and bare soil, dLSE\nasymptotically approached zero, which conﬁrms the\
    \ accuracy of the estimated LSE. However, we\nhave stated that the NDVI-THM approach\
    \ cannot be used to estimate the emissivity of senescent\nor withered plants,\
    \ as the NDVI of dry vegetation (which is considerably affected by water stress)\n\
    has a similar emissivity spectrum as that of bare soil [57,58]. The emissivity\
    \ of dry vegetation can\nreach very low values, compared to healthy plants, which\
    \ leads to LST values that are considerably\nunderestimated; without additional\
    \ consideration of meteorological parameters, a potential error of\nabout 9 K\
    \ can occur (Section 4).\nThe BTsens map (Figure 7a) clearly distinguishes colder\
    \ areas of the dense canopy and warmer\nspots (up to 4.8 K) of the rape varieties\
    \ affected by frost, as well as bare soil surfaces. As the measured\nat-sensor\
    \ brightness temperature does not take into account the surface emissivity and\
    \ current\natmospheric conditions, BTsens should only be used for surfaces with\
    \ high emissivities and relative\ntemperature observations under similar weather\
    \ conditions. The LST retrieval (Figure 7b) included the\nestimated LSE (Figure\
    \ 6a), as well as the present atmospheric conditions. The minimum temperature\
    \ of\nthe dense canopy was 13.5 ◦C and the maximum temperature of the bare soil\
    \ and dried-up plants was\n19.2 ◦C. The difference between LST and BTsens (Figure\
    \ 7c) showed a maximum deviation (dLST) of\n1.0 K for bare soil surfaces and varieties\
    \ that had suffered from frost. The accuracy of the LST retrieval\nis strongly\
    \ dependent on the speciﬁc surface emissivity and differs substantially with decreasing\n\
    emissivity: Without consideration of mixed-resolution cells from soil and vegetation,\
    \ the LST will be\nunderestimated for affected pixels by at least 1 K (Figure\
    \ 7c). Hence, we recommend using an NDVI\nthresholding method (Section 2.1.2)\
    \ for the emissivity estimation, in order to consider mixed pixels\nand to minimise\
    \ the uncertainties.\nThe ﬁnal LST retrieval (Figure 7b) depicts almost the same\
    \ temperature distribution as the BTsens\nmap: warmer spots (up to 5.7 K) showed\
    \ frost-damaged plants and bare soil, and dense canopy\noccurred as colder areas.\
    \ Compared to the CIR map, with speciﬁc reddish colours for same varieties,\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n16 of 27\nthe temperature variation within the plots\
    \ was larger than for different varieties. Therefore, the\nvarieties were not\
    \ distinguishable by certain LST thresholds.\nFigure 7. The temperature distribution\
    \ between rape plots and surrounding soil areas: BTsens map (a)\ngenerated from\
    \ the LWIR imagery (11 April 2018, 13:42 CET). The LST map (b) based on estimated\n\
    LSE after the corrections were made. The dLST map (c) was computed to quantify\
    \ the temperature\ndeviation between BTsens and the retrieved LST.\nMoreover,\
    \ we had nearly constant weather conditions during the campaigns (Section 2.2.3)\
    \ and no\nnoticeable shifts in the plant state. Thus, the temperature variance\
    \ of the varieties was generally caused\nby different evapotranspiration, plant\
    \ water content, and soil water supply. In our case, the differing\ncanopy temperature\
    \ within the plots was mainly related to the diverse emissivities of withered\
    \ and\nhealthy plants.\nFinally, we analysed the impacts of the meteorological\
    \ parameters on thermal measurements.\nDifferent assumptions were made to emphasise\
    \ the effects of when essential parameters, such as\ntransmittance and environmental\
    \ thermal emissions, were not taken into account in LST retrieval\n(Section 2.1.3).\
    \ Each case was compared to the uncorrected BTsens (Figure 7a) and the modiﬁed\n\
    LST retrievals (Equations (11) and (12)) to depict the consequences of inaccurately\
    \ retrieved LSTs:\nCase i: Atmospheric transmittance included in LST(τ), but without\
    \ consideration of the background\ntemperature and speciﬁc emissivity (Equation\
    \ (11)); and case ii: The background temperature and\nspeciﬁc emissivity included\
    \ in LST(ϵ), but without consideration of transmittance (Equation (12)).\nFor\
    \ BTsens without consideration of the atmospheric transmittance, a temperature\
    \ deviance of up\nto 0.4 K occurred (Figure 8a). This was mainly caused by water\
    \ vapour absorption in the thermal\ndomain. In contrast, omitting the background\
    \ temperature and speciﬁc emissivity led to a deviance\nof up to 0.6 K (Figure\
    \ 8b). This result was derived during cloudy sky conditions (Tbkg = 8.8 ◦C). In\
    \ a\nmodiﬁed scenario, with respect to the background temperature in clear sky\
    \ conditions, the temperature\ndeviation was up to 2.9 K (Figure 8c). In all scenarios,\
    \ the largest deviation was found for bare soil\nareas. During clear sky conditions,\
    \ Tbkg had minimal temperature −40 ◦C and maximal temperature\n10 ◦C, in the case\
    \ of a diffusely scattering sky [32]. Diffuse scattering (in overcast conditions)\
    \ leads to\nalmost identical measurements between the air temperature and the\
    \ observed background temperature\n(Tbkg). However, the background temperature\
    \ should be taken into account to minimise uncertainties\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12,\
    \ 1075\n17 of 27\nand to prevent the LST from being underestimated. In conclusion,\
    \ environmental thermal emission (if\nϵ < 1) is the most inﬂuential meteorological\
    \ parameter in thermal measurements.\nFigure 8.\nAberrations of BTsens and LST\
    \ for different assumptions: the dLSTtau map (a), only\nincluding the atmospheric\

    temperature (case ii) for overcast sky conditions; and the modiﬁed dLSTbkg’ map\
    \ (c) for clear sky\nconditions, to highlight the effects of leaving out essential\
    \ meteorological parameters.\nThe NDWI map (Figure 9a) was generated to detect\
    \ the pond’s surface and to reclassify the\ncorresponding emissivity (ϵw) of the\
    \ water using a determined NDWI threshold (Section 2.2.3). Based\non the emissivity\
    \ map (Figure 9b), the mean pond surface temperature (LSTpond) was retrieved (Figure\n\
    9c). Before and after the ﬂight over the agricultural experiment site (ﬂights\
    \ 1 and 3, respectively), we\nretrieved 24 suitable LST images (LSTpond) to validate\
    \ the thermal data using the measurements with\nthe pond thermocouples (Tpond).\
    \ Both LSTpond and Tpond were used to calculate the mean temperature\ndeviations\
    \ (dTpond) to assess the accuracy of retrieved LST.\nFigure 9. The NDWI map (a)\

    \ = 0.53 K, with a coefﬁcient of\ndetermination of R2 = 0.985 (n = 24). For ﬂight\
    \ 3 (Figure 10b), the MAE was dTpond_2 = 0.54 K and R2 =\n0.964 (n = 24).\nFigure\

    \ validation, especially for ﬂight 1, conﬁrmed the high signiﬁcance\nof the performance\
    \ of the retrieval algorithm (Equation (3)). During ﬂight 3, the correlation was\n\
    somewhat less signiﬁcant in comparison to ﬂight 1.\nThe temperature validation\
    \ of the rapeseed experiment (dTrape) also conﬁrmed the high\nperformance of the\
    \ LST retrieval (Figure 11). The MAE was dTrape = 0.41 K and R2 = 0.879 (n =\n\
    27).\nFigure 11. Correlation of the retrieved surface temperature (LSTrape) and\
    \ measured surface temperature\n(Trape) during ﬂight 1 over the rapeseed experiment\
    \ (11 April 2018, 13:34–13:49 CET).\nFor the UAV campaigns using the proposed\
    \ LST retrieval algorithm (Equation (3)), we found the\naccuracy of the thermal\
    \ measurements to be around MAE = 0.5 K.\n4. Discussion\nIn this study, we have\
    \ developed an UAV-based LST retrieval algorithm (Equation (3)) suitable for\n\
    conducting thermal campaigns, especially in agricultural areas. Agricultural applications\
    \ increasingly\ndemand precise and current LST maps for irrigation scheduling,\
    \ evapotranspiration and drought stress\nmonitoring, and plant disease detection.\
    \ A true physical temperature, as calculated by the LST retrieval\nof crops, is\
    \ essential for calculating indices such as the Vegetation Health Index (VHI)\
    \ or CWSI [13].\nThe accuracy of retrieved LST depends mainly on properly estimating\
    \ the emissivity of the surface\ntype (LSE). Thus, we have used the proposed NDVI\
    \ threshold method (Section 2.1.2) to distinguish the\nemissivities in three classes:\
    \ bare soil (NDVI < NDVIsoil), dense canopy (NDVI > NDVIveg), and\nmixed states\
    \ (Equation (9)). For dense canopy, we suggest a global NDVIveg of 0.814 (as observed\
    \ in\nsummer 2018) or around 0.8 (as proposed by [17]), which was averaged for\
    \ different crops (i.e., corn,\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n19 of 27\nwheat,\
    \ barley, and rape). For bare soil, we derived NDVIsoil to be 0.157, in agreement\
    \ with [30], or\naround 0.2 (as proposed by [17]). In the case of higher sand\
    \ content, lower NDVI values arise.\nThe determined emissivity of dense canopy\
    \ (ϵveg = 0.988) agreed with frequently cited values,\nas in [27,29,31,60]. However,\
    \ the plants must be healthy, as the emissivity decreases signiﬁcantly in\nthe\
    \ case of withered crops. In the study site, soil surfaces predominantly consisted\
    \ of loamy to silty\ntextures. Thus, we maintained an emissivity of bare soil\
    \ of ϵsoil = 0.935 (as proposed by [31,53]). For\na sandy soil texture, we suggest\
    \ a lower emissivity, such as 0.914 (as proposed by [30]). Regardless\nof the\
    \ emissivity of mixed resolution cells, the LST was underestimated for the affected\
    \ pixels by at\nleast 1 K (Figure 7c). The lower the emissivity, the higher the\
    \ impact of the background temperature\n(Tbkg) on the retrieved LST. Hence, we\
    \ recommend atmospheric correction, especially in (‘cold’) clear\nsky conditions,\
    \ in which observation periods commonly occur to ensure the best radiometric image\n\
    quality. However, this method reaches its limits in the case of lower emissivities\
    \ (e.g., ϵ = 0.88), such\nas those for dry vegetation [31,34]. Disregarding essential\
    \ meteorological parameters (Section 2.1.3)\nand assuming an overall emissivity\
    \ for dense canopy (for instance, of ϵveg = 0.985), a potential error of\nabout\
    \ 9 K occurs.\nFor data validation, we continuously measured the water temperature\
    \ of a nearby pond by\nthermocouples, which we compared with each set of 24 suitable\
    \ retrieved LST images of the pond from\nthe ﬂights before and after observing\
    \ the experiment. Water bodies provide a convenient opportunity\nfor reference\
    \ measurements, due to their relatively homogeneous and constant surface temperature.\n\
    For the pond, we assumed an emissivity of ϵw = 0.985 (according to [31,34]). The\
    \ mean emissivity (in\nthe LWIR range of the camera) of distilled water (ϵ = 0.986),\
    \ obtained from the emissivity library of the\nModerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer\
    \ (MODIS) conﬁrms this assumption [61].\nThe advantages and disadvantages of conducting\
    \ thermography under homogeneously cloudy\nor clear sky conditions remain to be\
    \ discussed: Clear sky conditions provide the most contrasting\nresults; and cloudless\
    \ weather is indispensable for the validation of airborne or satellite data with\
    \ UAV\nobservations. However, the lower the emissivity, the higher the reﬂection\
    \ of the surface. Therefore, the\nimpact of environmental thermal emissions on\
    \ bare soils and dry vegetation is the greatest, which must\nbe taken into consideration.\
    \ Cloudy conditions have a strong impact on the quality of the captured\nthermal\
    \ imagery, since they reduce the contrast and radiometric resolution [13]. However,\
    \ the impact\nof environmental thermal emissions is low (isotropic radiation)\
    \ and the background temperature is\nquite similar to the air temperature. Scenarios\
    \ with the biggest drawbacks are rapidly changing air\nand surface temperatures\
    \ or cloud shadows in the recordings. In order to ensure the best lighting\nconditions,\
    \ we recommend thermal measurements in clear sky or, at least, in homogeneously\
    \ cloudy\nconditions.\nIn conclusion, the validations showed MAEs of dTpond_1\
    \ = 0.53 K (R2 = 0.985) and dTpond_2 = 0.54 K\n(R2 = 0.964), respectively. These\
    \ results conﬁrm the highly signiﬁcant performance of the retrieval\nalgorithm\
    \ (Equation (3)). For the thermal measurements, we stated an MAE of about 0.5\
    \ K.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this study, we present a semi-supervised algorithm that\
    \ combines UAV-based thermal infrared\nand multispectral measurements in order\
    \ to obtain precise LST maps for agricultural applications. For\nthis purpose,\
    \ we have developed an innovative dual sensor platform mounted on a ﬁxed-wing\n\
    glider that simultaneously captures VNIR and LWIR images.\nIn the analyses, we\
    \ have noted\nthe improvements that can be achieved by performing an atmospheric\
    \ correction to minimise the\nuncertainties. The processing chain incorporates:\n\
    1.\nConstruction of an ortho-mosaic for NDVI maps, LST maps, and emissivity maps;\n\
    2.\nAtmospheric correction, including the background temperature; and\n3.\nEmissivity\
    \ estimation for three surface types (bare soil, dense canopy, and mixed states).\n\
    Remote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n20 of 27\nThe high spatial resolution of the LST\
    \ maps and the capacity of the UAV system to observe the\nentire study site (181\
    \ ha) within 3–6 hours allow for operational agricultural applications and the\n\
    cost-effective validation of airborne and satellite data complying with high quality\
    \ standards. Special\nadvantages of the proposed method for agricultural applications\
    \ are:\n1.\nLow-cost UAV campaigns for the thermal mapping of large areas with\
    \ high repetition rates;\n2.\nIrrigation management, crop water stress monitoring,\
    \ and plant disease detection; and\n3.\nHigh spatial resolution of the LST maps\
    \ (10 cm/pixel) for thermography at the leaf level.\nThis approach requires neither\
    \ LST ground stations (except for validation procedures) nor in-situ\nstations\
    \ to account for canopy emissivity change over time. However, the proposed NDVI\
    \ threshold\nmethod needs NDVI means of the current canopy to estimate the emissivities.\
    \ In order to ensure\nhigh quality LST results, we recommend performing atmospheric\
    \ corrections and considering the\nbackground temperature. Further investigation\
    \ is needed to ﬁnd a method for the emissivity estimation\nof senescent and withered\
    \ vegetation, in order to prevent the LST from being underestimated in the\ncase\
    \ of lower emissivities.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.H., B.S.\

    \ A.1. Pre-Processing of VNIR and LWIR Data\nImmediately before take-off and after\
    \ landing, we captured three images (in all VNIR bands) of\na calibrated reﬂectance\
    \ panel (MicaSense; Inc., Seattle, WA, USA). Four additional greyscale tarps\n\
    (sailcloth, calibrated by a ﬁeld spectrometer) were captured during the ﬂights.\
    \ All images contained\nGPS, roll, pitch, and yaw angle information as metadata\
    \ (exchangeable image ﬁle format, Exif) obtained\nfrom the VNIR sensor. The stored\
    \ GPS and solid angle information were used by the ortho-mosaic\nsoftware to correct\
    \ the position of the imagery. The total captured VNIR imagery (including all\
    \ four\nbands) comprised about 7300 recordings (resulting from a frame rate of\
    \ 2/3 Hz) with a volume of about\n17 GB, stored as a 16-bit (binary raw data,\
    \ raw) tagged image ﬁle format (TIFF). The total captured\nLWIR imagery comprised\
    \ about 24,000 recordings (with a frame rate of 8.33 Hz) with a volume of\nabout\
    \ 5 GB, stored as 14-bit raw radiometric data stream (TMC). The ThermoViewer 2.1.6\
    \ software\nwas used to convert the TMC ﬁles into the 16-bit TIFF format, including\
    \ metadata with GPS and\nheading information from the autopilot as Exif data.\
    \ The amount of captured imagery was necessary\nto generate ortho-mosaics and\
    \ to compensate for the loss of discarded images (i.e., those taken during\nthe\
    \ launch/landing maneuvers and blurred recordings). The VNIR images of the calibrated\
    \ reﬂectance\npanels were incorporated for radiometric calibration. The PhotoScan\
    \ 1.4.2 software (Agisoft PhotoScan,\nSt. Petersburg, Russia) was used for reﬂectance\
    \ calibration and for normalisation of the band sensitivity.\nFor thermal sensors,\
    \ radiometric calibration is essential to correctly convert raw DN into (spectral)\n\
    radiance. The DN of the thermal camera (FLIR Tau 2 640) consists of speciﬁc instrument\
    \ factors, such\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 1075\n21 of 27\nas the self-emission of\
    \ the detector and its spectral response curve (FLIR’s Tau 2 spectral response\n\
    curve [62]). Calibrated blackbody sources at exactly known temperatures allow\
    \ us to derive the spectral\nresponse curve [63]. This camera is the most sensitive\
    \ at around 9.75 µm. Blackbody calibration,\nhowever, was done by the manufacturer\
    \ FLIR. The ThermoViewer 2.1.6 software was used for NUC\nand drift compensation\
    \ of the LWIR imagery (Section 2.1.1). Thermal reﬂections at the land surface\
    \ by\nemitting background objects (e.g., buildings) and re-emission—for instance,\
    \ by lower clouds—were\ndetermined to correct the LWIR data (Equation (3)). A\
    \ pyrometer (optris MSPro; Optris GmbH, Berlin,\nGermany), with emissivity set\
    \ to ϵ = 1, was used to quantify the background temperature (Tbkg) on a\npanel\
    \ of crumpled aluminium foil [29,32,64], which had a very low emissivity of ϵ\
    \ = 0.03 (0.04 at 10\nµm [53]) and acted as an isotropically reﬂecting LAMBERT\
    \ radiator (see LAMBERT’s cosine law, 1760).\nThe pyrometer indirectly captured\
    \ the background temperature in the range of 8–14 µm (accuracy: ±1\n◦C). As a\
    \ pre-check, we directly measured the overhead sky (not including the sun) to\
    \ compare with\nthe Tbkg value obtained from the aluminium panel [65]. Averaged\
    \ temperatures of Tbkg from before,\nduring, and after the ﬂights were used for\
    \ atmospheric correction.\nAppendix A.2. Ortho-Mosaic Construction and Used Tools\
    \ and Parameters\nOverlaps of the captured imagery were standardised for the smallest\
    \ ﬁeld of view (FOV), therefore\nbased on the LWIR camera. Generally, overlaps\
    \ result from the FOV and ﬂight altitude, which was\nabout 77 meters. In addition,\
    \ forward overlaps depend on the frame rate and the UAV’s ground speed.\nThe resulting\
    \ distance between each ﬂight line was about 25.5 meters, which was relevant for\
    \ the side\noverlaps. Based on the ground speed of 5–8 ms−1, the FOV of the LWIR\
    \ camera lens (see Table 1), and\nthe frame rate (LWIR: 8.33 Hz), the forward\
    \ overlap was about 98.8% and side overlap was about 60%.\nMore detailed information\
    \ is listed in Table A1.\nTable A1. Details on the forward and side overlap in\

    \ parameters of reﬂectance panels and sun sensor\nwas executed, taking into account\
    \ the captured VNIR images of the calibrated reﬂectance panels. The\nrequired\
    \ reﬂectance values of each band were either obtained from the company of the\
    \ used panel or\nfrom ﬁeld spectrometer measurements of the four greyscale tarps\
    \ described above (Section 2.2.3). The\nNormalize band sensitivity tool was utilised\
    \ to include the spectral response (for each band) of the VNIR\nsensor (contained\
    \ as metadata). For the VNIR sensor, the following pre-calibrated lens parameters\n\
    were used: focal length (f, pixels), co-ordinates of the main point (cx and cy),\
    \ and radial distortion\ncoefﬁcients (k1–k4). For the LWIR camera, the following\
    \ most ﬁtting geometric lens parameters, which\nwere generated during self-calibration\
    \ in the alignment process (of the Adaptive camera model ﬁtting\ntool), were used\
    \ as ﬁxed pre-calibrated values: f, cx and cy, k1–k4, biased transformation coefﬁcients\
    \ (b1\nand b2), and tangential distortion coefﬁcients (p1–p4). After the pre-processing\
    \ steps, the ortho-mosaic\nwas constructed, generating both the VNIR and LWIR\
    \ maps. Ortho-mosaic construction is a common\nmethod in photogrammetry. Various\
    \ structure from motion (SFM) software, such as PhotoScan, Pix4D\n(Pix4D, Lausanne,\
    \ Switzerland), and VisualSFM (a freeware GUI application) provide tools to generate\n\
    digital surface models (DSM) and ortho-images while compensating for undesirable\
    \ lens distortion [46].\nEven when using a high-performance computer with two\
    \ graphics cards (for a total of 24 GB of GDDR5\nmemory), mosaic construction\
    \ is a time-consuming process due to the quantity of high-resolution\nimagery\
    \ and the required processing operations (the appropriate parameters are listed\
    \ in Table A2).\nOrtho-mosaic construction of the entire study site, using the\
    \ software PhotoScan 1.4.2, took us about\nthree days. The remaining calculations\
    \ (Figure 1) were conducted using the R language. In this context,\nRemote Sens.\

    \ applied to exclude blurry images from further\nanalysis. As the frame rate of\
    \ the thermal image data acquisition was quite high, the sharpest image\nfrom\
    \ each sequence of ﬁve consecutive recorded images was identiﬁed. The identiﬁcation\
    \ of the\nsharpest image was done by calculating an image quality measure from\
    \ the representation of every\nsingle image in the frequency domain after applying\
    \ a 2D FOURIER transform. A detailed description\nof this method can be found\
    \ in [66]. The image with the highest image quality measure within each\nsequence\
    \ was selected. Thus, only the sharpest images were used in the subsequent process\

    \a\nAbstract: As the key principle of precision farming, variation of actual crop\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET)\nwithin the ﬁeld serves as the basis for crop management.\
    \ Although the estimation of evapotranspiration\nhas achieved great progress through\
    \ the combination of diﬀerent remote sensing data and the FAO-56\ncrop coeﬃcient\
    \ (Kc) method, lack of the accurate crop water stress coeﬃcient (Ks) at diﬀerent\n\
    space–time scales still hinder its operational application to farmer practices.\
    \ This work aims to explore\nthe potential of multispectral images taken from\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for estimating the\ntemporal and spatial variability\
    \ of Ks under the water stress condition and mapping the variability of\nﬁeld\
    \ maize ET combined with the FAO-56 Kc model. To search for an optimal estimation\
    \ method,\nthe performance of several models was compared including models based\
    \ on Ks either derived\nfrom the crop water stress index (CWSI) or calculated\
    \ by the canopy temperature ratio (Tc ratio),\nand combined with the basal crop\
    \ coeﬃcient (Kcb) based on the normalized diﬀerence vegetation\nindex (NDVI).\
    \ Compared with the Ks derived from the Tc ratio, the CWSI-based Ks responded\
    \ well to\nwater stress and had strong applicability and convenience. The results\
    \ of the comparison show that\nET derived from the Ks-CWSI had a higher correlation\
    \ with the modiﬁed FAO-56 method, with an\nR2 = 0.81, root mean square error (RMSE)\
    \ = 0.95 mm/d, and d = 0.94. In contrast, ET derived from\nthe Ks-Tc ratio had\
    \ a relatively lower correlation with an R2 = 0.68 and RMSE = 1.25 mm/d. To obtain\n\
    the evapotranspiration status of the whole maize ﬁeld and formulate reasonable\
    \ irrigation schedules,\nthe CWSI obtained by a handheld infrared thermometer\
    \ was inverted by the renormalized diﬀerence\nvegetation index (RDVI) and the\
    \ transformed chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance index (TCARI).\nThen, the whole\
    \ map of Ks can be derived from the VIs by the relationship between CWSI and Ks\n\
    and can be taken as the basic input for ET estimation at the ﬁeld scale. The ﬁnal\
    \ ET results based on\nmultispectral UAV interpolation measurements can well reﬂect\
    \ the crop ET status under diﬀerent\nirrigation levels, and greatly help to improve\
    \ irrigation scheduling through more precise management\nof deﬁcit irrigation.\n\

    \ climate is characterized by long periods of drought and strong interannual\n\
    variability in rainfall amounts and distribution, leading to high year-to-year\
    \ variability in agricultural\ndevelopment and production [1]. The North China\
    \ Plain is one of the most important agricultural\nregions because it accounts\
    \ for about one-ﬁfth of national food production. In this area, rainfall cannot\n\
    meet the crop water requirements, and the overexploitation of groundwater aggravates\
    \ water scarcity,\nreduces the groundwater table, and threatens sustainable agriculture\
    \ [2]. Irrigation is then necessary\nto prevent water stress and ensure proﬁtable\
    \ yields. To determine the optimal irrigation scheduling\nand adopt such strategies\
    \ eﬃciently, it is necessary to have reliable methods of providing information\n\
    about the temporal and spatial variability of crop evapotranspiration (ET) within\
    \ the ﬁeld scale [3].\nThe direct ET measured methods consist of the use of a\
    \ lysimeter, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio,\nand soil water balance. However, they\
    \ face important limitations due to expensive techniques and\nlow spatial representativeness\
    \ of measurements, particularly in agricultural ﬁelds characterized by a\nhigh\
    \ level of heterogeneity in terms of crops and water status [4]. The indirect\
    \ form can be made from\nempirical equations that use agronomic, biophysical,\
    \ and meteorological elements as input variables [5].\nAs the most widely used\
    \ method for the determination of ET, the FAO-56 dual crop coeﬃcient (Kc)\napproach,\
    \ published by the Food and Agriculture Organization in Irrigation and Drainage\
    \ Paper No.\n56 [6], has received favorable acceptance and application worldwide\
    \ [5,7]. The dual Kc approach\ndescribes the relationship between the daily evapotranspiration\
    \ of a given crop and the reference\nevapotranspiration (ET0) by separating the\
    \ single crop coeﬃcient into the basal crop coeﬃcient (Kcb),\nsoil water evaporation\
    \ (Ke) coeﬃcient, and water stress coeﬃcient (Ks). Although simple in design and\n\
    construction, the dual Kc method successfully incorporates a number of consistent\
    \ and compensating\nfactors that distinguishes the ET of any unique crop from\
    \ that of the reference ET [7]. However, the\nmethod is mainly used for the ET\
    \ estimation based on stationary measurements and cannot provide a\nﬁne estimation\
    \ due to inconsistent crop growth.\nTo explore the distribution of crop ET within\
    \ the ﬁeld scale, remote sensing technology provides a\ndependable basis [8].\
    \ The crop coeﬃcient generated from remote sensing based on canopy reﬂectance\n\
    responds to the actual crop condition, captures the variability among diﬀerent\
    \ local atmosphere\nconditions and ﬁeld spatial variability [9], and reﬂects the\
    \ heterogeneity of plant development in large\nirrigated ﬁelds [10–14]. Studies\
    \ have established diﬀerent inversion models between vegetation indices\n(VIs)\
    \ and Kcb [15–18]. For decades, satellite remote sensing images have been the\
    \ main data sources to\nintegrate the FAO-56 for the estimation of crop ET. For\
    \ example, Bellvert et al. [19] used a dataset of the\nvegetation index (NDVI)\
    \ derived from Landsat-8 to facilitate the estimation of the Kcb, and potential\n\
    crop water use. However, the low spatial and temporal resolution of satellite\
    \ data limits its further\napplication in estimating ET within the ﬁeld scale.\
    \ At the same time, cloud cover remains a signiﬁcant\nchallenge in satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing [20].\nAs one of the most important emerging remote-sensing platforms,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) have been gradually employed in precise agriculture.\
    \ Soon, UAVs will be vital tools for\ngrowers as they can cover large areas, and\
    \ take advantage of new sensing, mapping, and data analytical\ntechnologies [21–23].\
    \ Real time mapping and rapid image analysis also provide the early detection\
    \ of\nplant water status for timely irrigation scheduling [24]. Based on these\
    \ advantages, UAVs have broad\napplication prospects for more sophisticated ET\
    \ management within the ﬁeld scale. When dealing\nwith the estimation of ET based\
    \ on a combination of UAV and the dual Kc method under water stress\nconditions,\
    \ four parameters are required: ET0, Kcb, Ke, and Ks. ET0 can be estimated using\
    \ the FAO\nPenman–Monteith formula and the collected meteorological data [25].\
    \ Ke is clearly correlated with\nfoliage cover and irrigation/rainfall event,\
    \ and becomes negligible when the crop completely covers the\nsoil [26]. Many\
    \ studies have validated that Kcb has a strong correlation with NDVI and foliage\
    \ cover,\nand applied to practical water requirement monitoring [16,27]. For instance,\
    \ Han et al. [28] studied the\nfeasibility of UAV multispectral remote sensing\
    \ in the estimation of maize crop coeﬃcients at diﬀerent\ngrowth stages. The results\
    \ showed a strong relationship between UAV-measured NDVI and Kcb, with\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n3 of 22\nan R2 value of 0.82. Although the assimilation\
    \ of FAO-56 and remote sensing data has made such great\nprogress, discrepancies\
    \ between the measured and simulated ET remained when water stress occurred.\n\
    The accurate estimation of Ks is the key to accurately estimate crop ET using\
    \ UAV remote sensing\ndata under water stress conditions. Speciﬁcally, Ks represents\
    \ the fraction of potential transpiration\nrate, with a value from 1 to 0, according\
    \ to the level of water stress, which is directly related to the\nwater content\
    \ in the root zone. Less attention has been paid on determining the water stress\
    \ coeﬃcient\nKs from the remote sensing data because there are diﬃculties in estimating\
    \ soil and root zone moisture\n(or root zone depletion) from remote sensing data\
    \ [29]. It is necessary to use a new indictor, which\nis easy to obtain and can\
    \ respond to real-time plant-water status. Studies [30,31] have proven that\n\
    canopy temperature (Tc) is closely related to soil water content, actual transpiration,\
    \ and crop water\nstress status. Therefore, Ks and canopy temperature are deﬁnitely\
    \ related to each other. Olivera et\nal. [32] used the vegetation and soil temperatures\
    \ retrieved from LST (land surface temperature) data\nderived from the eddy covariance\
    \ system to estimate the Ks. This method is based on the polygon\ndeﬁned in the\
    \ LST–VI space, which needs a large amount of temperature data and has a complex\n\
    analysis procedure. Recently, studies have evaluated indices based on Tc that\
    \ require less information\nfor detecting crop water stress and have shown that\
    \ Ks is related to several crop water stress indices.\nFor instance, Bausch et\
    \ al. [18] successfully used a ratio of canopy temperature as a substitute for\
    \ the\nsoil moisture based Ks. The ET diﬀerence between the two deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ treatments for the 25-day\ninvestigative period calculated by Tc ratio and water\
    \ balance techniques was 21 mm and 4 mm. Kullberg\net al. [33] observed that using\
    \ an appropriate Ks method had the potential to improve irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ to properly manage stress and ensure optimum crop yield under a limited irrigation\
    \ water\nsupply. A noted advantage of non-dimensional crop indices such as CWSI\
    \ (crop water stress index)\nis that they are typically considered to be scalable\
    \ to Ks for ET estimation (i.e., Ks = 1 − CWSI). This\nis also the basis behind\
    \ the Tc ratio approach, although it has dimensionality restrictions [34]. For\n\
    the estimation of Ks based on water stress indices, most studies have used handled\
    \ or stationary\ninfrared thermometers [33–35]. A ground-based platform is still\
    \ time consuming and labor intensive.\nAdditionally, like the estimation by counting\
    \ root zone depletion, it is impractical to estimate ET by\ncombining the Kcb\
    \ of large image pixels with Ks based on ground-point measurements due to the\n\
    heterogeneities of the crop and soil status.\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ technology, high-resolution thermal imagery acquired by\nUAVs has been used\
    \ to map plant water stress indices such as the CWSI, and water deﬁcit index (WDI).\n\
    However, when Kcb and Ks are obtained from diﬀerent sensors (i.e., multispectral\
    \ and thermal sensors),\nthe problem of data fusion and matching will be obstacles\
    \ to ET estimation with the UAV system.\nFor example, as the image resolution\
    \ obtained by the two sensors is diﬀerent, image matching with\ndiﬀerent resolutions\
    \ requires a complicated process. Most importantly, the biggest eﬀect is not only\
    \ on\nthe pixel mixing due to the downscale, but on the georectiﬁcation and co-registration\
    \ of the images,\ntherefore, the asynchronous time and space of the Ks and Kcb\
    \ may inﬂuence the acquisition of maize\nET. Previous studies have indicated that\
    \ multispectral VIs have signiﬁcantly high correlation with\nwater stress indicators.\
    \ For example, Samuel et al. [36] summarized the common spectral vegetation\n\
    indices (VIs) that have been correlated to plant water stress. Studies [37–39]\
    \ suggested that the\nrenormalized diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI) and transformed\
    \ chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance\nindex (TCARI) are useful in plant stress\
    \ monitoring. Therefore, the synchronized acquisition of Kcb\nand Ks using one\
    \ sensor (i.e., a multispectral camera) should be explored.\nThis study aimed\
    \ to estimate more accurate ET maps with UAV-based multispectral images over\n\
    maize in the semiarid region of the North China Plain by applying the FAO-56 dual\
    \ Kc approach.\nMore speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst compared the ET derived from water stress\
    \ indices (CWSI and Tc ratio) and\nNDVI to that calculated with the modiﬁed FAO-56\
    \ dual Kc method by evaluating the suitable water\nstress indicator for local\
    \ maize ET estimation. Next, we investigated the potential of assimilating ET\n\
    estimation with VIs data (multispectral UAV) through the retrieve relation between\
    \ the water stress\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n4 of 22\nindex and VIs to eliminate\
    \ discrepancies caused by using data at diﬀerent scales and obtain a high\nresolution\
    \ (4.7 cm) spatial-temporal ET map.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study Site\

    \ Factors and Soil Water Content\nThe weather data were obtained from an automated\
    \ weather station located on a grass reference\nsurface (0.95 ha) that was 1000\
    \ meters away from the research ﬁeld, with observations of rainfall, air\ntemperature\
    \ (Ta), humidity, net solar radiation (Rn), and wind speed (2 m above the reference\
    \ surface).\nExcept for rainfall, the data acquisition interval was 30 minutes.\n\
    Soil water content (SWC) was measured two or three times each week on the day\
    \ before or after\nirrigation within each sampling plot by the traditional gravimetric\
    \ method [43]. At each sampling\nplot, three sampling sites were randomly chosen\
    \ around the center. The samples were collected by soil\naugers at depths of 30\
    \ cm, 60 cm, 90 cm, and 120 cm. Soil samples were put in aluminum boxes to\navoid\
    \ the inﬂuence of evaporation. Basically, the gravimetric method involves taking\
    \ soil samples,\nweighing, oven-drying, and reweighing them, then expressing the\
    \ moisture content (i.e., loss in weight)\nas a percentage of the oven-dry weight.\
    \ This is the weight or mass basis of expressing soil moisture\ncontent. Then,\
    \ by multiplying the bulk density, the results can be expressed in terms of volume\
    \ [44].\nThe average SWC (θ) was estimated by interpolating the soil moisture\
    \ observations of the diﬀerent\ndepths belonging to the root-zone of maize.\n\
    2.2.2. Measurement of Maize Parameters\nMaize canopy temperature (Tc) and UAV\
    \ multispectral data were synchronously collected under\nclear sky at solar noon.\
    \ Tc was collected during the full foliage cover period (6–29 August 2017\nincluding\
    \ the reproductive and maturation stages). A handheld infrared thermometer (Raytek\
    \ ST60+,\nRaytek Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was used to measure Tc with a measurement\
    \ error of ±1 ◦C or\n±1% of the reading. The larger values were adopted in the\
    \ practical application. The temperature and\nspectral ranges of the Raytek ST60+\
    \ are −32–600 ◦C and 8–14 µm, respectively. The emissivity value\nwas set to 0.97\
    \ [45]. To avoid the interference of soil, the thermometer was used to sweep the\
    \ canopy\n(about 120◦) perpendicular to the row, 30 cm above the canopy, and at\
    \ a 15◦ horizontal angle. At each\nsample site, three measurements were made to\
    \ obtain the Tc. The values averaged over one sampling\nsite or over one plot\
    \ (yellow circle in Figure 1c) were taken to represent their status.\nThe main\
    \ plant parameters needed to run the modiﬁed FAO-56 model (see Section 2.2.3)\
    \ are\ncanopy height (h) and leaf area index (LAI). A random sampling method was\
    \ used to collect the LAI\nand plant height of maize. An LAI-2200C canopy analyzer\
    \ (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA)\nwas used to measure the LAI of maize;\
    \ 10 sampling points were randomly selected for each plot and\nthe average value\
    \ was obtained. For each plot plant height of maize, 15 representative maize plants\n\
    were randomly selected and measured by tape measure. Cubic spline interpolation\
    \ is a piecewise\nregression approach that uses third-order polynomials for interpolation\
    \ between a series of paired\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n7 of 22\ndata points\
    \ [14]. Thus, cubic spline was used to process the measured LAI and plant height\
    \ data, and\nthen the daily sequence of maize LAI and plant height data were obtained.\n\
    2.2.3. The Modiﬁed FAO-56 Dual Crop Coeﬃcient Method\nIn FAO-56, the actual ET\
    \ is deﬁned as the product of crop coeﬃcient (Kc) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (ET0) [26]. In the dual Kc model, Kc is split into two factors that separately\n\
    describe the evaporation (Ke) and transpiration (Kcb) components. The method has\
    \ been widely used\nin scheduling irrigation and improving agricultural production\
    \ [46]. FAO-56 ET is estimated as follows:\nET = ET0 ∗ (KcbKs + Ke),\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ ET is in mm/d; Ke is the evaporation coeﬃcient of the bare soil fraction; Kcb\
    \ is the basal crop\ncoeﬃcient; Ks is the water stress coeﬃcient; and ET0 is the\
    \ grass reference evapotranspiration in\nmm/d. The stages of canopy temperature\
    \ acquisition and ET estimation were in the period of high\ncoverage (i.e., vegetation\
    \ cover ranging from 0.79 to 0.84 as estimated by an empirical equation based\n\
    on NDVI [47]). With Ke = 0.25 × (1 − fc) [26], it had a minor inﬂuence on total\
    \ ET and was ignored.\nThe ET0 of this reference surface was estimated according\
    \ to the following Penman–Monteith\nequation:\nET0 =\n0.408∆(Rn − G) + γ\n900\n\
    T+273u2(es − ea)\n∆ + γ(1 + 0.34u2)\n,\n(2)\nwhere Rn is the net radiation at\
    \ the crop surface; G is the soil heat ﬂux density (as the magnitude of the\n\
    1-day or 10-day soil heat ﬂux beneath the grass reference surface is relatively\
    \ small, it may be ignored,\nthus Gday = 0 [26]); T is the mean daily air temperature\
    \ at 2 m height; u2 is the wind speed at 2 m\nheight; es is the saturation vapor\
    \ pressure; ea is the actual vapor pressure; ∆ is the slope vapor pressure\ncurve;\
    \ and γ is a psychrometric constant.\nThe basal crop coeﬃcient, Kcb, is generally\
    \ obtained from the guidelines of FAO-56 by looking-up\nthe tabulated value at\
    \ every growth stage and then linearly interpolating it to obtain the daily values.\n\
    The approach from the original FAO-56 dual Kc procedures cannot calculate the\
    \ daily actual value\nof Kcb [42]. Feng et al. [48] modiﬁed Kcb with LAI through\
    \ eddy covariance systems near the\nexperimentation site, which illustrated that\
    \ the modiﬁed dual crop coeﬃcient method could estimate\nmaize ET accurately on\
    \ the North China Plain. Therefore, in order to evaluate the dynamic changes of\n\
    ET in the maize ﬁeld more accurately, the canopy height and LAI were used to modify\
    \ the dynamic\nKcb. The modiﬁed FAO-56 Kcb value can be calculated by Equations\
    \ (3) and (4):\nKcb − Tab = Kc,min +\n\x10\nKcb,full − Kc,min\n\x11\n(1 − exp[−kLAI])\
    \ ,\n(3)\nKcb, full = min(1 + 0.1h, Kc,max) + [0.04(u2 − 2) − 0.004(RHmin − 45)]\n\
    \ \nh\n3\n!0.3\n,\n(4)\nwhere Kc,min is the minimum for bare soil (0.15); Kcb,full\
    \ is the estimated basal Kcb for vegetation having\nfull ground cover; Kc,max\
    \ is the maximum Kc (1.2); RHmin is the minimum relative humidity (%); and k\n\
    is the canopy attenuation coeﬃcient of radiation, and the value of k is listed\
    \ in Table 2.\nThe crop water stress coeﬃcient Ks related to the actual root zone\
    \ water content is a key parameter\nfor calculating and simulating soil water\
    \ conditions. Several linear and curvilinear functions have been\nproposed to\
    \ adjust for the eﬀects of decreasing available water on ET or for the Ks used\
    \ in Equation (1).\nThe simple linear model for estimating Ks as described in\
    \ FAO-33 is commonly used and calculated by\nEquation (5) ,which is an equivalent\
    \ expression to the FAO-56 Ks procedure [49].\nKs − FAO =\n\n1,\nθ ≥ θj\n\

    \ a minimum value (maintained during the\ninitial crop growth stage at 0.1 m)\
    \ and a maximum value (that reached 1 m at the beginning of the\nmid-season stage).\
    \ The maximum value was measured in the ﬁeld and was equal to 1 m, according to\n\
    FAO-56 [6]. When the θ was lower than θj, the crop begins to reach the stress\
    \ period (Ks < 1), and if θ\nis less than θwp, the crop does not absorb water\
    \ from the root zone (Ks = 0). Values for Equations (5)\nand (6) are listed in\

    \ \nFigure 3. Schematic diagram of the UAV multispectral remote sensing system\
    \ developed in this study.\nDuring the study period (20 June to 29 August 2017),\
    \ 11 UAV ﬂights were conducted on sunny\ndays between 11:00 and 13:00 local time\
    \ (Chinese standard time, 11:44–13:44) with the RedEdge camera\nlens vertically\
    \ downward, and an 80% heading and side overlap. The ﬂight height, speed, and\
    \ pixel\nresolution were 70 m (relative ﬂying height), 5 m/s, and 4.7 cm, respectively.\
    \ A total of 2185 images (ﬁve\nbands) were collected during a single ﬂight and\
    \ Pix4DMapper software was used for image mosaicking.\nTo establish the regression\
    \ models between UAV-based multispectral VIs and crop coeﬃcients\n(NDVI vs. Kcb\
    \ and TRCAI/RDVI vs. Ks), three VIs were selected: NDVI [50], transformed chlorophyll\n\
    Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n9 of 22\nabsorption in reﬂectance index (TCARI) [51],\
    \ and the renormalized diﬀerence vegetation index\n(RDVI) [52]. In addition, cubic\
    \ spline interpolation was used to determine the VI values between two\nﬂight\
    \ overpasses. Their calculation equations are as follows:\nNDVI = ρnir − ρred\n\
    ρnir + ρred\n,\n(7)\nTCARI = 3\nh\x10\nρrededge − ρred\n\x11\n− 0.2\n\x10\nρrededge\

    \ + ρred\n,\n(9)\nwhere ρnir, ρred, ρrededge, and ρgreen are the reﬂectance values\
    \ of ground objects in the near-infrared, red,\nred-edge, and green bands, respectively.\n\
    2.2.5. Crop Coeﬃcient Estimation Using Reﬂectance Data\nReﬂectance-based basal\
    \ crop coeﬃcient (Kcb) methods have been used to improve the irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ of maize. NDVI is one of the most widely used indices for estimating crop parameters.\n\
    This index is highly sensitive to variations of LAI and the fraction of the ground\
    \ that is covered by\nvegetation, (fc). The NDVI has a linear relationship with\
    \ fc along the whole range of vegetation cover [47].\nAccordingly in this study,\
    \ Equation (10) was used for fc estimation. In this study, one 12 m × 12 m area\n\
    was selected as the spectral sampling plot in each treatment (yellow box in Figure\
    \ 1b). Studies [53,54]\nshowed that Kcb can be estimated from fc.\nfc =\nNDVI\
    \ − NDVImin\nNDVImax − NDVImin\n,\n(10)\nwhere NDVImin and NDVImax are the minimum\
    \ and the maximum values of the NDVI associated\nwith bare soil and dense vegetation,\
    \ respectively. Once fc has been obtained through Equation (10), the\nKcb can\
    \ be estimated as:\nKcb − NDVI = 1.13 fc + 0.14,\n(11)\nThe two diﬀerent Ks obtained\
    \ from CWSI and Tc ratio were derived from the handheld infrared\nthermometer,\
    \ with daily values taken around local times between 11:00 and 13:00 (local time),\
    \ which\nare approximate times of peak stress.\nJackson et al. [30] showed that\
    \ CWSI is inversely related to the water use of the crop under\nconsideration;\
    \ Ks can also be calculated from CWSI by:\nKs−CWSI = 1 − CWSI,\n(12)\nOne of the\
    \ widely used methods for estimating CWSI is based on measured canopy\ntemperature\
    \ [30,55]. The CWSI is deﬁned in Equation (13).\nCWSI = dTm − dTLL\ndTUL − dTLL\n\
    ,\n(13)\nwhere dTm, dTLL, and dTUL are the actual measurement, lower limit, and\
    \ upper limit of the\ncanopy–air temperature diﬀerence (Tc−Ta), respectively.\n\
    More detailed information about local\nCWSI measurements can be found in Zhang\
    \ et al. [39]. CWSI = 0 indicates no water stress, while\nCWSI = 1 indicates the\
    \ most severe stress.\nZhang et al. [39] established linear regression models\
    \ (R2 = 0.80, p < 0.001) between TRCAI/RDVI\nand CWSI (Equation (14)). The local\
    \ calibration of CWSI performed in [39] was also retained here.\nThus, we could\
    \ integrate the remote sensing data into the Ks model by establishing a stable\
    \ relationship\nbetween VIs and CWSI. According to the relationship between Ks\
    \ and CWSI (i.e., Ks = 1 − CWSI)\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n10 of 22\nand to\
    \ rescale the Ks value between 0 and 1, the linear regression models can been\

    \ alternative method to evaluate water stress that only requires the crop canopy\
    \ temperature\nwas proposed by Bausch et al. [35]. The relationship between Ks\
    \ and Tc ratio is as follows:\nKs−Tc ratio = Tc ratio = TcNS\nTc\n,\n(16)\nwhere\
    \ Tc ratio is a stress coeﬃcient proposed as a surrogate for the water stress\
    \ coeﬃcient Ks from\nFAO-56. Tc is the canopy temperature and TcNS is the temperature\
    \ of a fully irrigated, non-stressed\ncanopy, which was chosen as the lowest canopy\
    \ temperature observed at the given timestamp including\nall treatments [34].\
    \ This temperature ratio was found to be capable of quantitatively monitoring\n\
    water stress and can potentially be used in the place of the water stress coeﬃcient\
    \ when soil water\nmeasurements are not available.\n2.2.6. Evapotranspiration\
    \ Comparison and Statistical Analysis\nDue to the lack of validation information\
    \ from an eddy covariance tower or lysimeter, the ET\nestimated by the modiﬁed\
    \ dual Kc method [42,48] was used to validate the model. Ding et al. [42]\nfound\
    \ good agreement between the predicted ET and transpiration using the modiﬁed\
    \ model and\nthe measurements through the lysimeter for maize in 2010, with a\
    \ slope of linear regression of 0.99\n(R2 = 0.90) and 1.01 (R2 = 0.92). Feng et\
    \ al. [48] also obtained similar results and suggested that the\nmodiﬁed dual\
    \ crop coeﬃcient method was suitable for calculating the actual daily ET of the\
    \ main\ncrops across the North China Plain. Studies [56,57] also used the local\
    \ ET estimated by the FAO-56\nKc method to validate the derived ET from their\
    \ model. Thus, employing the ET data estimated by\nthe modiﬁed FAO-56 dual Kc\
    \ method as the validation set had certain accuracy in this study. The\nsimulated\
    \ daily ET of the maize derived from the two Ks methods and NDVI-based Kcb methods\n\
    (ET-CWSI and ET-ratio) were compared with the values obtained from the modiﬁed\
    \ FAO-56 dual\ncrop coeﬃcient method. The ET-CWSI, ET-ratio, and ET-FAO values\
    \ were compared by using a linear\nregression analysis and the statistical parameters\
    \ of the coeﬃcient of determination (R2), root mean\nsquare error (RMSE), and\
    \ index of agreement (d) were used as a relative measure of the diﬀerence\namong\
    \ variables. Perfect agreement would exist between the observed and modeled values\
    \ if d = 1.\nFinally, we compared the cumulative evapotranspiration (CET) obtained\
    \ by the VI method with\nthe water balance approach to evaluate the ability of\
    \ ET determination by UAV. Cumulative ET\nobtained by the soil–water balance [58]\
    \ was used as the reference ET, and a relatively simple relation is\nexpressed\
    \ as:\n(Pr + I) + U − RO − ET − DP − ∆SW = 0,\n(17)\nwhere Pr is the eﬀective\
    \ precipitation; I is the irrigation depth; U is the ground water replenishment;\n\
    RO is the runoﬀ from the soil surface; and DP is the deep percolation of water\
    \ moving out of the root\nzone. ∆SW is the change between the ﬁrst and last measurements\
    \ of soil water storage within the root\nzone. All terms are expressed in mm.\

    \ that the soil moisture at 1.2 m changed little during the study period and the\

    \ (17)) and the above criteria, the CET was determined as follows:\nCET = Pr +\

    \ it can also influence Tc and affect crop \ntranspiration when Tc exceeds the\
    \ suitable canopy temperature for maize growth. The Tc of three \ndifferent water\
    \ treatments used for calculating the water stress index (CWSI and Tc ratio) showed\
    \ a \ncertain numeric gradient from 6 to 29 August 2017. Overall, Tc increased\

    18\nThe diﬀerent soil texture and soil heterogeneity led to diﬀerent water, fertilizer,\
    \ gas, and heat\nconditions and diﬀerent crop growth status. We could even observe\
    \ the diﬀerences of ET in the\nsame treatment through the high spatial resolution\
    \ (4.7 cm) multispectral images. Table 4 shows the\ntreatment values of CV (coeﬃcient\
    \ of variation) and mean ET. The diﬀerent water treatments in spatial\nvariations\
    \ of ﬁeld ET capacity from the reproductive to maturation stage were distinct.\
    \ On the whole,\nCV increased with decreased ET and increased water stress. In\
    \ addition, CV increased over the maize\ngrowth period in TRTs 2 and 3, which\
    \ illustrated that the prolonged water stress distinctly detected\nspatial ﬂuctuations\
    \ in ﬁeld soil heterogeneity via its inﬂuences on maize evapotranspiration condition.\n\
    For instance, in the deﬁcit irrigation treatment TRTs 2 and 3, CVs increased from\
    \ 9% to 34% and 8% to\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n16 of 22\n18% with the accumulation\
    \ of water stress. On the other hand, a higher CV in TRT 2 demonstrated that\n\
    the dual eﬀect of soil heterogeneity and water stress could severely aﬀect maize\
    \ ET.\nNext, the cumulative daily values of ET from 6 to 29 August 2017 for the\
    \ three irrigation treatments\nwere calculated by two techniques. (1) The VIs\
    \ (the average value of the entire treatment zone) method,\nwhere daily crop water\
    \ requirement (ET) was calculated by multiplying the daily crop coeﬃcients of\n\
    daily ET0 (Equation (1)). As above-mentioned, crop coeﬃcients were derived through\
    \ the relationships\nbetween Kcb and NDVI, and between Ks and TRCAI/RDVI. In addition,\
    \ a cubic interpolation was\nused to determine the values of VIs (NDVI, TRCAI,\
    \ and RDVI) between two UAV ﬂights. (2) The water\nbalance approach (Equation\
    \ (18)). As presented in Table 5, the total water consumption of the three\ntreatments\
    \ for the study period were 75 mm, 53 mm, and 67 mm, respectively. The diﬀerence\
    \ between\nthe cumulative ET calculated by the VIs method and water balance approach\
    \ were 2.6 mm, 8.9 mm,\nand 5 mm, respectively. Note that the retrieved ET were\
    \ similar to the crop water consumption.\nTable 5. Cumulative ET from the 6–29\

    Daily ET represents the most important process for the determination of the surface\
    \ and\nmass-energy interaction for both water resource management and agricultural\
    \ practices. At present,\nthere are mainly two types of models for ET assessment.\
    \ The ﬁrst involves models using thermal band\nbased energy-balance approaches\
    \ (SEB) [59,60]. The second method utilizes the empirical VI model.\nThough the\
    \ surface energy balance models are able to estimate ET with ﬁne accuracy. Deﬁciencies\n\
    in the current suite of thermal data sources (e.g., plenty of data requirements,\
    \ biases, inaccurate\ncalibration, poor spatial or temporal resolution) can strongly\
    \ limit the applicability of such procedures\nfor the continuous monitoring of\
    \ ET at a high spatiotemporal resolution [61]. Due to the longstanding\nfamiliarity\
    \ and widespread use within the irrigation community of crop coeﬃcient approaches\
    \ and\ntheir relative operational simplicity, reﬂectance-based crop coeﬃcients\
    \ might elicit a successful and\nfar-reaching approach for improving irrigation\
    \ management [12]. Multispectral VIs calculated from\ncanopy reﬂectance can be\
    \ used to simulate real-time Kcb. Figure 6 shows that there was a strong\nsimilarity\
    \ between the Kcb-NDVI and Kcb-Table. With the help of UAVs, we can provide more\n\
    sophisticated Kcb information for irrigation management. Studies [29,62] showed\
    \ that the VI-Kcb\nmodel can perform well under well irrigation conditions, but\
    \ that it could be diﬃcult to capture actual\nET under the water stress condition.\
    \ Water stress evaluation (Ks) based on soil water storage in the root\nzone is\
    \ the traditional and common method, but is costly and there is a shortage of\
    \ representation. For\ninstance, Er-Raki et al. [29] reported that the original\
    \ FAO-56 model may overestimate eddy covariance\nmeasurements because of the misrepresentation\
    \ of the soil stress factor.\nTo deal with these defects, Ks estimation is mainly\
    \ divided into direct and indirect methods. In\nindirect methods, they usually\
    \ need to ﬁrst obtain the potential ET (PET) and actual ET, and then\ncalculate\
    \ Ks through the soil–water balance. It is diﬃcult to obtain the actual ET because\
    \ sophisticated\nand costly instruments such as eddy covariance and lysimeters\
    \ are generally limited. On the other\nhand, estimating Ks through the indirect\
    \ method is not only laborious, but is also not time-eﬀective.\nDiarra et al.\
    \ [63] highlighted the uncertainty of indirect assessment in detecting crop water\
    \ stress in\nlight of the decision making process for irrigation planning. Therefore,\
    \ the direct calculation of Ks\nis very important for the application of the FAO-56\
    \ dual Kc method. Some studies have employed\nwater stress indices derived from\
    \ temperature data as the proxy. For instance, Kullberg et al. [33] used\nfour\
    \ canopy temperature–based methods (CWSI, degrees above non-stressed (DANS), degrees\
    \ above\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n17 of 22\ncanopy threshold (DACT), and Tc\
    \ ratio derived from infrared thermal radiometer) to calculate Ks and\nestimate\
    \ ET in a deﬁcit irrigation experiment of corn. A similar observation was made\
    \ by this study\nwhen estimating Ks for maize with the CWSI. Figure 9 shows that\
    \ the Ks derived CWSI was useful to\nestimate ET, with an acceptable accuracy\
    \ of R2 = 0.81 and RMSE about 0.95 mm/day when compared\nwith the modiﬁed FAO-56\
    \ Kc method. Bausch et al. [35] also obtained similar results using Tc ratio.\
    \ The\napplicability of the water stress index may be diﬀerent in diﬀerent areas\
    \ and cultivation conditions,\nso it is necessary to choose the local appropriate\
    \ water stress index. Furthermore, the water stress\nindices based on canopy temperature\
    \ may be a more realistic parameter than soil–water content to\nrepresent the\
    \ stress coeﬃcient due to the complicated physiological processes that plants\
    \ undergo as\nthey encounter water stress [35]. In Figure 7, we can see that the\
    \ Ks values calculated by CWSI are\nnot 1, as are the FAO-56 Ks in full-irrigation\
    \ TRT 1. It is probable that even a well-watered crop could\nhave a high canopy\
    \ temperature because of other changes in microclimate such as air temperature\n\
    and vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD) [64]. The change in the air temperature surrounding\
    \ the leaf will\nchange the leaf temperature and directly aﬀect the gradient of\
    \ water vapor between the leaf and the\natmosphere. Water deﬁcit stress and heat\
    \ stress may be induced by changes in available water, VPD,\nand increased ambient\
    \ air temperature [65].\nStationary infrared thermometers were mainly used for\
    \ validating the relationship between water\nstress indictors and Ks [33,35],\
    \ which can be greatly constrained by transport and operator costs and it\ncan\
    \ be diﬃcult to obtain large area images of crop. These shortcomings may cause\
    \ signiﬁcant errors\ndue to the diﬃculty of achieving a spatially-homogenous,\
    \ targeted soil, or plant water status. More\nimportantly, it is diﬃcult to obtain\
    \ Kcb and Ks on a large area at the same time. Kcb and Ks from\ndiﬀerent platforms\
    \ and scales will inevitably lead to errors in estimating ET, especially with\
    \ the high\nheterogeneities of soil and crops. Several studies [36,66,67] have\
    \ revealed the feasibility of mapping\ncrop water conditions using spectral vegetation\
    \ indices, taking advantage of the high spatial resolution\ncapabilities that\
    \ are more diﬃcult in the thermal region. The RDVI and TCARI were developed\n\
    to reduce the variability of the photosynthetically active radiation due to the\
    \ presence of diverse\nnon-photosynthetic materials and are useful in plant stress\
    \ monitoring to capture the changes in canopy\nstructures caused by water stress\
    \ [36,68]. Compared to the Ks calculated by on-site measurements, the\nKs based\
    \ on VI-Ks regression models could better reﬂect the water stress conditions of\
    \ maize at the\nﬁeld scale. Taking DOY 231 as an example, the mean ET could well\
    \ reﬂect TRT 2 (69%) and TRT 1\n(100%) in the reproductive stage, with the corresponding\
    \ values of 5.05 mm and 4.23 mm, respectively.\nTable 5 conﬁrmed the utility of\
    \ VIs to help constrain the ET components under three diﬀerent water\ntreatments.\
    \ Cumulative estimated ET diﬀered from the observed by only 2.6 mm, 8.9 mm, and\
    \ 5 mm\nfor TRTs 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The result during the 24-day investigative\
    \ period conﬁrmed that\nthe model may be suitable for clearly distinguishing the\
    \ diﬀerent irrigation schemes. In addition, we\ncould obtain accurate ET only\
    \ through the meteorological and UAV multispectral images.\nPrevious studies have\
    \ reported on combining the FAO-56 Kc model with Landsat [13,57,69],\nSPOT [25,70],\
    \ and Sentinel 2 [71] data to estimate the crop coeﬃcient and map crop water consumption.\n\
    However, with satellite remote sensing, a pixel represents a large area. It is\
    \ diﬃcult to observe the\nvariability in crop status on the ﬁeld scale and to\
    \ formulate precise irrigation plans. In addition, newly\nhigher resolution observation\
    \ platforms may be too costly for crop monitoring. In contrast, UAVs\ncan monitor\
    \ ﬁeld ET information scale up information from the leaf to canopy/ﬁeld levels\
    \ and maybe\nsuitable technology for actual problem scouting within the ﬁeld scale.\
    \ From the ET maps (Figure 9), we\ncan observe that the evapotranspiration of\
    \ crops varied even with the same treatment. Table 4 shows\nthe mean and CV values\
    \ of diﬀerent treatments due to the diﬀerent soil texture and soil heterogeneity\n\
    in the ﬁeld. Explicitly, because of the dual eﬀect of soil heterogeneity and water\
    \ stress, the CV of\nET reached 34% on DOY 241. Acquiring such data for planning\
    \ is probably the role most people\nenvisage when they think of UAV remote sensing\
    \ for precision agriculture. For example, Shi et al. [72]\nproposed a decision\
    \ support system for variable rate irrigation through ﬁeld ET maps acquired by\n\
    multispectral UAV images, which were inputs to the fuzzy inference system and\
    \ were successful in\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 2519\n18 of 22\nproviding a duty-cycle\
    \ control map for a central pivot variable rate irrigation system. Compared with\n\
    satellite remote sensing data, using UAV for ﬁeld information management has unique\
    \ advantages,\nbut there are still challenges in its application. UAV remote sensing\
    \ images usually need to be acquired\non-site by researchers, which may lead to\
    \ problems if the research area is remote and diﬃcult to reach,\nand the UAV cannot\
    \ take long-distance photographs due to battery power limitations, so there are\n\
    certain limitations in wider-range crop monitoring. Moreover, using UAVs for planning\
    \ has high costs\nfor data acquisition and analysis. To make monitoring economically\
    \ worthwhile for farmers, new\nmethods of analysis are needed to bring costs down.\
    \ Even so, UAV technology is now available to give\nfarmers the data products\
    \ they have long been requesting from remote sensing [73]. In sum, this study\n\
    demonstrates the feasibility of mapping maize crop ET under the water stress condition\
    \ and monitor\nits spatial variability at a ﬁeld scale by using UAV-based VI-Kcb\
    \ and VI-Ks regression models.\n5. Conclusions\nAs the most widely used approach\
    \ for calculating crop evapotranspiration (ET), the FAO-56 dual\nKc method has\
    \ been increasingly used and improved with remote sensing data. However, the accurate\n\
    estimation of the temporal and spatial variability of crop ET within the ﬁeld\
    \ scale is still a challenge,\nespecially when water stress occurs. To better\
    \ monitor water requirements under water stress and\nprovide a simpler and more\
    \ maneuverable method for farming practices, this study investigated\nwhether\
    \ an UAV-based multispectral remote sensing system could map the evapotranspiration\
    \ of\nmaize under diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation at the ﬁeld scale as a\
    \ supplement to the dual crop\ncoeﬃcient model. We conﬁrmed that CWSI can be a\
    \ better index assimilated into local maize ET\nestimation under deﬁcit irrigation.\
    \ The comparison results show that the ET derived from Ks-CWSI\nhad a higher correlation\
    \ with the modiﬁed FAO-56 Kc method, with a coeﬃcient of determination\nvalue\
    \ of 0.81, root mean square error value of 0.96 mm/d, and index of agreement value\
    \ of 0.94. Based\non which, a stable relationship between VIs and crop coeﬃcients\
    \ (Kcb and Ks) can be assimilated\ninto the FAO-56 dual Kc method for ﬁeld maize\
    \ ET estimation. Thanks to the UAV system, we could\nobtain high-resolution images\
    \ with higher frequencies for ﬁner irrigation management. In summary,\nthis study\
    \ demonstrates the feasibility of mapping maize crop evapotranspiration and monitoring\
    \ its\nspatial variability within the ﬁeld scale by using UAV-based multispectral\
    \ images under the water\nstress condition. Future experiments will incorporate\
    \ the ground validation (eddy covariance or\nlysimeter) of ET to provide an independent\
    \ assessment of model accuracy and use more convenient\nand reliable water stress\
    \ indices to evaluate crop stress and quantify crop evapotranspiration over a\n\
    longer crop growth period.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.T. and\

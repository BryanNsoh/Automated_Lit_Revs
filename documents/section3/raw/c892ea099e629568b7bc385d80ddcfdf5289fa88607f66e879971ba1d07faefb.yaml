    INTRODUCTION\nPrecision \nagriculture \ncurrently \nplays \na significant role\
    \ in the spatial and temporal \nmanagement of the inputs involved in agricultural\
    \ \nproduction. This science focused on the optimization \nof water resources\
    \ in irrigated areas is called \nprecision irrigation (PI), whose objective is\
    \ to \ndevelop appropriate technologies to increase water \nproductivity in irrigated\
    \ agriculture through the \napplication of water in precise and accurate amounts\
    \ \nat the right time, according to the spatial and temporal \nvariability of\
    \ the irrigated areas (ABIOYE et al., \n2020; BWAMBALE et al., 2023; ABAGALE &\
    \ \nANORNU, 2023; CAPRARO et al., 2018).\nIn \naddition, \nconsidering \nirrigation\
    \ \nmanagement, this is elaborated, according to soil, \nplant and climate information,\
    \ which generate a large \nvolume of data to be transformed into prescription\
    \ \nmaps of irrigation depths, based on the variability \nof soil attributes,\
    \ landscape features and growing \nconditions (STONE et al., 2015).\nIn view of\
    \ this, precision irrigation has \ntools capable of identifying contrasting spatial\
    \ \ndifferences in an agricultural production area and \nestablishing personalized\
    \ management in a rational \nway in the field (CASANOVA et al., 2014; CORWIN,\

    \ research on precision irrigation driven by climate change has developed a multitude\
    \ of strategies, methods \nand technologies to reduce water consumption in irrigation\
    \ projects and to adapt to the increasing occurrence of water scarcity, agricultural\
    \ \ndroughts and competition between agricultural and industrial sectors for the\
    \ use of water. In this context, the adoption of water-saving and \napplication\
    \ practices implies a multidisciplinary approach to accurately quantify the water\
    \ needs of crops under different water availability and \nmanagement practices.\
    \ Thus, this review article presented a review of technologies and new trends\
    \ in the context of precision irrigation, future \nperspectives and critically\
    \ analyze notions and means to maintain high levels of land and water productivity,\
    \ which minimize irrational water \nconsumption at the field level.\nKey words:\

    RESUMO: Nas últimas décadas pesquisas voltadas à irrigação de precisão, impulsionadas\
    \ pelas mudanças climáticas, desenvolveram uma \ninfinidade de estratégias, métodos\
    \ e tecnologias para reduzir o consumo de água em projetos de irrigação, para\
    \ adaptação à crescente ocorrência \nde escassez de água, secas agrícolas e competição\
    \ entre os setores agrícolas e industriais pelo uso da água. Nesta conjuntura,\
    \ a adoção de \npráticas de economia e aplicação de água, implica em uma abordagem\
    \ multidisciplinar para a quantificação precisa das necessidades de água \ndas\
    \ culturas, sob diversas práticas de disponibilidade e manejo da água. Dessa forma,\
    \ este artigo de revisão tem como objetivo apresentar uma \nrevisão sobre as tecnologias\
    \ e novas tendências no contexto da irrigação de precisão, as perspectivas futuras\
    \ e analisar criticamente noções e \nmeios para manter altos índices de produtividade\

    \ focused on \nstrategies, methods, new technologies and trends \nthat are available\
    \ to farmers and professionals in \nthe context of precision irrigation with a\
    \ focus on \noptimizing water use.\nPrecision irrigation technologies and trends\n\
    Soil moisture sensors in agriculture\nIrrigation management via soil moisture\
    \ \nsensors has recently undergone several commercial \ninnovations, many of which\
    \ have been introduced \nby technology companies and independent research \ngroups\
    \ around the world (FERRAREZI et al., 2020). \nMany of these innovations are due\
    \ to a significant \ndecrease in the prices of monitoring equipment and \ndata\
    \ storage in digital agriculture. TIGLAO et al. \n(2020), who used a system of\
    \ wireless sensors that cost \nhalf the price of commercial systems, achieved\
    \ savings \nof 81% in water consumption applied in irrigation \nmanagement.\n\
    Although, the accessibility of sensors \nhas increased in recent years, their\
    \ operation still \nhas the same fundamentals based on physical, \nchemical \n\
    and \nmechanical \nmethods \nfor \nthe \ndetermination of information of interest,\
    \ which \ncan be obtained electrically, electromagnetically, \noptically, radiometrically,\
    \ mechanically, acoustically, \npneumatically or electrochemically, with the methods\
    \ \nof electrical resistance (Boyoucus), tensiometry, \nneutron moderation and\
    \ time domain reflectometry \n(TDR) being the most used to estimate the amount\
    \ of \nwater available in the soil (ZINKERNAGEL et al., \n2020).\nThe most common\
    \ and simple sensors that \nuse indirect (non-destructive) methods to measure\
    \ \nsoil moisture are resistive sensors that work by \nmonitoring the variation\
    \ in electrical resistance \nbetween two electrodes embedded in the soil. \nAdvantages\
    \ of their use include low acquisition cost, \nsimple sensor operation and easy\
    \ availability in the \nmarket; as a disadvantage, they do not have high \naccuracy\
    \ in soil moisture readings. Models such as \nFC-28 and SEN0114 are found on the\
    \ market. The \nother sensors are capacitive, such as the SHT10 \nand EC-5 models;\
    \ they work by measuring the \ndielectric constant of the soil by the time elapsed\
    \ \nafter emitting an electromagnetic pulse generated by \nmetal rods embedded\
    \ in the soil. These sensors have \nthe advantage of high accuracy in readings;\
    \ however, \ndue to the construction of their sophisticated and \nexpensive electronic\
    \ components, their acquisition \ncosts can be high (GASCH et al., 2017; GOMES\
    \ \net al., 2017; MATOS et al., 2017). Other models \nfound on the market include\
    \ Decagon 10HS, Meter \nTEROS-12 (also measures temperature and electrical \n\
    conductivity), Sentek Drill & Drop (measuring \nmoisture, temperature and salinity\
    \ every 10 cm) and \nWatermark 200SS (measures the tension of water \nheld in\
    \ the soil in kPa).\nDue to the wide variety of methods for \nobtaining data and\
    \ the very nature of construction of \nhumidity sensors, a series of usage characteristics\
    \ and \nrecommendations for each field condition can be specified \nin each specific\
    \ situation ZINKERNAGEL et al. (2020).\nOne of the biggest advantages of using\
    \ soil \nmoisture sensors is linked to irrigation management, \nsince monitoring\
    \ the amount of water in the soil is a \ndirect indication of the irrigation needs\
    \ of an agricultural \narea (HAMAMI & NASSEREDDINE, 2020).This \napplicability\
    \ can be observed in research carried out by \nO’SHAUGHNESSY et al. (2020) in\
    \ the state of Texas, \nUSA, studying the productivity of Sorgum bicolor L., in\
    \ \nwhich the productivity of irrigation water was quantified \nbased on three\
    \ different management methodologies, \nvia plant-based thermal patterns, via\
    \ soil-based \nneutron probe measurements, and a hybrid method \ncombining plant\
    \ and soil monitoring over a period \nof three consecutive years. The researchers\
    \ reported \nthat in the periods of joint use of monitoring methods \n(hybrid\
    \ method), there was a consistent increase in the \naccumulation of biomass, resulting\
    \ in both productivity \ngains per unit of area and water savings.\nEL-NAGGAR\
    \ et al. (2020), in an \nexperiment in New Zealand with bean and pea crops \n\
    under two irrigation management methods, via \nclimatological water balance and\
    \ via capacitive soil \nmoisture sensors (FDR) coupled with radiofrequency \n\
    data transmission systems (IoT), observed a difference \nin the volume of water\
    \ applied and at the beginning \nof irrigation operations, resulting in savings\
    \ between \n27–44% of the volume of water used in areas managed \nwith soil moisture\
    \ sensors. This result was attributed \nto the imprecision of the balance methodology\
    \ of \nwater in predicting the effects of poor soil drainage, \nPrecision irrigation\
    \ trends and perspectives: a review.\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\n3\nespecially\
    \ resulting from the presence of a physical \nimpediment in the soil profile,\
    \ which underestimates \nthe real volume of water available to the plants.\nIn\
    \ addition to monitoring, the use of \nsensors also encompasses the use of automation\
    \ in \nirrigation systems, as can be seen in a study carried \nout by CONESA et\
    \ al. (2021), where the use of an \nautomatic irrigation system based on capacitance\
    \ \nsensors (FDR) showed better results in the efficiency \nof water use, resulting\
    \ in a decrease in the irrigation \ndepth compared to methods based on monitoring\
    \ the \nevapotranspiration of the water reference (ETo) and \nin the use of crop\
    \ coefficients (Kc) in the literature. \nJAISWAL & BALLAL (2020) used an automatic\
    \ \nsystem based on soil and climate sensors operating \nwith fuzzy logic to control\
    \ the flow of the irrigation \nsystem, achieving a smaller volume of water between\
    \ \n45% and 30%, respectively, as well as lower irrigation \ncosts, when compared\
    \ to the flood irrigation system.\nAccording to DOMÍNGUEZ-NIÑO et al. \n(2020),\
    \ the use of sensors in agriculture also allows a \nbetter understanding of the\
    \ real situation of humidity \nin different areas with plants in different stages\
    \ of \ngrowth, since monitoring via sensors takes place \ndirectly at the place\
    \ of interest and not in a generalized \nway, such as in climate monitoring, which\
    \ often \nconsiders irrigation sites based on a single stage of \nplant growth.\n\
    The automation of irrigation systems \nbased on soil sensors associated with the\
    \ use of IoT \ntechnologies can be observed in the research of \nBARKUNAN et al.\
    \ (2019) in which the soil moisture \nand climate monitoring sensors were connected\
    \ \nthrough a microcontroller capable of sending messages \nto the operator’s\
    \ smartphone, providing information \non the soil moisture conditions and the\
    \ beginning of \nthe irrigation period. This is possible through the use \nof\
    \ wireless communication devices that allow data \ntransfer between applications\
    \ without cables.\nThe use of a wireless sensor network \nis very important in\
    \ precision irrigation because, \naccording to irrigation management, extension\
    \ of \nthe area to be irrigated and producer preferences, it \nis necessary to\
    \ use spatially distributed sensor mesh \nto attend to data collection remotely\
    \ from several \nirrigated sectors, for example. Cabe points out that \nthe choice\
    \ of type of wireless device must consider the \nrange of the device. For example,\
    \ a Bluetooth device, \nmodel HC-06, with an SPP usage profile (Serial Port \n\
    Profile), has a maximum distance of 10 m between \nconnected devices, with a point-to-point\
    \ connection. \nAnother model, the XBee XB24-Z7WIT-004, of \nZigBee specification,\
    \ uses radiofrequency signals \nfor communication and low operating power, with\
    \ a \nrange limit of about 100 m, which allows point-to-\npoint and multipoint\
    \ connections, making it possible \nto form a mesh network of wireless devices.\n\
    Challenges in the application of sensors for soil \nmoisture monitoring\nOne of\
    \ the challenges for using FDR \nor TDR sensors in soil water monitoring is the\
    \ \nrelationship between factory calibration and sensor \ninstallation orientation\
    \ in the soil profile (vertical or \nhorizontal), which can cause systematic variations\
    \ in \nthe humidity readings.\nThis effect was observed by CHEN et al. \n(2019a),who\
    \ when comparing a capacity sensor and \nthree TDR sensors in three positions\
    \ on the ground, \nobserved a significant variation in the readings of \nwater\
    \ content in the soil under irrigation, concluding \nthat, in general, for sensors\
    \ with factory calibration, \nthe vertical orientation presents greater precision\
    \ when \ncompared to horizontal orientation, attributing this \nphenomenon to\
    \ the greater disruption in the soil that \nthe installation in the horizontal\
    \ position of the sensor \ncauses at the time of installation of the sensor. They\
    \ \nsuggested that irrigators should follow the positioning \nthat manufacturers\
    \ recommend for their equipment.\nHowever, SHARMA et al. (2017) pointed \nout\
    \ that, not infrequently, the calibration of sensors \nprovided by manufacturers\
    \ can overestimate the \nvolume of water in the soil and that, although they may\
    \ \nbe suitable for soils of similar texture, they often do \nnot consider factors\
    \ such as type, amount of organic \nmatter and apparent density of the soil, which\
    \ influence \nthe dielectric properties, making a local calibration \nnecessary\
    \ for better accuracy in the readings.\nFor the positioning of sensors in soil\
    \ \nlayers of different textures, KARGAS & SOULIS \n(2019) observed interesting\
    \ results, concluding \nthat for the correct management of irrigation in \nproductive\
    \ areas, it is necessary to use a different \nsensor for each soil layer or a\
    \ single sensor installed \nin the middle portion of the root system that is in\
    \ \ncontact with both layers simultaneously.\nSILVA et al. (2018), in a study\
    \ on banana, \nobserved that the ideal positioning of the sensors may \nnot be\
    \ constant throughout the development of the \nplant; that is, the most representative\
    \ position for the \nsensor to read the soil moisture may vary along with \nthe\
    \ phenological stage of the plant.\nOther factors such as salinity, soil textural\
    \ \nclass and temperature where the sensor is installed can \nalso affect the\
    \ accuracy of soil moisture monitoring, \nwhich may limit the use of these sensors\
    \ in areas \n4\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\nGundim et al.\nwith higher temperatures,\
    \ such as semi-arid and \narid regions, or the use of reused water in irrigation\
    \ \n(CARDENAS-LAILHACAR & DUKES, 2015; \nINCROCCI et al., 2019; OATES et al.,\
    \ 2017).\nNaturally, the use of soil moisture sensors \nin agriculture results\
    \ in a large amount of data for \nanalysis. It is possible to observe a growing\
    \ trend \nin researches that use data science techniques to \ninterpret the readings\
    \ of these sensors based on \nartificial intelligence techniques.\nResearches\
    \ \nsuch \nas \nthe \none \nby \nGOLDSTEIN et al. (2017) trained several machine\
    \ \nlearning algorithms in the interpretation of a series \nof climatic and soil\
    \ data to propose assertive \nrecommendations for the management of irrigation\
    \ in \nthe field based on data storage in cloud computing.\nUsing more robust\
    \ computational techniques, \nsuch as “neural networks” it is possible to employ\
    \ a \nnetwork of sensors for the precise determination of \nsoil moisture, resulting\
    \ not only in more homogeneous \nirrigation in the areas but also in water and\
    \ electrical \nenergy savings through the best use of the pumping \nsystem (DURSUN\
    \ & ÖZDEN, 2016).\nThe use of mobile sensor systems, together \nwith graphical\
    \ software, to better understand the \ndetermination and monitoring of soil moisture\
    \ \ndistribution; although, in smaller quantities, also \nexpands the options\
    \ for new research areas and future \napplications at the field level (SHAN et\
    \ al., 2019).\nFinally, the development of the following \nnew \ntypes \nof \n\
    sensors \ndemonstrate \nindustrial \ninnovations to be used in future research:\
    \ mm-sized \nsoil moisture sensors (ZHOU et al., 2019), which \nhave the ability\
    \ to perform better monitoring of water \ndistribution in the soil profile; perforated\
    \ coaxial \ncylinder (CHEN et al., 2019c), capable of monitoring \nboth soil water\
    \ volume and temperature; thick film \nconductivity sensors (SOPHOCLEOUS et al.,\
    \ 2020), \ncapable of monitoring changes in soil structure through \nchanges in\
    \ conductivity and soil water content; and a \nFiber Bragg Grating sensor (ZHANG\
    \ et al., 2019), \ndeveloped for monitoring water pressure in the field.\nUse\
    \ of satellites and spectral sensors for precision \nirrigation\nAdvances in spectroscopy\
    \ have allowed \nthe execution of specific analyses of different types of \nmaterials\
    \ in a non-destructive and fast way, revealing \nvaluable information through\
    \ the energy reflection of \nthe targets (LILLESAND & KIEFER, 1994).\nSpectral\
    \ sensor technology has been used \nto efficiently generate information on a large\
    \ time–\nspace scale. Data collected in the field with point \nequipment can be,\
    \ in some cases, more accurate, \nwhile cost, speed and practicality are advantages\
    \ \nof spectral sensors coupled to satellites or UAVs to \ncapture information\
    \ spatially distributed over large \nareas. The remote data analyzed allow considerations\
    \ \nabout photosynthesis, physiological disturbances, \nphenology and water interactions\
    \ in real time, which \nare fundamental for water planning and management \n(KARTHIKEYAN\
    \ et al., 2020).\nSatellites and sensors\nThere are currently several satellites\
    \ in \noperation that perform this type of work remotely: \nMODIS, Landsat 7,\
    \ Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A. \nThe great acceptance of this technology is because\
    \ \nthey are free products, with good spatiotemporal \nresolution and radiometric\
    \ quality and with ease of \ndata integration with APIs.\nThe data generated by\
    \ satellites can be useful \nin several applications at the irrigation level.\
    \ VANINO \net al. (2018) combined meteorological data with data \ncaptured by\
    \ the sensors of the Sentinel 2A satellite to \nestimate the leaf area index and\
    \ surface albedo to use \nthis information to calculate the evapotranspiration\
    \ \nof tomato crops and validate it through comparison \nwith evapotranspiration\
    \ data obtained by the soil–\nwater balance. The results of this research showed\
    \ the \nsatisfactory suitability of the Sentinel 2A satellite to \ndetermine water\
    \ demand. SHADMAN et al. (2017) \nused thermal band data from the Landsat 8 satellite\
    \ \nto estimate water stress in sugarcane plants through \nthe crop water stress\
    \ index (CWSI). According to the \nauthor, the data capacity of the satellite\
    \ sensors was \npositive and sufficient to carry out monitoring via \nremote sensing\
    \ of the water stress of sugarcane without \nthe need for auxiliary soil data.\n\
    MARINO et al. (2014) evaluated spectral \ndifferences in tomato leaves located\
    \ in 3 irrigated \nregions, classifying them as high (H), medium (M) \nand low\
    \ (L) in terms of water use and efficiency; \nNETO et al. (2017) evaluated the\
    \ spectral reflectance \nin the visible (VIS) and near-infrared region (NIR) \n\
    of sunflower leaves in water deficit to obtain \nmodels capable of estimating\
    \ the status of water \nand chlorophyll. CHEMURA et al. (2017) used \ninformation\
    \ from VIS and NIR to create a machine \nlearning model using the random forest\
    \ algorithm \nto predict the water content in the plant in the coffee \ncrop.\
    \ All studies were conclusive and showed \nvariations in spectral identity in\
    \ relation to variations \nin water content in plants.\nIn precision irrigation,\
    \ indices generated \nfrom orbital satellites have been mainly used to: \nPrecision\
    \ irrigation trends and perspectives: a review.\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\n\
    5\n(a) monitor irrigation systems in macro-regions; (b) \nadapt local crop coefficients\
    \ for a better calculation of \nplant evapotranspiration; and (c) estimate vegetative\
    \ \nmetrics such as plant density, coverage fraction (fc) \nand leaf area index\
    \ (FRENCH et al., 2020).\nAccording to CHEN et al. (2018), many \nstudies focus\
    \ only on mapping the extent of irrigated \nareas without considering important\
    \ information \nthat could also be extracted with the use of remote \nsensing,\
    \ such as the amount of water with drawn from \nthe system and the frequency and\
    \ time of irrigation.\nDifferent levels of decision can be used in \nirrigated\
    \ macro-regions using satellite systems, since \nit is possible to track the temporal\
    \ growth of crops, \nderiving this information in basal coefficients that \nallow\
    \ a better estimate of regional evapotranspiration. \nThus, GONZÁLEZ-DUGO et al.\
    \ (2013) developed a \nmethodology called MINARET (monitoring irrigated \nagriculture\
    \ ET), which uses Landsat data capable \nof constantly monitoring the water consumption\
    \ of \ndifferent irrigated crops. MASELLI et al. (2020) used \nmeteorological\
    \ data together with Sentinel 2A data to \nestimate evapotranspiration in monitoring\
    \ irrigated \nareas in the Italian semi-arid region.\nObtaining evapotranspiration\
    \ values with \ngreater precision is a fundamental factor, as it is a key \nparameter\
    \ in the water and energy balance equation. \nFAO bulletin 56 states that crop\
    \ evapotranspiration \n(ETc) can be calculated by multiplying the reference \n\
    evapotranspiration (ETo) and a specific crop \ncoefficient (Kc) (ALLEN et al.,\
    \ 1998).\nAlthough, \nthe \ncoefficients \nprovided \nby the FAO are general,\
    \ throughout the growing \nseason, there are variations in crop characteristics,\
    \ \nso the parameter is intrinsically linked to species, \nvariety, plant population\
    \ density, phenology, water \navailability, climate and other factors. Therefore,\
    \ a \nstandard Kc may not well represent some localities, \ncausing less reliable\
    \ estimates and directly impacting \ngood water use (MOKHTARIA et al., 2018).\
    \ In \nrecent years, several works have contributed to more \naccurate irrigation,\
    \ developing methods to estimate \nKc or Kcb (basal crop coefficient) and considering\
    \ \nvegetation indices, which are considered great \nphenological thermometers,\
    \ called Kc-VI (ALAM et \nal., 2018; CAMPOS et al., 2017). Still, more recently,\
    \ \nPEREIRA et al. (2021) published a newsletter \n(Updates and forward to the\
    \ FAO56 crop water \nrequirements method - Case studies using ground \nand remote\
    \ sensing data; applications to update and \nupgrade the FAO56 method) with updates\
    \ of these \ncoefficients through a collection of several studies, \nwith the\
    \ use of new tools, such as remote sensing and \nIoT, which bring more precision\
    \ to the calculation \nof the water needs of crops, which are important \nadvances\
    \ for precision irrigation.\nFRENCH et al. (2020), using data from \nLandsat and\
    \ Sentinel mission satellites, determined \na Kc-VI used to calculate wheat evapotranspiration.\
    \ \nThe experiment was carried out in the American \nsouthwest, and it was concluded\
    \ that the best values \nof Kc and ETc were obtained in the middle of the \nseason\
    \ until the end of senescence, while at a time \npoint sooner than 60 days after\
    \ planting, a high and \noverestimated ETc was observed due to the low \ncoverage\

    Electromagnetic \napproach \napplied \nto \nthe \ndetermination of the spatial\
    \ variability of the water \nstatus of plants in the field based on UAVs\nFour\
    \ components must be considered \nbefore selecting the appropriate UAV for IP\
    \ (GAGO \net al., 2015): experimental design, type of data to be \nobtained, data\
    \ acquisition, and data processing and \nresults. In addition to UAVs, sensors\
    \ are essential for \nthe quality of the images obtained. Decision-making \nregarding\
    \ the type of camera to be used depends \ndirectly on the project objective. The\
    \ cameras \nembedded in UAVs most used in the IP concept \naiming intelligent\
    \ management of water are thermal, \nmultispectral, hyperspectral, RGB and near\
    \ infrared \n(NIR) cameras.\nTo monitor biotic and abiotic stress, \nthermal (1\
    \ band) and hyperspectral (100–250 bands) \ncameras are recommended, while multispectral\
    \ (6–12 \nbands) and RGB cameras (3 bands) are indicated for \ngrowth and biomass\
    \ assessment (ADÃO et al., 2017). \nHigh-resolution RGB cameras are traditionally\
    \ used \nin agroforestry applications; however, they lack the \nprecision and\
    \ spectral range to trace the material \ncharacteristics that hyperspectral and\
    \ multispectral \ncameras can provide.\nSUSIČ et al. (2018) demonstrated the \n\
    potential of using hyperspectral images ranging from \n400 to 2500 nm to assess\
    \ the water deficit status in tomato \nplants. ZARCO-TEJADA et al. (2012) used\
    \ UAV-based \nhyperspectral and thermal cameras to assess water stress \nlevels\
    \ in citrus crops and confirmed a link between PRI \nand canopy temperature. Recently,\
    \ LOGGENBERG \net al. (2018) used hyperspectral technology combined \nwith machine\
    \ learning to discriminate between water-\nstressed and non-stressed vines.\n\
    Hyperspectral imaging cameras generally \ncapture more detail in spatial and spectral\
    \ ranges \ncompared to other cameras. LOGGENBERG et al. \n6\nCiência Rural, v.53,\
    \ n.8, 2023.\nGundim et al.\n(2018) observed that the main limiting factor in\
    \ the \napplication of hyperspectral data is the inherent issue \nof dimensionality,\
    \ which results in reduced precision. \nIn addition, hyperspectral cameras are\
    \ very expensive \nand complex (ELVANIDI et al., 2018), which limits \ntheir expeditious\
    \ and wide application, especially in \ncommercial agriculture.\nMultispectral\
    \ cameras are composed \nof multiple sensors with high-quality filters that \n\
    can simultaneously capture images using different \nwave frequencies. They can\
    \ record both the light \nspectrum that is visible to the human eye and the \n\
    non-visible spectrum; thus, these cameras allow for \nmuch more accurate measurements\
    \ of plant health \nand phenological status than conventional cameras \n(RGB)\
    \ (KHANAL et al., 2017).\nMultispectral and hyperspectral cameras \ndo not have\
    \ a resolution comparable to traditional \nRGB cameras, which causes some initial\
    \ frustration \nfor users new to the spectral area accustomed to \ntraditional\
    \ high-resolution images. The resolution of \nRGB cameras is in the range of 20–120\
    \ MB, while \nmultispectral and hyperspectral cameras have a \nresolution between\
    \ 0.2–3 MB.\nAccording to POBLETE et al. (2017), \nplant water status is not accurately\
    \ predicted using \nmultispectral imaging between the 500 and 800 nm \nspectral\
    \ bands due to the lack of sensitivity to water \ncontent; however, wavelengths\
    \ greater than 800 nm \nare best for this purpose.\nRALLO et al. (2014) observed\
    \ that \nsatisfactory estimation of leaf water potential at leaf \nand canopy\
    \ levels can be obtained using vegetation \nindices based on the NIR shortwave\
    \ infrared domain, \nwith specific optimization of the “central bands.”\nRecently,\
    \ some researchers have developed \nartificial neural network (ANN) models derived\
    \ from \nmultispectral images to predict the spatial variability \nof water potential\
    \ in agricultural crops. ROMERO et \nal. (2018) classified the water status of\
    \ the vine based \non 10 vegetation indices (VI) using bands of Red, \nGreen,\
    \ Red-Edge, and NIR wavelengths and found \nthat there were no significant relationships\
    \ between \nindividual VIs, with values of correlation lower than \n0.3 for almost\
    \ all the studied indices.\nThere is a very specific spectral band \ncalled RedEdge,\
    \ which lies between red and \ninfrared, has excellent correlation with chlorophyll\
    \ \nfluorescence and effectively differentiates between \nhealthy and senescent\
    \ vegetation (MATESE & DI \nGENNARO, 2018). There is already a range of \nspecific\
    \ multispectral cameras for use embedded in \nUAVs (MATESE & DI GENNARO, 2018).\
    \ Among \nthem, Tetracam, Airinov and Micasense camera \nmanufacturers can be\
    \ highlighted.\nTetracam’s modular cameras can be \nmounted in different arrangements,\
    \ depending \non which bands you want to capture and which \nbandwidths. Airinov’sagro\
    \ Sensor has 4 bands and \nhas been used by the famous eBee AG, the version of\
    \ \nthe fixed-wing UAV for agricultural applications in \nSwitzerland Sensefly\
    \ (MATESE & DI GENNARO, \n2018). The American Micasense manufactures \nthe RedEdge\
    \ sensor, a multispectral camera that \nsimultaneously captures 5 different narrow-width\
    \ \nbands and a more recent dual camera that captures 10 \nspectral bands. In\
    \ addition to the RGB bands of the \nvisible spectrum, the camera also captures\
    \ the NIR in \nthe non-visible spectrum and the RedEdge, a spectral \nband that\
    \ is positioned exactly on the threshold \nbetween the visible and the non-visible.\
    \ In addition to \nincreasing the sensitivity of certain indices, it is with \n\
    this spectral band that certain diseases and crop pests \ncan be identified (DEVIA\
    \ et al., 2019).\nDEVIA et al. (2019) studied biomass \nproduction in rice crops\
    \ using multispectral imaging. \nThe authors presented a method for biomass \n\
    estimation using near-infrared (NIR) images captured \nat different crop scales.\
    \ The approach estimated the \nbiomass of large areas of the crop with an average\
    \ \ncorrelation of 0.76 in relation to the traditional manual \ndestructive method.\n\
    KITIĆ et al. (2019) proposed a low-\ncost portable active multispectral optical\
    \ device \nfor accurate detection of plant stress and to \nperform field mapping\
    \ called Plant-O-Meter. The \ndevice has an integrated multispectral source \n\
    that comprises light in four more indicative \nwavelengths (850, 630, 535 and\
    \ 465 nm) and allows \nthe simultaneous illumination of the entire plant. \nSequential\
    \ illumination and detection provide fast \nreflectance measurements, which are\
    \ transmitted \nby wireless to Android-powered devices for data \nprocessing and\
    \ storage. The device was tested under \nlaboratory conditions by comparing Plant-O-Meter\
    \ \nmeasurements with imaging results from a SPECIM \nhyperspectral camera and\
    \ a GreenSeeker handheld \ndevice under field conditions. The comparison \nrevealed\
    \ comparable performance, showing a strong \ncorrelation in both the hyperspectral\
    \ (R2 = 0.997) \nand portable GreenSeeker (R2 = 0.954) from the \nlaboratory measurements\
    \ and R2 = 0.886 for the field \nexperiments), indicating that the device exhibited\
    \ \nstrong potential for accurate stress measurements.\nThe scientific articles\

    \ cameras used by the \nscientific community for the rapid detection of water\
    \ \nstress in culture.\nArtificial intelligence in precision agriculture\nDue\
    \ to climatic uncertainties, the growing \ndemand for food and the rapid expansion\
    \ of the \npopulation, the agricultural sector is increasingly \ndependent on\
    \ the use of new technologies to obtain \nhigher yields in a sustainable way with\
    \ each harvest. In \nthis context, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly\
    \ \ndeveloping \napplications \nin \nagriculture \naiming \nproductivity gains\
    \ in a precise and effective way, \navoiding the waste of resources (SHAIKH et\
    \ al., 2022).\nIn recent decades, researchers have strived \nto allow computers\
    \ to extract enough information \nfrom raw data to model the real world. To achieve\
    \ \nthis, many have turned to machine learning \nalgorithms to capture a large\
    \ amount of information \nand automatically discover the representations \nneeded\
    \ to detect or classify input patterns and solve \nthe various problems and needs\
    \ of the agricultural \nsector (KHALIL & ABDULLAEV, 2021). Machine \nlearning\
    \ algorithms are computation models with \nparticular properties such as learning,\
    \ generalizing, \ngrouping or organizing data. They consist of \ndistributed structures\
    \ formed by a large number \nof very simplified processing units connected to\
    \ \neach other. Intelligent behavior occurs through the \ninteractions of the\
    \ neural network processing units \n(CANZIANI et al., 2016). The first neural\
    \ networks \nto achieve widespread repercussions were based \non unsupervised\
    \ pre-training. However, it was the \nrediscovery of convolutional neural networks\
    \ (CNN) \n(LECUN et al., 1998) that made this topic one of the \nmain topics in\
    \ machine learning, parallel processing \ntechnologies in GPUs (Graphal Processor\
    \ Unit) and \nlarge databases that allowed these networks to be used \nfully.\
    \ With the good performance being demonstrated \nby such models, other areas of\
    \ knowledge besides \nthe area of computing have been using these models \nfor\
    \ different purposes, as in the area of agricultural \nsciences since the 1990s\
    \ with the pioneering work \nof MCQUEEN et al. (1995), in which the authors \n\
    investigated the use of machine learning techniques \nexisting at the time for\
    \ some problems in agriculture \nand horticulture and presented a case study to\
    \ infer \nmanagement rules for some invasive plants. Recent \nresearch has used\
    \ PCN-type networks (pulse-coupled \nnetworks) for the separation of wheat grains\
    \ and to \nevaluate the physical characteristics of the soil and \nthe growth\
    \ of the cultures, concluding after field \nexperiments that the developed model\
    \ assisted in \nchoosing the crop that best suited the evaluated soil \n(SHAIKH\
    \ et al., 2022).\nWorks that involve not only agronomic data \nbut also other\
    \ technologies, such as satellite images, \nhave been developed, such as the classification\
    \ of \nmanagement areas using satellite images (KHALIL \n& ABDULLAEV, 2021). In\
    \ the context of the use of \nneural networks for agriculture and with the advent\
    \ \nof cheaper computing resources combined with the \nnew sensors that are being\
    \ developed, proposals that \nincreasingly use cutting-edge technological resources\
    \ \nare noted (SOBAYO et al., 2018).\nAs a tool to aid strategic decision making,\
    \ \nsmart agriculture has emerged as a new scientific \narea that employs, among\
    \ other technologies, \nmachine learning algorithms to assess and monitor \nthe\
    \ conditions of growing areas, such as soil and \nweather conditions, leading\
    \ to more accurate results \n(LIAKOS et al., 2018).\nBACHOUR \net \nal. \n(2015)\
    \ \nused \na \nmethodology that combines wavelet mult-iresolution \nanalysis with\
    \ the MVRVM algorithm (multivariate \nrelevance vector machine) to predict 16\
    \ days of \nETo. More recently, deep learning (DL) is a machine \nlearning technique\
    \ that has shown good results in \nsolving agricultural problems. KAMILARIS &\
    \ \nPRENAFETA-BOLDÚ (2018) presented a review \nof 40 relevant studies in the\
    \ area and found that, in \naddition to improvements in the performance of \n\
    classification/prediction problems, DL also reduced \nresource engineering in\
    \ many of the works.\nFor crop management, for example, yield \npredictions can\
    \ be made from satellite images, as \npresented by KHALIL & ABDULLAEV (2021).\
    \ In \nthis research, the authors concluded that it is possible \nto predict wheat\
    \ yield from image processing with \nsupervised Kohonen networks. Another beneficial\
    \ \nactivity is pest and disease control, where the \nspraying of pesticides is\
    \ now directed only to the \naffected plants, reducing financial and environmental\
    \ \ncosts (JIAO et al., 2022).\nIn water and soil management, important \npractices\
    \ have been developed not only to increase crop \nproductivity but also to use\
    \ these resources efficiently. \nPATIL & DEKA (2016) used the extreme learning\
    \ \nalgorithm to estimate the weekly evapotranspiration \nof a crop in India.\
    \ In soil management, GU et al. \n(2021) presented a new method for estimating\
    \ \nsoil moisture based on ANN models. ANN shave \nalso been the subject of scientific\
    \ investigations in \nthe field of irrigation engineering to estimate the \nlocalized\

    \ & ALAZBA (2017), the use of neural \nnetworks presents a powerful tool for estimating\
    \ the \nload loss caused by initial connectors when compared \nto the use of empirical\
    \ models. KADHEM et al. \n(2017) used a neural network to predict wind speed \n\
    data with chronological and seasonal characteristics. \nThe authors concluded\
    \ that the neural network \nwas able to portray variations in wind speed with\
    \ \ngood performance during the different seasons \nof the year. LIU et al. (2018)\
    \ developed a wind \nspeed prediction model based on WPD (wavelet \npacket decomposition),\
    \ CNN (convolutional neural \nnetwork) and CNNLSTM (convolutional long short-\n\
    term memory network). To verify the prediction \nperformance of the proposed model,\
    \ it was compared \nwith 8 neural models widely used by the scientific \ncommunity.\
    \ The authors concluded that the proposed \nmodel is robust and effective in predicting\
    \ wind speed \ntime series.\nDefinition of management zones in precision \nirrigation\n\
    One way to manage physical, chemical \nand/or biological variations within a growing\
    \ area is \nthrough the delineation of management zones (ZM). \nManagement zones\
    \ are sub-areas within a cultivation \narea that have similar characteristics\
    \ but differ to a \ncertain degree from the others in such a way that a \nparticular\
    \ agronomic management is justified to be \nadopted in each of them (KITCHEN et\
    \ al., 2005).\nFor management zones to be determined, \nit is necessary to obtain\
    \ data from the area of \ninterest, which can be of various types, such as crop\
    \ \nproductivity, soil physical and chemical properties, \ntopography, vegetation\
    \ indices, and aerial images. \nFrom these individual or combined data, thematic\
    \ \nmaps are created, and this spatial information is then \ninterpreted. In this\
    \ context, BAZZI et al. (2018) used \nsoil property data to define management\
    \ zones, such as \nsoil texture and apparent electrical conductivity. YAO \net\
    \ al. (2014) used soil physicochemical properties and \ncrop yield data and determined\
    \ management zones.\nGenerally, \nirrigation \nis \ncarried \nout \nuniformly\
    \ in a cultivated area, regardless of the \nspatial characteristics of that area.\
    \ In the field, the \nwater content in the soil is not homogeneous due \nto its\
    \ spatial variability, which ranges from crop \ndevelopment, difference in relief\
    \ and variation of soil \nhydraulic properties and rainfall distribution. Thus,\
    \ \nthe proper use of irrigation in each management zone \nreduces the volume\
    \ of water used in the irrigation \nsystem, as there is an increase in efficiency\
    \ that \nprovides growth in productivity, reducing nutrient \nleaching and water\
    \ waste. Management zones are used \nto optimize irrigated areas, where a heterogeneous\
    \ area \nis separated into homogeneous zones and irrigation \nmanagement will\
    \ be the same in these regions (LIANG \net al., 2016; PEREA et al., 2017).\nFor\
    \ XIANG et al. (2007), cluster analyses \nand empirical analyses are the categories\
    \ in which \nmost of the methods used to define management \nzones are inserted.\
    \ Since the empirical methods are \nsimpler, based on specialized knowledge and\
    \ on the \ndistribution of productivity in the production areas, \nin this way,\
    \ it is possible to divide a heterogeneous \narea into homogeneous sub-areas.\
    \ However, cluster \nanalysis is a more complex, less subjective method \nthat\
    \ uses multiple variables during the establishment \nof management zones. In cluster\
    \ analysis methods, \ndata points in a cropping area are divided into \ndifferent\
    \ classes, where the similarities between the \npoints are evaluated to define\
    \ the classes, and with \nthat, the management zones are defined (GAVIOLI et \n\
    al., 2019; LI et al., 2007).\nTo define management zones, several \nfactors and\
    \ data are often used; in this case, a \nmultivariate analysis was used to define\
    \ the zones. \nOLDONI et al. (2019) also used geostatistical and \nmultivariate\
    \ analyses to determine management \nzones in a peach orchard, with a clustering\
    \ approach \non both soil (soil texture, water content, organic \nmatter content)\
    \ and plant (amount of fruit per tree, \naverage fruit weight, total soluble solute\
    \ content) for \ndifferentiated management.\nAnother form of multivariate geospatial\
    \ \nanalysis is kriging factor analysis, a data interpolation \nmethod that identifies\
    \ variability and was used in \nthe study by BEVINGTON et al. (2019), where soil\
    \ \nproperties and hydraulic parameters were measured \nto define management zones\
    \ using kriging factor \nanalysis and the fuzzy-c means algorithm. CHEN et \n\
    al. (2019b) used an RGB camera attached to a UAV \nto determine the plant cover\
    \ and vigor of the peanut \nand cotton canopy through the green–red vegetation\
    \ \nindex to determine management zones in Italy, used \nas indicators of irrigation\
    \ uniformity, which they also \nserved as an indication for the application of\
    \ variable \nrate irrigation (VRI) in a pivot system. In the research \nby SCHENATTO\
    \ et al. (2017), management zones \nwere also created using the fuzzy-c means\
    \ algorithm, \nfocusing on soil characteristics, such as elevation, \nslope, density,\
    \ organic matter, clay and sand contents, \nand plant attributes, such as yield.\n\
    In the study by ANASTASIOU et al. \n(2019), multivariate geostatistical techniques\
    \ were \nPrecision irrigation trends and perspectives: a review.\nCiência Rural,\
    \ v.53, n.8, 2023.\n9\nalso used to unite the multitemporal data from a \nmultiband\
    \ radiometer and a geophysical sensor and \nthus delimit the management zones\
    \ of a vineyard, \nconsidering the electrical conductivity of the soil \nand canopy\
    \ area. OHANA-LEVI et al. (2019) used \na weighted multivariate spatial clustering\
    \ model \nto determine irrigation management zones in a \nvineyard. Management\
    \ zones were determined using \na multivariate k-means cluster, and machine learning\
    \ \nand spatial statistics were also used to analyze the \nvariables, which comprised\
    \ soil properties, terrain \ncharacteristics and environmental impact.\nAnother\
    \ tool used to collect data and define \nmanagement zones is the proximal sensing\
    \ of the \nsoil, based on electromagnetic induction techniques, \nradiometry and\
    \ fluorimetry (CASTANEDO, 2013). \nIn the research by CASTRIGNANÒ et al. (2017),\
    \ \nproximal and remote sensors were used in a tomato \ngrowing area, and there\
    \ was integration with \nmultivariate geostatistical data to define management\
    \ \nzones based on the electrical conductivity of the soil, \nwhich was measured\
    \ at different frequencies, sensor \npolarizations and depths. Likewise, MOUAZEN\
    \ et \nal. (2014) used a soil sensor to measure electrical \nconductivity, soil\
    \ water holding capacity, available \nwater, organic matter, density, clay content\
    \ and \norganic carbon, establishing a multi-sensor and data \nfusion approach\
    \ to delineating management zones for \nsite-specific irrigation, best addressed\
    \ in section 1 of \nthis review.\nTo define management zones, low-cost \nremote\
    \ sensing data are viable options (section 2 of \nthis review), where spatiotemporal\
    \ information on \nthe biological and physical parameters of vegetation \nare\
    \ used (FONTANET et al., 2018). FONTANET et \nal. (2020) used remote sensing to\
    \ define management \nzones in a corn planting area, analyzing normalized \ndifference\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI) time series by \nremote sensing, soil moisture sensors,\
    \ and root zone \nsimulation predictions. GOBBO et al. (2019) also \nused NDVI\
    \ in defining management zones in corn \nplantations and combined it with soil\
    \ texture data to \ncreate irrigation management zones.\nIn the research by GEORGI\
    \ et al. (2017), \nremote sensing was used together with an automatic \ndelineation\
    \ algorithm. An automatic segmentation \nalgorithm \nwas \ndeveloped \nusing \n\
    multispectral \nsatellite data, which is a cheaper method for defining \nmanagement\
    \ zones.\nWe emphasized that the creation of \nmanagement zones for irrigation\
    \ is not strictly \nassociated with the application of water at a varied rate\
    \ \nbut rather in specific fields or areas and not exclusively \non a lateral\
    \ line of an irrigation system. The creation of \nthese zones can help in the\
    \ sizing of localized irrigation \nsystems, enabling the differentiation of water\
    \ needs by \nsector, such as ZM, which differs from SS-VRI (site-\nspecific variable\
    \ rate sprinkler).\nAnother point to consider is the limitations \nof the use\
    \ of remote sensing to create ZM. \nFONTANET et al. (2020) suggested the integration\
    \ \nof spatial and temporal information, since there are \nsoil and/or plant attributes\
    \ with spatial differences \nthat also change over time; that is, they are not\
    \ static. \nFor example, the NDVI must be combined with a \nmeasurement of available\
    \ soil water to dynamically \ndelineate both space and time ZM for irrigation.\n\
    Irrigation systems with variable water application rates\nIrrigated agriculture\
    \ is one of the \nagricultural activities with the highest consumption \nof fresh\
    \ water in the world. In this sense, precision \nirrigation is an important tool\
    \ for the development \nof profitable and sustainable agriculture (DU et al.,\
    \ \n2015; MATEOS & ARAUS, 2016). \nThus, as discussed in the previous section,\
    \ \nthe creation of irrigation management zones is \nessential to increase the\
    \ efficiency of the application \nand use of water in the field. Within this tool,\
    \ Site-\nspecific Variable Rate Irrigation (SS-VRI) is a \nmanagement method that\
    \ consists of applying water \naccording to spatial variability due to characteristics,\
    \ \nsuch as soil and culture; and therefore, through \nrational application, it\
    \ is possible to increase water \nconservation and productivity, in addition to\
    \ reducing \nthe leaching rate of nutrients and agrochemicals and \noptimizing\
    \ inputs (DU et al., 2015; MATEOS & \nARAUS, 2016).\nSS-VRI differs from conventional\
    \ sprinkler \nsystems and requires variable rate sprinklers, which \nare based\
    \ mainly on pulse modulation, angle of \ndeparture and arrival points, and sprinkler\
    \ head \n(SADLER et al., 2005).The main research covers \nlinear and center pivot\
    \ sprinkler systems due to the \nlevel of automation and coverage of the cultivation\
    \ \narea through a single side tube (ADEYEMI et al., \n2017). However, this type\
    \ of management has \nalready been studied for other types of irrigation \nmethods,\
    \ such as drip, considering the challenges of \ndirectionality and the invariable\
    \ rate of lateral lines \n(LINKER, 2020). Therefore, the main commercial \nequipment\
    \ developed thus far is linked to central \npivot and linear mechanized sprinkler\
    \ irrigation.\nThe greatest success of implementing VRI \nin center pivot systems,\
    \ and the focus of this review, \nis that it allows: first, the control of the\
    \ travel speed \n10\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\nGundim et al.\nof the center\
    \ pivot, allowing the variation of water \napplication/infiltration depth by sector,\
    \ and second, \ncontrolling the variation of water application by zone; \nthat\
    \ is, it allows the differentiation of irrigation rates \nalong the lateral pipeline\
    \ (ANDRADE et al., 2020; \nO’SHAUGHNESSY et al., 2019; SUI & YAN, 2017).\nSOBENKO\
    \ et al. (2018) developed a \nsprinkler with flow adjustment through the cross\
    \ \nsection based on an iris mechanism controlled by \na stepper motor using a\
    \ deterministic model for \nflow prediction, but the idealized nozzle discharge\
    \ \ncoefficient (0.60) was below the average values \n(0.90–0.92) observed in\
    \ conventional fixed nozzles.\nThe management of SS-VRI can be carried \nout efficiently\
    \ in several ways, such as monitoring the \nsoil moisture content, a subject discussed\
    \ in greater \ndepth in sections 1 and 4. For this, the positioning \nand number\
    \ of sensors should be chosen with care so \nthat the generated data are representative\
    \ of the area \nunder cultivation. Through analyses of variance and \ntemporal\
    \ stability of soil water content monitored by a \nneutron probe, BARKER et al.\
    \ (2017) concluded that \nfor management zones divided to minimize variations\
    \ \nwithin the zones, the number of sensors may be \nmore important than their\
    \ position in the area. In \naddition, due to the high cost of a number of sensors,\
    \ \na partnership between modeling and monitoring soil \nwater is proposed. In\
    \ a similar study focusing on the \nplacement of soil sensors, ZHAO et al. (2017)\
    \ stated \nthat the clay percentile of management zones should \nbe considered\
    \ for the placement of sensors.\nThe use of spectral images obtained \nvia satellite\
    \ or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) \nhas been used in the management of variable-rate\
    \ \nirrigation systems. The principle of this use is based on \nunderstanding\
    \ the spectral response of the leaf, which \nis applied at the canopy level and\
    \ is used to establish \nmanagement zones (HANK et al., 2018). MENDES et \nal.\
    \ (2019), using images obtained from satellites, carried \nout the mapping of\
    \ areas considering the variability for \nthe application of variable-rate irrigation\
    \ depths via the \ncentral pivot system. With the same objective, SHI et \nal.\
    \ (2019), with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles \n(UAVs), obtained multispectral\
    \ images of the vegetation \nand used vegetation indices to determine the spatial\
    \ \nvariability and constitution of homogeneous areas. \nSimilar work was developed\
    \ by BHATTI et al. (2020), in \nwhich the comparison of multispectral images obtained\
    \ \nby UAV and satellites was performed to evaluate the \nresponse of crops to\
    \ variable irrigation based on canopy \ntemperature and surface energy balance\
    \ modeling. More \nexamples of the use of images in precision irrigation are \n\
    mentioned in sections 2 and 3.\nDespite all the benefits, the uptake of \nSS-VRI\
    \ systems has grown slowly. The main \njustifications for this are that this type\
    \ of management \nrequires qualified technical assistance, and the \nacquisition\
    \ of the necessary equipment still has a high \ncost, requiring a careful analysis\
    \ of the economic \nviability of production (ABIOYE et al., 2020). To \nassist\
    \ in these matters, simulation models are viable \noptions for assessing the response\
    \ of crops to different \nirrigation management methods.\nMCCARTHY et al. (2014)\
    \ used a model \ncalled VARIwise based on the predictive control \nmodel methodology\
    \ to evaluate the performance of \ncotton cultures grown on a center pivot with\
    \ variable \napplication rate irrigation compared to conventional \nsystems. In\
    \ most results, simulations of precision \nirrigation performance had superior\
    \ results. In a \nsimilar research, THORP (2019) carried out a long-\nterm evaluation\
    \ through simulations using the same \ncrop under soil variability parameters\
    \ to analyze the \nadvantages of the system. However, modeling applied \nto precision\
    \ irrigation can be complex because it deals \nwith the dynamics of water in soil.\
    \ The following \ntopic discusses in-depth examples of models and \napplications\
    \ of modeling in irrigated agriculture. \nModeling agricultural crops and their\
    \ interaction \nwith the prescription of variable water depths in \nprecision\
    \ irrigation\nExtreme drought events have increased \nin intensity in recent decades\
    \ and predictions from \nagrometeorological modeling indicate that climate \n\
    extremes of drought will become more frequent and \nprolonged due to a set of\
    \ factors, among which global \nwarming stands out (IPCC, 2018).\nAgriculture\
    \ is one of the human activities \nmost dependent on climatic conditions, especially\
    \ \ntraditional rainfed crops, so the development \nof studies to evaluate the\
    \ effects of these on \nagricultural production is important. However, \ncarrying\
    \ out field experiments becomes limiting due \nto a series of factors, such as\
    \ manpower, available \ntime and financial resources. An alternative or \ncomplementary\
    \ solution is the use of agricultural \nmodeling to forecast the development of\
    \ agricultural \ncrops in new climate scenarios.\nCrop simulation models are based\
    \ on \nbiophysical processes to make estimates such as \ngrowth, development and\
    \ production, based on \nphysiological characteristics of the crop in question\
    \ \nand environmental variables (MONTEITH, 1996). \nUnderstanding these models\
    \ becomes the conceptual \nbasis for modeling agricultural crops.\nPrecision irrigation\
    \ trends and perspectives: a review.\nCiência Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\n11\nMechanistic\
    \ models, based on the physics \nand physiological processes of plants, become\
    \ allies \nin the development of teaching, research and crop \nmanagement. Among\
    \ them, the DSSAT (Decision \nSupport System for Agrotechnology Transfer) presents\
    \ \na set of models developed for several important crops, \nsuch as corn and\
    \ soybean (JONES et al., 2003).\nIn a review of the opportunities and \napproaches\
    \ for modeling spatial variations of water \nat the field level, TENREIRO et al.\
    \ (2020) pointed \nout that, among the irrigation methods, there are \nthree ways\
    \ to simulate irrigation applications in crop \nmodels: a) determination of a\
    \ calendar by the user; \nb) an irrigation program based on the water capacity\
    \ \nof the soil, applying constant or variable rates; and c) \nthrough a schedule\
    \ based on multiple criteria, such as \nthe phenological stage of the crop, water\
    \ content in the \nsoil, restrictions on the availability of water and type \n\
    of cultural management. These methodologies have \nthe potential to calculate\
    \ the varied rate of irrigation \nto be provided to plants, “when,” “where” and\
    \ “how \nmuch” they need, resulting in the optimization of \nthe use of this water\
    \ resource (HAGHVERDI et al., \n2016), thus validating the three ways to simulate\
    \ \nfield-level irrigation applications in the models.\nIn the literature, the\
    \ prescription of \nvariable irrigation depths follows two methodologies: \na)\
    \ make individual use of crop simulation models or \nhydrological models, which\
    \ focus on the movement \nof water in the soil and b) make combined use of \n\
    these two models.\nThe DSSAT model, because it is a \nsimulation of cultivation,\
    \ is advantageous in the study \nof irrigation management scenarios, as presented\
    \ by \nMALIK & DECHMI (2019) in a study carried out \nin Spain with different\
    \ cultures. They evaluated \ntwo scenarios, one based on irrigation applied by\
    \ \nproducers and another on irrigation adjusted to \nthe water demand of the\
    \ crop, with crop and soil \ndata collected for model calibration and validation.\
    \ \nThe authors reported up to a 27% reduction in the \napplication of irrigation\
    \ depths. Similar researches are \npresented by CAMARGO & KEMANIAN (2016), \n\
    PEREZ-ORTOLA et al. (2015) and XIANGXIANG \net al. (2013).\nAnother well-established\
    \ model is APSIM, \nwhich also focuses on modeling agricultural crops and \nassesses\
    \ the impacts of different crop management \npractices, including irrigation (AMARASINGHA\
    \ et \nal., 2015; DUTTA et al., 2020).\nPEREA et al. (2017), for example, carried\
    \ \nout an integrative modeling coupling a deterministic \nmodel of water application\
    \ with the Aquacrop model, \nsimulating the impacts of heterogeneous irrigation\
    \ \ncaused by wind drift and pressure variation in the \nirrigation system. They\
    \ concluded that variable-rate \nirrigation was the best method in all scenarios\
    \ of \npressure variation in the system to save water and \nincrease onion yield.\n\
    ROY et al. (2019) also proposed the \nintegration of crop and hydrological models\
    \ using \nHYDRUS-2D software and DSSAT to identify the \nmost appropriate irrigation\
    \ management to maximize \nwater use efficiency through precision irrigation using\
    \ \nretention technology of subsurface water, together \nwith a computational\
    \ procedure of evolutionary multi-\nobjective optimization to link the two models.\
    \ The \nauthors concluded that the optimization procedure \nreduced water use\
    \ and increased corn yield prediction \nby 6-fold compared to non-optimized and\
    \ randomized \nirrigation management without subsurface water \nretention membrane.\
    \ For the combination of models, \nanother proposal developed by GARCÍA-VILA \n\
    & FERERES (2012), in which they combined the \nAquaCrop model with an economic\
    \ optimization \nmodel, identified irrigation strategies and predicted \ntheir\
    \ impact on income. in which the simulated \nresults indicated that the best strategy\
    \ under water \nrestrictions combined the planting of crops with low \nwater use\
    \ in part of the area as a way of making more \nwater available for the most profitable\
    \ crops and with \nthe greatest water need.\nIn this review, several premises\
    \ involving \nprecision irrigation were addressed, from the use of \nsoil sensors,\
    \ remote sensing, artificial intelligence, \nmanagement zones for irrigation,\
    \ and variable-\nrate irrigation to agricultural modeling in view of \noptimizing\
    \ the use of water resources. However, there \nare other techniques and technologies\
    \ used in RI that \nhelp in the efficient use of both water and energy \nresources,\
    \ such as the use of wastewater (IBEKWE \net al., 2018; SHANNAG et al., 2021;\
    \ VERGINE et \nal., 2016), solar panels to reduce energy costs with \nwater pumping\
    \ and automation in irrigation systems \n(GRANT et al., 2022; SINGH et al., 2021)\
    \ and \nthe use of microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) to \nmitigate damage caused\
    \ by water deficit (ASHWIN \net al., 2022).\nCONCLUSION\nThis review of trends\
    \ and prospects for \nprecision irrigation for irrigation monitoring and \nmanagement\
    \ is based on relevant past and current \nresearch work that has contributed to\
    \ achieving \ngreater water savings in agriculture. It is hoped that \n12\nCiência\
    \ Rural, v.53, n.8, 2023.\nGundim et al.\nthis review article has given a broad\
    \ overview of \nresearch trends and generated new ideas for readers \non implementation\
    \ and execution approaches \nto choosing the best smart irrigation strategy, \n\
    paying attention to the fact that the combination of \nmonitoring methods via\
    \ soil, plant and climate is \nthe most assertive strategy to increase the energy\
    \ \nefficiency of water use in irrigated fields. However, \nit results in a large\
    \ volume of data to be analyzed, \nmaking it necessary to use algorithms based\
    \ on \nartificial intelligence, which promotes a fast and \nefficient monitoring\
    \ system of the collected data, \naiming the assertive recommendation of irrigation\
    \ at \na variable rate in the area irrigated to save water and \nenergy so as\
    \ not to overload the irrigating farmer with \nthe daily decision in determining\
    \ the irrigation dose.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors want to thank the scientific\

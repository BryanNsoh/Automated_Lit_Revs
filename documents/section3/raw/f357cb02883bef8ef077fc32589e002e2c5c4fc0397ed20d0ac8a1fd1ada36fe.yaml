    connection to monitor each plant and device performance via a data platform. During
    testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive enough to detect and measure plant transpiration,

    255 Accesses 1 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Climate instability directly affects
    agro-environments. Water scarcity, high air temperature, and changes in soil biota
    are some factors caused by environmental changes. Verified and precise phenotypic
    traits are required for assessing the impact of various stress factors on crop
    performance while keeping phenotyping costs at a reasonable level. Experiments
    which use a lysimeter method to measure transpiration efficiency are often expensive
    and require complex infrastructures. This study presents the development and testing
    process of an automated, reliable, small, and low-cost prototype system using
    IoT with high-frequency potential in near-real time. Because of its waterproofness,
    our device—LysipheN—assesses each plant individually and can be deployed for experiments
    in different environmental conditions (farm, field, greenhouse, etc.). LysipheN
    integrates multiple sensors, automatic irrigation according to desired drought
    scenarios, and a remote, wireless connection to monitor each plant and device
    performance via a data platform. During testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive
    enough to detect and measure plant transpiration, from early to ultimate plant
    developmental stages. Even though the results were generated on common beans,
    the LysipheN can be scaled up/adapted to other crops. This tool serves to screen
    transpiration, transpiration efficiency, and transpiration-related physiological
    traits. Because of its price, endurance, and waterproof design, LysipheN will
    be useful in screening populations in a realistic ecological and breeding context.
    It operates by phenotyping the most suitable parental lines, characterizing genebank
    accessions, and allowing breeders to make a target-specific selection using functional
    traits (related to the place where LysipheN units are located) in line with a
    realistic agronomic background. Background Excessive costs of water and/or limited
    access to it in some agricultural areas do not allow all producers to access available
    solutions [1, 2]. Breeders are constantly searching to identify new phenotypic
    traits in early-generation materials that can indicate drought resistance, and/or
    water-use efficiency, and allow higher crop yields and better seed quality while
    keeping production costs low [3, 4]. This is a challenging task, especially when
    dealing with a wide range of possible adaptations or extremely different final
    product quality (seeds). On the other hand, the room for crop adaptation is limited
    by climate and climate-change volatility. Furthermore, there is not enough precise
    information about how crops will respond to these changes [5]. In the case of
    common beans, drought stress (and its consequences) has a higher level of severity
    than other types of abiotic stresses to which the bean may be exposed [6]. However,
    these problems are present in many other crops. Experiments in diverse but well-described
    and well-managed conditions help researchers to determine crop behavior related
    to a given environment [7]. Experiments focused on important crops need to be
    accompanied by internal and external information on crop physiological reactions.
    The whole set of important responses is related to restricted water availability,
    which should be understood by compiling both physical and climatic components;
    different soil types and soil profile depths; plant density, and crop-atmosphere
    relationships [8]. The physiologically adequate and agronomically relevant stress
    timing and duration connected with high-frequency data will play a crucial role
    in understanding crop responses. Thus, crops’ water use has become a main focus
    and carries different concepts to be considered. Therefore, to define water productivity
    at the plant level, transpiration efficiency (TE) likely plays a crucial role
    as it is an important component of the concept called effective use of water (EUW).
    TE is defined by accumulated economic biomass (i.e., seeds) per water unit transpired
    via the plant body [9]. To measure TE, a long period of plant observation/weighing
    is an indispensable need during the entire crop cycle. Without automation, this
    work has a drudgery component. Additionally, [10] emphasize that EUW studies should
    not be the only factor in optimizing yield under limited water conditions; Understanding
    the role of both limited and non-restricted transpiration during the diurnal phase
    and also across the whole phenology is one of the most important questions connected
    to target-specific breeding. Crop growth models recognize that water scarcity
    is associated with a high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which in turn implies
    a condition of atmospheric water stress [11]. The dehydration resistance of leaves
    to very high VPDs has become a trait that researchers suggest being included when
    considering breeding crop varieties adapted to water-limited environments [12].
    On the other hand, under drought conditions, a limited transpiration rate under
    high VPD could be used to conserve soil water for later use when seeds are filled
    [13]. Logically the soil water availability and dynamic changes in water consumption
    during different phenological steps are crucial factors in determining the impact
    of VPD on crop development and should be included in analyses [14]. The challenge
    of useful phenotyping is aimed at techniques, tools, and databases together with
    the entire phenotypic platforms which rely on “hypothesis-driven” rather than
    “available tool-driven” research outputs [15]. The lysimeters measure changes
    in water movements by weighing the entire system. However, because of their robustness
    and complexity, most designs are considered impractical and expensive thus they
    are not widely used in research centers [16]. Additionally, the weighing lysimeter
    is a very accurate method for studying crop water-related requirements and gives
    valuable data for improving crop water management. Understanding this, some agronomists
    or crop scientists use pots or trays in evapotranspiration calculations [17, 18].
    Undoubtedly, there is a constantly increasing need for plant-phenotyping systems,
    which can (semi-)automatically measure water movement and calculate water use
    to identify genotypes with improved EUW [19]. In support of the above-mentioned
    considerations, the integration of technology to study plant features has reached
    the point at which novelty robotics solutions and mechatronic systems have often
    been offered [20]. Mechatronic systems that analyze plant-pot systems with (semi-)controlled
    irrigation are the next logical step to go further to find conservative crops
    with a limited transpiration rate at high VPDs [13]. Since VPD appears to have
    the greatest influence on transpiration response compared to other environmental
    variables [12], different studies have presented their prototypes reflecting VPD
    values. One of these is the lysimeter developed with a water-use-optimized irrigation
    system developed by Vera-Repullo. The study includes irrigation determined from
    the lysimeter’s dataset processing and an embedded system controller which is
    used as a remote data logger and allows data information access through the internet
    [21]. However, it is crucial that researchers focus efforts on developing tools
    that may be used directly in field conditions, not only in regulated and protected
    greenhouses. Some authors [16] have presented a weighing lysimeter prototype at
    the field level which was used on the farm and placed in the soil. Solutions implemented
    so far also include remote-sensing systems (i.e., wireless sensors with dataloggers),
    which have become an important tool for crop scientists. These technologies allow
    for capturing standardized data, reducing time-demanding operations, and eliminating
    differences in individual data perception [15]. Therefore, it is common that remote
    systems to be integrated with the internet-of-things (IoT). One example of this
    is the solution shown by [17], which implemented a low-cost weighing lysimeter
    that was able to measure the weight of potted crops and use an open-source platform
    to determine water balance in irrigation periods. Data were sent remotely to the
    cloud and accessible via the internet. In that way, [22] the system used 100 balances
    (scales) inside a glasshouse where each one automatically logged weight data every
    minute. In this study [22], two common bean cultivars demonstrate greater drought
    sensitivity compared to soybean cultivars. Thus, it is demonstrated that gravimetric
    platforms allow recognizing of the effects of biomass accumulation and transpiration
    per individual plant, as well as calculations related to the TE at the cycle end
    when seed yield is available. Through the measurements of plant weight changes,
    the extracted transpiration rate profiles can identify water-saving and water-spending
    mechanisms based on daily plant water losses (standardized to actual leaf area
    or other traits) representing transpiration response to VPD [23]. Our study shows
    the development and testing process for a solution-oriented tool that combines
    sensors with IoT technology. We called the device “LysipheN” (also Gravimetric
    Unit—GU). LysipheN is an automated, low-cost, and novel prototype for measuring
    the soil–plant-atmosphere continuum responses. By measuring the weight changes
    of the system (plant sown in a pot with soil) and reducing evaporation by surface
    coverage, LysipheN can automatically obtain the transpiration amount every minute
    diurnally or across the entire crop lifecycle. The system recognizes exactly the
    amount of water that has been irrigated within the system since the beginning
    of the experiment. The internal tissue (stem and pod temperature), soil moisture,
    air humidity, and air temperature sensors have been included in the device to
    capture the climatic data. Electronically, the LysipheN is an autonomous self-standing
    IoT-embedded system that sends data through the internet and stores a backup of
    millions of data locally within each unit. Besides that, the Arduino-based integrated
    system allows the integration of more sensors together. Using a Linux-based operating
    system (OS) allows updating and identifying the responses of different genotypes
    to different environments in an almost real-time manner. Each GU is an independent
    system and can be placed in different sites—growth chambers, greenhouses, and
    even within (remote) field trials. The goal of this study is to present a LysipheN
    system that can identify outstanding parental accessions for a particular region,
    using lines within a realistic breeding context, connected to product profile
    information, to dissect water-use-related traits of different genotypes/species
    and help to characterize genebank accessions. The LysipheN concept is oriented
    to be universal and versatile across a range of special-interest in crops such
    as beans, rice, bananas, tropical forage crops, and others in different stress
    scenarios related to TPEs of interest. Results The research implemented several
    experiments to achieve secure, highly precise measurements via the developed LysipheN
    prototype. Several different prototypes were tested (Gravimetric Units). The prototype
    device is described in “Materials and methods” section. For detailed technological
    adjustment data, please see Additional file 1. Once the defined version was ready,
    10 prototype replicas of LysipheN units were built to be tested. The experiments
    were conducted using the Bioversity International and CIAT Alliance facilities,
    inside a greenhouse in controlled conditions and under a monitored environment.
    The prototypes were set to record data every 5 min. The system weight (Fig. 1),
    air RH, air temperature, internal stem temperature, and soil temperature (Fig.
    2) were monitored. Together with the data from the sensors, every prototype calculates
    and recognizes data such as bean variety, number of irrigation events, total irrigated
    volume, etc. These data are stored automatically and sent to the phenotyping platform
    database. The raw results show that GU’s are stable (1, 2, 3, 5, 6–10), only GU4
    shows some noise data (Fig. 1). The irrigation events are clearly visible close
    to 10 am of each day. Mark higher raw weight changes in younger plants suggesting
    very high transpiration and water consumption connected to active prolongation
    growth on the plants. Fig. 1 Raw weight data from ten prototypes (evaluation of
    3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), GU6
    to GU10 (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). A remaining noise can be noted
    on GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Fig. 2 Air temperature, electronic board
    temperature, the inside stem temperature (inserted thermocouple), and soil temperature
    together with air RH and calculated VPD. GU1 to GU5 studied younger (PCS) plants
    (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 studied plants close to the final harvest
    (PCH) Full size image The results show the environmental and stem temperature
    data from GUs (Fig. 2). The environmental data are logically pretty similar as
    the experiment was conducted in the same greenhouse. The only variable here can
    be visualized in the stem temperature as this is affected by the stem water conductivity
    and other genotype-related factors. Total leaf area (TLA) values were calculated
    for both experimental and control plants. The bar chart (Fig. 3) shows the calculated
    TLA per plant and nicely visualizes the growth differences between groups of smaller
    and big plants. The leaf area of smaller plants were around 200 cm2, meanwhile,
    the big plants’ leaf area was around 3000 cm2. Note, to standardize the row transpiration
    values among plants it is crucial to know the leaf area of each plant. Fig. 3
    Total leaf surface area calculated based on measurements of every single leaf
    surface area per plant (evaluation of 3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 contain
    younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain old plants
    close to physiological maturity (> 80 days after sowing; PCH) Full size image
    Data analysis The cumulative transpiration per plant was calculated from GU data
    as the difference between the amount of water irrigated (ml) and the weight loss
    for 24 h (in our case for 3 consecutive days; Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Cumulative transpiration
    was calculated for every single GU. GU1 to GU5 contain younger (PCS) plants (1
    month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain (PCH) old plants (> 80 days after
    sowing). The influence of the remaining noise from the load cell can be noted
    in GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Additionally, from manually measured TLA
    values and cumulative transpiration previously obtained, the net transpiration
    standardized for LA was obtained for PCS (small; GU 1–5) and PCH (big; GU 6–10)
    plants (Fig. 5). Thus, the net cumulative transpiration per leaf unit (ml cm−2)
    by the plants in different phenological stages can be observed. Note the markable
    differences between day (high) and night (low) net transpiration (Fig. 4). Fig.
    5 Net cumulative transpiration was calculated per leaf area unit for every single
    prototype. GU1 to GU5 contains data from young (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing),
    and GU6 to GU10 (PCH) contains data from physiologically mature plants (> 80 days
    after sowing). The influence of remaining noise can be noted in GU2 and GU10 data.
    Mark the difference in the scale between GU1-5 and GU6-10 due to TLA being lower
    on these plants Full size image The results show the significant difference between
    cumulative values of plant transpiration standardized to leaf area (ml cm−2) regarding
    their developmental stage. Figure 5 shows the raw, however stable data of cumulative
    transpiration standardized per leaf area. Discussion The LysipheN prototypes demonstrate
    their ability to measure 24/7 plant water consumption via transpiration (soil–plant–atmosphere
    continuum) changes according to the concept proposed by Poorter et al. [7]. The
    other variables such as stem and pods’ internal temperature, air temperature,
    air relative humidity, and soil water content were measured individually for a
    single plant. At the same time, the LysipheN units successfully supported plant
    growth without any supervision. This was achieved by controlling the daily irrigation
    of the individual plants based on plants’ previous water consumption data. The
    irrigation events were implemented by water injection reaching the defined target
    weight point every day (Fig. 1). The 10 LysipheN units were assembled based on
    the final prototype constructed from different previous versions of the GU. In
    this study, the previous versions are not shown. However, the development prototype
    process can be found in Additional file 1: “Prototype development process” section.
    This process was oriented to solving issues related to irrigation systems, hardware
    selection, sensor stability, and reducing the noise affecting the load cells.
    Some of these issues were related to the electric noise or were caused by vibrations
    [17]. Monitoring water-use efficiency (WUE) in diurnal schemes or for the entire
    growth cycle under different environmental stresses (such as VPD or irradiance
    [24]) is extremely helpful for the detection of preferred phenotypes. The specific
    target population of environments (TPE) needs to be properly considered before
    data mining starts, as only TPE-related outputs are useful for breeders who depend
    on realistic contexts. Evaluation of the final prototype on plants focused on
    showing that the prototype can effectively measure transpiration water losses
    in real-time, precisely capturing the diurnal dynamics (Fig. 1). However, some
    prototypes (GU2, GU3, and GU10) showed noise susceptibilities in the weighing
    measurements (abrupt and non-logical changes in the chart) which affected data
    quality and the analysis. We kept these data for easier detection of transpiration
    variability by former users. This particular erroneous behavior can easily be
    repaired by acquiring a high-load cell-quality sensor. The prototypes revealed
    that PCH transpired 100–200 more grams of water than PCS plants per day (during
    the 3 consecutive days), under the same environment and soil conditions. This
    is an expected result since the TLA of PCH plants was over 2000 cm2 and PCS under
    500 cm2 (Fig. 3). At this point, it is important to mention that plants’ transpiration
    under the same environment depends partly on genetics and partly on the presence
    of other abiotic or biotic stresses, and leaf temperature, thickness, and surface
    area [25, 26]. Knowing the weight losses per day, cumulative transpiration per
    leaf area/plant can be easily calculated using a particular formula (Fig. 4).
    As mentioned above, the transpiration of each plant should definitely be standardized
    per LA (Fig. 5) to unify responses between different plants and eliminate the
    genotype or treatment effect within each group. The calculations standardized
    to LA, allow us to determine that the amount of water transpired per leaf area
    was higher in smaller (PCS) than in bigger (PCH) plants due to the leaf phenology
    and in accordance with other physiological studies. These results demonstrated
    that the LysipheN prototypes are sensitive enough to detect and measure even tiny
    weight changes and then produce good transpiration data from very early to oldest
    plants across developmental stages. With additional measurements (air RH, air,
    soil, and internal stem temperatures) the co-factor effects in varying VPD (Fig.
    2) can be determined and support deeper analysis focused on factors that restrict
    transpiration. Genotypes with restricted transpiration could be more resistant
    to terminal drought but more susceptible to heat waves. However, the particular
    environment/soil scenario needs to be considered before any final decisions are
    made. The developed GU prototype is an innovative low-cost tool for modern phenotyping.
    Our system showed that combining different technologies focused on plant measurements
    creates a synergy that meets specific needs of crop physiologists, pre-breeders,
    genebank curators, and breeders. Due to the previous calibration procedures, the
    LysipheN unit is completely portable, allowing it to work in different environmental
    conditions and be connected to different electrical sources (solar panels, any
    110/220 AC source, batteries, 12 V power plants, etc.). Additionally, as an IoT
    phenotyping tool, each unit allows access to data remotely in real time through
    the web-user application. This application will send an email alert message if
    values are out of the programmed limits. Besides this, every prototype integrates
    an SQL database for data secure storing and algorithms able to calculate the water
    losses. The automatic adjustment (based on the predetermined stress scenario)
    of the next irrigation event based on the programmed watering scenario is another
    advantage of the system. High data precision will facilitate different crops’
    growth such as rice, forages, bananas, and other species according to the researchers’
    interest. Importantly, it will reduce the “preliminary experiments” to a minimum,
    especially when new stress, and more importantly new species are introduced. At
    the time of the study publication, the cost of materials per LysipheN unit (without
    manufacturing costs) was around 500 USD. Conclusions The developed LysipheN prototypes
    could become an important low-cost tool for crop pre-breeding and phenotyping
    teams, especially in places where scientists have limited resources for a big
    phenotyping platform or where the number of studied materials varies or is low.
    Development efforts were focused on the assurance of data stability and quality
    and also on a user-friendly approach for researchers even in remote areas of the
    world. The full availability for remote use of these units is an intended and
    crucial advantage when region-specific responses are needed. In this case, soil,
    water, and other inputs are used from this particular place to ensure outcomes
    suitable for modelers, pre-breeders, and breeders. This process is called “target-specific
    breeding” and is in accordance with the recommendations presented by physiological
    breeding. So far, we built 10 LysipheN prototypes capable of indirectly recognizing
    the growth specifications of individual plants by direct evaluation of their transpiration
    with a high level of precision. Weight measurements can vary between prototypes;
    therefore, easy calibration and mainboard thermal corrections are sufficient to
    solve this problem. However, the load cell noise, water condensation, and vibrations
    can affect high-precision measurements when plants are very small (one or two
    true leaves) because daily weight changes are close to the load cell threshold
    (± 5 g). With bigger plants, prototypes demonstrated successful noise reduction
    and are very reliable. The next development efforts will be focused on implementing
    cleaning algorithms and using robust industrial sensors. Using low-cost devices
    that allow remote connection to collect data in near real-time as also automatic
    irrigation based on feedback with previously transpired water is an important
    facilitation step for even small research groups to verify valuable hypotheses.
    The tool multiplies its benefits when selected functional traits are used in acceptable
    breeding contexts on materials with acceptable agronomic background (outstanding
    parental identification or early-materials evaluation). LysipheN is a tool to
    implement precise crop phenotyping, useful for breeders and physiologists but
    also in pre-breeding teams (characterization of genebank accessions by curators).
    Materials and methods In order to detect errors and challenges and measure plant
    transpiration, from early to ultimate plant developmental stages the following
    methodology is outlined. All additional technical details are included in Additional
    file 1. Experimental design An experiment with one common bean variety was carried
    out with the 10 previously-calibrated GUs inside the greenhouse with one plant
    in each GU. The experiment proved system stability, and automatic irrigation scheme
    viability, and verified the minimum threshold in weight recognition (real cell-load
    accuracy). To assess the contrast in transpiration, plants evaluated using GUs
    were divided into two groups with 5 replicates each according to their phenological
    stage (Fig. 6). The first group was formed with plants 30 days after sowing (PCS)
    and the second group with plants closer to the final harvest (PCH) (> 80 days
    after sowing). Fig. 6 Prototypes with plants—two groups. 1. Right—5 prototypes
    with younger plants (PCS) (1 month after sowing). 2. Left—5 prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Center—water source container for prototypes’
    automatic daily irrigation supply Full size image In addition, 15 extra pots with
    one plant per pot, were placed next to the prototypes for manual evapotranspiration
    monitoring (control plants, Fig. 7). The soil surface of both the control and
    experimental GU was covered with black polyethylene to eliminate evaporation by
    irradiation and so measure only transpiration changes of individual plants. Fig.
    7 Prototypes with experimental (right) and control (left) plants. 1. Five prototypes
    with younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing). 2. Five prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Control plants. Note that all pots are
    surface covered with black polyethylene. In the middle (between 1 and 2) there
    is an irrigation basin to feed peristaltic pumps for automatic irrigation Full
    size image Automatic data collection Every GU prototype was scheduled to automatically
    supply water to the plant. The amount of irrigated water depends on the amount
    of weight lost via plant transpiration during the last 24 h, after the previous
    irrigation event. In this case, 100% of the transpired water was added to each
    GU for each irrigation event, and plants were irrigated with the same amount of
    consumed water. For the purposes of this study, 3 consecutive days were selected.
    Manual data collection Some samples were taken manually during the experiment.
    Initially, 1 day before the experiment started, leaf length (LL) (from tip to
    petiole) and leaf width (LW) in millimeters at the leaves’ widest point were measured
    manually. However, these two values, LL and LW multiplied, give a rectangle area.
    Therefore, every single Leaf surface Area (LA) in cm2, was calculated by Eq. 1.
    (1) Note that GF is a genotype factor, which is a constant value of the area inside
    the rectangle that is not part of the leaf. This GF factor was obtained previously,
    and can be specific per used genotype. Thus, the Total Leaf surface Area in cm2
    (TLA) was calculated per plant (Eq. 2) as the addition of every single Leaf surface
    Area (LA). (2) TLA values were calculated for both experimental and control plants.
    Note that in Eq. 2 “n” is the number of trifoliate leaves in the plant, and LA
    is the single leaf area. Additionally, the number of leaves was also obtained.
    TLA measurements are depicted in Fig. 3 (Results section). The LysipheN prototype
    The LysipheN prototype is a mechatronic device, including hardware and software
    implemented in a mechanical structure. The mechanical structure is constructed
    as a robust, compact, and light assembly allowing the LysipheN to be easily portable.
    For the hardware implementation, the electromechanical devices, a microcontroller,
    IoT devices, and other sensors were equipped and plugged into an embedded electronics
    system. The software was developed using different programming languages and communication
    protocols. The LysipheN prototypes can measure different types of variables in
    the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. The directly measured variable is transpiration,
    calculated via system weight changes over time. Other sensors (the tissue temperature,
    soil moisture, relative air humidity, and air temperature) serve as a source of
    additional data and support the high reliability/repeatability of the experiments.
    Using a peristaltic pump, the prototype can perform automatic and precise irrigation
    during the whole plant life cycle. Each GU is able to accurately quantify the
    transpiration losses and automatically adjust the later irrigation amount together
    with feedback from individual pre-settled unit treatment (irrigation amount in
    ml can vary from 0 to > 100% of the water loss during the evaluated period of
    time, based on the realistic or hypothetical stress scenario). The LysipheN-cultivated
    plants grow without any supervision and their performance is much better than
    in hand-irrigated plants (no damage by errors in over-watering by technicians).
    The initial parameter setting thus serves to supply plants with adequate water
    availability during the entire cycle or support constant under or overwatering.
    Accessing data in real-time is possible since every prototype has integrated a
    remote-access web application. LysipheN prototype portability allows users to
    easily move the tool to the evaluation site. The right combination of genotypes
    (deep understanding of parental lines for further crossing) together with the
    selection upon different stressors (climate, soil, watering regime, response to
    fertilizers, rhizobia etc.) will help to obtain proofs of concept for physiological
    trait/allele combinations that could boost yield, but still within a realistic
    breeding context. Mechanical structure The structure was built (Fig. 8) using
    elements purchased in a home store (our case in Homecenter in Colombia). Construction
    elements of the prototypes consist of commonly used materials such as polyvinyl
    chloride tube (PVC) 6-inch length and tube ½-inch diameter, polytetrafluoroethylene
    (PTFE; Teflon) 6-inch diameter, and electrical square box 12 × 12 cm. The mechanical
    structure contains an integrated weighing sensor (Fig. 10), but also, an irrigation
    system (actuator), cable and water hose protection, and an electronic box. The
    GU prototype structure itself (depending on the load cell capacity) is strong
    enough to support the weight of the complete system (pot, soil, and plant) up
    to 60 kg. Fig. 8 Gravimetric unit. 1. Teflon base for placing the pot. 2. Electrical
    Ip65 box. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch diameter PVC base. 4. Output holes for
    connecting sensors and dripping irrigation tubes. 5. Peristaltic pump for irrigation
    Full size image Hardware Since the GU prototype was developed as a complete embedded
    IoT development system, the hardware required a design adaptation process to build
    a compact electronic board with ports for the sensors, and other devices that
    facilitate the electronic working of the prototypes. This adaptation and electronic
    design process were carried out in different stages oriented to the GU hardware
    to be fully competent for the various parts: sensors’ data acquisition; irrigation
    control; electrical source connection and backup; data collection; control microcontroller,
    and IoT internal communication and application’s device (Fig. 9.). Fig. 9 Hardware

    structure was ready, the physical scope was defined to retain the ergonomics and
    protection of the electronic system without neglecting its basic operation. Sensor’s
    data acquisition Weight system measurements The weighing system (sensor, amplifier,
    and converter) returns the primary and most important variable in the measurements.
    A load cell [27] was used as the sensor to measure raw data in terms of voltage
    changes depending on the compression applied to the sensor (Fig. 10). Thus, after
    signal treatment, the system’s weight changes are measured for every required
    sample time (from milliseconds to hours), and—logically—individually for each
    GU. Therefore, considering a known initial dry weight of the substrate (soil),
    the weight system calculates the actual soil water content in % and according
    to how much water was supplied/lost evaluates the pot humidity in each period
    [28]. The sensor junction with the body of LysipheN was easily assembled in the
    structure using screws (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Weight sensor installation. 1. Weight
    sensor (load cell). 2. Metal box as a support. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch
    diameter PVC base of the whole unit Full size image As the load cell works at
    a very low voltage level with 3–5 V input (1 mV in this case as an output signal)
    it is necessary to use the signal amplifier system (instrumentation amplifier)
    [28]. The ADS1232 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) was used for this purpose
    (Texas Instruments, USA). Internal pod and stem temperature measurements The prototype
    includes two thermocouple sensors to measure the temperature inside the stem and
    the fruit/pod. developed a methodology to measure the sap flow (however, this
    concept needs to be verified in our system as the most important part is the sensor
    insulation). In our case, the two sensors measure the internal pod and internal
    stem temperature by using the K-type thermocouple (K-type Teflon thermocouple
    with Nickel chromium and Nickel aluminum alloy) (Uxcell K-Type Thermocouple Wire).
    Each thermocouple (sensor) has an adapted welded end and the temperature changes
    applied to this union generate a small voltage as an output (mV) (Seebeck effect)
    transformed into the temperature. This data provides essential insights for plant
    modelers. Future crop models must accurately use varied tissue temperatures to
    estimate air temperature’s impact on growth in a changing climate. During this
    phase, internal stem and pod temperatures were measured to find links to other
    variables, plant behavior, and the influence of direct sun radiation. Electronical
    board’s temperature measurement There is a recognized temperature-based influence
    on electronic devices during their operation that could directly affect the reliability
    of working [29]. Therefore, methods to reduce the effect of the temperature should
    be applied in the design of electronic embedded boards [17] For this purpose,
    the temperature sensor TMP36 [30] was used to measure the air temperature related
    to the microclimate to which the electronical board is exposed. The data from
    this sensor is used to run an auto-compensation temperature calibration algorithm
    for more precise weight measurements. Environmental variables The monitoring of
    the immediate/cumulative plant responses according to treatment concerning actual
    climatic conditions is a necessary step for climate change-oriented plant research
    [18]. Besides, these variables are extremely important in any comparison of plants’
    responses [31]. However, sometimes climate data from far-set weather stations
    are used. Even if the climate is measured in plant proximity, some basic errors
    can easily occur because of convection, conduction, or radiation. In the developed
    LysipheN prototype, air temperature (Ta) and relative air humidity (air RH) close
    to the GU location are measured to know the dynamics of these variables during
    the experiment. These variables (Ta and RH) play a crucial role in terms of the
    VPD calculation in relation to these and transpiration demand [32]. Thus, based
    on that data, the evapotranspiration models can be calculated [33]. To measure
    Ta and air RH, an SI7021 IoT sensor together with a Sonoff module was used. The
    sensor measurement range is 0–100% RH, and − 10 to 85 °C. The precision of the
    sensors is approximately ± 3% in humidity and ± 0.4 °C for the temperature measurements.
    This sensor does not require a calibration process. Only the Tasmota code [34]
    must be uploaded to the Sonoff module with the Wi-Fi credentials. This module
    is very small. Therefore, plant development is not affected. Water irrigation
    control Poorter et al. [7] proposed different options to evaluate water consumption
    in the sense of irrigating plants in each pot individually. The consumed water
    can be replaced by plant irrigation while maintaining a nearly constant soil water
    status during the day [21]. Irrigation was supplied with high precision actuators
    (water volume error 5–10 ml) which were also used to support two different irrigation
    systems (dripping point from above the soil surface and classic bottom irrigation
    reaching first the roots). Having both systems available will allow a wider range
    of plant types to grow, including lowland rice under simulated flooding [21].
    The developed LysipheN prototype includes a programming algorithm for, among others,
    consulting local network time every 10 s in cases (experiments) where irrigation
    control by a specific time is required (below). The data of actual transpiration
    or tissue (leaf, bud, flower, pod) temperature are immediately available after
    any water supply. For the precise control of the irrigation system, a 12 V peristaltic
    pump [35] was used and connected to a digital relay which is an electronic device
    used to implement switching on/off logic [36]. During each experiment, irrigation
    process parameters may easily be changed depending on the user or plant requirements
    according to the type of water availability scenario in the developed user interface
    (UI) for the prototype (below). In a factory setting, irrigation was scheduled
    every day at a specific programmed time (usually early morning). Electrical source
    connection and backup Any experiment with LysipheN units needs an autonomous electrical
    and commonly used universal 12 V source. This allows its use at any location or
    country. Therefore, all experiments involved a battery backup system, which in
    parallel, secured 100% of the time working for the ten replicas built. Data collection
    and control microcontroller For an electronic system that requires sensor use,
    it is essential to have a microcontroller capable of reading and converting analog
    signals or digital messages into useful data. To solve this problem, the Atmega328p
    was selected [37]. This microcontroller programming is open source (using C++
    language) and can be done using the Arduino IDE. However, to get remote access
    and an internet connection for the prototype, this microcontroller needs to be
    accompanied by another device capable of saving data and sending it via Wi-Fi
    (as the Atmega328p does not have these functions). IoT internal communication
    and application device As mentioned above, Atmega328p (microcontroller) is used
    only for sensors data readings. For the prototype, it was necessary to use another
    device serving as a complement to this microcontroller able to both save and send
    data via Wi-Fi and also show them in an application Node-Red interface (see Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming). To solve this, we selected Raspberry
    Pi Zero W [38]. It is a small development board, a one-core processor with 512
    MB RAM, and integrated with a 32 GB microSD card for storing data and OS working.
    The Raspberry Pi Zero W function is highly important in the prototype’s working.
    It allows, among others: Host the main LysipheN unit web application (Fig. 15)
    where all collected data are shown and plotted in real-time. Store data in an
    internal integrated MySQL database. Control the peristaltic pump. Communicate
    and request data from Atmega 328p Microcontroller. Make easy wireless microcontrollers
    and main web application reprogramming. The use of this development board is like
    having a minicomputer within each LysipheN. Because it will allow easy connection
    and configuration of the main web application as well as allow integration of
    possible behavioral algorithm estimation and correlations that are within the
    limits of what is permitted by Raspberry’s characteristics. Main electronic board
    design The developed prototype has an integrated electronic board that contains
    ports for all devices necessary for the system’s working. For the correct integration,
    the development of the board carried out separate tests per device into an embedded
    system (Figs. 11 and 12). Thus, each sensor was tested individually using Arduino
    Uno to verify the communication working and data consistency. Fig. 11 Schematic
    design in EASYEDA Full size image Fig. 12 PCB design (top view), JLCPCB preview
    Full size image The electronic board is equipped with all devices and connections
    required. It is divided into three different parts. The first part is composed
    by: Supply connections that are connected to the 12 V main source. Internal 5
    V and 3 V converter that will supply to the Microcontroller, Raspberry, and other
    devices. The second part is accomplished by: Microcontroller (Atmega328p). Raspberry
    Pi Zero W with working respective connection. The third part in the main electronic
    board was meant for sensors connection. Weighing system (load cell, electric filter,
    and ADS1232 ADC) using a wired connection to the Atmega328p microprocessor. Two
    K-type thermocouples (tiny Teflon end welded). TMP36 sensor. Relay for ON/OFF
    peristaltic pump control. 12 V peristaltic pump for precise controlling of water
    supply. Finally, each unit has a main button, to start the entire system when
    it is switched off or to do a reboot, if necessary. A mini 5 V fan was connected
    to the IP65 box to cool it and make some airflow over electronic devices inside
    the box. Server web hosting device The GU project now comprises 10 prototypes.
    Even though each GU is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Zero W that works, among others,
    as application web hosting, this application is focused on single prototype information.
    Therefore, a Udoo Neo [39] model has been used as a server where the Node-Red
    general application works. This application contains data information of each
    GU connected to the same network and it is part of a bean phenotyping platform
    (in preparation) developed with MySQL and other saving and processing tools (below).
    Software The prototypes’ Programming routine was built in two different languages
    and programming environments. The microcontroller was programmed in C++ through
    Arduino IDE uses, and Raspberry Pi’s application was developed on Node-Red, which
    is a programming tool based on visual connections of nodes and allows different
    uses of internal Raspberry input and output pins, besides Wi-Fi connection and
    MQTT communication. Communication Perfect communication synchrony between devices
    is critical for any automated IoT development. Establishing the protocols and
    making sure that the data will not be lost, must be considered during system routine
    construction (Fig. 13). In our case, the Raspberry Pi and Microcontroller are
    compatible with serial communication, which makes it easier to share data processes
    between them. These two devices are perfectly synchronized. The Raspberry Pi Zero
    W sends a JSON package to the Phenotyping Platform with the data of each prototype
    using the MQTT protocol at each interval time previously defined. Fig. 13 Prototype
    communication flow Full size image Another important aspect of how to increase
    the communication quality for each LysipheN unit was the direct SPI connection
    between Raspberry Pi Zero W and the microcontroller. This allows the user to change
    the programming routine in both devices at any time and gives the possibility
    to add or change sensors and actuators in the future. Microcontroller programming
    routine A working program was written in C++ language to establish the main routine
    of the device that will collect data from all sensors (Fig. 14). This program
    code considers the working requirements of each sensor. Fig. 14 Microcontroller
    programming routine Full size image First, the program will load whole libraries
    and initial parameters to read the traits of the sensors’ signal data. Then, the
    user can choose in the Raspberry Pi Zero W application (see “Raspberry application’s
    user interface programming”) whether the weight temperature calibration will begin
    or not. If yes, this process will take 1 or 2 days depending on the required quality
    of the calibration. If not, the program will assign the parameters obtained during
    the last calibration to the weighing process which can then start immediately.
    If a data request arrives from Raspberry Pi Zero W, all sensors’ data are read
    and packaged in a JSON message, and it is sent to Pi Zero. Then, Atmega328p and
    the sensors are electrically disconnected for a previously defined time. Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming Every single unit was equipped with its
    user web application (Fig. 15). The role of the Raspberry Pi Zero W is to run
    the main application that uses a Node-Red programming environment, which is based
    on visual Programming through node connection and allows writing functions, Raspberry’s
    GPIO uses, and communication protocols such as MQTT. The flowchart is the name
    of the routine programmed, and it begins a short time before Raspberry starts.
    Fig. 15 Application interface with real-time data during the calibration process.
    Left to right; the last 36 h the weight and temperatures plot; the last 30 min
    weight and temperature plot; total water; and the current amount irrigated in
    the experiment and downloading data panel Full size image The application manages:
    Correcting the microcontroller’s electrical connection/disconnection. Requesting,
    receiving, and storing data from the microcontroller. Watering for daily irrigation
    control. Plotting the real-time weight and temperature changes in a web interface
    (Fig. 15). Sending data to the Phenotyping platform (Fig. 16). Fig. 16 Individual
    prototype programming of the user application Full size image Another important
    feature related to routine programming works in “parallel.” This enables the applications
    to be pending the defined irrigation time and simultaneously request, save, and
    send the data. Thus, when the time of irrigation is reached, the application executes
    the function that supplies the water based on the parameters defined previously.
    All received data are stored automatically in the MySQL database. Then, the database
    updates a CSV file with the new information and this file is ready to be downloaded
    at any time as users require. At the same time, a new JSON package is created
    and sent using the MQTT protocol to the Mosquitto broker (phenotyping platform
    server), where data from the 10 devices were saved into the MySQL database and
    interfaced in the phenotyping application in real-time. Once the data are received
    and saved, the microcontroller state is changed to OFF again and the cycle is
    restarted depending on the sample time defined by the user previously. This not
    only saves energy and protects the system, but also helps to keep the load cell
    in the correct calibration stage. Once the sampling time is reached, the Atmega328p
    state is switched to ON and then, the application requests data using the serial
    path. Phenotyping platform The aim of the platform was to construct an IoT-based
    automation platform to monitor and control environmental conditions inside greenhouses
    [40]. This platform includes vast information from many experiments on beans (Phaseolus
    vulgaris L.) at CIAT. It was developed as an open service able to receive, store,
    and show data in real-time. In addition, the IoT platform includes the application
    developed for requesting, receiving, and storing data from the Gravimetric Units
    (ten replicas), which is a necessary complement for the phenotyping development
    described in this study (Fig. 17). Fig. 17 Phenotyping platform. Note, that it
    is possible to access to complete experiment’s location-measured data and controlled
    variables information together with prototypes’ received data in a global database
    Full size image The phenotyping platform allows a general view of the data from
    the LysipheN unit prototypes in a real-time. In addition, this tool is able to
    integrate physiological and statistical analysis useful for breeders or other
    research purposes. It is important to mention that communication between the Phenotyping
    Platform and the LysipheN is made through the internet connection since both (the
    prototype and phenotyping platform) manage the wireless connection. However, developed
    LysipheN prototypes can be used without the internet, even though Wi-Fi is only
    for real-time monitoring and initial configurations, all the previously specified
    prototypes’ functionalities were programmed to work with only an electrical source.

    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t

    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information

    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate

    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.

    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation

    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: Ocean monitoring systems are designed for continuous monitoring of
    the seas and oceans to track their evolution and thus anticipate environmental
    issues. However, they are often based on Internet of Things (IoT) systems that
    are expensive, hard to maintain, and offer little spatial coverage. An emerging
    alternative is Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) systems that offer good geographical
    coverage but, as a reliable and real-time monitoring system, they also face several
    challenges such as environmental conditions, spatio-temporal granularity, terrain
    oleography, etc. This paper introduces an easy-to-use software tool to crawl water-quality
    data from up to 6 satellite instruments (i.e. Sentinel 3A, Sentinel-3B, NOAA VIIRS,
    SNPP VIIRS, Aqua MODIS, Terra MODIS) of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Coopernicus
    system and NASA's Marine Environmental Monitoring Service. We also provide an
    in-depth analysis in terms of reliability and data coverage for the chlorophyll-a
    (Chl-a) in a highly anthropised local/regional context like the Mar Menor lagoon
    (Murcia, Spain), where serious socio-environmental issues are arising due to the
    eutrophication process. Our results show a good linear correlation between in
    situ data, obtained by several Spanish public institutions since 2016, and data
    generated by the IRTM-NN (Inverse Radiative Transfer Model-Neural Network) algorithm
    of Sentinel 3 in general, reaching coefficient correlation values close to 0.9.
    They also show that organic matter inputs from ephemeral streams are relevant
    in determining Chl-a concentrations. Moreover, the temporal coverage using a single
    instrument is rather limited, as no data were recorded for 80% of the days studied.
    This figure decreases to 30% when data from the 6 satellite instruments are combined,
    increasing the temporal granularity of the measurements from approximately 5 to
    1.5 days, suggesting the need for a combination of these systems for a robust
    SRS system.

    remote sensingData coverageQuantitative validation 1. Introduction Remote sensing
    is gaining relevance in recent years as it offers the monitoring of different
    habitats around the globe such as forest (Lechner et al., 2020), agriculture fields
    (Huang et al., 2018), soil moisture (Pezij et al., 2020), urban environments (Singh,
    2019), archaeological and cultural heritage (Luo et al., 2019), Oceans (Martin,
    2014), Rivers (Beveridge et al., 2020) or Rainfall driven hazards (Wright et al.,
    2017), just to name a few. Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS); i.e., monitoring systems
    based on sensors aboard satellites that detect and record reflected or emitted
    energy, are increasingly available, offering global coverage, frequent acquisition,
    and high spatial resolution (Chuvieco, 2016). Beyond obtaining satellite images
    with high-quality geometric and radiometric information, many biogeophysical parameters
    have been obtained from the processing of these images (Sowmya et al., 2017; Vos
    et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2013). For instance, from the spatial and spectral
    ranges provided by the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor,
    44 different standard data products have been developed and are classified into
    Atmosphere, Land, Cryosphere and Ocean products (Justice et al., 2002). Moreover,
    the continuous development of new retrieval algorithms and the launch of new high-quality
    satellites has led to the development of various satellite products with different
    spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions, such as ESA''s Sentinels missions
    (Malenovskỳ et al., 2012) and the NPP VIIRS products (Justice et al., 2013). SRS
    data is becoming popular for near real-time (NRT) monitoring systems to address
    natural and societal challenges such as shedding light on global and regional
    challenges, thereby supporting several initiatives (e.g. Sendai Framework, Paris
    Agreement, Sustainable Development Goals) (Grainger and Kim, 2020; Noe et al.,
    2022; Walz et al., 2020). However, SRS-based products, including algorithms and
    associated model parameters, are often unknown from a global perspective, but
    their effectiveness and feasibility are ignored at the local/regional scale. As
    a result, large discrepancies might exist between satellite-derived products and
    the actual state of surface parameters (Wu et al., 2019). In addition, other factors
    affect the accuracy of these products such as the state of the local atmosphere,
    and the characteristics of the earth or ocean surface, among others. Undoubtedly,
    biases between in situ and satellite-derived satellite products for a given variable
    or discrepancies of the same product over different regions, not only reduce their
    usefulness in applications but also reduce the accuracy of their downstream products.
    Therefore, it is essential to thoroughly investigate the accuracy of SRS-based
    products in the system under study to improve its quantitative application before
    developing a particular SRS-based monitoring system. In this paper, we deeply
    analyse SRS data acquired from public ESA and NASA-related products to monitor
    the Mar Menor coastal lagoon (Murcia, Spain); a local ecosystem at risk of collapse.
    The Mar Menor is the largest hypersaline coastal lagoon in Europe and is listed
    as a RAMSAR site (Casini et al., 2015). It was chosen as an example to carry out
    this research as it has intensified pressures (e.g. agriculture, tourism, fishing,
    urbanisation, eutrophication, pollution, flash floods, climate change) that have
    led to environmental deterioration and near collapse — last year more than 5 t
    of dead fish washed up on its shores. The high mortality is attributed to lack
    of oxygen in the water due to massive algal blooms (Ruiz et al., 2021). Therefore,
    this paper focuses on the Chl-a concentration as a key indicator of the eutrophication
    status of this ecosystem (Gunia et al., 2022). Several works have been proposed
    for developing SRS-based monitoring systems (Caballero et al., 2022; Erena et
    al., 2019; Gómez et al., 2021) for this variable. However, these works assume
    the validity of the data obtained by satellite systems, focusing mainly on one
    or two satellite sources, mainly Sentinel-derived products, without going into
    the process of validation and/or coverage of all existing products for this lagoon.
    This validation process, developed in this article, is critical in this unique
    ecosystem due to the limited in situ data coverage, the large spatial scale mismatch
    between in situ measurements and remotely sensed pixels, the lack of understanding
    of the intrinsic heterogeneity of land and ocean surfaces (Andersen et al., 2021),
    which release nutrients into the lagoon, the shortcomings and deficiency of theories
    on the scale problem embedded in validation, and the absence of the most reliable
    in situ dataset with continuity, completeness and consistency. Therefore, the
    main contributions of this article include the following: • A quantitative and
    qualitative validation of up to six different SRS-based products for Chl-a concentration
    detection is provided, including Sentinel-3A OLCI, Sentinel-3B OLCI, NOAA VIIRS,
    SNPP VIRRS, Aqua MODIS, and Terra MODIS, for a local/regional coastal lagoon.
    • A comparison of in situ variable detection vs. SRS is carried out to analyse
    the impact of different geospatial and environmental variables that may be relevant
    in the SRS data generation, such as land surface heterogeneity, lagoon depth,
    proximity to the shore, biogeochemical conditions, large-scale spatial mismatch
    between in situ measurements and remotely sensed pixels, etc. • An automatic crawling
    module has been developed to obtain information from different SRS products by
    setting GPS coordinates as input. • Sentinel-3 IRTM-NN algorithm offers the best
    performance for a near real-time surveillance system in a local/regional environment
    such as the Mar Menor. However, we identify the need to complement different systems
    to achieve a higher measurement coverage, going from 19% to 70% of annual daily
    coverage. The rest of the article is structured as follows. First of all, materials
    and methods carried out in this work are described in Section 3. Then, we show
    the quantitative results offered by all SRS-based products for monitoring the
    Mar Menor coastal lagoon in Section 4. Finally, Section 6 ends with some conclusions
    and future work directions. 2. Related work Satellite technology has markedly
    expanded our capabilities for assessing water quality on a planetary scale. Contemporary
    missions are increasingly equipped with sophisticated instruments specifically
    calibrated to discern aquatic characteristics, thereby facilitating the measurement
    of critical water quality parameters through advanced remote sensing algorithms.
    For instance, the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on Sentinel-3 provides
    extensive datasets for oceanic and coastal water monitoring (Shen et al., 2020).
    These missions contribute significantly to our comprehensive understanding of
    the Earth''s hydrosphere''s health. Nevertheless, it is widely acknowledged in
    the literature that the calibration protocols, predominantly tailored for the
    open ocean''s optically simpler waters, may not directly translate to the more
    complex optical properties of turbid shallow waters found in inland lakes and
    coastal zones (Loisel et al., 2013; Palmer et al., 2015). This discrepancy underscores
    the necessity for region-specific calibration efforts to enhance the accuracy
    of satellite-derived data in these ecologically distinct environments (Chen et
    al., 2020). A multitude of scholarly inquiries have underscored the efficacy of
    SRS in monitoring Chl-a levels across diverse aquatic milieus. Such studies are
    particularly salient when grappling with the intrinsic complexities of shallow
    water bodies. Seminal work by (Gitelson et al., 2011; Li et al., 2017) has been
    instrumental in delineating the correlation between Chl-a concentrations and specific
    spectral bands—namely, the blue, green, red, and near-infrared wavelengths—leveraging
    the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on both the Terra and
    Aqua satellites. These methodologies, while invaluable, encounter limitations
    when applied to the optically complex and variable environments of shallow waters,
    a testament to the ongoing evolution of satellite technologies and their spectral
    sensitivities. The landscape of aquatic environmental monitoring has been notably
    transformed by recent technological advancements, particularly through the integration
    of machine learning (ML) methodologies with satellite data interpretation. Pioneering
    studies by (Cao et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2008) have marked a
    significant leap in refining the precision of satellite-derived analytical processes,
    particularly for the estimation of Chl-a concentrations. Notably, (Binh et al.,
    2022) have spearheaded the development of sophisticated algorithms tailored for
    atmospheric correction, optimized for application with data from the Sentinel-3
    satellite. Their research has yielded algorithms that demonstrate marked efficacy
    in the nuanced analysis of Chl-a concentrations within the optically complex waters
    of shallow lakes. The Mar Menor, a unique coastal lagoon, has become a focal point
    for SRS research, providing a rich dataset for innovative studies. Key research
    conducted by (Caballero et al., 2022; Erena et al., 2019; Gómez et al., 2021;
    González-Enrique et al., 2023) has been instrumental in elucidating the utility
    of data from Landsat 8/9 and Sentinel-2 satellites in environmental monitoring
    endeavors. These studies have not only validated the robust application of SRS
    within the Mar Menor''s context but have also been at the forefront of developing
    and implementing novel algorithms that enhance Chl-a estimation, among other environmental
    variables. Despite these advancements, the research also underscores the inherent
    challenges associated with remote sensing in such dynamic environments. Issues
    such as temporal data gaps stemming from satellite revisit cycles and the critical
    need for data synchronization with in-situ measurements are salient, as underscored
    by (González-Enrique et al., 2023). These challenges necessitate a concerted effort
    to refine data collection methods and algorithmic approaches, aiming to bridge
    the observational intervals and integrate diverse data streams for a more comprehensive
    environmental analysis. The application of SRS to the monitoring of shallow waters
    such as the Mar Menor is fraught with challenges (Mizuno et al., 2018), including,
    but not limited to, the paucity of high caliber in-situ datasets, spatial inconsistencies
    between ground-based measurements and remote sensing pixels, and the propensity
    to ignore the inherent heterogeneity of land and sea surfaces that contribute
    to nutrient dynamics within the lagoon (Jiménez-Navarro et al., 2023). In addition,
    theoretical gaps persist, particularly in terms of reconciling scale differences
    during validation processes [Doe et al., 2021]. Given these complexities, meticulous
    initial analysis is essential to determine the most appropriate remote sensing
    data source that can address the distinctive ecological nuances inherent in regions
    such as the Mar Menor. 3. Materials and methods This section provides a full description
    of the lagoon ecosystem to be monitored, focusing on the critical points of interest
    for SRS. Then, it describes the in-situ reference data used for the validation
    of the SRS data, before showing remote sensing monitoring instruments themselves
    and the data compilation tool for crawling their information. 3.1. Mar Menor coastal
    lagoon One of the largest coastal lagoons in Europe and the largest on the Iberian
    Peninsula, the Mar Menor is a coastal lagoon in Murcia (Southeastern Spain). This
    lagoon is relatively shallow, with an average depth of 3.6 m and a maximum depth
    of 7 m. It is isolated from the Mediterranean Sea by a 22 km long sandy coastal
    barrier (called La Manga). La Manga is crossed by several gullies, which determines
    the semiconfined nature of its waters and gives them unique salinity and temperature
    characteristics (see Fig. 1). In addition to its importance from an environmental
    point of view, the Mar Menor is also a key place for the economy of the Murcia
    Region. The unique climatic conditions and rich natural resources of the region
    have not only fostered tourism and recreational activities but have also bolstered
    the local economy through fishing and agriculture. The basin that drains the Mar
    Menor is called Campo de Cartagena (CC) and is a long plain of more than with
    a network of ephemeral streams that collect the scarce but intense rainfall (Senent-Aparicio
    et al., 2015). Download : Download high-res image (404KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Mar Menor layout. The Mar Menor has been characterized
    by its oligotrophic waters and by its strong resistance to eutrophication. The
    lagoon''s transparent waters have historically served as its key defining feature,
    but during the past ten years, eutrophic tendencies have emerged (Conesa and Jiménez-Cárceles,
    2007). Inputs with high concentrations of nutrients to the lagoon have grown over
    the past few decades due to changes in agricultural practices in the CC and the
    introduction of intensively irrigated crops. Several studies (Domingo-Pinillos
    et al., 2018; Senent-Aparicio et al., 2021) found that flow transfer from the
    CC aquifer to the Mar Menor lagoon must have been significantly impacted by the
    entry of nitrates and other agrochemical elements from fertilization. These inputs
    caused a dramatic increase in pollution in the lagoon (García-Ayllón, 2019) and
    triggered an eutrophication process, resulting in water quality loss (Jimeno-Sáez
    et al., 2020). In 2016, an extreme eutrophication event resulted in sharp bloom
    of phytoplankton (Mercado et al., 2021) that produced a significant change in
    the quality of the waters, with a substantial increase in turbidity, a change
    in the water colour, and a loss of transparency, with a drop in the depth of Secchi
    disc visibility to less than 1 m. These raised significant concerns among environmentalists
    and those working in the tourism industry, with significant socioeconomic repercussions
    (Garcia-Ayllon, 2018). In September 2019, Chl-a levels significantly increased,
    even exceeding the peak observed in 2016. This was due to surface runoff water
    from the drainage basin that flowed into the Mar Menor as a result of a big storm.
    The driving factors of primary productivity were the enormous volumes of nitrogen,
    phosphorus, organic matter, and sediments drained by runoff (Ruiz-Fernandez et
    al., 2019). Under this scenario, early intervention is required to reduce nutrient
    and other pollutant entry into the lagoon. 3.2. In situ data During the last decade,
    mainly due to environmental problems in the Mar Menor, several periodic in situ
    monitoring campaigns have been carried out by two Spanish public bodies; i.e.,
    the regional government of Murcia (CARM) and the Spanish Oceanographic Institute
    (CSIC-IEO). Fig. 1 shows the Mar Menor layout regarding these monitoring campaigns.
    Fig. 1a shows in situ monitoring points (ISMPs) of CARM (in blue) and CSIC-IEO
    (in green) respectively. It is important to note that these campaigns are still
    being carried out nowadays. Table 1 shows the main figures from this in situ monitoring
    for the data period considered in this article. Table 1. In situ monitoring description.

    2016-05-24 2021-08-26 227 CARM 2016-08-02 2022-02-24 3251 The CARM in situ database
    has been obtained through measurements acquired by the Instituto Murciano de Investigación
    y Desarrollo Agrario y Alimentario (IMIDA) from 2 August 2016 to 24 February 20022
    on an approximately weekly basis. These measurements were taken at 12 points in
    the Mar Menor at different depths (see blue points in Fig. 1b). Overall, the database
    used has an average of 152 field campaigns on different dates for each sampling
    point, with a total of 3251 measurements taken. The instrument used to carry out
    the water quality measurements were a Sea Bird Electronics SBE-19 equipped with
    three fluorimeters to estimate, among other variables, the Chl-a (in mg/m3) (Erena
    et al., 2019). It is important to note that the measurements were always taken
    at the same points with fixed coordinates as shown in Fig. 1b. Similarly, the
    CSIC-IEO in situ database has been obtained through measurements acquired by the
    Spanish Institute of Oceanography (CSIC-IEO) from 24 May 2016 to 26 August 2021
    with an approximate monthly frequency. These measurements have been taken at the
    3 most representative points of the Mar Menor at the shallowest part (see green
    dots in Fig. 1b). Overall, the database used has an average of monthly field campaigns
    on different dates for each sampling point, with a total of 227 measurements taken.
    The measurements of Chl-a (in mg/m3) have been performed by laboratory analysis
    using 0.5 L of water filtered through Whatman GF/F filters for determination of
    the Chl-a concentration by spectrophotometry after overnight extraction in 90%
    acetone at 4–5 °C (SCOR-UNESCO 1966). It is important to note that the measurements
    were always taken at the same points with fixed coordinates. Furthermore, this
    dataset is smaller, as the temporal granularity is lower. However, a more reliable
    Chl-a measurement technique is used that allows us to better differentiate the
    levels of this variable, especially for high Chl-a values, as is shown in Section
    4. 3.3. SRS data As mentioned above, this paper analyses SRS data obtained by
    different satellite products in which data is publicly available. Particularly,
    we focus on monitoring the Mar Menor Chl-a concentration with the main objective
    of developing a near real-time monitoring system for early warning. With that
    in mind, this work focuses on six specific satellite Chl-a products for the collection
    of this variable together with its historical data for further quantitative and
    qualitative validation. Table 2 shows different SRS products under study. The
    first two are products from the European Copernicus Marine Service (CMS) that
    provide free, regular, and systematic authoritative information on the state of
    the Blue (physical), White (sea ice), and Green (biogeochemical) ocean, on a global
    and regional scale. Among several products that Copernicus offers through their
    different platforms, this work focuses on data from Sentinel-3A and B. Both satellites
    have on board the imaging spectrometer Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI)
    that measures solar radiation reflected by the Earth in 21 spectral bands at spatial
    resolution of 300 m. It is important to note that this work focuses on these Sentinel-3-related
    products as they offer daily data from the same world region around the same hour
    (see Table 2) and having a high temporal resolution is essential for the development
    of a monitoring system. Table 2. Main satellite instruments features. Satellite/Instrument

    2002 2006* Sentinel-based data are processed and split into products depending
    on the stage of the process. Thus, OLCI provides three different processing levels.
    This work focuses on Level-2 (L2) data that provides the water Chl-a concentration
    in . OLCI L2 product also provides additional data such as reflectances, Aerosol
    Optical Thickness (AOT), and Diffuse Attenuation coefficient (Kd940), just to
    mention a few. Despite these parameters are not consider in this work, they are
    used by ESA algorithm to calculate the Chl-a data provided. Another important
    feature of OLCI products is the resolution. In this work, we use Water Full Resolution
    (WFR) product that provides the data related to water masses at 300 m resolution.
    Regarding time granularity, the CMS download tool selects files by timeless which
    indicates the period from the image was acquired until it becomes public. Particularly,
    we focus on NTC (Non Time Critical) files that refer to products delivered within
    the next 24/48 h after data acquisition by satellite, in contrast to NRT (Near
    Real Time) which refers to products delivered less than 3 h after acquisition.
    NTC products contain data adjusted and collated using information from other platforms
    thus seems more precise to use this product in the present analysis. Although
    the main goal of this paper is to create a robust, near real-time monitoring system,
    the data coverage for monitoring systems is under study. Therefore, we consider
    the best-case scenario for data coverage provided by SRS sources; i.e., NTC data
    instead of NRT. Anyway, a monitoring system could provide the data in NRT and
    then rewrite it with its NTC data when it becomes available. To obtain the processed
    Chl-a historical data from Sentinel-3A and B, we use CREODIAS (Malinowski et al.,
    2020); a platform that contains the data generated by Sentinel, Envisat, Lansat,
    and other EODATA satellites. Its design allows third-party users to prototype
    and build their value-added services and products. This service allows programmers
    to request the previous Sentinel products easily from Sentinel Hub. In this case,
    the API returns a set of netCDF4 files that contain parameters related to Chl-a,
    GPS coordinates, light reflectances, atmosphere light absorption, etc. Sentinel-based
    products use two different algorithms to obtain Chl-a concentration from this
    raw information. The former is the Maximum Band Ratio (MBR) semi-analytical algorithm
    called OC4Me Chlorophyll ( ) developed by Morel et al. (Morel et al., 2007a).
    This is the latest version of the MERIS pigmentation index algorithm which is
    based on the construction of a polynomial based on the use of a semi-analytical
    model using in situ measurements over the last decades in several open water oceanic
    regions (Bricaud et al., 1998; Morel and Maritorena, 2001). The polynomial is
    based on the Eq. 1 (1) where is the irradiance-reflectance of the bands between
    443, 490 and 510 nm, and represents the band at 560 nm. This calculation is performed
    in a loop that includes the calculation of the irradiance-reflectance from the
    outgoing directional reflectance of the water, which requires a bidirectionality
    correction based on the Chl-a estimate. Convergence is achieved when the difference
    between two successive Chl-a estimates is less than a threshold. We refer the
    reader to (Morel et al., 2007b) for insights in the procedure. The latter algorithm
    to estimate the Chl-a (namely ) is based on the Inverse Radiative Transfer Model-Neural
    Network (IRTM-NN) to estimate from normalised water-leaving reflectance at OLCI
    bands b440 to b674, b709, and . This algorithm relies on neural networks to address
    the problem as a non-linear multiple regression method that drastically reduces
    computational time, once the network is properly trained to fit the coefficients.
    Fortunately, CMS already provides the IRTM-NN model that outputs water-inherent
    optical properties such as total backscattering coefficient ( ), total absorption
    coefficient ( ), phytoplankton absorption coefficient ( ), coloured Detrital and
    Dissolved Material absorption coefficient ( ), Chlorophyll (Chl2) concentration,
    Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentration. We refer the reader to (Pahlevan et
    al., 2020) for insights. Regarding NASA-based products, the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership
    (SNPP) and NOAA-20 (previously known JPSS-1) satellites. NOAA-20 was launched
    to replace SNPP whose lifespan was until 2021 although it is still working. Both
    satellites have on board a Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) that
    acquires data almost every day. VIIRS is a whiskbroom scanner radiometer that
    collects imagery and radiometric measurements of the land, atmosphere, cryosphere,
    and oceans in the visible and infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum with
    a resolution of 375 and 750 m depending on the band of the electromagnetic spectrum.
    Similar to ESA, NASA provides different sorts of products and levels. Thus, VIIRS
    Level 2 products provide water Chl-a concentration with a resolution of 700 m.
    Moreover, the Aqua and TERRA missions are also part of the NASA-centered international
    Earth Observing System (EOS). Both form a twin system that acquires data from
    the same region at AM and PM respectively. These satellites have on board a Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MODIS acquires images with a 1 km
    resolution every 1 or 2 days. Despite their lifespan being until 2006, they still
    send data periodically. It is important to note that Earthdata API (Maxwell et
    al., 2019) allows to request NASA''s satellite information like CREODIAS. Like
    Sentinel-based products, NASA provides Chl-a measurements in as a part of the
    standard Level-2 OC product suite and the Level-3 CHL product suite. The current
    algorithm is a combination of two; the standard OC3/OC4 (Chl_OCX) band ratio algorithm
    (O''Reilly, 2000) and the colour index (CI) defined by Hu et al. (Hu et al., 2012).
    These algorithms combine in situ measurements of chlor_a and remote sensing reflectances
    in the blue-to-green region of the visible spectrum with, at least, three or more
    sensor bands spanning the 440–670 nm spectral regime. The CI is a difference algorithm
    between the green band reflectances and a linear combination of the blue and red
    band reflectances (see Eq. 2). (2) where and are the instrument-specific wavelengths
    closest to 443, 555 and 670 nm respectively. Eq. 3 shows the OCx algorithm based
    on a polynomial that relates reflectances with chl_a. (3) where the numerator
    is the greatest of several input reflectances values and the coefficients, - ,
    are sensor-specific. These coefficients are the main difference between MODIS
    and VIIRs values. For instance, OC3M MODIS sensor uses . However, OC3V VIIRS sensor
    uses . We refer the reader to (Franz et al., 2012) for insights. Unlike the Mar
    Menor lagoon and as it is described in the papers, this product is restricted
    to relatively clear waters and the overall impact is to reduce artifacts and biases
    in Chl-a recoveries in clear waters due to residual glare, stray light, atmospheric
    correction errors and white or spectral-linear bias errors in reflectances. 3.4.
    Crawling SRS data In the pursuit of enhancing our comprehension of aquatic systems,
    the SMARTLAGOON project has been a pivotal initiative. Through this project, an
    innovative satellite data collection tool was developed, which systematically
    collects water quality data from public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
    of major space agencies including the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This tool is engineered to meet the
    needs of users and third-party applications, providing historical and current
    data insights, thus constructing an organized and coherent time series of varied
    variables obtained by Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) services. The architecture
    of this sophisticated tool is divided into two core components as shown in Fig.
    2. The first component focuses on acquiring satellite imagery for predefined geospatial
    coordinates over a determined period. This process begins with the ingestion of
    GPS coordinates from a custom input file named “stations.csv,” outlining the spatial
    boundaries for data acquisition. This component then proceeds to systematically
    retrieve NetCDF4 file links for each set of coordinates. The data stored within
    these NetCDF files, sourced from either ESA or NASA, include vital parameters
    such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient
    (Kd940), and Chl-a concentrations. Download : Download high-res image (258KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Crawling tool developed to get historical
    and near real-time data from different SRS products. A practical application of
    this tool was demonstrated through the generation of SRS data for over a hundred
    GPS coordinates within the Mar Menor lagoon. This data acquisition was part of
    a broader effort to address the environmental challenges faced by coastal lagoons,
    such as Mar Menor, which have been subject to significant degradation due to climatic
    changes and human activities. A portion of these coordinates was closely matched
    with the Comunidad Autónoma de la Región de Murcia (CARM) and the Consejo Superior
    de Investigaciones Científicas-Instituto Español de Oceanografía (CSIC-IEO) in
    situ Monitoring Points (ISMPs) for qualitative validation. The rest were chosen
    to evaluate the influence of geographical attributes on the remote sensing data,
    including bathymetry and proximity to coastlines. The subsequent component of
    the tool is responsible for converting the raw SRS data into structured Comma-Separated
    Values (CSV) files for each GPS point, creating a daily time series for various
    water quality parameters. The design of the CSV files enables a detailed temporal
    analysis, where each row contains data from a single day and each column represents
    different water quality metrics such as water temperature, suspended particulate
    matter, and Chl-a concentration. Fig. 3 shows the systematic approach employed
    to generate these CSV files for each ISMP, utilizing the “stations.csv” file in
    conjunction with satellite imagery data acquired on a given day. The “stations.csv”
    file serves as a repository of geographical coordinates, specifically latitude
    and longitude, for each designated ISMP. During the processing, these coordinates
    are employed to pinpoint the nearest corresponding pixel within the satellite
    image. This selection of the proximate pixel is integral to ensuring the spatial
    relevance of the satellite data to the physical location of the ISMP. Each pixel
    within the satellite image is a multidimensional entity, encapsulating a suite
    of environmental parameters Chl-a concentrations, diffuse attenuation coefficients
    at 940 nm (Kd_940), and spectral reflectance across various bands, to name a few.

    Fig. 3. CSV data time series creation from satellite image and stations.csv file.
    The retrieval process is meticulously designed to extract these parameters from
    the nearest pixel, thereby encapsulating the local environmental characteristics
    with high fidelity. The extracted values are then systematically transposed into
    a CSV format, with each file corresponding to an individual ISMP. These CSV files
    are subsequently structured to provide a temporal snapshot of the water quality
    and other relevant parameters for each monitoring location, facilitating a robust
    analysis over time. This method of data extraction and conversion from satellite
    imagery to CSV files is essential for the accurate monitoring and assessment of
    aquatic environments. It bridges the divide between remote sensing observations
    and ground truth data, enabling a comprehensive analysis that is both spatially
    and temporally informed. Complementing this data collection tool, the SensingTools
    application was developed as part of SMARTLAGOON''s digital twin concept. This
    decision-making application aims to construct a systemic understanding of the
    socio-environmental interplay affecting coastal lagoons. By synthesizing data
    from diverse sources, including in situ IoT infrastructures, remote sensing, social
    media, and socio-economic datasets, and employing advanced AI, NLP, and citizen
    science models, SensingTools provides real-time monitoring, analysis, and management
    of these delicate ecosystems. This tool not only serves the policy-making process
    but also enhances local and citizen awareness of environmental impacts, making
    it a cornerstone for sustainable management of coastal lagoons. For the Mar Menor
    case study, the SensingTools application is being co-developed with local citizens,
    stakeholders, and policymakers to ensure that it effectively meets their needs
    and fosters engagement in environmental stewardship. The agile methodology applied
    in its development guarantees that the tool remains responsive and relevant to
    the specific requirements of Mar Menor, with the potential to be adapted for use
    in other coastal lagoons. The complete suite of the SRS crawling tool, alongside
    the SensingTools application, forms a robust framework for environmental monitoring
    and decision-making. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations inherent
    in the SRS crawling tool. The crawler is sensitive to alterations in the architecture
    of the targeted websites, necessitating regular updates to maintain algorithmic
    accuracy. This sensitivity underscores the tool''s reliance on the continuous
    availability and accessibility of the websites it queries, a limitation that is
    intrinsic to web-based data collection methodologies. By disclosing these constraints,
    we endeavor to ensure a transparent and comprehensive understanding of the tool''s
    operational parameters. The repository housing the SRS crawling tool and the SensingTools
    application, available at (SMARTLAGOON, 2022), contains essential files that support
    the crawling process, manage API requests, file downloads, and other pivotal operations.
    For those who seek to delve deeper into the operational intricacies of these tools,
    the repository''s README.md file serves as a valuable resource. 4. Results This
    section shows the analysis of raw data obtained from the Earth Data and Coorpenicus
    services for the Chl-a concentration in the Mar Menor. The SRS data is compared
    to the in-situ data previously described in Section 3. Fig. 4 shows the data description
    (i.e. box plot) of all data sources. It is important to note that this figure
    is generated by including historical data from all ISMPs. Download : Download

    of all targeted marine observatory systems (i.e. Copernicus, Modis, VIIRS) along
    with in situ monitoring. In-situ data reported by CSIC-IEO are generated with
    a direct analytical procedure, i.e. they are analysed in the laboratory with spectrophotometer
    techniques as described above. Looking at their distribution, it can be seen that
    the data are highly concentrated, except for an outlier ( ) that was reported
    on October 29, 2019. September and October 2019 brought one of the most dramatic
    episodes in the Mar Menor. In September 2019, a big storm occurred, recording
    500 mm in just one day. This episode of heavy rainfall led to the entry of a large
    amount of sediment into the Mar Menor, which, days later, favoured an intensive
    phytoplankton bloom that led to extreme Chl-a levels. In mid-October, the first
    large appearance of dead fish on the coast of the Mar Menor occurred. As previously
    mentioned, the in situ data of Chl-a concentration reported by CARM are obtained
    by fluorescence techniques that are more similar to the possible values obtained
    by SRS data as they are based on reflectance analysis. This is probably the reason
    why the sentinel_chl_nn distribution is quite similar to CARM data. The other
    SRS data sources do not seem to follow a similar distribution to the in situ data
    collected by either, CSIC-IEO or CARM. However, some of the ISMPs are very close
    to land, either because of their proximity to the coast, islands, or gulfs. This
    fact affects close land data where the spectral perturbation is caused by land
    surfaces near the measured point. Also, Mar Menor is shallow in general (maximum
    depth 7 m) but some ISMPs are located in places where the depth is around two
    meters which affects also to reflected light (Bulgarelli et al., 2017). Table
    3 shows the temporal data coverage provided by SRS services under study. All SRS
    services provide daily measures of Chl-a. However, some factors occasionally produce
    anomalies or events that affect the quality and availability of the SRS data.
    Data providers reject images with errors, hence they do not provide level 2 files
    for these days or values are not valid. The column “% of days with image” in Table
    3 shows the number of images obtained by all SRS services. Sentinel-based services
    offer an average of 50.11% data availability, i.e. 1 out of every 2 days image
    are available. This figure is much higher for NASA-based services, providing images
    almost 100% (97.75% on average) of the days. Table 3. Temporal coverage for SRS
    services under study. We assume daily measurements from the starting dates of
    each mission (see Table 2). Satellite product % of days with image Average valid
    values all ISMPs Sentinel-3A OLCI L2 54.17% 34% chl_nn - 21% chl_oc Sentinel-3B
    OLCI L2 46.06% 29% chl_nn - 21.5% chl_oc NOAA VIIRS L2 95.26% 31% both chl_ocx-chl_a
    SNPP VIIRS L2 99.95% 34% both chl_ocx-chl_a Aqua MODIS L2 98.97% 22% both chl_ocx-chl_a
    Terra MODIS L2 99.13% 19% both chl_ocx-chl_a However, it is important to note
    that not all of these images generate good-quality data. SRS data services offer
    quality flags supplied at Level 2 products which have quality-related information
    about each image pixel. In the case of OLCI-based products, a pixel value can
    be masked, indicating a null value depending on the state of the flag, whose main
    reasons are usually atmospheric factors, such as clouds or haze density, which
    in the case of the Mar Menor, located in southeastern Spain, is quite common due
    to the proximity of the Sahara desert. Sentinel provides an ancillary file with
    the meaning of the mask for each pixel. In the first approach, we verify that
    the main reason to mask a pixel is unknown in around 70% of masked pixels and
    the rest is due to cloudy. Only CTD-9, the closest to the coast, shows few values
    masked as “land”. Another frequent factor for poor image quality is that the target
    pixel is grounded due to its spatial granularity. Sentinel-based SRS services
    have a spatial granularity of 300 m. However, MODIS offers a spatial granularity
    of up to 1 km. There are also flag values that do not mask a pixel value, however,
    they indicate a high probability of abnormal values. In this work, we do not consider
    the quality flag directly thus the masked values are treated as no data available.
    The column “Average valid values all ISMPs” in Table 3 shows the number of images
    that have been not masked by the SRS algorithm. It should be noted that, depending
    on the spatial granularity of the SRS services, these figures are lower. As previously
    mentioned, MODIS-based services have a spatial resolution of 1000 m and have the
    lowest rate of unmasked values (22%–19%). It is followed by VIIRS services with
    a maximum rate of 31% of unmasked data and a spatial granularity of 750 m, and
    finally, Sentinel-based services offer a rate of up to 34% of unmasked data in
    the best case. It can be concluded that Sentinel-based services provide less imagery,
    about half of the days they have no imagery available, of which less than one-third
    are useful. Fig. 5 shows the percentage of invalid values for any reason in the
    data history of the satellite services. Now, the data are separated by the in
    situ sampling points performed by CARM in the Mar Menor (i.e., ISMPs, see Fig.
    1a). It should be noted that the points closest to the coast are ISMPs 1, 5, and
    9. They are the GPS coordinates with more non-valid values in all SRS services.
    Again, the impact on the generation of invalid values of the instrument spatial
    resolution is also reflected here. For example, MODIS has a 1 km grid resolution
    and its null data is over 80% for ISMPs 1,2,4,5,9 which are about one km from
    the coast or less. The percentage of invalid values improves for VIIRS data which
    provides over 80% of null data for ISMPs located less than one km (1, 5, and 9).
    For sentinels OLCI, this situation happens in ISMPs 1 and 5, but only for Chl-a
    obtained by OCX algorithm. It can be seen that the algorithm based on Chl_NN is
    more stable because it does not operate like the classical algorithms. On the
    contrary, it focuses on a neural network algorithm that can learn and infer such
    situations. It is also important to note that the location where the percentage
    of null values for Chl-a is lowest is the one that coincides with ISMP6. This
    point matches the deepest point of the Mar Menor lagoon (approximately 6.7 m).
    Depth is another key factor in the determination of Chl-a using satellite instruments.
    Points deeper than 5 m and more than 1 km from land have higher non-zero percentages.
    These satellite points are those that coincide with ISMPs 6, 3, 8, 10, 11, and
    12. Download : Download high-res image (641KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 5. Percentage of null values reported in each SRS source. The X-axis shows
    the percentage of null values. The Y-axis shows the ISMP where the SRS data have
    been requested. With the high percentage of invalid data shown above, it can be
    concluded that a monitoring system based on satellite information for a shallow
    coastal lagoon such as the Mar Menor should consider more than an SRS service
    to obtain daily data with a higher probability. Fig. 6 shows the number of daily
    valid data obtained by the different SRS services during 2021. Satellite service
    is considered to provide valid data if at least one of its instruments/products
    generates valid data; i.e. if any of the Sentinel instruments A and/or B provide
    valid data, then the Sentinel-based SRS service is counted as 1. This analysis
    has been carried out for all ISMPs to figure out the influence of the Mar Menor
    geographical parameters on providing valid data. Let us remind the reader of the
    main geographical points of interest for SRS in Mar Menor that are shown in detail
    in Fig. 1c and d. They include the isobath map of the lagoon, four gulfs that
    serve as points of water interchange with the Mediterranean Sea, i.e. clear waters,
    five islands of volcanic origin in the middle of the lagoon, and the mouth of
    several ephemeral streams where intensive agriculture and urban water treatment
    plants legally, or sometimes presumably illegally, discharge waste with high nitrate
    and phosphate concentrations. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download

    all ISMPs during 2021. The maximum number of samples is 3 (Dark blue), taking
    into account that some of the Sentinel, VIIRS, and MODIS instruments/algorithms
    provide data (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend,
    the reader is referred to the web version of this article.). With all of the above
    in mind, Fig. 6 shows some interesting findings. The best data coverage is achieved
    for ISMPs 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 which are those furthest from the lagoon shore
    and with a depth of more than 4 m as previously mentioned. Taking a deeper look
    at ISMP 6, the number of null values (i.e. days without recorded data in the year
    2021) was 112 days, which means 30.68% days of the year no satellite service provided
    data at the deepest point of the Mar Menor. The summer period, where the climate
    of the region is very warm and with clear sky conditions, the number of invalid
    daily registers is lower, compared to more cloudy and rainy periods. There were
    70 days (19.17%) where only valid data was collected, which in most cases comes
    from Sentinel''s neural network algorithms. Finally, there were only 95 days (26.02%)
    where all satellite services reported valid data. Bearing in mind these figures,
    it is important to note that using only a satellite service, the coverage of the
    monitoring system could be described as very low; i.e., less than 20% of the days
    with valid measurements would be reported. With several satellite services as
    backup, this number increases to 69.32%. Therefore, considering only the coverage
    of a hypothetical satellite monitoring service for shallow coastal lagoons such
    as the Mar Menor would require a robust service that integrates several satellite
    sources and cooperates to generate data as close as possible to the daily time
    scale. Fig. 7 shows the Pearson correlation matrix for all satellite sources and
    in situ monitoring sources at all ISMPs. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)
    is used here to assess the strength of the relationship between the Chl-a values
    generated by L2 SRS products and their in situ counterpart measurements. The Pearson''s
    coefficient is a metric for measuring the linear correlation between two datasets
    or, in other words, it quantifies the relationship that may exist between two
    variables. The PCC ranges from −1.0 (strong inverse relationship) to +1.0 (strong
    direct relationship). Several considerations should be taken into account before
    discussing the results. Firstly, CSIC-IEO in situ monitoring is only carried out
    at ISMPs 1, 3, 6, 10, 11, and 12, while the CARM in situ monitoring covers all
    the ISMPs under study, and therefore some rows are missing for the ieo_chl tag.
    Generally speaking, SRS data show a stronger direct correlation with CSIC-IEO
    data than with CARM data in those ISMPs where there are records for both. But
    this has to be analysed carefully, as the statistical significance of the correlation
    through p-value has to be considered. The small number of samples in the CSIC-IEO
    dataset, together with a large number of invalid data in the SRS-based datasets,
    makes the sample size to be correlated very small. There is a small chance that
    these data points fall in such a way that higher PCC is reported, even without
    any argument in favor of supporting the correlation. For instance, the temporal
    matches between the measurements of the CSIC-IEO in situ data and the data generated
    by the SRS products are 3 for the Sentinel-based products, 11 for the Modis-based
    products and 9 for the Viirs-based products for ISMP 6. Although PCC reaches 0.86
    for CSIC-IEO and sentinel_chl_nn datasets at ISMP 6, its p-value is 0.34, which
    means that the correlation is not statistically significant. There are only 8
    statistical tests that are statistically significant in the correlation between
    CSIC-IEO data with data generated by SRS sources. Particularly, these positive
    correlations happen at ISMP 10 and Sentinel_chl_nn data, where the PCC reaches
    up to 0.89 by combining Sentinel-3A and B data, having a p-value of 0.00069 and
    a matched data sample of up to 27 values, and also at ISMP 12 where PCC reaches
    up to 0.64 by also combining sentinel_A_chl_nn and B data, having a p-value of
    0.0167 and a matched data sample of up to 27 values. Although Fig. 7 shows other
    interesting PCC between CSIC-IEO and SRS products, such as 1 between the CSIC-IEO
    and MODIS at ISMP 1 or 0.8, 0.86 and 0.84 PCC between CSIC-IEO and sentinel_chl_nn
    at ISMPs 3, 6 and 11 respectively, they are not statistically significant, therefore,
    we can not conclude they are good samples for Mar Menor lagoon Monitoring. Download

    Pearson correlation matrix for all ISMPs. Dark red means a direct correlation
    close to a Pearson coefficient of 1, and dark blue means an inverse correlation
    close to a Pearson coefficient of −1. (For interpretation of the references to
    colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
    article.) The number of in situ samples from the CARM is significantly larger
    and thus offers a larger sample to compare with the SRS systems. The reported
    PCC figures are generally lower than those reported with CSIC-IEO data, in the
    range of 0.5–0.7 at best, but are statistically significant and therefore more
    reliable from a data quality point of view. Looking at ISMP 6, for example, the
    number of coincident elements between SRS and CARM data are 216, 442 and 446 for
    Sentinel, VIIRS and MODIS respectively, which makes significant correlations in
    almost all combinations. Furthermore, it is important to note that sentinel_chl_nn
    is the SRS with the highest correlation figures with CARM (and also CSIC-IEO).
    Therefore, generally speaking, figures reported in Fig. 7 place sentinel_chl_nn
    as the service with the strongest correlation with in situ monitoring data. It
    should be also noted that the correlation of the other satellite services is very
    low and therefore a calibration of the data is necessary to adapt it to the context
    of the Mar Menor. Fig. 8 shows a geospatial distribution of the highest PCC obtained
    between data from any SRS services and both; the CARM data (see Fig. 8a) and the
    CSIC-IEO data (see Fig. 8b) in the Mar Menor. Surprisingly, the best PCC is obtained
    in ISMPs that are very close to the mouths of the ephemeral stream; CARM achieves
    its best PCC at ISMP 7, very close to “Albujón” ephemeral stream (i.e., “Rambla
    del Albujón”), and CSIC-IEO achieves its best PCC at ISMP 10, very close to “De
    Ponce” and “Carrasquilla” ephemeral streams (i.e., “Barranco de Ponce” and “Rambla
    de Carrasquilla”). Let us remind the reader that PCC was statistically significant
    at ISMP 10 for CSIC-IEO and Sentinel_chl_nn. Ephemeral streams, and particularly,
    the Albujón ephemeral stream are the main nutrient input to the lagoon (Senent-Aparicio
    et al., 2021). This result is quite interesting since proximity to land or depth
    is usually identified as the main limiting factors for the quality of SRS data
    in oceanographic products. Indeed, these factors also have an impact here, as
    can be seen in ISMPs 1, 4, and 9, where the lowest Pearson''s coefficients are
    reported (0.2, 0.4, and 0.22 respectively). However, the SRS products generate
    the Chl-a data from the visible spectra (Morel et al., 2007a; O''Reilly, 2000),
    and, at ISMP 7 is where greater weights of the green spectral band are observed,
    in consistency with the band combinations that more commonly are used in the Ocean
    Chl-a Algorithms. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download : Download

    streams, with the CSIC-IEO (ISMP 10), CARM (ISMP 7), and the deepest point (ISMP
    6). A good trend is clearly shown between the in situ monitoring data and the
    satellite data, in particular for the areas where phytoplankton may be more abundant
    due to nutrient input. Nevertheless, the results shown in this paper conclude
    that there is room for improvement in adjusting the data provided by SRS products
    to the context of such shallow and highly anthropised lagoons. To make this bias
    correction, it also opens up the possibility of not making general lagoon models,
    but more specific models according to the geographical and ecological conditions
    of the lagoon. Download : Download high-res image (159KB) Download : Download

    5. Discussion In the field of environmental monitoring, the deployment of SRS
    technology offers a paradigm shift, particularly in the domain of coastal lagoon
    monitoring. This research has ventured into an exhaustive analysis of six distinct
    SRS-based products tailored for the detection and quantification of Chl-a in the
    contextually rich backdrop of the Mar Menor lagoon. The insights garnered from
    this inquiry underscore the nuanced interplay between the technological prowess
    of SRS and its applicability to regional and localized environmental phenomena.The
    practical deployment of SRS, either as a complementary resource or as a substitute
    for traditional in situ detection, requires a multifaceted consideration of operational
    elements. The appeal of SRS lies in providing a high-resolution temporal and spatial
    dataset. Our research demonstrates that combining diverse SRS data streams can
    significantly increase the data acquisition window from a mere one-fifth to a
    commendable 70 % coverage. Despite these advances, regional calibration of SRS
    algorithms emerges as a sine qua non to mitigate endemic biases at the local scale.
    This recalibration highlights the commitment to refine SRS methodologies, incorporating
    localized model building to rectify and adapt SRS data. In addition, the establishment
    of a network of terrestrial validation stations, along with a regimented calibration
    schedule, is imperative to promote the veracity and robustness of SRS data. The
    SRS methodology boasts an unparalleled spatial expanse, eclipsing the reach of
    conventional in situ sensors. This capability is particularly salient in scenarios
    necessitating immediate and comprehensive data reconnaissance, such as during
    phytoplankton bloom events, where SRS can serve as an indispensable tool. In the
    Mar Menor study, the SRS data, particularly from the Sentinel-based IRTM-NN modality,
    has exhibited a commendable fidelity to in situ measurements, as evidenced by
    a Pearson correlation coefficient cresting at 0.86. Yet, this technological advantage
    does not render SRS infallible. The precision of SRS data is often contingent
    upon the ecological matrix within which it operates. Anomalies such as algal blooms
    may inadvertently enhance the precision of SRS readings; conversely, anthropogenic
    perturbations can precipitate substantial deviations in data accuracy. The granular
    detail and verisimilitude afforded by in situ measurements are unparalleled, serving
    as the bedrock for the calibration and validation of SRS data. In light of the
    foregoing, we propose an integrative framework for policymakers contemplating
    the assimilation of SRS into extant monitoring regimens: • Validation Imperative:
    Prioritize a robust validation phase, where SRS and in situ data collection are
    synchronized to establish the SRS''s reliability and situational relevance. Qualitatively,
    this stage not only aligns the SRS data with ground truths but also provides insights
    into the SRS''s capabilities to capture the variability and complexity of environmental
    phenomena. • Iterative integration protocol: The assimilation of SRS into monitoring
    frameworks should be characterized by its iterative nature, whereby SRS algorithms
    are continuously refined based on accumulating in situ data. Qualitatively, this
    iterative process allows for the adjustment of SRS methodologies to better reflect
    the dynamic and multifarious nature of ecological environments, thereby enhancing
    the interpretive power of SRS data. • Policy Formulation: It is essential to formulate
    convincing policies and procedural protocols that define the precise modalities
    for the use of SRS, including their integration into broader environmental management
    strategies and contingency protocols that respond to ecological changes detected
    by SRS. Qualitatively, these policies should encompass a nuanced understanding
    of the strengths of SRS, such as its ability to provide a macroscopic view of
    ecological patterns and trends that in situ sensors would not be able to reproduce
    due to logistical constraints. The potential of SRS to revolutionize local and
    regional ecosystem monitoring is unequivocal. However, incorporating SRS into
    existing monitoring frameworks requires discerning recognition of its advantages
    and limitations. By adopting a distributed, iterative approach and establishing
    rigorous validation mechanisms, SRS can effectively complement in situ sensing
    techniques, fostering a more robust and comprehensive environmental monitoring
    and management system. Qualitative insights into the application of SRS underscore
    its usefulness in providing a broader perspective and continuous monitoring capabilities,
    which are particularly beneficial in large and inaccessible areas or where timely
    data collection is crucial. Lessons learned from our study argue for a complementary
    role for SRS, where its breadth of coverage and rapid data processing capabilities
    provide an overall context within which in situ data can be interpreted. This
    synergy facilitates a comprehensive understanding of environmental conditions,
    allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions with a level of detail and speed
    unattainable with in situ methods alone. 6. Conclusions and future work We are
    witnessing the continuous development of remote sensing systems and algorithms
    that enable the development of monitoring systems with high temporal and spatial
    accuracy, and increasingly better precision in the geophysical variables offered
    by their products. However, these systems are usually developed at global scales
    and offer large biases when they are applied to regional or local areas and, therefore,
    there are other limiting factors either technical, environmental, ecological or
    geographical that affect the accuracy of SRS measurements. Validation of these
    data in local/regional context is therefore essential before promoting the application
    of remote sensing products by independently checking their errors using reference
    data such as in-situ measurements, which are considered the cornerstone of validation.
    In this article, up to six different SRS-based products for Chl-a monitoring in
    a local/regional context such as the Mar Menor (Murcia, Spain) are analysed. In
    this highly anthropised coastal lagoon, several satellite measurement systems
    have been proposed, ignoring the validation and spatial-temporal coverage of these
    systems. Our results show that the consideration of only one satellite source
    limits the temporal coverage, reducing data availability to 19.17% of the sampled
    days. Increasing the number of sources enhances data availability by more than
    40%, reaching a coverage of approximately 70% of the sampled days on average.
    Regarding the qualitative validation of the data obtained from the satellite products,
    Sentinel-based IRTM-NN provides the best measurements for Mar Menor lagoon in
    general, showing a Pearson correlation coefficient reaching up to 0.86. Furthermore,
    we have identified that certain ecological components, such as extreme algal blooms
    due to high nutrient inputs to the lagoon, can benefit the accuracy of SRS products.
    But there is still a long way to go to have reliable satellite monitoring systems
    in these highly anthropised lagoons. Data correction and adaptation to these local/regional
    contexts is mandatory, and this can be achieved through several approaches but,
    in light of the results obtained here, we recommend a distributed approach that
    encompasses the heterogeneity of these lagoon environments. In the continuing
    evolution of remote sensing technologies, the future holds a tailored approach
    to environmental monitoring. The development of localized algorithms capable of
    fitting global-scale data to regional ecosystems is an essential step. This accuracy,
    resulting from the combination of multispectral satellite and ground-based data,
    will improve the accuracy of remote sensing applications to capture dynamic ecological
    processes in coastal lagoons. While harnessing these technological advances, the
    scientific effort must be accompanied by policy frameworks that skillfully utilize
    this influx of data for informed ecological management. Long-term environmental
    management will depend on integrating this wealth of remotely sensed information
    into a coherent strategy that ensures that vital aquatic systems such as the Mar
    Menor are protected in the medium to long term. Software availability Name of

    Introduction With the rapid development of the network in the 1990 s, the gradual
    maturity of multimedia technology and the rise of ecommerce, multimedia information
    on the Internet has increased dramatically, but the network openness and resources
    sharing make the problem of network information security increasingly prominent
    and make digital products more vulnerable to malicious attacks or subtle modifications
    that affect the copyright certification [1], [2]. This requires effective protection
    means and technology of digital product copyright to solve this realistic problem.
    Therefore, information hiding technology has attracted widespread attention in
    the international academic circle, in which steganography [3] and digital watermarking
    technology [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16],
    [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22] are two important branches. Especially as a
    large amount of image information pours into people''s lives and becomes easier
    to operate, its copyright authentication is still a huge challenge so far [4].
    In order to cope with this challenge, digital watermarking technology, as a part
    of the solution, has made a significant contribution to image content security
    and received more and more attention. 1.1. Related works As an effective technology
    for copyright protection of digital products, digital watermarking is to embed
    meaningful marking information into digital multimedia by making full use of data
    or visual redundancy in digital multimedia works and certain embedding methods
    [5]. However, their value is not affected and human perception system cannot detect
    the embedded watermark. Digital image mainly includes binary image, gray image
    and color image, and people pay more attention to color image than the other kinds
    of image. In real life, the identity of the copyright protection tends to be beautiful,
    practical, and large capacity color digital watermark image, and is no longer
    limited to the pseudo random sequence, binary image or gray image with small capacity.
    However, the color image, viewed as a digital watermark with large amount of information,
    will increase the difficulty of watermark embedding, and will affect the performance
    of the watermarking in different degrees [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18],
    [20], [21], [22]. For example, Zhang et al. [12] came up with a block-level perceptual
    image watermarking framework including three-direction correlation and block-level
    just noticeable difference model, which mainly utilized the characteristics of
    discrete cosine transform and could effectively resist most common image processing
    attacks. Luo et al. [13] put forward a watermarking based on Tucker decomposition
    feature graph extraction and Schur decomposition for protecting the copyright
    of high dynamic range images, and it could effectively resist different tone mapping
    operations and common image attacks. At present, the application of machine learning
    tools in the field of watermarking develops very rapidly. Deep network and convolutional
    neural network, which have gained wide attention in the application of computer
    vision, are also applied in the research of digital watermarking [6], [7], [8],
    [9], [10], [11]. For example, Fang et al. [6] proposed a watermarking algorithm
    based on deep template, designed two new information embedding and locating templates
    at the embedding side, and proposed a new two-stage deep neural network at the
    extraction side, which not only guaranteed the original visual quality, but also
    had strong robustness. However, its actual message bits are 30 bits, the pure
    payload of the message is 30/(512 × 512) = 1.1444e-4bit/pixel, and the watermark
    capacity is small, which is not suitable for large-capacity color image watermarking.
    Quan et al. [11] proposed a black-box watermarking algorithm for pre-training
    models, taking advantage of DNNs’ overparameterization in image processing. However,
    its total time cost is higher than 25 s, which is difficult to meet the real-time
    requirements of digital copyright protection in 5G environment. In addition, according
    to different processing methods of host images, digital watermarking can be divided
    into spatial domain watermarking [15], [16], [17], [20] and transform domain watermarking
    [12], [13], [18], [19], [21], [22]. Among them, the spatial domain watermarking
    refers to embedding watermark information by directly modifying the image pixel
    value, which is characterized by simple calculation and high execution efficiency,
    but relatively poor robustness. The transform domain watermarking refers to adding
    watermark signal in the coefficient of transform domain, which has certain robustness
    but is more complex in calculation. In order to combine the advantages of the
    two kinds of watermarking, Su et al. [17] presented a fusion domain watermarking
    algorithm that combines spatial domain and singular value decomposition. The effect
    of embedding watermarks in the frequency domain is realized in the spatial domain,
    which not only maintains strong robustness, but also has a shorter running time.
    Additionally, there are other schemes in frequency domain which make use of soft
    computing techniques or optimization of signed images [41], [42], [43]. These
    schemes based on evolutionary algorithms are capable to give good outcomes in
    transform domain with good time efficiency. Sharma et al. [41] proposed a new
    image adaptive watermarking scheme, which used the Manta ray foraging optimization
    algorithm to optimize locally correlated multiple embedding intensities to balance
    imperceptibility and robustness of watermarked images. At the same time, the algorithm
    achieves high watermark recoverability in the signature image, which fully proves
    its robustness. Hilal et al. [42] proposed a new intelligent zero-watermarking
    method for authentication and tamper detection of Arabic text content. This method
    uses the fourth order and alphanumeric mechanism of Markov model to analyze Arabic
    text and extract text features as digital watermarks. Compared with the baseline
    method, this method significantly improves the watermarking robustness and tamper
    detection accuracy. Chekira et al. [43] proposed a new blind watermarking method
    based on dithering modulation. The method can automatically select the optimal
    embedding parameters to ensure the high quality of the watermarked image and the
    low bit error rate in the extraction process. The experimental results show that
    the proposed optimization algorithm achieves the best balance between robustness
    and imperceptibility, and shows good performance in terms of operation efficiency.
    Based on the above literature survey, the limitations of the existing state-of-the-art
    methods mainly include insufficient watermark embedding capacity and low real-time
    performance. Besides, digital images will be subjected to malicious attacks when
    spreading in the network, so watermarked image should have certain resistance.
    However, the further investigation of related works reveals that most watermarking
    schemes have great limitations in this respect, that is, they are generally robust
    to traditional signal processing, but there is no discussion or acceptable robustness
    to common geometric attacks. Furthermore, it is found in the investigation that
    scheme [14] proposed an image correction algorithm based on geometric characteristics
    to resist geometric attacks, but there are some shortcomings: 1) some image edges
    are partially incomplete or the color is close to the background, which makes
    it impossible to locate the image vertices accurately for more accurate correction;
    2) the type of image under geometric attack is only parallelogram rather than
    any quadrilateral, as shown in Fig. 1; 3) the corrected image exists sawtooth
    phenomenon without anti-aliasing processing. Therefore, a more effective scheme
    that can resist both types of attacks is needed. Download : Download high-res

    for geometric attacks: (a) scheme [17], (b) proposed scheme. 1.2. Motivation and
    contributions Nowadays, people have higher requirements on real-time performance
    of various applications. At present, the transform domain watermarking with certain
    robustness is still running for a long time due to high computational complexity,
    but the robustness of spatial domain watermarking with short running time cannot
    be guaranteed. In the investigation of related works, we learn a kind of fusion
    domain watermarking of combining spatial domain and matrix decomposition, which
    can integrate the advantages of the two kinds of watermarking. As a classic watermarking
    method with low complexity, the lower triangular matrix of LU factorization (LUF)
    is suitable for embedding watermark [25], but LUF in the frequency domain still
    has certain limitations for digital copyright protection under the 5G environment.
    Therefore, an algorithm combining LUF and spatial domain is derived in this paper,
    which has not been explored in prior fusion domain watermarking. Based on the
    above motivation and the limitation of the existing state-of-the-art methods,
    this paper proposes a new fusion domain and new image correction scheme. Its main
    contributions are as follows: 1. A new image correction algorithm is innovatively
    proposed in this paper, including locating image vertices accurately by using
    straight line detection, correcting arbitrary quadrilateral images, performing
    anti-aliasing operation by using the idea of fast approximate anti-aliasing, which
    can effectively resist geometric attacks; 2. The distribution relation and calculation
    algorithm between changed special matrix elements of LU factorization and spatial
    image pixels are deduced for the first time in this paper; 3. The embedding and
    blind extraction processes are completed in the spatial domain rather than in
    the complex transform domain, which fully integrates the merits of two kinds of
    different domains watermarking. In addition, Section 2 explains the theoretical
    knowledge. Section 3 describes the proposed scheme in detail. Section 4 evaluates
    and analyzes the performance of the proposed scheme. Finally, Section 5 summarizes
    this paper and provides the future research direction. 2. Preliminary knowledge
    2.1. Two-dimensional Logistic-adjusted-Sine map A chaotic system with more complex
    ergodicity, unpredictability and wider chaos range is proposed in algorithm [23],
    [24], which mainly depends on the two-dimensional Logical-adjusted-Sine map. It
    is derived from the Sine map and Logistic map and is defined by Eq. (1): (1) where,
    , x0 and y0 are two inputs, and are output pairs. The two inputs interact, and
    the output pairs are distributed in a two-dimensional phase plane. Compared with
    the single Sine map or Logistic map, its structure is more complex and the output
    result is more difficult to be calculated, so it can effectively encrypt the image
    into the random image and has strong ability to resist security attacks. Among
    them, x0, y0 and μ are the keys of image encryption. 2.2. LU factorization 2.2.1.
    LUF in the frequency domain In linear algebra, LUF is a kind of matrix decomposition,
    which is mainly used in numerical analysis to solve linear equations, solve inverse
    matrices or calculate determinants [25], [26]. Like other similar decompositions
    such as Hessenberg, Schur, QR or SVD, LUF also decomposes a matrix into the product
    of multiple matrices as shown in Eq. (2). But in addition to its low decomposition
    complexity, the stimulus behind deploying LUF is to improve watermarking robustness
    by taking advantage of the lower triangular matrix L with stable pairs of highly
    dependent elements and retaining the upper triangular matrix U for the geometric
    shape information of the image. (2) 2.2.2. The deep fusion theory between spatial
    domain and LU factorization Compared with traditional spatial watermarking schemes,
    the fusion domain watermarking schemes perform better in protecting watermark
    robustness. This method enhances the watermarking scheme''s resistance to various
    attacks. Meanwhile, compared with frequency domain watermarking scheme, fusion
    domain watermarking scheme has better real-time performance. The fusion domain
    watermarking scheme can calculate the relative coefficients directly in the space
    domain, and can replace the complex matrix transform by embedding and extracting
    the corresponding coefficients, thus reducing the extra computing burden, and
    is more suitable for real-time application scenarios. Therefore, the fusion domain
    watermarking scheme combines the robustness of frequency domain watermarking scheme
    and the real-time of spatial watermarking scheme, and has higher practical significance
    and application value. In order to combine the advantages of high real-time performance
    of the spatial domain watermarking and strong robustness of the frequency domain
    watermarking, the high correlation elements of matrix L are obtained by LUF in
    the spatial domain to complete the proposed watermarking scheme in the spatial
    domain without real LUF, which has not been explored in prior fusion domain watermarking.
    Two key difficulties of LUF need to be solved: (1) how to obtain the special matrix
    elements after LUF in the spatial domain; (2) how to distribute the changed special
    matrix elements to the image pixels in the spatial domain. The specific solution
    and derivation process are as follows. According to the decomposition characteristics
    of Eq. (2), the values of all elements in the kr-th row of square matrix A can
    be analyzed and obtained as shown in Eq. (3): (3) The values of all elements in
    the kc-th column of A are shown in Eq. (4): (4) Matrix L and U elements can be
    obtained from Eqs. (3), (4), as shown in Eqs. (5), (6): (5) (6) where, 1 ≤ kr,
    kc ≤ m, j = k,…, m, i = k + 1,…, m. Let kr = kc = 1 in Eqs. (5), (6), then the
    elements of the first row of matrix U and the elements of the first column of
    matrix L can be obtained in the spatial domain, as shown in Eqs. (7), (8): (7)
    (8) The proposed watermarking scheme utilizes the high correlation elements of
    matrix L to embed the watermark, and its frequency domain method is shown in Eq.
    (9): (9) where, is the modified lower triangular matrix element, p and q are rows
    of high correlation elements of matrix L, and T is the quantization step. Substitute
    Eqs. (7), (8) into Eq. (9) to obtain the algorithm that calculates in the spatial
    domain, as shown in Eq. (10): (10) Assuming , Eq. (11) can be obtained from Eqs.
    (7), (8) and (10): (11) Finally, the algorithm of distributing the changed related
    matrix elements to the image pixels in the spatial domain can be obtained, as
    shown in Eq. (12): (12) where, is the pixel value in row p and column j of the
    watermarked image block A*. The derivation process of is the same, obtaining .
    In order to better understand the watermarking process of the proposed fusion
    domain scheme, Fig. 2 gives the comparison example of embedding watermarks by
    the frequency domain scheme and the proposed one. As shown in the following Fig.
    2, by processing spatial image pixels with lower complexity, the proposed watermarking
    scheme obtains the same results as using frequency domain methods with higher
    complexity. In other words, with the results of the frequency domain of this decomposition
    as the target, the proposed scheme completes the watermark process in a simpler
    way, which not only does not sacrifice invisibility and robustness, but also further
    improves real-time performance and achieves fast processing of the watermarking
    scheme. The robustness and invisibility of the watermarking scheme can be effectively
    improved by embedding the watermark information into the relevant elements in
    the matrix L. This is because there is a strong correlation between those high
    correlation coefficients. Even if the attacker deleted or tampered with part of
    the correlation coefficients, the remaining correlation coefficients can still
    provide enough information to restore the original watermark information. This
    method makes the watermarking scheme better resistant to various attacks, and
    the visual perception of the watermark is very low, and the visual quality of
    the image is maintained. Therefore, the reliability and invisibility of the watermark
    can be ensured by embedding the watermark information with the relevant elements
    in the matrix L. Therefore, the reliability and invisibility of the watermark
    can be ensured by embedding the watermark information with the relevant elements
    in the matrix L. Therefore, the embedding and extracting watermark processes can
    be realized by processing spatial image pixels with lower complexity instead of
    the real matrix decomposition with higher complexity, and their operation result
    is the same, which can greatly improve the real-time performance of the proposed
    watermarking scheme. Download : Download high-res image (350KB) Download : Download

    objects is usually described by perspective transform (PT), which can be used
    to generate a mapping from distorted image to corrected image, and a plane graph
    can produce stereo effect after PT [27], [28]. PT is a transform that converts
    the spatial coordinates (x, y) into the new coordinates (x'', y'') defined by
    Eq. (13): (13) where, it is a pure PT when c02 + c12 ≠ 0, that is, c0 and c1 will
    cause nonlinear perspective distortion of the image; if they are both equal to
    zero, the PT becomes a linear affine transform. In addition, all coefficients
    are real numbers, and c2 is usually set to 1 to simplify the equation, so there
    are eight parameters in Eq. (13). Therefore, the PT matrix can be obtained according
    to the vertex coordinate pairs of the original image and transformed image, which
    is utilized to realize the PT. Fig. 3 shows a schematic diagram of PT, that is,
    a square image can be transformed into any quadrilateral and can also be restored
    by PT, and its premise is to determine the vertex coordinates before transform
    and the corresponding transformed coordinates. Download : Download high-res image

    3. Proposed watermarking scheme The proposed watermarking scheme is mainly composed
    of four parts: watermark pretreatment, watermark embedding, image correction and
    watermark extraction. For a clearer understanding of the whole scheme, its overall
    flowchart is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (571KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. The overall flowchart of the proposed watermarking
    scheme. 3.1. Watermark pretreatment process The specific operations of watermark
    pretreatment process are shown in pseudo-code Algorithm 3.1. Algorithm 3.1 Watermark
    pretreatment Input: Watermark image W, host image H, block size bsize, encrypt
    key ekeys and position key pkeys Output: Encrypted watermark sequence EWS, all
    keys allkeys and embedding position position 1: WCo = levelCombination(W); 2:
    EWCo = encryptW(WCo, ekeys); 3: Str = binStr(EWCo); 4: EWS = reshape(Str, 3, []);
    5: Hr = size(H, 1); 6: EWSc = size(EWS, 2); 7: posipara = [Hr, bsize, EWSc]; 8:
    position = getPosition(posipara, pkeys); 9: allkeys = [ekeys, pkeys]; In which,
    steps 1 to 4 are the encryption of watermark. Firstly, three color channels of
    the watermark are horizontally combined into a non-square matrix WCo by levelCombination(.),
    and WCo is encrypted using the encryption method in Section 2.1 by encryptW(.).
    Then, the encrypted non-square matrix is converted into a binary sequence by binStr(.).
    Finally, since the embedded watermark and the color host image are presented by
    RGB model, the rows number of this sequence is changed to 3 to facilitate complete
    the watermark embedding process. Steps 5 to 9 are the acquisition of embedding
    position. Firstly, the rows number of H and the columns number of the EWS are
    obtained through steps 5–6 to determine the total number of image blocks and watermark
    bits as well as the range of random numbers in step 8. Then, all embedding positions
    of watermark bits are selected by function getPosition(.). Specifically, this
    function executes a random function to obtain the random position sequence number
    of all embedded blocks in all image blocks and takes the function parameters as
    the keys. Finally, the corresponding values should be saved as the key for subsequent
    processes, and to be suitable for watermarking applications, allkeys are implicitly
    exchanged between Alice and Bob to ensure the security of the watermarking method.
    3.2. Watermark embedding process The specific operations of watermark embedding
    process are shown in pseudo-code Algorithm 3.2.1 and Algorithm 3.2.2. Algorithm
    3.2.1 Watermark embedding Input: Host image H, encrypted watermark sequence EWS,
    embedding position position, and variable quantization steps T 1Output: Watermarked
    image WH 1: WH = H; 2: for level = 1: 3 3: for k = 1: size(position, 2) 4: block
    = selectBlock(Hlevel, position, k); 5: w = EWSlevel, k; 6: newblock = watermarkBitEmbedding(block,
    w, Tlevel); 7: replaceBlock(WH, position, k, newblock); 8: end 9:end In Algorithm
    3.2.1, steps 4 to 7 are the acquisition of the watermarked image. Firstly, select
    the embedded block based on position by selectBlock(.), where Hlevel represents
    the level-th image channel of H. Specifically, this function first obtains the
    position sequence number of the current embedded block from position according
    to the serial number k, and then calculates the position coordinates of the image
    where the current embedded block is located to determine the block. The advantage
    of this embedding strategy is that the watermark can be embedded using the high
    correlation between matrix elements, thus ensuring the robustness and invisibility
    of the watermark. At the same time, the random embedding method can reduce the
    probability that the watermark is detected by the attacker. It should be noted
    that the watermark bits are embedded in the blocks chosen with random manner,
    so watermark bits might have been embedded in any part of the image. However,
    the idea of watermark embedding is to take advantage of the high correlation between
    the matrix elements, which is independent of the position of the embedded block.
    Then, get the watermark bit according to the EWS, where EWSlevel, k represents
    the value in row level and column k of EWS. After that, call Algorithm 3.2.2 to
    complete the embedding of one watermark bit by watermarkBitEmbedding(.), in which
    variable quantization steps [20] are adopted to improve the watermark invisibility.
    In step 7, replace the original image block with the watermarked image block.
    Finally, the watermarked image with key information is obtained. Algorithm 3.2.2
    Watermark bit embedding Input: Selected block block, watermark bit w and quantization
    step Tlevel Output: Watermarked block newblock 1: if someCases(block) 2: Enlarge
    Δ; 3: end 4: newblock = block; 5: if w==''1′ 6: if lp,1-lq,1＜2Tlevel 7:  8:  9:
    end 10: else 11: if lq,1-lp,1＜2Tlevel 12:  13:  14: end 15: end In Algorithm 3.2.2,
    steps 4 to 7 are the handling of special cases. If the block belongs to some special
    cases, that is, the watermarked image block after being converted to an 8-bit
    unsigned integer is the same as the original block, the Δ in Eq. (11) needs to
    be enlarged to solve this problem so as to enhance the robustness. Steps 5 to
    15 are the acquisition of the watermarked image block. Serving as a limiting condition,
    li,1 is obtained by Eq. (8) in the spatial domain, and the block that meets the
    condition does not need to perform the embedding operation, thus further reducing
    the embedding time. Then, the derived Eq. (12) is used to embed one watermark
    bit in the spatial domain, which omits the complex transform process, quickly
    completes the embedding of one watermark bit and reduces the embedding time. It
    should be noted that the watermark bits are embedded in the blocks chosen with
    random manner, so watermark bits might have been embedded in any part of the image.
    However, the idea of watermark embedding is to take advantage of the high correlation
    between the matrix elements, which is independent of the position of the embedded
    block. 3.3. Image correction process 3.3.1. Image vertex location The specific
    operation of image vertex location, as shown in pseudo-code Algorithm 3.3.1, is
    the key step to extract the edge of the image. In order to more accurately determine
    the vertex position of the image, we need to extract the edge of the image. In
    watermark detection, only when the vertex position of the image is determined,
    the watermark image can be aligned with the carrier image and compared. Image
    edge detection can help solve the problem that the vertex position of the image
    may not be easily determined accurately. By looking for four edges, it can help
    determine the vertex position of the image, so as to realize the image positioning
    for further image correction. Algorithm 3.3.1 Image vertex location Input: Watermarked
    image under geometric attack WH_GA Output: Image vertex set Points and attack
    type Type 1: LI = logical(WH_GA1 + WH_GA2 + WH_GA3); 2: EI = edge(LI, ''approxcanny'');
    3: Lines = lineDetection(EI); 4: Type=’Others’; 5: if at least one LI(corner point)==1
    6: if at least two edges with more than half the valid values in LI 7: if exist
    edges without valid values in LI 8: Type=''Translation''; 9: The parameter range
    of the attack is specified according to the number of lines in Lines; 10: Calculate
    and compare the distance with each edge, or combine the calculation of line intersection
    points, and determine the image vertex set Points; 11: else 12: In addition to
    the known points, find the position of value change of each edge of LI, and determine
    the Points; 13: end 14: else 15: By calculating the distance and sorting, find
    the minimum distance point between the closest point to the upper right corner
    and the closest point to the lower left corner in Lines; 16: According to the
    symmetry relation, the position of symmetric points is obtained, and the Points
    is determined; 17: end 18: else 19: By calculating the distance and sorting, the
    Points closest to each edge in Lines is found; 20: Determine the order of the
    Points according to the center line; 21: end In which, step 1 is the image type
    conversion. RGB image values are converted into logical values consisting of 0
    and 1, so as to facilitate the processing of subsequent steps. Steps 2 to 3 are
    the straight line detection. Firstly, as a pretreatment of line detection, the
    edge detection process with Canny method [30], [31] is performed on the LI, and
    then, four image edges are found, where the image texture has been ignored in
    step 1, which can speed up the running of straight line detection. Finally, the
    Hough transform is used to detect the lines by lineDetection(.), so as to determine
    positions Lines of the starting points and end points of four edges. The essence
    of Hough transform is a mapping relation from image space to parameter space [29].
    The slope of a line can be infinite, so Hough transform is usually carried out
    in polar coordinates. Fig. 5 shows a schematic diagram of Hough transform, that
    is, the mapping from image space of Fig. 5(a) to parameter space of Fig. 5(b).
    The three blue points in Fig. 5(a) map to the parameter space and intersect at
    the red point in Fig. 5(b), i.e. the collinearity of three points in a rectangular
    coordinate system corresponds to the common point of multiple lines in the ρ-θ
    space. Because some image edges are partially incomplete or the color is close
    to the background, image vertices cannot be located accurately. While straight
    line detection based on Hough transform has advantages of strong anti-interference
    ability and insensitive to the incomplete parts of lines, noise and other coexisting
    non-linear structures in the image. Therefore, the above situation can be avoided
    by using Hough transform. Because Hough transform has the problem of pseudo-peak
    in parameter space [32], that is, line error detection may occur due to the influence
    of noise and small short lines. For solving this problem, it is supplemented by
    step-by-step point detection in steps 4 to 21 to more accurately determine the
    image vertex set Points, that is, the final image vertices are determined by continuing
    to search step by step on the basis of Lines. What’s more, the premise of performing
    accurate point detection each time is to distinguish the attack type Type, and
    this identification is mainly according to the distribution characteristics of
    the edges and corners of images after different attacks, which is introduced in
    the other description of steps 4 to 21. Download : Download high-res image (102KB)

    of attacked image correction are shown in pseudo-code Algorithm 3.3.2. Algorithm
    3.3.2 Image correction Input: Watermarked image under geometric attack WH_GA,
    Image vertex set Points, all keys allkeys and attack type Type Output: Corrected
    watermarked image CWH 1: if Type==''Translation'' 2: CWH = inverseTranslation(WH_GA,
    Points); 3: else 4: PTimg = perspectiveTransform(WH_GA, Points); 5:  [r, c] =
    find(PTimg1); 6: PTimg*= ; 7: for Each edge of PTimg* 8: if length(find(edge >
    Φ1)) > length(edge) × Φ2 9: Update edge of PTimg*; 10: end 11: end 12: CWH = imresize(PTimg*,
    allkeys); 13: end In which, Steps 1 to 2 are the single correction operation of
    translation. If the attack type is translation, the correction is completed by
    carrying out inverse translation operation, which only needs to judge the direction
    and distance of image translation according to the image vertex set Points. Steps
    3 to 4 are the general correction operations. For other attack types, the corrected
    image PTimg can be obtained, where the used function is utilized perspective transform
    described in Section 2.3. However, this image contains wide edges irrelevant to
    the watermarked image WH, so they need to be removed in next steps. Steps 5 to
    14 are the update of image edge. Firstly, the row and column numbers completely
    irrelevant to the WH are found, and then they are directly deleted from PTimg
    to obtain PTimg*. Then, the correlation between the edge and the WH may be very
    low, so if the effective pixels occupy a certain proportion of the whole edge,
    the edge will be updated as the latest edge of PTimg* that judged by step 8, where
    Φ1 and Φ2 are threshold values. Finally, the image size of PTimg* needs to be
    adjusted to be consistent with the original image size for subsequent the image
    correction and watermark extraction processes. 3.3.3. Corrected image post-processing
    After the correction in the previous section, there exist sawtooth in image edges,
    which refers to the phenomenon of zigzag markings in the area with drastic color
    changes on the resulting image. This phenomenon is especially obvious on the color
    edge of the image due to the large color difference on both sides of the edge,
    in which the fast approximate anti-aliasing (FXAA) is an important performance-oriented
    deformation anti-aliasing algorithm [33], [34]. In this paper, FXAA’s sawtooth
    boundary determination algorithm is mainly used. The specific operations of corrected
    image post-processing are shown in pseudo-code Algorithm 3.3.3. Algorithm 3.3.3
    Corrected image post-processing Input: Corrected watermarked image CWH Output:
    Processed corrected watermarked image PCWH 1: PCWH = CWH; 2: for Each edge of
    PCWH 3: Lumi = getLuminance(edge); 4: for Each pixel of edge 5: if lumiContrast(Lumi)
    ≥ t1 6: edgeLumi=(current_pixel + blending_pixel)/2; 7: t_gradient = edgeLumi
    × t2; 8: lumiDelta = Lumi(current_pixel + edgeStep)-edgeLumi; 9: while abs(lumiDelta)
    ≥ t_gradient && edgeStep ≤ searchSteps 10: edgeStep = edgeStep + 1; 11: lumiDelta
    = Lumi(current_pixel + edgeStep)-edgeLumi; 12: end 13:end 14: if edgeStep > searchSteps
    15: Pixel detect; 16: end 17: Linear interpolation; 18: Update Lumi; 19: end 20:
    end In which, steps 2 to 3 are to obtain the brightness of each edge. The brightness
    Lumi is obtained by getLuminance(.), in which the brightness conversion equation
    [35] is shown in Eq. (14): (14) where, L, R, G, and B represent the brightness
    value and the pixels of three channels, respectively. Steps 4 to 16 are the sawtooth
    boundary determination. Firstly, the luminance contrast values are calculated
    by lumiContrast(.), which are determined by luminance difference between horizontal
    and vertical pixels, and only when the contrast value is greater than the threshold
    t1, anti-aliasing processing is considered. Anti-aliasing technology works by
    adding additional information or processing to the edges of objects to smooth
    out jagged edges and create a more natural image. Then, the boundary is determined
    by calculating whether the difference of Lumi on both sides conforms to the current
    brightness gradient, that is, calculating the average brightness value edgeLumi
    of the current pixel current_pixel and the pixel to be blended blending_pixel,
    and taking a certain proportion t2 as the gradient threshold t_gradient. Then,
    searching along the sawtooth direction with step size edgeStep to judge the difference
    lumiDelta with the current edgeLumi, and if the value is smaller the threshold,
    it is considered that the sawtooth boundary has been reached. If no boundary is
    found within searchSteps pixels, the position of the boundary is restricted and
    the pixels around the searchSteps are detected by the pixel detection in step
    15, and the position with the maximum probability of sawtooth boundary is selected
    as the final boundary. Steps 17 to 20 are to reduce the sawtooth effect. When
    the sawtooth boundary is determined, the linear interpolation [36] is used to
    eliminate the sawtooth in the selected region, and then the Lumi is updated for
    anti-aliasing processing subsequent use. Finally, the final PCWH can be obtained
    by eliminating and updating each sawtooth area of each edge. 3.4. Watermark extraction
    process The specific operations of watermark extraction process are shown in pseudo-code
    Algorithm 3.4. Algorithm 3.4 Watermark extraction Input: Processed corrected watermarked
    image PCWH, all keys allkeys, and variable quantization steps T Output: Extracted

    1, []); 14: EWCo*=decImage(Str*, allkeys); 15: WCo*=decryptW(EWCo*, allkeys);
    16: EW = levelSplit(WCo*); In which, step 1 and step 4 are to select extraction
    blocks. All extraction block positions are selected by getPosition(.), and the
    current extraction block is located by selectBlock(.). Steps 5 to 10 are to get
    the extracted watermark bit. According to Eq. (8), obtained in the spatial domain
    is judged the extracted watermark bit, and then the extracted watermark sequence
    EWS* is obtained. Steps 13 to 16 are to decrypt the extracted watermark. Firstly,
    the EWS* is arranged into a one-dimensional binary sequence and it is converted
    to a decimal non-square matrix by decImage(.). Then, it is decrypted by decryptW(.)
    by the method in Section 2.1 to obtain WCo*. Finally, WCo* is split horizontally
    into the extracted three color channels, and they are combined into the final
    EW by levelSplit(.). 4. Performance results and analysis 4.1. Simulation data
    and metrics In theory, when a color image is used as a digital watermark, the
    information contained is three times as much as that of a gray image and 24 times
    as much as that of a binary image of the same size. If the maximum embedded watermark
    image size is specifically compared, and the 512 × 512 color host image and the
    4 × 4 block that can be embedded with 1 watermark bit are taken as an example,
    a maximum of 49,152 bits of binary watermark information can be embedded, and
    a maximum of 221 × 221 binary image watermark, a maximum of 78 × 78 Gy image watermark
    and a maximum of 45 × 45 color image watermark can be embedded. Therefore, in
    order to detect the practical application effect and fair comparison, this paper
    uses the color watermark image for experimental verification. 4.1.1. Image dataset
    For subsequent display and analysis of experimental results, Fig. 6 shows different
    types of standard color images adopted with size of 512 × 512, which are all from
    image databases CVG-UGR [37] and USC-SIPI [38]. Fig. 7 shows watermark images
    of size 32 × 32 with different color characteristics selected in subsequent experiment.

    other performances, the proposed scheme has the same actual embedding rate as
    all comparison schemes in the whole comparison experiment. 4.1.2. Performance
    metrics Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) [15] and structural similarity index
    metric (SSIM) [16], as performance evaluation metrics of invisibility, are defined
    as Eqs. (14), (15): (15) (16) where, represents the pixel value of row i and column
    j of the level-th image channel of host image H, WH represents the watermarked
    image, M and N are the sizes of image, l(H, WH), c(H, WH) and s(H, WH) are luminance,
    contrast and structure comparison function, respectively. Normalized cross-correlation
    (NC) [16] and bit error rate (BER) [18], as performance evaluation metrics of
    robustness, are defined as Eqs. (16), (17): (17) (18) where, W and EW are original
    and extracted watermark images, respectively, and EWSc is the total number of
    watermark bits of one watermark image channel. 4.1.3. Parameter selection In order
    to select the quantization step, we use the images of Fig. 6, Fig. 7 as test images,
    and Fig. 8 shows the line chart of each metric with the change of quantization
    step T3, where U_NC and U_BER are the NC and BER values without any attack, respectively,
    A_NC and A_BER are the NC and BER values under attacks, respectively, and T3 refers
    to the quantization step used in the third image channel. The selection of quantization
    step should be based on different application occasions. According to the results
    in Fig. 8, the presented watermarking scheme achieves the best balance in terms
    of robustness and invisibility at T = 0.0316. In this case, all the evaluation
    indicators show good performance. Download : Download high-res image (232KB) Download

    steps T3. In addition, the proposed scheme adopts variable quantization steps
    [20] to better meet the invisibility, that is, different quantization step is
    set for different image channels. This is because there is a certain correlation
    among RGB image channels and the human visual system has different sensitivities
    to the three primary colors. The specific relationship of variable quantization
    steps is T1 = 0.78 × T3, T2 = 0.94 × T3. 4.2. Invisibility results and analysis
    Invisibility is the invisible ability to hide the attached digital watermark information
    in the host image. Generally speaking, the watermark information is subjectively
    visible when the PSNR＜25 dB; the image quality is acceptable when 29 dB ≤ PSNR＜35
    dB; the image quality is good when 35 dB ≤ PSNR＜48 dB [39]. Table 1 shows the
    average invisibility results. The average values of PSNR and SSIM of the proposed
    scheme embedded with different watermarks are all above 40.20 dB and 0.96, respectively.
    In terms of the metric value of a single image, the PSNR value is around 40 dB
    and SSIM is around 0.96. Therefore, the proposed scheme has good image quality.

    addition, the invisibility comparison results show that the invisibility of schemes
    [21] and [22] just meet the basic requirements with PSNR around 35 dB and SSIM
    less than 0.95. Compared with them, the invisibility of the proposed scheme has
    a greater advantage. Scheme [14] has good invisibility and is basically equal
    to the performance of the proposed scheme. While scheme [19] has excellent invisibility
    due to its small quantization step, so that the amount of pixel modification is
    very small. However, the quantization step affects the balance between invisibility
    and robustness, which also leads to its poor robustness as shown in Table 3. Therefore,
    scheme [19] achieves high invisibility by sacrificing robustness. Table 2. Attack

    the invisibility of the proposed scheme has advantages over most comparison schemes.
    However, the purpose of the proposed scheme is to protect copyright effectively,
    so it achieves stronger robustness on the basis of meeting the basic requirement
    of good invisibility. 4.3. Robustness results and analysis Robustness refers to
    the ability of the watermarked image to retain the watermark information after
    being intentionally or unintentionally modified. According to the attack types
    and parameters in Table 2, a series of robustness comparison experiments are conducted,
    and the experimental results are shown in Table 3. The calculation unit of NC
    is pixel value in decimal, while that of BER is binary number, so NC may differ
    greatly in the case that BER is the same. Therefore, the robustness of the proposed
    scheme can be considered more comprehensively through these evaluation metrics.
    For A1, the robustness of the proposed scheme is lower than that of other schemes
    because schemes [14], [21], [22] embed the watermark by modifying the low-frequency
    coefficients. JPEG format compresses mainly high-frequency information, so the
    modification of low-frequency coefficients has little influence on original data.
    The scheme [22] has worst performance because of a small quantization step. For
    A2, the proposed scheme and the comparison schemes have excellent robustness,
    and their NC and BER are close to 1 and 0, respectively. For A3, the proposed
    scheme has the strongest robustness compared with other schemes. Except for scheme
    [21], other schemes have good robustness. The Salt & Pepper noise is the random
    appearance of white or black dots on the image with a certain probability, and
    the block size of scheme [21] is the largest among all schemes, so the probability
    of noise appearing in the block is higher. In scheme [21], a block is embedded
    with four watermark bits, so the extraction of more watermark bits will be affected.
    For A4, the robustness of proposed scheme is at an acceptable medium level compared
    with other schemes. For A5, the proposed scheme has superior robustness compared
    with other schemes. Under this attack, part of the image block will become the
    same color and the coefficient range after transform will change greatly or the
    value is very extreme, so the correct watermark bit cannot be extracted by other
    schemes based on quantization. In addition, the distributed location of embedded
    blocks is also a factor. In scheme [19], the watermark bits are embedded into
    the host image in sequence, and the embedded blocks are not randomly selected.
    Therefore, when subjected to this attack, a large number of embedded blocks are
    destroyed, so that a large number of watermark bits cannot be extracted correctly.
    For A6, the robustness of most comparison schemes is better than that of the proposed
    scheme, but the robustness of the proposed scheme is acceptable. For A7 and A8,
    the robustness of all schemes is not particularly prominent because these attacks
    will cause image blur and destroy image details. For A9-A12, the proposed scheme
    has high resistance, while other schemes have particularly poor resistance. Under
    A9 attack, the overall motion displacement of the image is 9 pixels, and the motion
    angle is 0°. Under A10 attack, the image contrast is significantly changed. Under
    A11 and A12 attacks, the image brightness is significantly adjusted. Therefore,
    the range of coefficients in comparison schemes will change greatly, so that quantization
    results cannot fall within the correct range. However, the proposed scheme still
    has high similarity between the selected coefficient pairs and their size relationship
    is slightly affected, so their robustness has significant advantages. In practical
    applications, attackers may use a variety of attack methods to attempt to destroy
    embedded watermark information. Therefore, in order to ensure the practicality
    and reliability of the proposed watermarking scheme, we need to consider the robustness
    against different combination attacks. Table 4 shows robustness comparison results
    under six different combination attacks. It can be seen that the proposed watermarking
    scheme also shows more excellent robustness under the combination attacks compared
    with the other watermarking schemes. Table 4. Robustness comparison results under
    different combination attacks (NC/BER). Attacks Scheme [14] Scheme[19] Scheme

    image processing, and the results are obtained without correction processing.
    However, watermark positions are all shifted after geometric attacks, so the watermark
    can be extracted according to the confirmed position only after correction processing.
    In addition, the new image correction algorithm in the proposed scheme solves
    some shortcomings of the geometry characteristics-based image correction algorithm
    in scheme [14] mentioned in Section 1.1. Firstly, scheme [14] is to cycle through
    all image pixels and takes pixel points that are greater than a certain threshold
    value with the background as vertices, but if there are some defects at the image
    edge or its color is close to the background, it is impossible to accurately locate
    image vertices, while the proposed scheme can solve this problem through Hough
    transform line detection algorithm. Then, scheme [14] cannot solve the deformation
    of non-parallelogram, while the proposed scheme can utilize PT to correct the
    any quadrilateral image after determining the vertex position. Finally, scheme
    [14] does not take into account the sawtooth existing in the corrected image edge,
    while the proposed scheme uses the idea of the sawtooth boundary determination
    algorithm in FXAA, supplemented by pixel detection, to carry out anti-aliasing
    processing on the image edge. Because the schemes [19], [21], [22] do not contain
    the image correction algorithm, the watermark cannot be correctly extracted at
    all in the case of unknown attack types and parameters, while the scheme [14]
    can implement watermark extraction in this case as mentioned above, so Fig. 9
    mainly shows the watermark visual effect and robustness comparison results with
    scheme [14]. Under rotation (-30°), affine (0.15, 0.15) and perspective distortion
    attacks, the image correction algorithm of scheme [14] misjudges or fails to determine
    the attack type, so it can only extract the watermark from the original attacked
    image, which is impossible to extract the correct watermark. Under other attacks,
    especially those with obvious sawtooth caused by small transform angles, such
    as rotation (10°), the proposed scheme achieves better results due to the processing
    of edge sawtooth. Moreover, the average result of the proposed scheme, with NC
    higher than 0.9 and BER around 0.1, is much better than that of scheme [14], which
    proves that the proposed image correction algorithm has certain advantages and
    strong robustness. Download : Download high-res image (945KB) Download : Download

    correction (NC/BER). 4.4. Security analysis Security refers to the ability of
    the watermark scheme to ensure the security of the watermark information. In general,
    the key space needs to be greater than 2100 to prevent brute force from obtaining
    the correct key [40], where the key space is determined by the data type of the
    key. The proposed scheme shares two groups of keys, namely, encrypt key ekeys
    and position key pkeys, whose key spaces are 2207 and 245, respectively. Therefore,
    the total key space is 2252＞2100, which can resist brute force cracking and has
    high security. In addition, the encryption algorithm of the proposed scheme is
    sensitive to the initial state, where the secret keys [x0, y0, μ] are set to [0.56823603,
    0.00427592, 0.71750067]. As shown in Fig. 10, even if the numerical value of the
    wrong key is very close to the correct key, as long as one key is wrong, the correct
    watermark image cannot be extracted, indicating the high security of the proposed
    scheme. Download : Download high-res image (212KB) Download : Download full-size

    people are gradually losing patience with high-latency applications. Therefore,
    the watermarking scheme based on the fusion domain is proposed, which performs
    frequency domain conversion and coefficients modification in the spatial domain
    and greatly improves the efficiency to meet people''s requirements for real time.
    Table 5 shows the comparison results of running time in seconds, and the computing
    platforms are AMD Ryzen 7 4700U with Radeon Graphics 2.00 GHz, 16.00 GB RAM, x64,
    Windows 10 and Matlab (R2017a). Schemes [19], [21] and [22] are frequency domain
    schemes, and their time complexity are O(n2), O(n4) and O(n3), respectively. Similar
    to the proposed scheme, the time complexity of spatial domain scheme [14] based
    on Haar transform spatial domain schemes with O(n). In addition, if the embedding
    and extraction processes in this paper are realized by LUF in the frequency domain,
    the total time is 0.38814 s, while the total time is only 0.14471 s by using the
    proposed fusion domain method, which reduces the total time by nearly 63 % and
    is also less than the total time of all other comparison schemes. Therefore, the
    proposed fusion domain scheme has low time complexity and low actual running time,
    and can effectively improve the application efficiency. Table 5. Time comparison

    applying digital watermarking to the occasions of fast and efficient copyright
    protection, this paper proposes a fusion domain color image watermarking scheme
    based on LUF and new image correction. Firstly, the watermark is encrypted and
    the embedded position of watermark bits is obtained in the watermark pretreatment
    process. Then, the high correlation elements of the lower triangular matrix are
    calculated and modified in the spatial domain through the first deduced algorithm,
    and the changed matrix elements are distributed to the image pixels in the spatial
    domain. Before watermark extraction, if the image is subjected to geometric attack,
    it is corrected by the proposed image correction algorithm. Finally, the watermark
    extraction is directly judged by deduced formulas in the spatial domain. The proposed
    scheme reduces the running time by the derived fusion domain algorithm, and is
    not only robust under image signal processing, but also takes into account the
    robustness of some geometric attacks, so it can effectively protect color image
    digital copyright. However, the correction of geometric attacks is not fully considered
    and although the proposed scheme has greatly improved the real-time performance,
    it still takes a long time to ensure the algorithm security, which needs to be
    improved. In the future work, we will actively explore and study new watermarking
    technology trends and application scenarios, and consider how to apply them in
    real situations. In addition, we will also work to optimize the key space to ensure
    that the watermarking algorithm can further improve its efficiency while meeting
    the security requirements to adapt to the increasing data volume and processing
    needs. CRediT authorship contribution statement Qingtang Su: Supervision, Conceptualization,

  description: Saffron is a highly prized and globally demanded spice.Still, the rate
    of production is unable to keep up with the exponentially rising demand due to
    a variety of reasons. One of the major problems faced in increasing saffron growth
    is the lack of understanding of the best circumstances. Factors like Temperature,
    humidity, and light intensity play a vital role in the growth and development
    of plants, and continuous monitoring and control of these factors are necessary
    to ensure optimal growth. To address this issue this paper introduces an integrated
    automated system designed to empower farmers in optimizing production while simultaneously
    facilitating data collection for research purposes, aimed at enhancing both the
    quantity and quality of agricultural yields using the utilization of sensors and
    a live data streaming application. It allows for efficient management of saffron's
    growing operations and enables more accurate adjustments. The sensors can be remotely
    located in the saffron growing areas and connected to the app via wireless connections,
    allowing farmers to monitor these factors and suggest changes continuously. Using
    this system, farmers can ensure that the conditions for saffron plant growth are
    optimal at all times, leading to increased production. The developed app utilizes
    technologies such as ReactJS and Google Firebase, and also allows for real-time
    data streaming, enabling farmers to view the current conditions at any time and
    make adjustments accordingly. Additionally, a user-friendly mobile application
    is developed to enable farmers to easily oversee their cultivation conditions.
    This paper bridges the gap between existing research by integrating the factor
    of luminous intensity and its effect on Saffron during it's budding and growth
    stage, an area which is severely under researched and finds almost negligible
    mainstream integration in similar prototype models. Furthermore, the paper underscores
    the potential for future machine learning models by highlighting the provision
    for follow-up studies using the data collected through the prototype, thus fostering
    ongoing advancements in agricultural research and technology.

    Introduction Saffron (Crocus sativus) is renowned for its unique flavor, aroma,
    and natural coloring properties and medical applications. (Rezaee Khorasany and
    Hosseinzadeh 2016; Bingcong Xing et al., 2021) Saffron has potential medical applications
    that include its role as an antioxidant, mood enhancer (Peng Zhou et al., 2022),
    neuroprotective agent (Marx et al., 2019), anti-inflammatory, and potential benefits
    for cardiovascular health, weight management, eye health, cancer prevention, menstrual
    health, and skin health (Boskabady and Farkhondeh, 2016, Akhondzadeh et al., 2010,
    Agnihotri, 2015). However, further research is needed to confirm its effectiveness
    and safety for specific medical conditions. It should be used in moderation and
    under medical supervision (Amin et al., 2011, Bani et al., 2011), but its cultivation
    is characterized by substantial manual labor, making it one of the world''s most
    expensive spices. This study addresses a significant research gap in the field,
    focusing on the nuanced growth stages (López Córcoles et al., 2015) of saffron
    and the critical environmental factors that influence its development. The aim
    is to provide novel insights into optimizing saffron production through IoT and
    addressing the challenges posed by its cultivation, which have been relatively
    understudied in existing literature. The two major analytical points are: 1. Optimizing
    Growth Stages: It is hypothesized that understanding the specific environmental
    requirements at each saffron growth stage can lead to improved crop management
    practices, ultimately enhancing saffron yield and quality. 2. Greenhouse vs. Open
    Field Cultivation: The expectation is that greenhouse cultivation provides more
    precise control over environmental factors such as light, temperature, and humidity,
    leading to higher saffron production efficiency compared to traditional open-field
    methods. This comparative analysis fills a gap in existing research. The five
    major stages of the annual saffron cycle—sprouting, flowering, leaf development,
    daughter corm development, and dormancy—are influenced by various factors, which
    have been deduced and summarized from different works as below 1.1. Temperature
    Abbasi et al. (2009) and Nehvi et al. (2022) observed no bud growth during the
    first 30 days after leaf withering despite warm temperatures, but flowering commenced
    shortly thereafter. Interestingly, Molina et al. (2005) found optimal floral development
    within a range of 23–27°C for over 50 days, though exceeding 150 days resulted
    in floral abortion. A separate study by Zhang et al. (2023) highlighted the crucial
    role of temperature in flower emergence. They demonstrated that lowering the temperature
    to 17°C after initial incubation at warmer conditions (23–27°C) was essential
    for successful blooming. Higher temperatures, as reported by Wang et al. (2020),
    can impede flower initiation and even cause existing blooms to abort. Notably,
    their research showed that corms kept at 9°C produced no flowers at all. Further
    research by Li et al. (2022) investigated the impact of seasonal temperature fluctuations
    on saffron phenology. They observed rapid leaf withering followed by flower initiation
    in late spring/early summer when temperatures reached 20°C. Conversely, prolonged
    hot summers delayed flower emergence until late autumn when temperatures dropped
    to 15–17°C. 1.2. Humidity Research conducted by Singh et al. (2021) suggests that
    maintaining an average air temperature of 23.34°C and relative humidity of 65.71%
    for 60 days during corm incubation promotes efficient flower ontogenesis. However,
    for optimal sprout development, Zhao et al. (2019) found that 36 days of incubation
    at 19.77°C with 67.71% humidity was more effective. Interestingly, both excessive
    and deficient rainfall during the bud sprouting period have been linked to decreased
    saffron production and productivity, as noted by Kumar et al. (2018). Additionally,
    chilling periods in December and January, with mean aerial temperatures around
    2.4°C, appear to be crucial for successful saffron flowering, according to the
    findings of Khan et al. (2023). 1.3. Light intensity The role of light intensity
    in saffron cultivation remains somewhat enigmatic, particularly its impact on
    daughter bulb quality and seed yield. However, recent research by Chen et al.
    (2024) explored the effects of different light intensities and red/blue light
    combinations on saffron plants. Their findings suggest that a light intensity
    of 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ with a 3R2B ratio might be optimal for maximizing stigma yield,
    quality, and nutrient content. On the other hand, studies by Liu et al. (2020)
    indicate that higher light intensities can compromise stigma yield and quality,
    despite promoting leaf growth and photosynthesis. Leveraging the wealth of knowledge
    obtained from previous studies, an IoT-based saffron system offers unprecedented
    opportunities to revolutionize saffron cultivation by providing precise environmental
    control, data-driven insights, and adaptive management strategies. This integration
    of technology and scientific understanding holds great promise for advancing saffron
    production efficiency and sustainability in the future. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Technologies used The technologies that have been used in developing the
    prototype after considering all of the parameters are: -ESP32 as the primary micro-controller
    -The sensors used are the DHT11 and an LDR -Database management is handled using
    Google FireBase -The app environment was set up and developed using ReactJS Other
    technologies used by researchers in the same field have included Arduino UNOs
    which are generally more expensive than the ESP-32. They have also used separate
    air moisture and temperature while we used a DHT 11 sensor that incorporates both
    these sensors as one and helps reduce the overall cost and size of the equipment.
    Each of them is explained in detail below: 2.1.1. ESP32 The ESP32 family of systems
    on a-chip microcontrollers features dual-mode Bluetooth and integrated Wi-Fi and
    is cost-efficient and less power-consuming. ESP32 series uses Tensilica Xtensa
    LX7 dual-core The Tensilica Xtensa LX6 dual-core or single-core microprocessor,
    or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor, which also has integrated antenna switches,
    power amplifiers, filters,low-noise receive amplifiers, RF baluns, and power-management
    modules. ESP32 used is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (112KB)

    LDR sensor and a 10 kohm resistor). 2.1.2. DHT11 sensor The widely used DHT11
    temperature and humidity sensor consists of an exclusive NTC for temperature measurement
    and an 8-bit microprocessor which is used to output the temperature and humidity
    measurements as data which is serialized (Bai et al., 2017). 2.1.3. LDR sensor
    The most common uses for photoresistors, also known as light-dependent resistors
    (LDR), are expected to discern the presence or absence of light or to gauge the
    power of the light. When the LDR sensor is exposed to light, the resistance reduces
    rapidly, perhaps even to scant ohms, hinging on the light intensity. In the dark,
    their resistance is very elevated, often reaching 1 M. LDRs are non-sequential
    devices consisting of variable sensitivity depending on the wavelength of the
    input light. Although they are exploited in many applications, other gadgets like
    photodiodes and phototransistors frequently perform this light-sensing function.

    sensor (under implementation) In our current prototype of the IoT-based saffron
    system, we are enhancing its suitability for outdoor cultivation conditions by
    incorporating a soil moisture sensor. This addition will enable real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture levels, a critical parameter for optimizing saffron cultivation.
    By accurately assessing soil moisture content, our system can dynamically adjust
    irrigation schedules, ensuring that saffron plants receive adequate hydration
    while preventing overwatering or drought stress. This proactive approach not only
    enhances plant health and productivity but also promotes water conservation and
    sustainability in saffron farming practices. With the integration of the soil
    moisture sensor, our prototype aims to provide farmers with a robust tool for
    efficient and environmentally conscious saffron cultivation in outdoor settings.
    2.1.5. Google firebase Developers can use Firebase, the Google-sponsored app development
    platform, to create web apps, for Android and iOS. Firebase provides tools to
    trail analytics, report and resolve issues regarding applications, and create
    business and test products. Following are some of the benefits of using Google
    Firebase: Google Analytics for Firebase offers free, unlimited reporting for up
    to 500 different events. Analytics provides actionable data for iOS and Android
    app users to make better decisions and app marketing. Authentication with Firebase
    Authentication simplifies the onboarding and opt-in experience for users and makes
    it easier for developers to create secure authentication solutions. These features
    support email and password authentication, phone authentication, and access to
    Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, and more, providing a complete identity solution.
    Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a free, cross-platform messaging
    app that allows businesses to send and receive messages on iOS, Android, and the
    web. With Firebase Instant Database, a cloud-hosted NoSQL database, synchronization
    and storage of data between users can be done instantly between users. When the
    app is offline, it is still available because the device continues to connect
    to all users. Firebase and Crashlytics A real-time crash reporting tool called
    Crashlytics helps developers monitor, prioritize, and resolve security issues
    that make their applications vulnerable. their goods. With crash analysis, developers
    can focus more on building features for their applications rather than managing
    and troubleshooting crashes. Performance - Firebase Performance Monitoring Tools
    give developers information about the iOS and Android performance of their apps,
    allowing them to analyze where and how their apps are performing. When application
    performances can be improved. Developers can test iOS or Android apps on multiple
    connected devices in a single operation. They can view results, including screenshots,
    logs, and videos in the Firebase console. 2.1.6. ReactJS React is an open-source
    front-end JavaScript toolkit. It is used for creating user interfaces that are
    based on UI components. Sometimes it is known as React.js or ReactJS. Meta (previously
    Facebook) and a group of independent programmers and businesses are responsible
    for keeping it up-to-date. React can be the foundation for single-page, mobile,
    or server-rendered applications as it has similar frameworks like Next.js. React
    is only concerned with state management and presenting that information to the
    DOM that''s why creating React applications usually necessitates the use of extra
    libraries for routing and specific client-side functionality. 2.2. Application
    development 2.2.1. Application design The purpose of the application is to display
    and store real-time data, study the related objective, and help to improve on-field
    work. The designing of the application is done such that it is easy for even a
    layman to use and comprehend the application. Ease of user experience is made
    by using various UI/UX design methods such as providing white space and equal
    margin-padding to various components. Field testing is important for demonstrating
    the app in a live and demanding environment. As we move forward with our research,
    the next phase will focus on extensive field testing to validate the application''s
    performance in real-world scenarios, ensuring its effectiveness in practical on-field
    use. 2.2.2. Methodology The application is made using React JS, which is an open-source
    front-end JavaScript library used for developing user interfaces based on UI components.
    React can be exploited as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or
    server-rendered applications The structure of the appis shown in Fig. 3 The application
    is synced with a real-time Firebase database, from which the app gets data simultaneously
    and displays it on its interface. Firebase web APIs (application programming interface)
    are used to communicate between the application and server, as shown in Fig. 4

    The app is integrated with the sensors that need to be installed in the field
    and collects live data that the user can access through the app, unlike the existing
    apps that only have static elements (Dhanaraju et al., 2022). Using the live data
    and the data that have been collected, the app compares the live data with the
    optimal data and helps farmers adjust the conditions to maximize their yield.
    This app currently focuses on saffron, but it will later be generalized to help
    farmers predict which crops will be beneficial based on the live conditions of
    the soil and field. This way, production can be increased significantly. 2.2.3.

    3. Experimentation This experiment aims to validate the effectiveness of an IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system utilizing an ESP32 device. The experiment
    is conducted in a saffron cultivation environment, where the ESP32 device, equipped
    with sensors for monitoring temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture,
    is installed. These sensors are calibrated to ensure accurate measurement of environmental
    parameters crucial for saffron growth and development. The ESP32 device is configured
    to log sensor data at regular intervals, which is then analyzed by optimization
    algorithms to generate recommendations for optimizing environmental conditions
    based on saffron cultivation requirements. The experiment employs a randomized
    experimental layout with treatment and control groups. Treatment groups receive
    optimization recommendations generated by the IoT-based system, while control
    groups do not receive any intervention. Throughout a predetermined validation
    period, environmental parameters and saffron growth stages are monitored and recorded.
    Data analysis focuses on evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of the IoT-based
    system in providing monitoring and optimization recommendations. Preliminary results
    suggest that the IoT-based saffron monitoring and optimization system effectively
    monitors environmental parameters and generates timely optimization recommendations.
    Treatment groups receiving optimization recommendations demonstrate improved saffron
    growth and development compared to control groups, validating the system''s efficacy
    in enhancing saffron cultivation practices. This experiment contributes to the
    advancement of precision agriculture techniques in saffron cultivation, facilitating
    sustainable production and enhanced crop quality. Future research will aim to
    further refine the system''s algorithms and explore additional functionalities
    to optimize saffron cultivation under varying environmental conditions. 4. Future
    work In the next phase of our research, we plan to integrate a small pump into
    our existing IoT-based saffron monitoring and optimization system. This addition
    aims to automate irrigation by maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in the
    saffron cultivation plot. Our experimentation plan involves selecting a suitable
    pump, installing it in the cultivation plot, and calibrating it to deliver water
    based on soil moisture sensor readings. We will develop control algorithms to
    activate the pump when soil moisture falls below a predetermined threshold and
    integrate pump control functionalities into our IoT system. Through a series of
    experiments, we will validate the effectiveness of the integrated pump in promoting
    saffron growth and yield compared to manual irrigation methods. By automating
    irrigation based on real-time data, we aim to improve resource efficiency, enhance
    crop quality, and increase saffron productivity. 5. Results and discussions This
    study posits the conceptualization and realization of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based
    application designed for the surveillance and regulation of pivotal agronomic
    parameters, encompassing variables such as ambient temperature, relative humidity,
    and luminance levels. The overarching objective is to mitigate irrigation challenges
    while concurrently augmenting the cultivation practices of saffron. The resultant
    application, characterized by its intuitive and user-centric interface, harbors
    the capacity to bolster the qualitative and quantitative yield of saffron crops.
    A salient hallmark of this application is its capacity to amass and archive field-derived
    data, thus serving as a comprehensive repository that may be harnessed by researchers
    for investigative and multifarious purposes. Furthermore, the software is inherently
    adaptable, affording the ability to transition seamlessly from saffron cultivation
    to the cultivation of diverse exotic crops in prospective phases, although its
    current purview centers exclusively on saffron. The app is useful to index useful
    Luminous intensity, air moisture, and temperature data along with a radar for
    the optimum range criteria being met or not for a certain study interval. The
    paramount aim of this endeavor resides in the metamorphosis of conventional agricultural
    methodologies into the realm of smart farming, characterized by the judicious
    economization of both temporal and pecuniary resources for the agricultural community.
    A plausible extension of this initiative entails the infusion of IoT technologies
    within a controlled artificial environment, whereby scientific methodologies facilitate
    the cultivation of saffron and other crops within a smart agroecosystem, accompanied
    by rigorous performance assessment and analysis. The Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR) sensor, a pivotal component in the research, has furnished us with essential
    data. This data, meticulously analyzed and cross-referenced with existing research
    datasets, has played a pivotal role in ascertaining an appropriate environmental
    range conducive to saffron cultivation. Notably, this dataset has been instrumental
    in forecasting optimal growth periods. From a forward-looking perspective, this
    data serves as a foundational basis for the envisaged implementation of opaque
    light-restrictive structures. These structures are strategically designed to regulate
    luminous intensity, thus fine-tuning it to the precise threshold prescribed by
    our application for saffron cultivation. This orchestration ensures that the luminous
    conditions are maintained within the ideal spectrum conducive to saffron growth
    and development. 6. Conclusion The research and prototype have successfully demonstrated
    the integration of cutting-edge technology to address critical challenges in saffron
    cultivation. By developing an innovative mobile application integrated with sensors,
    a tool has been developed for saffron farmers to monitor and manage their crop’s
    temperature and humidity levels more effectively. This project has several key
    takeaways: 1. Resource Optimization: By monitoring saffron fields remotely through
    the mobile app, farmers can optimize resource usage, such as irrigation. This
    also contributes to sustainable farming practices, conserving water and energy.
    2. Data Collection and Analysis: Over time, the data collected through our system
    can serve as a valuable resource for research and analysis. Researchers and agronomists
    can access this data to gain insights into saffron cultivation trends, climate
    change impacts, and improved crop management strategies. 3. Enhanced Crop Management:
    The integration of sensors provides accurate and reliable data on temperature
    and humidity, two crucial factors in saffron cultivation. This data allows farmers
    to take timely actions to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on the crop. As
    a result, saffron cultivation becomes more resilient and efficient. In summary,
    this research and project have successfully addressed the challenges faced by
    saffron farmers by providing a reliable, user-friendly, and data-driven solution.
    By embracing the potential of IoT and mobile technology in agriculture, we have
    not only improved saffron crop management but also contributed to the broader
    goal of sustainable and efficient farming practices. This research paves the way
    for further innovation in precision agriculture and offers a promising outlook
    for the future of saffron cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    1. Introduction The frequent occurrences of red tides have had a significant impact
    on the marine ecological environment and human health in recent years (Chen et
    al., 2022b, Sakamoto et al., 2021). As a result, the public demand for mitigating
    the adverse effects of red tides has significantly increased (Patel, Lovko, &
    Lockey, 2020). To achieve this goal, detecting the HABs species that trigger red
    tides is critical to forecasting and prevention efforts. By identifying the specific
    species involved, targeted measures can be implemented to prevent and control
    red tides effectively (He, Shi, Geng, & Xu, 2022). In the real-time acquisition
    of HABs microscopic images, there are various kinds of algae in the seawater collected
    in each test tube, but only some of them are capable of triggering the red tide
    disaster, which we call the dominant algae species. The purpose of this paper
    is to identify and detect the dominant algal species that can cause red tide from
    a large number of algae, in order to prevent red tide in advance. However, due
    to the influence of light refraction and seawater impurities, algae are often
    degraded under high magnification microscope. Therefore, in this paper, we have
    also enhanced the microscopic images, which can be better applied to the subsequent
    classification process. At present, there are various automated identification
    methods for HABs, including liquid chromatography (Peris-Vicente et al., 2022),
    flow cytometry (Robinson, 2022), absorption spectroscopy (Chen et al., 2022a),
    fluorescence spectroscopy (Zeng et al., 2022), as well as methods based on BP
    neural networks and SVM (Liu et al., 2022a, Xi et al., 2022). However, these existing
    automated identification methods have limitations in recognizing blurry HABs images
    and demonstrate lower accuracy when identifying a limited species of HABs. When
    monitoring and predicting red tide outbreaks in marine engineering, real-time
    HABs images captured in the open ocean may experience degradation due to various
    factors such as water quality, illumination, and image extraction techniques.
    In recent years, the development of deep learning has led to the proposal of numerous
    image classification networks. However, when these methods are applied to the
    HABs datasets of this paper, the classification results may not always meet expectations.
    Consequently, it is crucial to enhance degraded HABs images and develop a highly
    accurate and efficient method for classifying HABs. To address the previously
    mentioned issues, we propose an image enhancement and HABs classification network
    (WFTC) for enhancing and classifying HABs images. The algorithm’s structure is
    depicted in Fig. 1. Firstly, we propose a novel cyclic white balance and three-image
    pyramid fusion method for enhancing degraded HABs images in the dataset. This
    step is intended to improve the overall quality of the HABs images in the dataset.
    Secondly, we propose an algorithm based on a dual-attention convolutional neural
    network and a Transformer encoder module to classify the enhanced HABs dataset.
    WFTC involves the following steps. Firstly, it extracts the features from the
    original HABs images using convolution and pooling operations. Next, it inputs
    the feature maps into two branches: branch one and branch two. In branch one,
    the algorithm applies the Transformer Encoder module to reorganize, interact,
    and integrate local features to produce a feature vector with global semantic
    information. In branch two, convolutional neural network and attention mechanism
    are used to extract deep features and highlight the critical features. Finally,
    the algorithm performs feature vector fusion using weighted fusion, followed by
    classification using the softmax function. The primary contributions of this paper
    are as follows: (1) We propose a cyclic white balance algorithm for the first
    time to correct the color deviation of HABs images. In addition, we introduce
    a HABs image enhancement method combining cyclic white balance and three-image
    pyramid fusion, which significantly enhances the contrast, edge, and texture features
    of degraded HABs images and improves the classification accuracy. (2) To reorganize,
    interact and integrate the local features of the feature map, we design the first
    branch of WFTC in conjunction with the Transformer Encoder module. This approach
    allows us to efficiently generate feature vectors with global feature information,
    thus improving the performance of the classification network. (3) Our proposed
    deep learning architecture leverages a combination of the Transformer Encoder
    module and attention-based convolutional neural networks, utilizing weighted feature
    fusion to improve HABs classification performance. Our approach yields significant
    improvements over existing methods by incorporating attention mechanisms and the
    Transformer Encoder’s ability to capture global image features. (4) Our extensive
    experiments on the 2020 Chinese offshore HABs real-world dataset show that WFTC
    outperforms some well-known deep learning networks, which is perfect for the challenging
    HABs classification task. Download : Download high-res image (93KB) Download :

    three inputs derived from the white-balanced version of the initial HABs image
    as the input for pyramid fusion. These inputs are fused using a multiscale fusion
    strategy to obtain an enhanced HABs image, which is then inputted into the HABs
    classification network for species identification. The novelty of our method lies
    in the cyclic white balance strategy applicable to correcting HABs images with
    various chromatic aberrations. Our specialized deep learning model for the HABs
    classification problem also achieves a high classification accuracy. The remainder
    of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review relevant existing
    approaches to underwater image enhancement/restoration and image classification.
    Section 3 details our proposed method for enhancing HABs images. Section 4 presents
    our HABs classification network design. In Section 5, we conduct a qualitative
    and quantitative analysis of our proposed HAB microscopic image enhancement method
    and the HAB classification network. Finally, Section 6 concludes the work of this
    paper. 2. Related work In this section, the first subsection primarily introduces
    the current state of domestic and international research on underwater image enhancement/restoration
    methods. The second subsection reviews some deep learning-based image classification
    algorithms. 2.1. Underwater image enhancement/restoration Recovering underwater
    images by building an underwater imaging model and estimating the background light
    and transmission map is known as underwater image restoration (Raveendran, Patil,
    & Birajdar, 2021). Zhou et al. (Zhou, Yang, Chu, & Zhang, 2022b) proposed a method
    to solve underwater images'' blurring and color degradation based on backward
    scattering pixels prior and eliminating color bias. Akkaynak et al. (Akkaynak
    & Treibitz, 2019) used the darkest pixels and their known range information to
    build an underwater image degradation model to recover the image by calculating
    the backscatter and the distance-dependent attenuation coefficients using estimates
    from spatially varying light sources. Hou (Hou, Pan, Wang, Yang, & Duan, 2019)
    et al. used the underwater dark channel prior (UDCP) combined with the quadratic
    tree segmentation algorithm to build an underwater image degradation model to
    recover the image. In contrast to underwater image restoration methods, underwater
    image enhancement does not require the consideration of a specific imaging model
    but directly employs image processing techniques to process the image. Zhou (Zhou,
    Zhang, & Zhang, 2022a) et al. proposed an underwater image enhancement method
    based on the fusion of multiple feature priors by extracting and fusing multiple
    feature priors of an underwater image, which removes the over-enhancement of the
    image and improves dark details. Pipara et al. (Pipara, Oza, & Mandal, 2021) designed
    a deep learning architecture consisting of an encoder and a decoder, which solved
    the underwater image color correction problem as an image coloring task and obtained
    relatively good results. Gao et al. (Gao, Zhang, Zhao, Zhang, & Li, 2019) proposed
    an underwater image enhancement model inspired by the morphology and function
    of the retina of scleractinian fish, which can better enhance the contrast and
    edge features of underwater images. 2.2. Image classification algorithm based
    on deep learning Our work involves three main research directions: convolutional
    neural nets with attention, Transformer Encoder modules, and multi-scale deep
    learning models. Here, we highlight some representative approaches closely related
    to our work. CNN with Attention: Attention has been widely used in many different
    forms to enhance feature representations. SENet (Hu, Shen, & Sun, 2018) used channel
    attention with CBAM (Wang, Fernandes, Zhu, & Zhang, 2021) to add spatial attention
    to feature maps to enhance their feature representation. ECANet (Wang, Wu, Zhu,
    Li, Zuo, & Hu, 2020) proposed a more efficient channel attention approach to improve
    SENet further. Many works in recent years have proposed deep learning models applicable
    to their research areas by combining CNNs with different self-attentiveness mechanisms
    (Bello, 2021, Guo et al., 2022, Pan et al., 2022, Ren et al., 2022, Srinivas et
    al., 2021, Zhao et al., 2020). BoTNet (Srinivas et al., 2021) replaced spatial
    convolution with global self-attention in the last three bottleneck blocks of
    ResNet, which enabled the model to achieve robust image classification performance
    in the ImageNet benchmark test. Transformer Encoder: Inspired by the success of
    Transformers in natural language processing (Vaswani, Shazeer, Parmar, Uszkoreit,
    Jones, Gomez, & Polosukhin, 2017), convolution-free models relying only on the
    Transformer layer are rapidly gaining popularity in computer vision. Vision Transformer
    (ViT) (Dosovitskiy, Beyer, Kolesnikov, Weissenborn, Zhai, Unterthiner, & Houlsby,
    2020) has successfully applied Transformer to the field of computer vision. Its
    accuracy in the field of image classification even surpasses CNN, and many variants
    of ViT have been proposed recently. Perceiver (Jaegle, Gimeno, Brock, Vinyals,
    Zisserman, & Carreira, 2021) utilizes an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively
    extract inputs into tight potential bottlenecks, allowing it to scale to handle
    huge inputs.T2T-ViT (Yuan, Chen, Wang, Yu, Shi, Jiang, & Yan, 2021) introduces
    a hierarchical Token-to-Token (T2T) transformation to encode the significant local
    structure of each token, instead of the plain tokenization used in ViT. Multi-Scale
    deep learning model: Multiscale feature representations have been used in CNNs
    for the detection and recognition of multiscale objects (Cai et al., 2016, Lin
    et al., 2017, Newell et al., 2016, Yang and Ramanan, 2015), as well as to accelerate
    neural networks in Big-Little Net (Chen, Fan, Mallinar, Sercu, & Feris, 2018)
    and OctNet (Chen, Fan, Xu, Yan, Kalantidis, Rohrbach, & Feng, 2019). bLVNet-TAM
    (Fan, Chen, Kuehne, Pistoia, & Cox, 2019) uses a two-branch multi-resolution architecture
    while learning temporal dependencies across frames. The Slow Fast Network (Feichtenhofer,
    Fan, Malik, & He, 2019) relies on a similar two-branch model, but each branch
    encodes a different frame rate instead of frames with different spatial resolutions.
    3. HABs image enhancement algorithm Our proposed HABs image enhancement algorithm
    consists of two primary steps. First, we apply the cyclic white balance to correct
    chromatic aberration in the images. Next, we use the image pyramid fusion algorithm
    to enhance contrast, edges, and texture features. 3.1. Cyclic white balance Most
    images in the HABs dataset in this study exhibit significant color deviation.
    In order to address this issue, several conventional image white balance algorithms,
    including Max RGB, Gray World, Shades of Grey, and Perfect Reflection, are applied
    to the HABs images. However, the results are generally unsatisfactory and fail
    to address the color bias problem fully. To overcome the shortcomings of these
    methods, we propose a novel cyclic white balance algorithm, which is based on
    the gray world algorithm and can effectively alleviate color deviation in HABs
    images. For instance, when dealing with biased blue HABs images with the loss
    of red and green channels, our cyclic white balance method is based on the following
    observations: (1) The average gray value of the red and green channels of the
    bluish HABs images is lower, while the blue channel has the highest mean grayscale
    values. (2) The blue channel contains the color information that is missing in
    the red and green channels. Therefore, using the blue channel, we can compensate
    for the red and green channels. (3) We observe that the compensation for the red
    channel should be proportionate to the difference between the average gray value
    of the blue channel and that of the red channel (notably, as the gray world algorithm
    assumes that all channels should have an equal average gray value before image
    decimation). A similar approach is employed for the compensation of the blue channel.
    In addition, our findings reveal that the difference in the average gray value
    between the blue and red channels indicates the degree of attenuation in the red
    and green channels. (4) We notice that the HABs images processed by the Gray World
    algorithm show red artifacts caused by overcompensation. To circumvent this issue,
    we propose applying for compensation only to areas where the red and green channels
    experience significant degradation. Conversely, compensation is unnecessary when
    the original red and green channels possess high gray values. (5) As the degree
    of attenuation in the red and green channels varies across different HABs images,
    we cannot determine a single optimal compensation parameter for all degraded images.
    To overcome this issue, we introduce a novel cyclic compensation strategy. Our
    findings indicate that a cyclic compensation number of 3 yields favorable outcomes
    and effectively compensates for various biased images. To account for the above
    observations, we express the compensated red channel at each pixel point (x) as
    follows: (1) Where , denotes the red and blue channels of the image I, the values
    of , are in the interval [0,1], and this range is a linearly normalized representation
    of the grayscale values of the RGB channels. , denotes the average values of ,
    . In Eq. (1), the second term successfully solves the problem mentioned in the
    above observation, where is the compensation factor. After conducting several
    experimental tests, we observe that the value of has a significant impact on the
    value of , affecting the optimal compensation effect. Based on our findings, we
    determine that the optimal value of is as follows: (2) Similarly, we express the
    compensated green channel at each pixel point (x) as follows: (3) Where denotes
    the green channel of image I, the value of is in the interval [0,1], and represents
    the average value of . The difference with Eq. (1) is the value of , we find that
    the value of has a significant impact on the value of , affecting the optimal
    compensation effect. Based on our findings, we determine that the optimal value
    of is as follows: (4) Based on the results presented in Fig. 2, we observe that
    traditional white balance methods are generally less effective at eliminating
    color deviations. In fact, the Gray World algorithm generates red artifacts, and
    the Shades of Grey algorithm accentuates color deviation. While Max RGB can mitigate
    color deviation to a certain extent, it brightens the overall image. In contrast,
    our proposed method effectively overcomes these issues. Download : Download high-res

    using Eq. (1). Bottom row from left to right: several well-known white balance
    methods (Max RGB, Gray World, Shades of Grey, Perfect Reflection) and HABs image

    white balance method can improve HABs images with various chromatic aberrations
    exceptionally well. However, the cyclic white balance algorithm cannot enhance
    the edge and texture features of the images. Therefore, in the next subsection,
    we propose a method based on the pyramid fusion of three images that relies on
    sharpening and correcting the contrast to solve the blurring problem of white-balanced
    images. Download : Download high-res image (202KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. HABs images with color bias and their results after processing by
    our cyclic white balance algorithm. 3.2. Image pyramids blending process In this
    section, we present an algorithm for enhancing HABs images based on the image
    pyramid technique and multi-scale fusion. The proposed method aims to enhance
    the contrast, edge, and texture features of HABs images. Initially, three distinct
    methods are utilized to create three input images from the white balance versions
    of the original HABs images. Next, associated weight maps are defined for each
    input image, these weight maps are then fused and normalized using multi-scale
    fusion to produce the normalized weight maps. Finally, the three input images
    and their respective normalized weight maps are fed into the image pyramid for
    fusion, resulting in the final enhanced HABs images. 3.2.1. Input images for blending
    process To improve the contrast of HABs images, we initially utilize contrast-limited
    adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) on white balance images to obtain Input1.
    However, after conducting extensive experiments, we discover that CLAHE does not
    effectively distinguish between algae and their backgrounds. As a result, we introduce
    Input2, a white balance-based global histogram stretching (RGHS) (Huang, Wang,
    Song, Sequeira, & Mavromatis, 2018) version, to complement Input1 and enhance
    the overall contrast of the HABs images. While input1 and input2 effectively enhance
    the contrast of HABs images, this process leads to a decrease in details in underexposed
    or overexposed areas, resulting in an undesirable blurring effect. To address
    the loss of detail caused by the contrast enhancement process, we compensate by
    processing the white balance image using an unsharpening mask, which resultes
    in Input3. A typical formula for the unsharpening mask can be defined as sharpening
    the image as: (5) Where I is the white balance image, G*I is the image obtained
    after I is Gaussian filtered, and β is the correction parameter. After conducting
    extensive experiments, we find that the sharpening effect of the white balance
    image is best when β is taken as 9. 3.2.2. Weight maps of input images In order
    to highlight the main features of the HABs images, we define the correlation weight
    maps of the three input images. Specifically, we utilize three weights: Canny
    weights, Butterworth weights, and Gamma weights. Canny weight ( ): To enhance
    the edge features of the HABs images, we apply the Canny operator to the RGB channel
    of the inputs, resulting in the Canny weights. Although the Canny operator successfully
    enhances the edges, it overlooks the HABs images’ texture features. To compensate
    for this, we introduce a second weight, known as the Butterworth weight, to enhance
    the texture features of the HABs images. By combining the Canny and Butterworth
    weights, we create a more balanced approach to enhancing the edge and texture
    features of the HABs images. Butterworth weight ( ): is obtained by applying Butterworth
    high-pass filtering to the input, which is used to highlight the high-frequency
    details in the image. Because of this advantage, we can make good use of Butterworth
    high-pass filtering to compensate for the deficiency of in capturing texture features.
    Gamma weights ( ): The preceding two weights effectively enhance the edge and
    texture features of the HABs images. However, they have limited ability to improve
    the image’s overall appearance. To further enhance image contrast, we introduce
    the gamma weight. The inputs undergo gamma correction, and the resulting weights
    effectively emphasize the primary image target and suppress the image background.
    As a result, image quality is further improved. For each input k, we calculate
    the sum of its three associated weights to obtain the combined weight . After
    that, we obtain the normalized weight for each input using the following equation:
    (6) The value of K = 3 indicates three inputs, while is a regularization term
    that is used to ensure that each input has its corresponding normalized weight.
    Based on numerous experiments, the optimal enhancement is achieved when is set
    to 0.6. As illustrated in Fig. 4, the association weights for each input and their
    normalized weights are depicted. Download : Download high-res image (462KB) Download

    image. Each input is depicted on the right side along with its respective three
    correlation weight maps and normalized weight map. The right-most image is our
    result. 3.2.3. Fusion process The proposed fusion algorithm in this paper is based
    on the Laplacian pyramid and Gaussian pyramid. First, we decompose each input
    and its normalized weight into different spatial bands through the Gaussian pyramid
    and independently fuse the inputs and their weights for each band. Subsequently,
    we perform a sequence of upsampling/downsampling operations on the fused images
    on different frequency bands to attain uniform sizes for all images. Finally,
    we employ the multi-scale fusion strategy to merge the images on all frequency
    bands. The framework of the HABs image enhancement algorithm can be visualized
    in Fig. 5. Download : Download high-res image (394KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Detailed process of the proposed HABs image enhancement method.
    After decomposing the input into different frequency bands, we observe that the
    Gaussian pyramid would likely lose some high-frequency information. To address
    this issue, we use the Laplace pyramid algorithm to preserve the high-frequency
    information of the images. Specifically, we compute the difference between an
    upsampled version of each layer in the Gaussian pyramid and the image of its next
    layer. Then, we perform Gaussian convolution on these different images to derive
    a series of Laplacian pyramid decomposed images. We define our N-layer image pyramid
    as follows: (7) Where (l = 1, 2, …, N) denotes the lth Gaussian pyramid, and denotes
    the lth Laplace pyramid. In Eq. (7), all the images are upsampled to the same
    size as image I. In the fusion process of each layer l, we perform the following
    operations: (8) Where denotes the fused image of the lth layer (in our experiments,
    l = 4). First, we upsample all fused images in each layer to match the size of
    the original image. Next, we sum up these images to obtain the enhanced image.
    As shown in Fig. 4, the white balance images processed using the image pyramid
    blending algorithm proposed in this paper exhibit considerable improvements in
    contrast and significantly enhance edge and texture features. The whole image
    pyramid blending algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1. In Algorithm 1, Input
    3 comes from Eq. (3), step 6 is based on Eq. (4), and the fused images of each
    layer are calculated using Eq. (7). Algorithm 1: HABs Image Enhancement. Input:

    Fig. 6 depicts the structure of the HABs image classification network. We denote
    the enhanced HABs image as X∈RH X W X B. H, W, and B represent the height, width,
    and number of channels of the image, respectively. We begin by applying convolutional
    and pooling operations to the enhanced HABs image to extract its underlying features.
    These features are used as the input for the subsequent network. The Transformer
    Encoder module is then used to reorganize, interact, and integrate the input local
    feature information, generating a feature vector representation with global semantic
    details that serves as the first branch of our classification network. We then
    combine a convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism to construct
    the second branch of the network. Finally, we perform weighted feature fusion
    on these two branches and predict the class of the HABs image using an FC layer
    and softmax classifier. Our deep learning model comprises seven primary modules,
    which we will elaborate on in detail in the following sections. Download : Download
    high-res image (354KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. The framework
    of the WFTC model. This model is mainly divided into seven parts: Convolution-Pooling
    Module 1 (CPM1), Convolution-Pooling Module 2 (CPM2), Transformer Encoder Module,
    Convolution-Attention Module (ConvAM), FC Layer, Weighted Feature Fusion Module,
    and Softmax Layer. 4.1. Convolution-pooling module As we notice from Fig. 6, WFTC
    uses two Convolution-Pooling Modules (CPM). CPM1 is designed to extract the basic
    features of the HABs images, which are used as the input of Branch 1 and Branch
    2. CPM2 further convolves the to extract deeper features, and the output is fed
    to the ConvAM. Each CPM has the following structure: a convolutional layer, a
    Batch Normalization (BN) layer, a LeakyReLU activation function, and a Max Pooling
    layer. The Max-Pooling layer is used to compress the feature map and reduce the
    h and w of the feature map after each operation. After each convolution operation,
    we apply a BN layer and a LeakyReLU activation function. Specifically, we input
    the enhanced HABs images Xh,w,b to CPM1, and the expression of the convolution
    operation of this layer is as follows: (9) Where denotes the output feature map,
    h, w, and m denotes the length, width, and number of channels, respectively. denotes
    the convolution kernel of the input feature map with row i, column j, and channel
    number b, and m represents the number of convolution kernels. BN represents the
    BN layer, and represents the LeakyRelu activation function. In Eq. (9), we use
    the LeakyReLU activation function instead of the traditional ReLU activation function
    to train the network more stably and prevent overfitting. Our proposed WFTC model
    is not pre-trained and is trained directly on our HABs dataset from scratch. Due
    to the small scale of our dataset, training from scratch can easily lead to overfitting.
    We add a BN layer and a LeakyReLU activation function after each convolution operation
    to accelerate convergence and avoid overfitting. 4.2. Transformer encoder module
    First, we divide the feature map (where the height and width values are 58 and
    the channel value is 128) into multiple patches. Each patch has a size of 4×4×128
    (a total of 196 patches). Next, we project these patches into fixed-length feature
    vectors of size 1×1×2048 using linear projection. We refer to these feature vectors
    as tokens, of which we have 197 (including one initialized header token). We use
    the header token to store and integrate the features of the other 196 tokens.
    Finally, we feed these 197 tokens into the Transformer Encoder Module to obtain
    a feature vector that stores all the features extracted from the input . The Transformer
    Encoder Module comprises a series of blocks, each containing a Multi-headed Self-Attention
    (MSA) module followed by a Feedforward Network (FFN) module. The FFN consists
    of a two-layer multilayer perceptron with a hidden layer expansion ratio of r.
    A GELU activation function is added after linearizing the first layer to increase
    nonlinearity. We apply layer normalization (LN) before each block and use residual
    connections afterward. The input x0 of the Transformer Encoder Module is processed
    by the kth block as follows: (10) Where ∈R1 X C and ∈N X C denotes the header
    token and the token transformed from patches, respectively. ∈R (1+N) X C denotes
    the positional embedding (N and C denote the number of patches and the dimensionality
    of each patch, respectively). After obtaining the input x0, we can obtain the
    output feature map processed by Transformer Encoder Module using the following
    equation: (11) Where f ( ), and g ( ) denote the projection and inverse projection
    functions of the alignment dimension, respectively. 4.3. Convolution-attention
    module In the context of limited computational power, an attention mechanism is
    a critical tool for solving the problem of information overload. The attention
    mechanism can allocate limited computational resources to more critical tasks,
    allowing the neural network to focus on a subset of its inputs or features (Luo
    & Zhang, 2022). Taking inspiration from this, we use the feature map with in-depth
    features as input to ConvAM to highlight the main features of HABs images. ConvAM
    uses two attention modules: the Position Attention Module (PAM) and the Channel
    Attention Module (CAM). These modules are used serially in this paper. Specifically,
    PAM interacts and integrates feature information at different locations on the
    feature map, enhancing the feature representation. On the other hand, CAM assigns
    different weights to different channels to identify channels containing important
    feature information during the training process and assigns higher weights to
    them. Position Attention Module: As shown in Fig. 7(a), the first step involves
    convolving the feature map to create two new feature maps, A and B, where {A,
    B}∈RH X W X C. We rescale the dimensions of A, B to RN X C, where N is the total
    number of feature pixels of . Then, we perform matrix multiplication between matrix
    A and matrix B after transposition and then use the softmax function to calculate
    the location attention weight map ∈RN X N as shown in the following equation:
    (12) Where represents the degree of influence of the ith position on the jth position.
    remains unchanged in terms of shape and number of feature pixels after being processed
    by PAM, and the values in the matrix belong in the range (0, 1) and indicate the
    importance of each position. Similarly, we obtain the feature map C after convolution
    and matrix multiply it with and reshape the result as RH X W X C. Additionally,
    to accentuate the primary features of the feature map and preserve the information
    of the original feature map, we multiply the weighted feature map with a learnable
    scale parameter . Finally, we add it with the initial feature map to obtain the
    output feature map represented by the following equation: (13) Channel Attention
    Module: In contrast to PAM, CAM concentrates on each channel''s significance within
    the feature map. By computing the importance of each channel, CAM reduces the
    dimensionality of the feature map and its computational complexity while refining
    the associated weights. As depicted in Fig. 7(b), we directly calculate the channel
    attention map ∈RC X C from the input feature map a, which the following equation
    can represent: (14) Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. The Position Attention Module and Channel Attention Module
    are specifically represented. Conv denotes the convolutional layer, , denotes
    the attention weight matrix, denotes matrix multiplication, and denotes matrix
    addition. Similar to PAM, the resulting feature map at the output of CAM can be
    expressed as follows: (15) Where is similar to in Eq. (12) and is also a learnable
    scale parameter with the same role as . The connections between each attention
    layer and input feature map are shown in Fig. 7 through the residual structure.
    The residual structure works to retain original feature map information and highlight
    essential feature information. To derive more profound and pertinent feature information,
    we employ a serial structure instead of a parallel structure in both our PAM and
    CAM. By utilizing these two attention structures, we amplify the expressiveness
    of convolutional layers, resulting in the more effective classification of HABs
    images. As shown in Fig. 6, we first downsample the feature map to match the dimensions
    of feature map so that the residual structure can calculate matrix summation.
    The specific mathematical representation of this residual structure is as follows:
    (16) Where Conv denotes a 1×1 convolution with 128 channels, we prioritize the
    primary features through the residual structure while retaining all other features
    to achieve optimal classification results. 4.4. Fully connected (FC)-layers The
    feature vector from Branch 1 is 1×1×2048, while the feature map from Branch 2
    is 28×28×128. To achieve the weighted fusion of these two features, we introduce
    FC layers to process into a feature vector of size 1×1×2048. The FC layer consists
    of three modules: the flattened layer, the LeakyRelu activation function, and
    the dropout layer. In our method, we set the dropout to 0.5. 4.5. Weighted feature
    fusion and classification The feature map output from Branch 2 is processed by
    the FC layer and converted into a feature vector , the same size as the feature
    vector obtained from Branch 1. We employ a weighted feature fusion to combine
    the two feature vectors. To perform the fusion, we utilize the following equation:
    (17) Where denotes the feature vector after fusion, we assign different fusion
    coefficients to the two branches to achieve different degrees of scaling. For
    the fusion coefficients, we set  = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 to investigate
    the effect of on the experimental results. As shown in Fig. 8, the highest accuracy
    is reached when  = 0.6, so we set the fusion coefficient to 0.6. Download : Download

    performance of WFTC with different fusion coefficients on the HABs data set of
    this paper. To train our WFTC model, we use the cross-entropy loss function, which
    is expressed as follows: (18) Where N and M denote the total number of samples
    and the number of categories in the training data set, respectively, and is a
    symbolic function (0 or 1) that takes 1 if the actual category of sample i is
    equal to c and 0 otherwise. denotes the predicted probability that the observed
    sample i belongs to category c, which is calculated by the Softmax function in

    algorithm with several existing underwater image enhancement algorithms. We evaluate
    the enhanced images generated by different methods using qualitative and quantitative
    evaluation metrics. Additionally, we compare the proposed WFTC model with other
    well-known classification networks such as ResNet-50 (He, Zhang, Ren, & Sun, 2016),
    VGG16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014), ViT, MobileNetV2 (Howard, Zhu, Chen, Kalenichenko,
    Wang, Weyand, & Adam, 2017), MobileViT (Mehta & Rastegari, 2021), and ConvNet
    (Liu et al., 2022b). We perform convergence analysis on the WFTC model and conduct
    ablation experiments to validate the role of each module. Our experimental results
    indicate that the proposed HABs image enhancement algorithm can effectively improve
    the contrast, edge, and texture features of HABs images, leading to improved classification
    accuracy. Moreover, on our HABs dataset, the proposed WFTC model achieves the
    highest classification accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art classification
    networks. 5.1. HABs microscopic image enhancement evaluation Our experiments are
    conducted on six representative HABs images from six species that suffer from
    chromatic aberrations, blurred edges, and textures. These images, shown in the
    leftmost column of Fig. 9, are referred to as experimental images. We apply several
    underwater image enhancement/restoration methods to the experimental images, including
    UCM (Saleh, Sheaves, Jerry, & Azghadi, 2022), ICM (Daway & Daway, 2019), ULAP
    (Song, Wang, Huang, & Tjondronegoro, 2018), DCP, CLAHE, GC, MIP (Liu, Rong, Cao,
    Li, & He, 2020), and Ancuti et al. (Ancuti, Ancuti, De Vleeschouwer, & Bekaert,
    2017). We also compare these methods with the HABs image enhancement method proposed
    in this paper to validate its effectiveness. Download : Download high-res image

    underwater image enhancement methods (UCM, ICM, ULAP, DCP, CLAHE, GC, MIP, and
    Ancuti et al.). The relevant evaluation metrics for these images are shown in
    Table 2. Fig. 9 displays the resulting images obtained by applying various well-known
    underwater image enhancement/restoration methods to the experimental images. Table
    2 provides the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of these images using the
    advanced evaluation metrics mentioned earlier. Our observations indicate that
    most of the existing underwater image enhancement/restoration methods fail to
    enhance the images’ edge and texture features while eliminating chromatic aberrations.
    Among these methods, UCM, DCP, CLAHE, and Ancuti et al. enhance the edge and texture
    features of the image to a certain extent, but they also enlarge the chromatic
    aberration of the image. Conversely, ICM, GC, and MIP do not improve the image’s
    edge and texture features, though they can reduce the chromatic aberration of
    the image. In contrast, the proposed HABs image enhancement method in this paper
    not only significantly eliminates chromatic aberration but also greatly enhances
    the edge and texture features of the images. Table 2. HABs image enhancement based
    on Entropy, Contrast, Average gradient, EME, EMEE, and MSSIM metrics are evaluated,

    0.413 0.945 Our method 6.281 52.011 8.449 5.273 0.588 0.702 To evaluate the performance
    of these methods, we choose six advanced evaluation metrics, namely information
    entropy (Entropy), image contrast (Contrast), Average gradient, enhanced measurement
    element (EME), enhanced measured entropy element (EMEE), and mean structural similarity
    mean (MSSIM). Information entropy is used to measure the amount of information
    contained in an image, Contrast to measure the image’s contrast, and Average gradient
    to measure the edge, texture features, and sharpness of the image. EME and EMEE
    evaluate the image enhancement effectiveness. MSSIM is used to measure the similarity
    between the enhanced and original images, where a higher value closer to 1 indicates
    a higher similarity. According to Table 2, the experimental images processed by
    our method achieve the highest values in Entropy, Contrast, Average gradient,
    EME, and EMEE metrics. However, we also find that the images enhanced by our method
    have the lowest values in the MSSIM metrics because MSSIM represents the degree
    of image similarity, which is closely related to the similarity of the original
    image. We aim to enhance the original image''s contrast, edge, and texture features,
    so the resulting image is bound to have some deviation from the original image.
    We introduce the MSSIM metric to evaluate whether the enhanced image is distorted
    (an image is considered distorted when the value of MSSIM is less than 0.4). Notably,
    the MSSIM values of the microscopic images of HABs enhanced by the method proposed
    in this paper are all above 0.7, indicating that our resultant images largely
    retain the original images'' main features. In summary, the HABs microscopic image
    enhancement method proposed in this paper usually produces good visual sensory
    quality while enhancing the images'' contrast, edge, and texture features to a
    large extent. 5.2. WFTC model evaluation In this section, we describe the dataset
    used for the experiments, the experimental setup, and the experimental results.
    Then, we analyze the convergence of the WFTC model. Finally, we explain the role
    of each module of the WFTC model using ablation experiments. 5.2.1. Data description
    Given the unavailability of a publicly accessible dataset of HABs, this paper
    utilizes the HABs dataset sourced from HABs measurement data collected offshore
    of China in 2020. The resulting dataset consists of 36 unique HABs categories
    and approximately 600 images. We partition the HABs images into training and validation
    sets in a 7:3 ratio to evaluate the model. The training set contains roughly 400
    images, and the validation set includes approximately 200. 5.2.2. Experimental
    settings To optimize the performance of our WFTC model, we conduct fine-tuning
    of the model parameters during implementation. Table 3 provides a detailed breakdown
    of these parameters. Given the limited size of our dataset, we utilize an SGD
    optimizer to mitigate the risks of overfitting. Our deep learning model is developed
    using Python 3.7 and Pytorch 1.9.0. The training is undertaken with an i7-8750H
    CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU. Table 3. Details of the parameter settings

    To assess the performance of WFTC, we compare it with various classical and advanced
    classification networks, namely VGG16, Mobilenet, Resnet50, Resnet50_CABM, ViT,
    MobileViT, and ConvNet. We leverage multiple evaluation metrics to assess the
    qualitative and quantitative performance of these networks, including Top-1 Accuracy
    (Top-1 Acc.), Macro Precision (P_macro), Macro Recall (R_macro), Macro F1-score
    (F_macro), Kappa coefficient, train time, and test time. Macro metrics measure
    the performance of each category separately in a classification task with multiple
    classes and then obtain the average. The Kappa coefficient, commonly used for
    multi-classification tasks, quantifies the difference between classifier accuracy
    and random assignment. The following are the definitions of some of the evaluation
    metrics: (19) Where C denotes the number of HABs categories, TPc, FPc, and FNc
    represent true positives, false positives, and false negatives of category c,
    respectively. Table 5 displays the evaluation metrics for the classification networks
    mentioned above, as applied to our HABs dataset. Table 5. Comparison results obtained

    classification networks we compare perform poorly across all evaluation metrics.
    This poor performance can be attributed to the small size of our HABs dataset,
    which may lead to uneven data distribution. Resnet50, Resnet50_CABM, and ConvNet
    achieve relatively poor results due to overfitting. While ViT and MobileViT are
    computationally less expensive, their lower accuracy rates need careful consideration.
    Although MobileNet and VGG16 achieve about 80 % classification accuracy, the method
    in this paper improves by 7 % in accuracy over these two classification networks.
    The improvement in accuracy is important for the fine classification of algae,
    especially for Horned Trichoderma. Meanwhile, WFCG also shows better results than
    MobileNet with VGG16 in terms of training time and testing time. Our proposed
    WFTC model, in contrast, outperformes other methods in terms of accuracy and other
    evaluation metrics, demonstrating more excellent stability and suitability for
    the HABs classification task. 5.2.4. Convergence analysis This subsection presents
    a comprehensive analysis of the convergence of our proposed WFTC model on the
    HABs dataset, as depicted in Fig. 10. Download : Download high-res image (187KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Model accuracy (a) and loss (b) curves
    of the WFTC model for each epoch on our HABs dataset. To assess the stability
    of our model, we conduct 1000 training runs on the WFTC model and graphically
    present the complete data set. Due to the magnitude of the data, we smooth the
    model’s accuracy and loss curves. As Fig. 10 demonstrates, the variance between
    the accuracy and loss of the training set and validation set is minimal, indicating
    that our proposed WFTC model effectively avoids the overfitting dilemma. Moreover,
    after training it for 1000 epochs, we discover that the WFTC model attains convergence
    on the HABs dataset and exhibits a special fitting effect. In conclusion, the
    WFTC model can be used well to predict HABs images. 5.2.5. Ablative analysis In
    this subsection, we perform an ablation analysis of our proposed method on the
    HABs dataset presented in this paper. Specifically, we investigate the impact
    of the Convolution-Attention Module, the Transformer Encoder Module, and their
    combination on classification accuracy. To achieve this, we employ the Top-1 Accuracy
    (%) metric, as tabulated in Table 5, to evaluate the performance of each module
    individually and in combination. By conducting this comprehensive ablation study,
    we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the contribution of each module to our
    overall method and identify potential areas for improvement. By observing the
    results in Table 6, we find that the combination of the Convolution-Attention
    and Transformer Encoder modules is better than using each module alone, which
    indicates that the contributions of these two modules are complementary. In addition,
    we also find that the PAM module used in parallel with the CAM module is less
    effective than the serial use, which may be due to the conflict between them,
    resulting in mutual interference affecting the classification accuracy. Table

    algorithm on experimental results In this section, firstly, we present the positive
    impact of the enhancement algorithm on the classification results. Then, we processed
    the image segmentation of the original HABs dataset as well as the enhanced dataset
    using the Unext network and visualized and analyzed the segmentation results as
    well as evaluated the parameters. Finally, we verified that image segmentation
    can improve the accuracy of image classification. 5.3.1. Impact of enhancement
    algorithm on classification results To validate that the HABs image enhancement
    algorithm proposed in this paper helps improve the classification accuracy of
    HABs, we compared the HABs dataset enhanced by the image enhancement algorithm
    with the original dataset. We used the evaluation metrics mentioned in 5.2.3 to
    evaluate the classification accuracy of both datasets. According to Table 7, the
    dataset enhanced by the HABs image enhancement algorithm proposed in this paper
    demonstrates superior performance across all evaluation metrics compared to the
    original dataset. This advantage is not only observed in the WFTC, but also extends
    to several well-known classification networks. In summary, the image enhancement
    algorithm proposed in this paper yields improved classification results for the
    HABs dataset. Table 7. Comparison results of the enhanced dataset with the original

    5.3.2. Image segmentation process In performing HABs microscopic image classification,
    the background information may be the interference point for the classification
    of HABs. Through image segmentation, HABs can be separated from the background
    and only focus on the target region, which in turn improves the accuracy of HABs
    classification. In this subsection, firstly, we used the Unext (Valanarasu & Patel,
    2022) network to perform image segmentation on our HABs dataset as well as the
    enhanced HABs dataset, and then compared the classification effect of the segmented
    image dataset as well as the original HABs dataset by using the WFTC network proposed
    in this paper. Fig. 11 shows the visualization and analysis results of our experimental
    images. Download : Download high-res image (562KB) Download : Download full-size

    segmentation network to evaluate the effectiveness of the enhanced HABs dataset.
    From left to right: the original HABs image, the segmentation result of the original
    HABs image, the enhanced HABs image using the image enhancement algorithm in this
    paper, and the segmentation result of the enhanced image. Through Fig. 11 we can
    find that the enhanced HABs dataset tends to be segmented more accurately and
    shows more details after image segmentation compared to the original HABs dataset
    (an important manifestation is that the flagellar features of the algal cells
    are also segmented). In order to verify that the HABs dataset after image segmentation
    processing helps to improve the classification accuracy of HABs, we compared the
    original HABs dataset, the dataset enhanced with the image enhancement algorithm
    proposed in this paper, the dataset processed with the original HABs dataset using
    the Unext image segmentation network, and the dataset processed with the enhanced
    dataset using the Unext image segmentation network using the WFTC network. Similarly,
    we use the evaluation metrics mentioned in 5.2.3 to evaluate the classification
    accuracy of the two datasets. As shown in Table 8, the HABs dataset processed
    by the Unext network exhibits superior performance in all evaluation metrics compared
    to the dataset without image segmentation processing. Meanwhile, the segmented
    dataset of HABs processed by the image enhancement algorithm proposed in this
    paper exhibits the highest classification accuracy. Table 8. Comparison results

    enhancement algorithm for preprocessing low-quality, degraded images in the original
    HABs dataset to enhance the quality of the HABs dataset. Then, we design the WFTC
    model to classify the HABs. On our HABs dataset, we qualitatively and quantitatively
    evaluate the proposed HABs image enhancement algorithm and the WFTC model. The
    evaluation results show that our proposed HABs image enhancement algorithm can
    significantly enhance images'' contrast, edge, and texture features and effectively
    correct color chromatic aberrations, thus making an essential contribution to
    improving classification accuracy. Compared with some well-known classification
    networks, our proposed WFTC model has better classification results and the best
    performance in the HABs classification task. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The
    study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center
    in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and
    32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical
    humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively,
    and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid
    (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018,
    the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight
    rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk
    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification
    of their suitability and an exposition of their main features. Then, is discussed
    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components
    description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared
    Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading
    of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV).
    For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or
    surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of
    with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical
    current of . The maximum battery voltage during charging is , and the minimum

    sensors, GPS receiver and server in the center pivot. The wireless GPS node in
    the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12
    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used
    to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined
    using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface
    pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral
    to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to
    the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal
    distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance
    from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path
    length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical

    angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal
    plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately
    of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface. Fig. 4 specifies the

    with an accuracy of 1–100 cm using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in
    the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three
    variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator

    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance

    battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor
    body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of
    canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes
    of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation
    (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The
    keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT

    a new dynamic center point . This location changes during the pivot movement,
    adding −90 degrees to the center pivot angle according to Fig. 4. 3. Results and

    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    1461.11 According to the University of Georgia’s crop production budget [76],
    a center pivot irrigation system can consume diesel and electricity per every

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

  description: This article delineates the design and deployment of an innovative
    real-time water quality monitoring system tailored for rural regions, focusing
    on monitoring the water resource quality parameters. We propose a solar-powered,
    waterproof, portable, and Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled solution that leverages
    Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology. Central to this system is a
    sophisticated LoRa node outfitted with an array of sensors for capturing key water
    parameters, such as pH, total dissolved solids, turbidity and temperature. A conjunction
    of an Arduino microcontroller-based board and a LoRa shield facilitates real-time
    data capture and transmission to a LoRaWAN gateway. The acquired data is transmitted
    to The Things Network server, which is seamlessly integrated with a ThingSpeak
    web-based IoT server and ThingView mobile applications. We incorporate a solar
    cell with a solar shield to ensure sustainable energy provision for powering the
    entire system through a rechargeable battery. This allows users to access vital
    water quality information online simultaneously and continuously in real-time.
    As a testament to its robustness, the system was empirically tested at Gambang
    Lake to demonstrate its effectiveness, functionality, buoyancy, and waterproof
    capabilities. We further validated the results by comparing them with laboratory
    sample analysis findings. Experimental evaluations confirmed the system's reliability,
    as evidenced by the strong agreement between the water conditions measured using
    our solution and those obtained from laboratory instruments. Moreover, our system
    efficiently and remotely updated data across multiple IoT platforms using the
    LoRa radio interface over the LoRaWAN gateway.

    and deployment of an innovative real-time water quality monitoring system tailored
    for rural regions, focusing on monitoring the water resource quality parameters.
    We propose a solar-powered, waterproof, portable, and Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled
    solution that leverages Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) technology. Central
    to this system is a sophisticated LoRa node outfitted with an array of sensors
    for capturing key water parameters, such as pH, total dissolved solids, turbidity
    and temperature. A conjunction of an Arduino microcontroller-based board and a
    LoRa shield facilitates real-time data capture and transmission to a LoRaWAN gateway.
    The acquired data is transmitted to The Things Network server, which is seamlessly
    integrated with a ThingSpeak web-based IoT server and ThingView mobile applications.
    We incorporate a solar cell with a solar shield to ensure sustainable energy provision
    for powering the entire system through a rechargeable battery. This allows users
    to access vital water quality information online simultaneously and continuously
    in real-time. As a testament to its robustness, the system was empirically tested
    at Gambang Lake to demonstrate its effectiveness, functionality, buoyancy, and
    waterproof capabilities. We further validated the results by comparing them with
    laboratory sample analysis findings. Experimental evaluations confirmed the system''s
    reliability, as evidenced by the strong agreement between the water conditions
    measured using our solution and those obtained from laboratory instruments. Moreover,
    our system efficiently and remotely updated data across multiple IoT platforms
    using the LoRa radio interface over the LoRaWAN gateway. Graphical abstract Download

    Quality Monitoring 1. Introduction Clean water is an essential resource that is
    required for life sustainability, and the quality of drinking water plays a major
    role in the well-being and health of human beings (Cloete et al., 2016, Zhao et
    al., 2022). However, the water sources available in rural areas for taps at urban
    houses and water supplies are not always safe to drink. Currently, water quality
    degradation and pollution problems are ascribed to a variety of sources and cause
    resulting from urbanization, industry, and over-exploitation of natural resources
    (Osman et al., 2018). Although it is the responsibility of the water authorities
    to guarantee that clean water is supplied to its nations, the clean water supply
    is strained by ageing infrastructures that are inadequately maintained and continuing
    population growth (Boccadoro et al., 2022). Hence, the water quality must be constantly
    monitored, and immediate action can be taken to maintain water quality, especially
    in rural areas. Water quality may be characterized by its broad composition of
    water-based properties, which includes physical, chemical, and biological features
    (parameters) (Caeiro and Martins, 2021, Zhang and Thorburn, 2022). These characteristics
    are crucial for monitoring water quality because it is used in daily activities,
    such as drinking, bathing, cooking, and other human tasks, such as agriculture,
    industrial production, and animal breeding. The parameters of water quality include
    potential hydrogen (pH), total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity,
    oxidation–reduction potential (ORP), dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, and temperature
    (Ighalo et al., 2020). Water quality monitoring systems are crucial for detecting
    any changes in the aforementioned quality parameters in real-time to ensure their
    safety (Shirode et al., 2018). The Internet of Things (IoT) embodies a dynamic
    paradigm where interconnected devices, varying in communication capabilities,
    engage in the exchange and synchronization of data. This network, potentially
    asymmetrical in nature, facilitates the seamless transfer of information to IoT
    servers for comprehensive processing and analytics (Kuo et al., 2018, Perumal
    et al., 2015, Tolentino et al., 2021). IoT-based applications can automatically
    update the sensor data to the internet in a device-to-device manner without requiring
    human intervention (Faber et al., 2020). The network infrastructure, particularly
    in urban areas, is undergoing rapid evolution, thanks in part to advancements
    in smart city concepts and the Internet of Things. This evolution is characterized
    by the widespread adoption and integration of established communication standards,
    network protocols and communication technologies such as ZigBee, Low Power Wide
    Area Networks (LPWAN), Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT), Long Range (LoRa),
    Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN), and Sigfox. These technologies, already
    well-defined in the realm of IoT, facilitate varied and efficient connectivity
    solutions within modern urban environments (Chen and Han, 2018, Premsankar et
    al., 2020, Singh et al., 2020). Environmental monitoring, including water quality
    monitoring, is among the emerging applications of IoT. Water quality monitoring
    and conservation are key utility services that face several problems from the
    consumer standpoint (Olatinwo & Joubert, 2018). However, the remote sensing assessment
    of water quality suffers from limited spatial resolution, making it difficult
    to monitor the quality of freshwaters, such as rivers, channels, and ponds, in
    urban areas (Chen & Han, 2018). Wireless sensor monitoring of such critical parameters
    is still considered ineffective and not energy efficient because it does not always
    fulfil the reasonable needs of certain utilities. Although the existing wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs) are less expensive than older equipment, certain issues,
    such as reliability, connectivity, and energy constraints, persist (Abdelfadeel
    et al., 2019, Cloete et al., 2016). Meanwhile, information handling and management
    can be improved. LoRa is a well-known LPWAN technology that exploits a proprietary
    physical layer (Chirp Spread Spectrum), whereas the upper layers are defined by
    an opensource standard — LoRaWAN (Sherazi et al., 2020; Magrin et al., 2019, Mroue
    et al., 2020). LoRa networks have been proposed to connect massive numbers of
    devices in large areas, and they have attracted increasing attention from the
    industry and academia to realize IoT implementation (Błaśkiewicz et al., 2019,
    Reynders et al., 2018). LoRaWAN networks are preferred for high-density deployments
    with flexible restrictions of latency and reliability. After a comprehensive investigation,
    LoRa and LoRaWAN as its network counterpart were nominated as potential LPWAN
    candidates for smart sensing technology in environmental monitoring as well as
    in industrial applications (Afisiadis et al., 2019, Jabbar et al., 2022). Hence,
    LoRa/LoRaWAN composition is selected for water quality monitoring system trials
    considering several features such as bitrate, energy consumption, communication
    range, simplicity, unlicensed band, and ease of management owing to its star of
    stars'' topology (Ana et al., 2020; Beltramelli et al., 2020, Chaudhari et al.,
    2020). In this work, the LoRa-based sensor node as a physical layer and LoRaWAN-based
    Gateway as a MAC layer protocol will be utilised to build a cost-effective, energy-efficient,
    multi-sensor, star topology wireless network for measuring the physicochemical
    water quality parameters and facultative real-time monitoring. The developed system
    is known as the water quality monitoring system WQMS-LoRaWAN. Four selected sensors
    are utilised and connected to a LoRa shield radio interface that is plugged into
    an Arduino UNO microcontroller-based board to measure the pH, TDS, turbidity,
    and temperature. The selected sensors enable the internal monitoring of the considered
    quality parameters of water and send the measured values as a payload stream based
    on a preset interval to the gateway that uploads the data to The Things Network
    (TTN (over the Internet. The TTN is a proud contributing member of the LoRa Alliance
    and is dedicated to building the LoRaWAN-based IoT network, which allows devices
    to connect to the cloud without cellular or Wi-Fi connectivity. The sensing information
    can be accessed by the user’s terminal either via a web-based dashboard over the
    ThingSpeak platform or ThingView mobile apps using laptops, PCs, or smartphones.
    1.1. Motivations and problem statement Water quality supplied in rural areas is
    not always safe to use in daily activities. Accordingly, conventional water quality
    check methods were carried out to monitor the water quality. Such traditional
    methods focused on manually gathering the water samples and delivering them to
    the research facility for further testing and inspection are ineffective, not
    economical, and time-consuming. Traditional water quality methods involve manual
    water sample collection in various sites and sending analytical techniques to
    the research facility to assess the character of water quality. These solutions
    are time-consuming and not economical (Lap et al., 2023). Although existing methods
    examine the physical, chemical, and biological agents, they still have some drawbacks,
    such as limited space–time range, time consumption, and cost, which is worker,
    operation, and apparatus and insufficiency of real-time quality of water info
    to allow crucial health of the people choose to be made (Feisal et al., 2023).
    However, constant real-time tracking of the water quality is necessary. WSNs are
    widely used for remote sensing and monitoring various stimuli or measuring change
    phenomena. Sensors in WSNs might need considerable computational power and generate
    large amounts of information that is transmitted. In rural areas, water quality
    monitoring networks are expected to have restricted local computation and transmission
    capabilities because of the nature of communication infrastructure in such areas
    in addition to limitations of the sensor process capabilities and energy resources
    (Bhardwaj et al., 2022). The utilization of such technologies is a non-economic
    and inefficient choice compared with conventional methods. Remote sensing is only
    suitable for a limited area and is not used in large and rural areas due to its
    limited communication range, bandwidth, and throughput. Therefore, the utilization
    of the IoT network is a good solution to overcome the limitations of conventional
    WSNs. The IoT architecture supports a wide variety of applications and supplies
    the required services. Data transmission over the Internet provides better accessibility
    regardless of time and place. The IoT cloud-based servers allow users to receive
    data in real-time from various sensors that communicate with each other via wireless
    radio interfaces. Given the lack of communication infrastructure in rural areas,
    LoRa is a promising candidate to build a free, long-range, and low-power wireless
    network for environmental monitoring. Such networks make IoT-based applications
    convenient for sensing and object detection (Almuhaya et al., 2022). Several parameters
    need to be considered when designing IoT-based monitoring systems to fulfil the
    system specifications. These parameters include the cost of materials, energy
    sustainability, reliability of data transmission, time delay, network coverage,
    and sensor accuracy (Jabbar et al., 2022). 2. Research contributions The proposed
    LoRaWAN system attempts to tackle the aforementioned issues to efficiently measure
    and track the water quality parameters in rural areas. In this paper, we present
    several significant advancements in the field of water quality monitoring systems,
    specifically addressing the limitations of existing solutions through the design,
    fabrication, and implementation of a novel WQMS-LoRaWAN IoT system. Our portable,
    real-time water quality monitoring system is well-suited for use in rural areas,
    as it continuously measures key water parameters and wirelessly transmits the
    data via the internet, regardless of location or time constraints. The following
    highlights the key innovations and contributions of our work: (i) We have developed
    a state-of-the-art WQMS utilizing LoRa and LoRaWAN technology, overcoming the
    challenges posed by short-range communication systems. Our system comprises a
    smart node equipped with multiple sensors, connected to an Arduino UNO microcontroller-based
    board, which is further augmented with a LoRa shield for seamless wireless communication
    with the LoRaWAN gateway. This gateway connects to the TTN network via the internet,
    and the entire system is powered by an environmentally friendly renewable energy
    source (solar cell). (ii) Our portable, floating, and waterproof WQMS boasts a
    unique design that seamlessly integrates into rural environments, providing real-time
    water quality monitoring and facilitating the detection of changes in water parameters.
    This data is then transmitted to the IoT cloud for analysis. In this work, we
    present a novel LoRaWAN-based WQMS tailored for rural areas, which incorporates
    the following key features: (a) We designed and fabricated a compact, IoT-based
    solar-powered water monitoring system that leverages LoRaWAN technology, an Arduino
    microcontroller-based board equipped with a LoRa shield, and multiple sensors
    (pH, TDS, turbidity, and temperature) to assess various water quality parameters.
    This portable, waterproof system features an integrated solar cell for enhanced
    durability and usability. (b) We introduced a new algorithm, implemented using
    the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE), to consolidate data from
    multiple sensors into a single packet with eight payloads. This packet is then
    periodically transmitted via a multi-channel LoRaWAN gateway to the TTN server.
    (c) We developed a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) on the ThingSpeak
    IoT platform, which is integrated with the TTN server. This allows for the simultaneous
    display of real-time data on a web-based dashboard and the ThingView mobile application,
    enabling users to monitor data on their devices (PCs and smartphones). (d) We
    deployed and evaluated our proposed WQMS-LoRaWAN system in a real-world rural
    setting, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy in comparison to laboratory
    instruments. The paper is structured as follows: Section II reviews the research
    background and related studies; Section III details the methods and materials
    employed; Section IV elaborates on the design, fabrication, and implementation
    of the WQMS system; Section V presents the system''s functionality testing and
    validation against laboratory results; and Section VI concludes the paper, offering
    suggestions for future work. 3. Background and related works Living The development
    of the economy and agriculture sectors keep increasing unceasingly causing pollution
    in the urban and rural areas. This causes certain areas especially rural facing
    the problem of lacking clean water for daily use, livestock watering, and for
    their crops. Water quality assessment is a real need in such areas to ensure the
    suitability and safety of the water source for diverse purposes for instance irrigation,
    drinking water supply, industrial cooling, and bathing. The water quality assessment
    can be classified into physical, chemical, and biological analyses. The parameters
    of these assessments deliver a whole picture of the water quality all these aspects
    need to be covered. Water Quality Indices is a very useful tool for professionalism
    to refer to. The Water Quality Indices provide a clear and complete picture of
    the water quality standards. These standards contain information about the water
    quality and the behaviour of the water resources. There are six classes of water
    based on its usage, namely: Class I, Class IIA, Class IIB, Class III, Class IV,
    and Class V. A water quality monitoring system is required to identify the different
    water classes. Different LAB instrumentations can be used to measure the parameters
    related to water quality such as pH, TDS, turbidity, Manganese, Ammonia-Nitrogen,
    temperature, and Nitrate-Nitrogen. IoT is a recent paradigm of communication technology,
    where all objects with communication interfaces, such as sensors, appliances,
    smartphones, tablets, and laptops, can connect with the Internet. The main intention
    of IoT is to form a global and smart world using a global network system; thus,
    it creates a sense for data collection from a huge number of devices/sensors/nodes
    worldwide and makes it available over the Internet. IoT applications enhance all
    areas of our daily lives and become more inspiring and pervasive in many emerging
    domains, including environmental monitoring, smart grid, smart city, home automation,
    smart agriculture, healthcare and medical aids, and industrial automation which
    is known as Industrial IoT (IIoT). IoT applications with massive sensors need
    efficient wireless technologies which provide a wide range, energy efficient,
    cost-effective with low-complexity end nodes (Short and Twiddle, 2019, Wang et
    al., 2019). Basically, it wirelessly connects battery-powered sensors; thus, the
    profile of power usage must be wisely designed to prolong the lifetime of batteries
    (Goundar et al., 2015, Schneider et al., 2018). The range of communication needs
    to be extended from short-range distances up to several kilometres since end nodes
    are disseminated throughout a wide operation area. By the consideration of all
    these requirements, a low-power wide-area network technology. LPWANs empower an
    increasing number of IoT applications in a wider geographical coverage, with a
    lower bitrate, and a longer lifetime. Thus, LPWANs gained popularity due to low
    power consumption and long-range and their multiple applications in the IoT applications.
    Driven by the growing variety of IoT applications and the shortage and limitations
    of existing wireless technologies in terms of scalability and communication range,
    new emerging LPWAN technologies have been developed. Existing LPWAN networks can
    be classified into three main categories depending on their requirements for supplementary
    infrastructure: (i) Cellular infrastructure (NB-IoT), (ii) Third-party infrastructure
    (Sigfox), and (iii) Stand-alone autonomous networks (LoRa and LoRaWAN). This section
    reviews existing studies on smart water quality monitoring systems, found by searching
    with keywords such as ''smart systems for water quality monitoring'' and ''Internet
    of things for water quality'' in two databases: Scopus and Web of Science (WoS).
    The search yielded 201 articles from WoS and 376 articles from Scopus. To refine
    the search, the keyword ''LoRa'' was included, resulting in 42 articles in Scopus
    and 9 articles in the WoS database. To further identify the most relevant articles,
    the keyword ''LoRaWAN'' was used, which produced 23 LoRaWAN articles in Scopus
    and 5 articles in WoS. After removing duplicates from the two databases, a total
    of 24 articles remained, focusing on IoT-based water quality monitoring systems
    using LoRaWAN technology. For the sake of brevity, the reviewed smart water quality
    monitoring studies have been summarized and compared in Table 1. Overall, many
    systems for water quality monitoring that utilise various communication technologies,
    parameter sensors, and microcontrollers have been proposed in the literature.
    Most of the reviewed systems have been tested or implemented in a real environment,
    and most of them were validated via simple prototypes in the laboratory without
    finished product fabrication or validation using laboratory instruments. In addition,
    none of these studies considered the development of both GUI for smartphones and
    Web-based dashboards, and most of them used one dashboard only. To the best of
    our knowledge, none of these studies are suitable for application in the real
    environment of rural areas that suffer from a lack of network coverage and require
    a standalone and cost-effective wireless network for real-time monitoring with
    a sustainable power source and maintenance-free system. Table 1. Comparison of

    investigated the usage of IoT in water quality monitoring. In (Liu et al., 2018),
    the authors proposed an IoT water quality monitoring based on LoRaWAN. The system
    consists of an Arduino Pro Mini, sensors (temperature, turbidity, conductivity,
    and pH), a LoRa module, and a solar panel. The system updates the data to a cloud
    database over the gateway using MQTT. However, among the drawbacks of the proposed
    system was the lack of system validation using laboratory instruments and the
    utilization of a private dashboard for data monitoring which makes it limited
    for a specific use case. In (Tolentino et al., 2020, Tolentino et al., 2021),
    the authors proposed an IoT-based device to allow local fish farmers to monitor
    various water parameters including pH, water level, temperature, dissolved oxygen,
    TDS, oxidation–reduction Potential, and turbidity using a smartphone. It also
    used different actuators to control fish-related activities like aerators, water
    filters, peristaltic pumps, water pumps, fish feeders, and heaters. The developed
    device used Packetduino as a microcontroller with a LoRa interface for data transmission
    to the Internet. However, system complexity, size, cost, and weight are among
    their drawbacks that need to be optimized according to the authors. In addition,
    the system needs to be powered using the main power source which might not be
    available in rural areas. In (Alset et al., 2020), the authors compared the performance
    of LoRa nodes under different frequencies (433 MHz, 865 MHz, and 915 MHz) based
    on the signal strength and the required energy using MATLAB. The study focused
    more on LoRa interface behaviour during the transmission of water quality-related
    information for example temperature, turbidity, pH, and GPS coordinates. The study
    simulated and analysed the LoRa node performance at different frequencies based
    on various spreading factors. Nevertheless, no real system development or prototype
    was carried out to monitor water quality. In addition, the study depends on the
    existing dataset rather than experimental sensor measurements. Ref. (Fathoni et
    al., 2020) implemented water quality monitoring using Rx64M MCU, pH, DO conductivity,
    and temperature sensors. The system uses LoRa to broadcast data over MQTT to the
    Grafana visualization platform. However, the system has limitations in terms of
    portability, waterproofing, and energy efficiency since it is battery-powered
    without any sustainable power source. Therefore, it is not suitable to be implemented
    in remote areas. The system prototype was tested in the LAB and it was not implemented
    in a real environment and no practical measurements were conducted for validation.
    Another study (Jiao & Luo, 2018) proposed a water quality monitoring system using
    Arduino Mega2560, LoRa shield with turbidity, pH, and temperature sensors. The
    acquired data by the sensors are updated on the JAVA-based website. Three sensors
    are used to check the uploaded information to the database. The study focused
    more on database design software development instead of system hardware implementation
    and validation. Ref. (Ngom et al., 2019) proposed a LoRa-based acquisition node
    that gathers information using Arduino Mega 2560 and four sensors (pH, electrical
    conductivity, oxidation/reduction potential, and temperature), then updates to
    the Global Visualization via a gateway. The system is powered using a fixed and
    separated solar panel and it was tested at the Botanical Garden pool in the faculty.
    However, the system lacks some features such as portability, floating, and the
    validation of the results. Ref. (Wu & Khan, 2019) developed a mobile monitoring
    system for water quality using USV, ATmega32U4 microcontroller, and Microchip
    RN2903 LoRa technology for Lake Dardanelle. Four sensors are used to collect data
    including pH, turbidity, DO, and temperature sensors. The gathered information
    is uploaded to the TTN and then to the MySQL database for further analysis. However,
    the usage of USV to carry the system increased system cost and complexity. Also,
    communication link stability and data transmission reliability are difficult to
    achieve with a mobile node. Vijayakumar & Ramya (2015) presented the design and
    development of a cost-effective, real-time water quality monitoring system using
    IoT technology. The system employs various sensors to measure the physical and
    chemical parameters of water, including temperature, pH, turbidity, conductivity,
    and dissolved oxygen. A Raspberry Pi B + model serves as the core controller to
    process the data collected from the sensors. The sensor data can then be accessed
    and viewed online through cloud computing, ensuring the safety of drinking water
    by continuously monitoring its quality. The Wi-Fi has a limited range, and no
    system prototype was developed or tested. In (Raut & Shelke, 2016), the authors
    presented a wireless acquisition system for water quality monitoring, aiming to
    overcome the limitations of traditional wired monitoring systems, such as high
    cost, installation complexity, and maintenance challenges. The wireless acquisition
    system consists of three main components: sensing nodes, a wireless transmission
    module, and a central control unit. Sensing nodes are equipped with various sensors
    to measure water quality parameters, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen,
    and turbidity. These nodes are responsible for collecting and processing data,
    which is then transmitted wirelessly to the central control unit using a ZigBee
    module. Similarly, a reconfigurable smart water quality monitoring system for
    the IoT environment was introduced by Myint et al., (2017). The system is composed
    of three main components: IoT-based water quality sensors, a wireless communication
    module, and a cloud-based data processing and storage platform. The data collected
    by these sensors is wirelessly transmitted to the cloud-based platform over the
    ZigBee module which is a short-range communication technology. In (Saravanan et
    al., 2017), a smart water grid management system utilising LPWAN-IoT technology
    is presented. The system consists of IoT-based sensors, LPWAN communication modules,
    and a centralized data processing platform. IoT sensors are employed to collect
    real-time data on various water parameters, such as flow rates, pressure, and
    water quality. The collected data is transmitted using LPWAN technology, which
    offers long-range communication, low power consumption, and the ability to connect
    numerous devices. The study lacks real-world testing and case studies to validate
    the effectiveness of the proposed system. Another Wi-Fi-based system consisting
    of WSN-based sensors, and a central data processing unit was presented by Li et
    al., (2018). The sensors are responsible for collecting real-time data on water
    quality parameters, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity.
    Although the study provides valuable insight into the potential benefits of using
    WSN technology for water quality monitoring, no real-world testing was conducted.
    A GSM-based water quality monitoring system for measuring various water quality
    parameters, such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity was introduced
    (Prasad et al., 2015). However, the study lacks a detailed examination of power
    consumption and strategies for optimizing energy efficiency within the system.
    Authors Das & Jain (2017) presented a detailed description of an IoT-based water
    quality monitoring system using ZigBee and GSM that can provide real-time data
    to ensure the safety and purity of water resources. However, some potential limitations
    should be considered. For example, the system was evaluated in a laboratory and
    a relatively small field test, so it is unclear how well it would perform in larger-scale
    implementations. Qin et al. (2018) discussed a unified water quality monitoring
    system that employs pH, free chlorine, and temperature sensors using FPGA and
    a wired network. The sensor configuration is dependable, cost-effective, and has
    fast response times, making it a valuable tool for constant monitoring of water
    quality aspects. However, the article could have discussed the potential challenges
    and limitations of the system, such as calibration and maintenance requirements,
    sensor life span, and the possible impact of external factors on sensor performance.
    Miao et al. (2022) described the creation of a monitoring system for monitoring
    air and water quality on a university campus. This system utilises LoRaWAN technology
    to collect and transmit data from various sensors that track temperature, humidity,
    PM2.5, and water quality. The authors note the system''s cost-effectiveness and
    potential for growth. However, the article lacks detailed information on the accuracy
    and reliability of the collected data, as well as any information on how the data
    is being used or shared. Additionally, the authors do not address any potential
    ethical or privacy concerns associated with monitoring individuals'' activities
    and behaviours on a university campus. In (Alobaidy et al., 2022), an Airborne
    IoT Network (LAP-AIN) based on low-altitude platforms for monitoring water quality
    in difficult tropical climates is introduced. By employing affordable solar-powered
    drones fitted with IoT sensors, the authors aimed to address the issues faced
    by conventional water quality monitoring techniques. The paper delves into the
    system''s structure, network planning, and simulation outcomes to showcase the
    efficiency and dependability of LAP-AIN. However, the study could benefit from
    a more in-depth analysis of the potential limitations and challenges of implementing
    the system in real-world scenarios, such as regulatory constraints, maintenance
    requirements, and the impact of extreme weather conditions on drone performance.
    Ref. (Jáquez et al., 2023) focused on improving the LoRa communication system
    and incorporating an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm in an IoT-based
    water quality monitoring system. The researchers suggest extending LoRa coverage
    using a mix of terrestrial and satellite communication, providing improved reliability
    and accessibility for distant regions. The study effectively shows real-time water
    quality tracking and early anomaly detection. Nevertheless, the authors could
    have explored the scalability of their proposed system, as well as the potential
    challenges that may arise in the deployment of such systems in rural areas. Lastly,
    an examination of the system''s energy consumption and maintenance requirements
    would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the system''s long-term
    feasibility. Incorporating insights from related works enhances our understanding
    of LoRa-based water quality monitoring systems. Notably, the study by Li et al.
    (2017) presents an innovative approach to water meter reading using LoRa communication
    technology. This research demonstrates the application of LoRa in a multi-level
    relay and concentrator structure for effective and efficient water meter reading
    in urban environments. Their system, featuring ultra-low power consumption and
    long-range wireless communication, offers valuable lessons for our WQMS-LoRaWAN
    system, particularly in terms of network design and energy efficiency. This reference
    underscores the growing relevance of LoRa technology in diverse urban and rural
    applications, reinforcing the potential of our proposed system to extend beyond
    its current rural-focused application. The study''s emphasis on achieving a balance
    between transmission efficiency and power consumption resonates with our system
    design considerations, particularly in ensuring sustainable and continuous operation
    in varied environmental conditions. A study by Ragnoli et al. (2020) demonstrates
    an application of LoRa technology in environmental monitoring. This research provides
    a comprehensive model for a flood-monitoring system utilizing a customized electronic
    board, emphasizing the system''s low power consumption and extensive coverage,
    attributes that are crucial for remote monitoring applications. The system''s
    modularity and adaptability to various sensor types are notable, illustrating
    the potential of LoRa technology in diverse environmental scenarios beyond flood
    detection. This inclusion not only enriches our literature review but also aligns
    with our study''s focus on harnessing IoT and LoRaWAN for real-time water quality
    monitoring in rural areas. The research underscores the importance of energy efficiency
    and the versatility of IoT devices in LPWANs, offering valuable insights and parallels
    to our own work in developing an efficient, adaptable, and sustainable water quality
    monitoring system. Zakaria et al. (2023) introduce an innovative flood monitoring
    and warning system (FMWS) utilizing LoRaWAN technology. This system is specifically
    designed to maintain extensive network connectivity, consume minimal power, and
    utilize low data transmission rates, thereby offering a cost-effective and user-friendly
    solution for real-time flood level monitoring and risk assessment. It employs
    an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor integrated with an Arduino microcontroller to measure
    flood levels and assess risk statuses, which are updated on The Things Network
    and integrated into TagoIO and ThingSpeak IoT platforms through a custom-built
    LoRaWAN gateway. The system''s solar-powered, standalone design ensures sustainability
    and continuous operation, making it an effective tool for early flood warnings
    and real-time updates to authorities and residents via mobile applications and
    web-based dashboards. This study not only demonstrates the system''s practical
    implementation and effectiveness but also evaluates the performance of the LoRa/LoRaWAN
    communication interface in various aspects such as signal strength and packet
    delivery, offering insights into the system''s adaptability and scalability for
    broader applications in environmental monitoring. The proposed system tackles
    multiple issues in the existing systems that were developed in the literature.
    The novelty of WQMS-LoRaWAN is from the consideration of several criteria in its
    design and fabrication. The system is compact, portable, lightweight, waterproof,
    expandable, cost-effective, and floatable. The system has benefited and combined
    the advantages of the existing systems into an all-in-one unique system. Firstly,
    the integration of multiple sensors in a single microcontroller (Arduino UNO)
    will be a good option for building cost-effective multi-sensor smart nodes with
    the ability to be extended by including more sensors to monitor other water quality
    parameters. Such a combination reduces the overall cost of the system compared
    to the market-available wireless sensors. Secondly, the usage of a license-free
    frequency spectrum transmission network (LoRa nodes), with low power and wide
    coverage network (LoRaWAN) will be privileged over the existing systems that utilise
    short-range communication technologies (ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) or commercial
    networks (GSM, 3G, 4G, NB-IoT, SigFox). Thirdly, the development of the new data
    acquisition algorithm based on IDE and the GUI based on open-source IoT platforms
    and servers (TTN, ThingSpeak, ThingView) will improve the public experience in
    rural areas to access data easily in real-time via public/private channels using
    their Internet-connected devices. Fourthly, the utilization of a solar cell with
    an Arduino-based solar shield charger will guarantee the sustainable operation
    of the proposed system in remote rural areas with lower energy constraints and
    less human intervention. Ultimately, the WQMS-LoRaWAN system''s real-world test
    at Gambang Lake demonstrated its floating capability, waterproof features, portability,
    and compact design. This field validation not only confirmed its effectiveness
    but also showcased its advantages over laboratory instruments, enhancing its usability
    and broader applicability. 4. Methods and materials This section provides an overview
    of the techniques and materials utilised in this study, as well as a description
    of the stages and processes followed to develop and implement the LoRaWAN-based
    water quality monitoring system. The method for choosing research materials is
    also outlined. The methodology flowchart can be found in Fig. 1. Our research
    commenced with an examination of the limitations of existing WQMS systems, followed
    by identifying research gaps. In the modelling phase, our focus is on system architecture
    and layout, component selection, and tool investigation for constructing the system
    prototype and developing the WQMS-LoRaWAN system. The system’s enclosure design
    is created using NX Siemens software, and a 3D-printed prototype is produced from
    ABS plastic. The WQM system''s design and implementation, utilizing LoRa technology,
    are carried out. Connections between various sensors in the WQM prototype and
    the attached LoRa system (including sensing node, gateway, power source, and IoT
    cloud) are set up and tested. Once the hardware installation and implementation
    are completed, software development and GUI design are executed to accomplish
    the necessary tasks. Then, the design is rechecked to verify the system''s functionality
    and identify whether any problem exists. The system returns to the previous phase,
    which is enhancement and optimization when any problem is found. The WQMS-LoRaWAN
    system is considered complete when it demonstrates strong performance and passes
    functionality testing. Practical implementation and performance assessment of
    the WQMS-LoRaWAN system are executed to confirm its effectiveness. Download :

    of research activities. 4.1. Components selection The required research components
    to build and fabricate the proposed system were selected after conducting a market
    survey on the available materials and prices. Several criteria were considered
    during component selection, including size, cost, operating conditions, applicability,
    and reliability. For example, we surveyed the available water parameter sensors
    included in the WQM system in the local market to compare the specifications and
    prices. The total cost of the proposed system including the cost of materials
    and fabrication service is around 240 USD. The following hardware and software
    components were selected. The hardware components include Arduino Uno Rev3 (Arduino,
    2023), Cytron 915 MHz Lora RFM shield (Cytron, 2021), 915 MHz LoRa Gateway Raspberry
    Pi Hat (Cytron, 2022), Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (Pi, 2020), Temperature (DS18b20)
    sensor, pH (E-201-C) sensor, Turbidity (SEN 0189) sensor, Gravity: Analog TDS
    sensor (SKU SEN0244), Solar charger shield v2.2 (Seeedstudio, 2021), LiPo rechargeable
    battery 9 V 5200 mAh, 2020 PCB connector housing 2 ways (Cytron, 2020), and SC10050
    Arduino compatible 5.0 V 100 mA solar cell. The software components include Nx
    Siemens software, Fritzing software, Arduino IDE software, The Thing Network,
    ThingSpeak Cloud, and ThingView. After the components selection process, we designed,
    fabricated, and implemented the WQMS-LoRaWAN system for water quality monitoring
    in rural areas. The selection of electronic components for the WQMS-LoRaWAN system
    was guided by several key criteria: cost-effectiveness, availability, ease of
    integration, and the need for modularity and adaptability in various rural water
    monitoring scenarios. We chose off-the-shelf elements for several reasons: Cost-Effectiveness
    and Accessibility: Using readily available components ensures that the overall
    cost of the system remains within a reasonable range. This is particularly important
    for potential replication and scaling in rural areas where resources may be limited.
    Ease of Integration and Adaptability: Off-the-shelf components allow for greater
    flexibility in modifying or upgrading the system. As the water quality monitoring
    needs may vary across different rural regions, the ability to easily replace or
    add components is beneficial. Reliability and Community Accessibility: Using standard,
    well-tested components ensures reliability and also makes it easier for local
    technicians to understand, repair, or modify the system, fostering community engagement
    and local capacity building. Regarding the implementation on a custom board, while
    it is true that a custom-designed board could potentially lead to a more compact
    and energy-efficient design, there are trade-offs to consider: Development Time
    and Cost: Designing and testing a custom board requires significant investment
    in terms of time and resources. For the initial phase of our project, our priority
    was to establish a functioning prototype that could be deployed and tested in
    real-world conditions rapidly. Flexibility and Scalability: Custom boards, while
    efficient, can be less flexible in terms of making quick modifications based on
    field feedback or integrating new sensors. Maintenance and Repair: In rural settings,
    the ease of maintenance and repair is crucial. Off-the-shelf components are more
    accessible and easier to replace or repair by local technicians who may not have
    specialized skills in custom electronics. 4.2. System architecture The overall
    system architecture of WQMS-LoRaWAN is illustrated in Fig. 2. Sensors are placed
    in the under-monitoring water source, such as a lake or a river. The pH sensor
    is utilised to define the acidity and alkalinity in the water. Meanwhile, the
    turbidity sensor is employed to detect the cloudiness of the water bodies. The
    DS18b20 sensor is utilised to identify the water temperature, while the TDS sensor
    is used to determine the salt concentration in the water. The four sensors measure
    the water quality parameters and transfer the information to the multi-sensor
    smart node, which consists of an Arduino Uno microcontroller-based board and LoRa
    shield. The microcontroller was used to gather data from different sensors and
    periodically send them as a payload stream over the 915 MHz Cytron LoRa radio
    to the LoRaWAN gateway. Download : Download high-res image (207KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 2. Overall system architecture. LoRa is the radio
    protocol, while LoRaWAN is the network protocol. LoRaWAN is a star topology network.
    This network uses sub-GHz frequency to communicate, which is regulated by each
    country’s regulatory body. The frequency range in Malaysia is from 919 MHz to
    923 MHz. The information will be transmitted by the LoRa gateway to the cloud,
    which is TTN, ThingSpeak, and ThingView application. The monocrystalline solar
    cell was placed on top of the smart node to harvest sunlight and generate the
    required electricity to supply the power for the sensors, microcontroller, and
    LoRa shield. The Solar Charger Shield v2.2 is an essential component of our WQMS-LoRaWAN
    system that was attached to the Arduino UNO R3. It functions as an interface between
    the solar panel and the system''s microcontroller, enabling efficient charging
    of the system''s battery using solar energy. This shield is specifically designed
    to manage the energy harvested from the solar cell, ensuring that the battery
    is charged safely and efficiently during daylight hours. Additionally, it regulates
    the power supply to the system''s components, contributing to the overall energy
    efficiency and sustainability of the WQMS-LoRaWAN. The inclusion of the Solar
    Charger Shield v2.2 is pivotal for ensuring that our system remains operational
    in rural areas, where access to conventional power sources might be limited. This
    choice aligns with our goal of developing a self-sustaining, environmentally friendly
    monitoring system suitable for remote applications. Energy efficiency is one of
    the key features of LPWAN to meet IoT application needs. Hence, the energy consumption
    of the sensing node is one of our system design considerations. Energy efficiency
    is a key player for extending the system''s lifetime. This criterion is well addressed
    by LoRa nodes that can run with the least maintenance and last for a long (up
    to 10 years). The energy consumption of LoRa nodes includes two types, (i) the
    consumed energy by the node’s controller that depends on the selected host board,
    and (ii) the wireless transmission energy that relates to LoRa shield and node
    activities. Although LoRaWAN technology has lower energy consumption compared
    to other wireless technologies, energy-saving is among the key considerations
    to enhance its performance. Class A LoRaWAN devices are the furthermost energy-efficient
    compared to other classes. Hence, we have selected Class A LoRaWAN in our system
    to improve the energy efficiency of wirelessly data transmission. Moreover, we
    have utilised renewable green energy resources with a rechargeable battery for
    the sustainable operation of our system regardless of the consumed energy by the
    microcontroller and sensors. The prototype employs a LiPo rechargeable battery,
    known for its efficiency and compact size. The battery is strategically placed
    within the enclosure to minimize direct exposure to sunlight, thereby reducing
    the potential for heat-induced degradation. The system’s enclosure, designed using
    PLA material, provides a protective barrier against direct sunlight. This design
    consideration helps in shielding the battery from excessive heat, which is crucial
    for maintaining its integrity and prolonging its life. During the deployment at
    Gambang Lake, we carefully observed the battery''s performance under natural sunlight
    conditions. This real-world testing is crucial in evaluating the battery''s resilience
    and in making necessary adjustments for future iterations. As soon as the gateway
    collects the data from the smart nodes, the data payloads will be transmitted
    to the IoT cloud, which is the TTN server. The TTN is integrated with the ThingSpeak
    IoT platform and ThingView mobile apps. The water quality information will be
    available either on web-based or mobile-based dashboards, and the users can easily
    access the water quality parameters by using their Internet-connected devices.
    The system runs depending on the developed coding and algorithm in the Arduino.
    The time interval for data gathering from sensors, packet size, data encoding,
    and decoding in addition to the LoRa configuration parameters are set using the
    Arduino IDE open-source platform. This system can be extended by adding more sensors
    and even actuators in real applications. The system''s operational procedure is
    depicted in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (277KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Flow Chart of WQMS working. 4.3. System design Siemens
    NX10 software was used in this project to design the WQMS-LoRaWAN enclosure. Before
    designing the prototype, a few criteria were considered. The design is in 3D because
    the system needs to be fabricated using a 3D printer to meet the criteria. The
    prototype design consists of multiple generations. The design is divided into
    two sections, namely, the lower and upper body parts. The system is designed on
    the basis of the criteria of being floatable, waterproof, and able to withstand
    sunlight. These requirements must be satisfied because we need to place the prototype
    in the lake and ensure that it will not drown. The design is straightforward and
    more practical with suitable dimensions. TWO main designs were proposed. The first
    design as illustrated in Fig. 4 (a) consists of microcontroller board holders
    which then were not suitable for our prototype since we need the prototype to
    be compact and practical which means space is very limited. The lower body part
    in the first design also was unsuitable since the prototype needed to float instead
    of submerged in water. In addition, it will be difficult to place the solar panel
    on the upside. Therefore, the round shape of the lower body part may affect the
    buoyancy of the prototype, thus it is changed to flat in the next design to make
    sure it floats. The second design is very straightforward and more practical as
    shown in Fig. 4 (b). The dimension of the second design was a little bit bigger
    than the first design to be more practical and potentially add attraction to our
    prototype. Consequently, our prototype is more practical and appealing. The upper
    body part is used to cover the sensor module and store the Arduino and LoRa shield.

    Fig. 4. System design using NX10 software. 4.4. System fabrication and verification
    The proposed system design is finalized and then it is fabricated. The fabrication
    process included 3D printing, drilling, surface finishing, and wiring connection.
    The 3D printing method is used in this project because it helps reduce material
    waste, minimizing errors, and producing lightweight parts. 3D printing can also
    be used to produce complex shapes, such as circular or spherical designs. The
    prototype’s materials were then listed before they were finalized on the basis
    of their characteristics, which comprised polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile
    butadiene styrene (ABS). The former is then selected as the prototype material.
    The main reason was that the PLA could be used to create dimensionally accurate
    parts. We also chose PLA over ABS because it is stronger, has greater strength,
    is stiffer, and is cheaper. After the 3D printing, we begin drilling to create
    a hole in the materials for bolts and nuts to secure the components inside the
    system enclosure. The drill used was a step drill to avoid any failure during
    the drilling. Surface finishing is necessary because the surface finish of the
    printed product is below a decent state. Accordingly, sandpaper is used to give
    the product a good and smooth surface finish. The final fabricated system enclosure
    (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (106KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. 3D Printed product. The concern about how our prototype''s enclosure
    handles high temperatures, particularly during sunny conditions, is an important
    consideration for the long-term reliability of our WQMS-LoRaWAN system. It is
    crucial to note that the current design is a prototype, not the final product,
    and is part of an ongoing development process. Considering that our prototype
    is strategically positioned on the water surface, it benefits from the moderating
    temperature effects of the surrounding water, mitigating the impact of high ambient
    temperatures typically experienced during sunny days. This phase also covers the
    wiring and installation of the system hardware components. Arduino Uno is a microcontroller
    board based on the ATmega328. Arduino is an open-source platform that is used
    as the main microcontroller and can be powered via a USB cable to a computer or
    powered with an AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. It contains a physical
    circuit board that can be programmed using the Arduino IDE to write and upload
    sketches to the physical board. The Arduino Uno can be connected to digital and
    analogue sensors. Cytron 915 MHz Lora RFM Shield is attached to the Arduino Uno
    to enable the wireless communication of the smart node. A solar charger shield
    v2.2 is also attached on top of the LoRa shield to interface between the solar
    panel and the microcontroller. Accordingly, Arduino Uno with LoRa and solar charger
    shield represent the main part of the multi-sensor smart node. Before the combination
    of all sensors within the smart node sensing unit, we tested each sensor in the
    laboratory. The calibration process of sensors with different samples of water
    and coding development for each sensor are performed to confirm the functionality
    and accuracy of all sensors as shown in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image
    (536KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Individual sensor testing
    and calibration. Four sensors are utilised in this study for different parameter
    measurements. The turbidity sensor measures the water''s darkness. Turbidity specifies
    the degree to which the water misses its transparency. This metric is a key indicator
    of water quality. Turbidity blocks out the light needed by submerged aquatic vegetation.
    This parameter can also increase the surface water temperatures above the normal
    level since suspended particles near the surface help the absorption of sunlight
    heat. The sensor’s outputs are in the nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU). Our
    system uses a DS18B20 temperature sensor due to several merits including waterproof,
    cost-effective, long-standing stability, efficient quality, rapid response, robust
    anti-interference ability, long-range signal transmission, digital output, multi-measurements
    for relative humidity and temperature, and accurate calibration. This temperature
    sensor is used to detect the water temperature. The aforementioned device accurately
    measures the temperature because of its digital output. The temperature of the
    DS18B20 sensor ranges from −55 °C to +125 °C. In our study, a pH sensor is utilised
    to detect the pH value, which is the most critical parameter of water quality.
    This metric indicates the alkalinity or acidity of a sample. The pH sensor scale
    is a logarithmic scale with a 0–14 range, and a neutral point being seven. Values
    higher than seven indicate a basic or alkaline solution. Meanwhile, values lower
    than seven would indicate an acidic solution. The probe must be cleaned with distilled
    water before performing multiple water quality tests because it is sensitive.
    The TDS sensor indicates how many milligrams of soluble solids are dissolved in
    1 L of water. As the TDS value becomes higher, it increases the soluble solids
    dissolved in water and decreases the water''s cleanness. The TDS sensor kit is
    compatible with Arduino, has a reasonable price, and is easy to use. The excitation
    source is an AC signal that can efficiently avoid the polarization of the probe
    and extend the probe’s life while also increasing the stability of the output
    signal. The TDS probe is waterproof and may be immersed in water for extended
    time measurement. The output reading of this sensor is in parts per million (PPM).
    At the beginning of the experiment, we tested each of the capabilities and durability
    of the sensor by making a calibration. The calibration is the most important step
    before starting the project to ensure that the sensor is working well and waterproof.
    At the first calibration test, we managed to study the turbidity (SEN0189) sensor
    output, that is, brightness calibration. We connect the sensor to the analogue
    input (A0). The serial monitor is used in this step of project development. Then,
    we calibrated the DS18B20 temperature sensor where we applied the same steps.
    However, the connection of the temperature sensor is somewhat different because
    it connects to the digital input (D8) and includes a 4.7 kΩ resistor. The DS18B20
    is tested in hot and cold water. We have also calibrated the TDS sensor (SKU SEN0244)
    by connecting to (A1) to Arduino input to measure the cleanness of the water by
    ppm unit. The final calibration sensor in our project is the pH (E_201_C) sensor,
    which is connected to the (A2) Arduino analogue input to measure the alkalinity
    or acidity of a sample. After the individual testing of sensors, a complete combination
    of circuit and coding is applied. We simultaneously measured the different water
    quality conditions by using a multi-sensor smart LoRa node. These tests are conducted
    locally without data transmission to the LoRaWAN gateway. Communication between
    the smart node in our project and the IoT is established via Cytron 915 MHz LoRa
    RFM shield, which allows data to be wirelessly transmitted over a long distance
    at low data rates (<50 kbps). This LoRa shield enables ultra-long range spread
    spectral communication with high immunity for interference while minimal current
    and targets various IoT applications, such as smart agriculture, smart homes,
    smart cities, and building automation. The RFM LoRa shield can achieve a sensitivity
    of over 148 dBm using the LoRa TM modulation technique and a low-cost crystal
    and bill of materials. The higher sensitivity supported with the integrated +20
    dBm power amplifier produces an industrial-competitive link budget that makes
    it ideal for any applications requiring range or robustness. LoRa also outperforms
    modulation methods in terms of blocking and selectivity, for achieving an acceptable
    trade-off among range, interference immunity, and energy consumption. The RFM
    LoRa shield provides exceptional linearity of the receiver and Input Third Order
    Intercept Point. It also allows outstanding phase noise and selectivity for noticeably
    lower currents. It supports high-performance (G) FSK modes for systems, such as
    WMBus and IEEE802.15.4 g. The LoRa shield allows extra shields that are compatible
    with Arduino to be attached on top of it via a stackable side header. This shield
    also includes built-in connectors for grove sensors that enable the integration
    of grove sensors for various applications. Users can also integrate OLED with
    this shield. LoRa operates in various region-based frequencies. The LoRa network
    is linked in star regional anatomy stars where the end nodes are connected via
    one hop to the gateways within the LoRa communication range. The utilised LoRa
    radio shield does not contain the LoRaWAN protocol; thus, we have integrated the
    LoRaWAN stack into the Arduino board. The LoRaWAN gateway functions as a relay
    and transfers the packets to the TTN server as the LoRaWAN network server (TTN).
    The LoRaWAN gateway in this project is built from Raspberry Pi 3 Model B + with
    a 915 MHz LoRa Gateway Raspberry Pi Hat by Cytron. The gateway HAT is based on
    RHF0M301-920 MHz, and it is a ten LoRaWAN concentrator module channel (8 × multi-SF
    + 1 × standard LoRa + 1 × FSK) with a 915 MHz antenna. This gateway kit was designed
    and developed to stack on Raspberry Pi 3, which is programmed to connect to the
    TTN LoRaWAN network server and collect and transfer data among all smart LoRa
    nodes. The choice of the LoRaWAN gateway, was driven by several factors: Coverage
    and Range: The gateway was selected for its proven effectiveness in covering the
    required range, which was essential for the rural deployment scenario at Gambang
    Lake. Compatibility with LoRaWAN: This particular model ensured seamless integration
    with the LoRaWAN network protocols, crucial for the reliability of data transmission
    to the TTN server. Installation Point Decision: The gateway was strategically
    installed on our campus, approximately 2 km from the test site (Gambang Lake).
    Accessibility and Security: The campus provided a secure and accessible location
    for monitoring and maintaining the gateway. We can build our IoT system to observe
    the water quality in real-time by connecting the smart node with the LoRa shield
    to the gateway. Both the LoRa shield and LoRaWAN hat that we used in the proposed
    system are displayed in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (162KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 7. (a) LoRa shield, (b) LoRa Gateway Hat. The
    received sensor readings by the gateway will be sent in real-time to the LoRaWAN
    server, TTN. TTN is an open-source and free IoT server that utilises the data
    from the LoRa sensor nodes. This server allows you to freely connect many LoRaWAN
    gateways and LoRa devices. The TTN is a powerful global platform for LoRaWAN applications
    with low complexity and efficient capabilities. Moreover, this server delivers
    a set of open tools and open network standards for developing the next IoT applications
    at a lower cost, higher security levels and maximum scalability. A secure and
    collaborative IoT network is built using robust end-to-end encryption that covers
    many countries across the world. In this study, the TTN LoRaWAN server is used
    to collect data from our system gateway through the internet. We have defined
    our gateway under the gateways of the TTN network and added our applications with
    smart devices. Each device should have its ID with multiple keys to ensure data
    security. These keys need to be included when building the smart nodes using the
    Arduino IDE. In our case, we have defined two sensor nodes, one for prototyping
    and testing and the other for the final product. Many verification steps were
    carried out during this phase to ensure the data flow from sensors to the TTN
    over the LoRa/LoRaWAN network. The sensing data, which include the encoded sensor
    measurements, are uploaded to the server as payload packets from the LoRa node.
    The data is instantaneously demonstrated on the TTN platform as encoded hexadecimal
    values. A new payload decoder was created at TTN based on the encoding procedure
    of data using the Arduino IDE at the sensor node. Accordingly, the TTN can receive
    and decode the uplink data which can be traced easily to monitor the considered
    water quality measurements. We have selected ThingSpeak among several available
    integrations in the TTN to build a user-friendly interface. ThingSpeak is an open-source
    IoT platform for storing and retrieving data from smart devices by utilizing MQTT
    and HTTP internet protocols. It enables the application''s creation for data logging,
    location tracking and status updates of sensors and actuators and enables integration
    with other tools and social networks. Users can access data output measurement
    of the system with their laptops or smartphones. The integration process was carried
    out to allow TTN to forward the data received from our system to ThingSpeak, which
    in turn makes it available to be displayed in its dashboard/channel or on ThingView
    mobile apps. Therefore, the proposed WQMS-LoRaWAN system can acquire data from
    sensors and send it to the ThingSpeak IoT server via the TTN LoRaWAN server and
    allow live cloud data streams to be aggregated, visualized, and analysed. We have
    selected the integration with ThingSpeak due to its key features, which include:
    (i) the ability to easily set up devices that use common IoT protocols to send
    data to ThingSpeak, (ii) visualize the sensor data from third-party sources in
    real-time, (iii) prototype and develop IoT applications without arranging networks
    or program development, (iv) a free software IoT system that uses the LAN or HTTP
    to collect related data from sensors or items through the internet, and (v) automatically
    activate data and connect with third-party providers to analyse data obtained
    by the device using ThingSpeak for easier processing, storage, and display. 5.
    System development and implementation After the individual testing for various
    components of the system, the implementation of the proposed design was carried
    out. The implemented WQMS-LoRaWAN IoT system was started by the combination of
    all sensors with the microcontroller and LoRa shield as one unit. 5.1. Functionality
    testing and design enhancement The testing of the all-in-one sensing unit was
    conducted to ensure system functionalities, and the design was enhanced and optimized
    when needed. This phase is vital to enhance the performance of the system and
    identify errors either in hardware connection or in software coding. Accordingly,
    the issues encountered in the previous stages are pointed out and solved. This
    phase was repeated to accomplish a successful system implementation. For example,
    at the initial stage of the system implementation, the output that we measured
    from the water quality system should be a reasonable measurement. After compiling
    all the programming codes into Arduino Uno, the 4-sensor module was installed
    on a breadboard according to Fig. 8 to measure various water quality parameters
    simultaneously. Download : Download high-res image (133KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Schematic diagram of sensors connection with Arduino.
    The codes of individual sensors were compiled using the Arduino IDE and the four-sensor
    module was installed on a breadboard to simultaneously measure various water quality
    parameters. The sensing unit functionality and capability were locally tested
    via serial monitor first, as illustrated in Fig. 9 (a). The system’s wiring installation
    and labelling were carried out according to the system layout for diagnosing input/output
    malfunctions. Besides, the connection with TTN was tested using Cytron Lora RFM
    antenna to the LoRaWAN gateway as shown in Fig. 9 (b). The communication between
    LoRa and the gateway to the TTN is working smoothly. In this stage, the evaluation
    of the system is conducted to ensure that all sensors and Arduino with LoRa and
    LoRaWAN gateway are effectively functioning. Download : Download high-res image

    node/LoRaWAN gateway to TTN. 5.2. Hardware implementation of the multi-sensor
    smart LoRa node Before finalizing the WQMS-LoRaWAN system, we conducted numerous
    tests on individual sensors as well as on the multi-sensor unit using a breadboard.
    One of the key attributes of the proposed system is its portability. In order
    to enhance the system''s modularity and ease of use, a plug-and-play feature has
    been incorporated into the WQMS-LoRaWAN design. This feature not only facilitates
    easy installation and replacement of various sensors but also comes with a power
    management system. Specifically, the system can automatically switch between solar
    power and battery sources depending on availability and need. Upon connection,
    the core module automatically recognizes the attached sensor, retrieves its unique
    identifier and adjusts the communication protocols accordingly. This minimizes
    setup time and allows users to customize the system based on their specific monitoring
    needs. In practical terms, the plug-and-play feature empowers local authorities
    or community leaders to adapt the system for different water conditions or quality
    parameters, thereby maximizing its utility and adaptability in diverse rural settings.
    The system is suitable to be used in daily real-time monitoring of water sources
    in rural areas. The system is placed in a circular form with a thin fabrication
    to meet the water conditions and retested after the hardware is installed. The
    system was enhanced and optimized when necessary until it was fully functioning.
    Thereafter, the system components are placed and arranged inside the enclosure
    (Fig. 10). The sensors are fixed in the lower body part to be closer to the water
    surface and easily dropped to the water. Meanwhile, the microcontroller with LoRa,
    solar charger, and solar cell are placed on the upside of the system. The holes
    for the sensors and antenna are well protected against water leakage into the
    system. After the components were attached to the prototype, the wiring connection
    was then established. The sensors connect to the module, the module connects to
    the board, and the board connects to the controller. The wire is held together
    with a cable tie and wire tape to ensure that it looks neat and assorted. Download

    Implementation of Multi-Sensor Node. Fig. 11 shows a developed testing prototype
    with the final edition of the portable WQMS-LoRaWAN system placed in the water
    aquarium and Gambang Lake. The system''s floating capability and waterproofness
    were tested in the laboratory prior to real implementation. The LoRa communication
    coverage and connectivity with the gateway were also tested in indoor and outdoor
    environments. The system was finalized to be appropriate for practical deployment
    and applicable in the considered environment regardless of the surrounding conditions.

    Fig. 11. Finalized system practical testing (a) LAB (b) Gambang Lake. For instance,
    during daylight hours, the system primarily relies on solar power, reducing the
    dependence on battery usage. When solar power is insufficient or unavailable,
    the system seamlessly switches to battery mode. This intelligent switching ensures
    continuous operation while optimizing energy consumption. In the context of energy
    sustainability, a paramount consideration for the WQMS-LoRaWAN system, we''ve
    undertaken an in-depth assessment of power utilization across all components.
    Our Arduino Uno core module accounts for roughly 40 % of the total system power
    consumption, while the SX127x LoRa Shield uses an additional 30 % and it is depending
    on the system situation (sending data or idle). The four water quality sensors—E-201-C
    for pH, SEN0189 for turbidity, DS18B20 for temperature, and SKU SEN0244 for TDS—cumulatively
    consume the remaining 30 % of the energy budget. Importantly, the inclusion of
    these sensors has a nominal effect on total power usage, elevating it by just
    5–8 %. This analysis corroborates the efficacy of our solar-powered configuration
    in meeting the energy requirements of both the core module and various sensors.
    This information is especially relevant for stakeholders planning to deploy this
    system in rural areas where energy efficiency is a critical concern. 5.3. Software
    implementation The software development focuses on proposing a new algorithm (Algorithm
    1) to gather data from a multi-sensing unit and compose it to be transmitted as
    a single packet periodically over the LoRa/LoRaWAN network to the TTN server.
    This process is known as encoding sensor readings for upload as bytes’ stream
    to the TTN via the gateway. Algorithm 1 is proposed and implemented in the Arduino
    IDE platform to perform the required monitoring tasks. Multiple functions were
    developed to gather data from each sensor. In our LoRaWAN-based system, we configured
    various parameters to optimize the node''s transmission capabilities and ensure
    efficient, collision-free communication (Croce et al., 2019). These configurations
    include: • Spreading Factor (SF): We experimented with two distinct SF settings:
    SF7 and SF12. These varying levels were tested to determine the most effective
    trade-off between communication range and data rate under different environmental
    conditions. • Bandwidth (BW): Set at 125 kHz, this bandwidth is a standard setting
    for LoRaWAN applications, providing a balance between data rate and signal robustness.
    • Coding Rate (CR): Typically, we set the CR at 4/5. This rate offers a compromise
    between transmission robustness and bandwidth efficiency, ensuring reliable data
    delivery without excessively consuming network resources. • Carrier Frequency
    (CF): The CF was selected in line with the regulatory norms and standard frequency
    bands specified for LoRaWAN operations in Malaysia, which range from 919 MHz to
    923 MHz. This careful selection ensured our system''s compliance with local regulations
    while optimizing signal transmission quality. • Transmission Power (Ptx): We adjusted
    the Ptx to balance the needs for transmission range and energy efficiency. The
    setting was fine-tuned based on the distance between the nodes and the gateway,
    aiming to maintain strong communication links while reducing power consumption
    as much as possible. This strategy is particularly crucial for our system''s solar-powered
    design, helping to extend battery life in remote or rural settings. By configuring
    these parameters, we aimed to create a network that is not only compliant with
    local telecommunication laws but also efficient and reliable, crucial for our
    system’s deployment in rural water quality monitoring scenarios. The LoRa parameters
    can be adjusted to achieve a trade-off between multiple features, such as data
    rate, range of transmission, interference robustness, and consumed energy. LoRa
    is a Physical Layer modulation technique proprietary by Semtech, whereas LoRaWAN
    is an open standard that offers a medium access control mechanism (MAC) that enables
    many LoRa end devices to communicate with the gateway. The LoRa Alliance supports
    and promotes global adoption of the LoRaWAN to ensure interoperability of all
    LoRaWAN-supported devices and technologies; thus, delivering IoT for a sustainable
    future. The structure of the LoRa packet includes (i) Preamble (≥4.25 symbols),
    (ii) 2-byte header (iii) 2-byte header CRC, (iv) data payload (≤255-bytes) and
    (v) Payload CRC(2-bytes). A packet initiates with the preamble, programmable 6–65535
    symbols, to which 4.25 symbols are added by the radio for the sync word. Next,
    it is optionally followed by a header that indicates the length and Forward Error
    Correction (FEC) rate of the payload and describes the existence of an optional
    16-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) for the payload. The header has its own CRC,
    and it is always transmitted with a 4⁄8 FEC rate. The payload comes after the
    optional header, and it can comprise 1–255 bytes. An optional 16-bit CRC might
    be added at the payload’s end. In the proposed system, the collected readings
    from the sensors are combined into a packet of eight payloads to be sent to the
    LoRaWAN gateway. Each sensor reading is represented by two payloads (1-byte each).
    This combination denotes the payload of sensing data in the LoRa Phy Packet Format.
    Fig. 12 depicts the utilised code to compose eight payloads as a single packet
    to be updated to TTN every 10 s and will be decrypted and shown in the hexadecimal
    format of the decoded “binary data,” every pair digit being one “byte”, as sent
    by the sensors. The bytes are used to represent numbers, text, and switch status.

    Fig. 12. Packet payloads structure. A payload decoder has been built in the TTN
    platform to interpret the received hexadecimal byte characters into human-readable
    information, as shown in Fig. 13. The uplink payload by the gateway is 16 bytes
    in length and represents the readings of four water quality parameters (pH, TDS,
    turbidity, and temperature) to show the gathered measurements from the employed
    sensors (Fig. 14). Nevertheless, the dashboard of TTN lacks a user-friendly interface
    and data visualization features. Consequently, we have integrated two user-friendly
    GUIs for water quality monitoring as part of the software development. One is
    a web-based ThingSpeak IoT dashboard where we have created our own channel that
    was integrated into the TTN platform using the channel ID, a write API key, and
    a read API key to enable the channel to acquire data from TTN and visualize it
    in the selected gauges, charts or widgets. The ThingSpeak represents IoT analytics
    with MATLAB. ThingSpeak IoT server has the capability to view the gathered data
    either as graphs, numerical values, or historical trends graphs for a selected
    period (daily, monthly, or annually). Four widgets were added to visualize the
    water quality measurements. The created channel has private and public views to
    support and control the privacy of displayed information. API read and write keys
    are exploited to share the sensor readings with other devices. Download : Download

    full-size image Fig. 14. TTN data payload form. The second GUI is a smartphone-based
    interface using the MQTT protocol known as ThingView. The ThingView mobile application
    was exploited to view the graph and the reading on the smartphone because it is
    among the mobile applications integrated with the ThingSpeak IoT platform. ThingView
    enables the visualization of ThingSpeak channels instantaneously via channel ID.
    Different configurations for the GUI view are available based on channel types
    (public/private), such as colour, timescale, chart type, and the number of results.
    The information on the water quality can be easily viewed anytime and anywhere
    by users through these apps. The two GUIs are synchronised, and users have two
    options for monitoring. The conditions of the water quality can be monitored on
    the spot all the time and immediately treat the water quality that has been polluted
    by using these two dashboards (ThingSpeak and ThingView). Further details about
    the integrated GUIs with their usage in the WQMS-LoRaWAN are explained in the
    following section. 6. Experimental results and validation This section presents
    the main findings and the performance validation of the developed WQMS-LoRaWAN.
    As previously mentioned, the testing of the proposed system was carried out in
    the laboratory first before the real deployment. Several verification steps were
    carried out prior to the implementation of the monitoring system in the rural
    area of Gambang, Pahang, Malaysia. The testing scenarios of the developed system
    have been carried out outdoors at Gambang Lake and indoors at our laboratory.
    The practical test results were validated by comparison with real measurements
    using the laboratory apparatus at the site. After that, samples of water taken
    from the lake were tested again in the laboratory under various conditions in
    comparison with other water samples (tap water and wastewater). While we acknowledge
    the limitations of our sample size, it is essential to highlight the practical
    aspects of our study. Our system underwent rigorous testing in a real-world environment
    at “Gambang Lake”. The outcomes were promising as we effectively monitored the
    specified water quality parameters in real-time, with the data being seamlessly
    transmitted to the IoT Cloud via the LoRa/LoRaWAN network. The core objective
    of this study was to ascertain the performance of the IoT system, both in a controlled
    LAB environment and in an authentic implementation scenario for verification and
    validation purposes. Though our LAB demonstrations employed a restricted sample,
    the intent was primarily to showcase the system''s inherent capabilities. It is
    a consensus that a broader, more encompassing sample would be instrumental for
    any large-scale roll-outs to holistically gauge water quality. In real-world scenarios,
    an ideal approach would be to deploy multiple LoRa nodes throughout the targeted
    lake or river. This would facilitate the monitoring of water quality across various
    segments of the water body. The amalgamated data could then be collated and scrutinized
    at the central utility servers, allowing for real-time water quality assessments
    based on inputs from these distributed sensing units. We have integrated these
    observations and suggestions into our discussion, emphasizing the scope and requirements
    for expansive sampling in subsequent implementations. 6.1. Water quality monitoring
    at Gambang lake During the outdoor test at the lake, our primary objectives were
    to assess network connectivity and the timely updating of data to our IoT platform.
    The multisensory node was strategically placed in the lake, with sensors submerged
    in the water to collect real-time data. Powering the system, a solar panel was
    used during the day while a rechargeable battery took over at night, efficiently
    managed by a solar charger shield. Our LoRaWAN gateway, situated 2 km away on
    our campus, successfully received data transmitted from the lake location. The
    test ran continuously from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm, with multiple runtime cycles to
    ensure robust data collection. During these testing hours, we gathered ten readings
    for each of the four parameters—TDS, turbidity, temperature, and pH—utilizing
    a variety of instruments. The LoRa node periodically relayed this data to our
    gateway, which in turn uploaded the information to the TTN cloud and ThingSpeak
    platform. This data was made accessible in real-time on multiple platforms—TTN,
    ThingSpeak, and ThingView—and could be viewed via internet-enabled devices like
    laptops, PCs, and smartphones. The focus of this test was not a full-scale implementation
    but rather a targeted evaluation of the system''s networking capabilities, sensor
    accuracy, and data upload reliability. Overall, the trial validated our system''s
    functionality and laid the groundwork for future real-world deployments. Certainly,
    for a more comprehensive monitoring solution and permanent implementation, it
    will be essential to deploy multiple systems across various locations on the same
    lake. This will ensure more thorough coverage and allow for a more nuanced understanding
    of the water quality variables at play. By disseminating several multisensory
    nodes, we can capture spatial variations in water quality, thereby providing stakeholders
    with a holistic view of the lake''s condition. Such a multi-node deployment would
    also allow for greater data redundancy and improved fault tolerance, enhancing
    the robustness of the system. This added layer of complexity is especially pertinent
    for stakeholders considering a long-term, scalable solution for water quality
    monitoring. In the TTN, the information on the water quality is periodically updated
    depending on the time interval required to establish a connection with the gateway.
    This platform allows for real-time water quality tracking. The ThingSpeak also
    shows the information as graphs and numeric values with a historical trend graph
    for each sensor reading, as depicted in Fig. 15. We also have created a widget
    for every sensor to synchronous the data between the utilised IoT servers. The
    data is also saved in the channel of ThingSpeak and can be extracted for further
    analysis. The same real testing data can be displayed on smartphones via the ThingView
    application as shown in Fig. 16. The condition of the water quality can be viewed
    at any time, and any abnormal conditions of the water quality can be reported
    by using these three dashboards. Our system can be used to notify the consumers
    regarding the water quality and report to the responsible authorities to treat
    the water when needed. The application will display the data as long as the connection
    is stable between the gateway and the LoRa nodes. The floating capabilities, impermeability
    functions, and connectivity with the gateway were tested in the field at Gambang
    Lake. Download : Download high-res image (260KB) Download : Download full-size

    have been conducted on the site and in the laboratory to analyse the performance
    of the proposed WQMS-LoRaWAN system. The reported results in this paper are observed
    and collected in real-time for the considered water quality parameters during
    a five-hour period. Since our system sends information to the cloud every 10 s
    in the testing scenario, more than one thousand entries have been received by
    the server. Thus, one thousand readings from each sensor have been averaged into
    ten readings (100 entries are averaged into one reading) to validate the system
    performance in comparison with practical measurements using laboratory apparatus.
    We have used 2100Q Portable Turbidimeter and SevenCompact pH/Ion Meter S220. The
    TDS values have been calculated based on laboratory experiments. The gathered
    data by the implemented WQMS-LoRaWAN was compared with practical measurements
    by LAB instruments. The turbidity data was validated first. Turbidity is often
    used to determine if the water loses clarity due to the existence of floating
    particles. The cloudiness of the fluid is usually invisible to the naked eye.
    The higher the TDS in the water, the more visible the cloudiness, and the higher
    the turbidity. NTU is used by turbidity to measure cloudiness. Turbidity is often
    used to determine if the water loses clarity due to the existence of floating
    particles. The cloudiness of the fluid is usually invisible to the naked eye.
    The turbidity of drinking water must not exceed 5 NTU and must be below 0.1 NTU,
    according to the World Health Organization. During the practical test, the 2100Q
    portable turbidity meter was used to test the turbidity of the lake water sample.
    Selected obtained results from practical water sample tests in the Lab are shown
    in Fig. 17. Download : Download high-res image (240KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 17. Parameters values of (a) pH (b) turbidity. Fig. 18 (a) illustrates
    the collected data by WQMS-LoRaWAN and the portable turbidimeter. The obtained
    results from the turbidimeter were marginally lower than the WQMS-LoRaWAN readings
    which represent an average value for 100 entries. Consequently, a minor variety
    is noticed between real-time data and experimental results of turbidity; however,
    it does not mean the imprecision of WQMS-LoRaWAN. The turbidity readings for real-time
    monitoring changed between 9.57 and 9.85 NTU compared with 9.46 to 9.6 NTU by
    the turbidimeter. Overall, the trend of both graphs is in agreement. Throughout
    this experiment, the turbidity (SEN 0189) sensor is validated, and it can be used
    for real-time monitoring of the water turbidity. Download : Download high-res

    and Instrumentation measurements (a) Turbidity (b) pH, and (c) Temperature. Fig.
    18 (b) compares the collected results using the proposed system and the SevenCompact
    pH meter S220. The pH value is used to detect the concentration of hydrogen ions.
    This parameter measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. The scale of
    pH basically ranges from 0 to 14. Drinking water with a pH of 6–8.5 is safe to
    drink, while water with a pH below six is acidic, and that with a pH above 8.5
    is alkaline or basic. A pH test is required to determine the water’s corrosiveness
    to avoid harm to human health. The equipment used was the SevenCompact pH meter
    S220, which can test the pH and temperature values as well. There are slight differences
    in the pH readings from WQMS-LoRaWAN and SevenCompact pH meter. The pH value changes
    due to the active microorganisms in the water. Obviously, the trend of both charts
    was approximately the same. In contrast, the obtained pH readings from both systems
    are consistent and identical irrespective of time and within the Environmental
    Protection Agency’s standard. The pH (E-201-C) sensor is validated and works efficiently
    in the proposed system hydrogen ions concentration. Similarly, the SevenCompact
    pH meter S220 is used to measure the temperature of the lake’s water every 30
    min and compare the measurements with the average readings from the WQMS-LoRaWAN.
    The temperature has a little change because the water is exposed to the sunlight
    when monitoring in real-time. Accordingly, the water temperature will increase
    or decrease. These changes have an impact on the other water quality parameters
    as well. Fig. 18 (c) shows the collected readings via the temperature sensor for
    the sensor validation over the defined period. A comparison between the gathered
    water temperature using the considered systems is introduced. In general, the
    trend was consistent for the two graphs regardless of the time. Our system measurements
    of the water’s temperature were slightly higher compared to the digital thermometer.
    The WQMS-LoRaWAN succeeded in continuously measuring the temperature using the
    DS18b20 temperature sensor for five hours. The data is uploaded in real-time over
    the LoRaWAN gateway to the IoT cloud. The total dissolved solids of water are
    displayed in mg per unit of total volume (mg/L), sometimes known as ppm. The measurement
    of conductivity can be defined. According to the Environmental Protection Agency’s
    standard, the TDS level of drinking water is 50 mg/L, and the limitation is 500
    mg/L. The gathered data from the WQMA-LoRaWAN throughout the practical test at
    Gambang Lake varied between 551 and 570 mg/L. In order to validate the analogue
    TDS sensor (SKU SEN0244), a sample of lake water was tested at the laboratory.
    The formula has been applied to calculate the TDS value which was 560 mg/L and
    it is close to the measured values during the site test. TDS is used to determine
    the total concentration of dissolved substances in the water, which measures the
    disintegrated minerals and natural matter present in the water. The mineral salts
    in water are magnesium, potassium, sodium, and calcium, which are cations, while
    chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, and carbonates are anions. Therefore, the system''s
    effectiveness was proven during the real-time implementation in the lake. The
    system succeeded in periodically updating the gateway with precise data and the
    water quality parameters acquired by the sensors were also accurate compared to
    the tested water samples. The obtained results prove that our system is efficient,
    reliable and suitable for implementation in rural areas. Moreover, the WQMS-LoRaWAN
    is a standalone system that can operate and update information about water quality
    continuously without any human intervention. The PV solar panel provides the required
    power for the sustainable operation of the WQMS-LoRaWAN. The harnessed solar energy
    by the solar panel as a renewable energy resource is exploited to charge the LiPo
    battery and secure the sustainable operation of the system. The utilised battery
    requires six hours for full charging by the PV solar panel and can last for 13
    h of continuous operation according to the conducted tests. 6.2. Water quality
    testing at the laboratory In the first scenario (outdoor testing), only the leak
    water quality was assessed using the proposed LoRaWAN-based system. However, in
    the second scenario (indoor testing), three different samples of water (tap water,
    wastewater, and lake water) are used to validate the system''s performance under
    different water quality conditions. Water samples have been collected from the
    lake to be tested in the laboratory. When the water samples were transferred to
    the laboratory, the water quality parameters were affected due to the surrounding
    microorganisms and the way of taking the water sample. Therefore, we have noticed
    some variations compared with the obtained reading during the site test. The amount
    of time to test the water sample is restricted. The longer the time that the water
    sample is kept, the less accurate the parameter being tested. In the real test,
    the deeper the sensor is immersed, the higher the reading of the turbidity. In
    the practical test, only 10 mL of water sample has been tested. Temperature is
    the main parameter of water quality that can affect the other parameters, such
    as pH, DO, and conductivity. When the water sample was brought back to the laboratory
    for the laboratory experiments, the temperature was affected because of the room
    temperature. The second validation test was carried out in the laboratory for
    various water samples under the same conditions. A few water samples have been
    taken and tested in real-time based on the four sensors of WQMS-LoRaWAN and via
    laboratory equipment analysis to ensure the accuracy of the obtained result from
    the developed system. The obtained results of the three types of water samples
    via real-time monitoring and laboratory equipment analysis were compared. The
    comparison shows that the readings were slightly different but within the acceptable
    range of the sensors’ accuracy. In both methods of testing, the readings varied,
    except that the temperature measurements were close to each other in both tests.
    Overall, our system was functioning well and can provide an overview of the quality
    of water in real-time. Table 2 summarizes and compares the obtained results from
    the developed system and the laboratory instruments for the considered water samples
    according to the tested parameters. Table 2. Comparison of Water Quality Parameters
    for Different Samples During Laboratory Testing of WQMS-LoRaWAN. Water Quality
    Parameters WQMS-LoRaWAN Laboratory Test Tap Water Lake Water Waste Water Tap Water
    Lake Water Wastewater Temp. (°C) 24.93 25.06 25.25 24.0 22.2 22.0 pH 7.12 8.09

    564.76 3332.3 30 600 4500 The traditional WQM methods, such as laboratory technique
    analysis, take a long time to analyse and obtain the result. Such methods also
    have the preferred time to keep the water sample to avoid the performance of the
    water sample from being affected. The pH of the water sample will become acidic
    if it is stored for an extended period. This phenomenon occurs because the oxygen
    in the water has been used up by the microorganism or bacteria. The microorganism
    or bacteria will die due to the lack of oxygen in the water. When the microorganism
    or bacteria are dead, the pH in the water will be affected and become acidic.
    Meanwhile, the acceptability of several inorganic constituents and chemical contaminants
    will be influenced by temperature, which may affect the water quality. The rise
    in water temperature increases the microorganism’s production. Taste, odour, colour,
    and corrosion issues are also affected. The ion concentrations will change with
    the increase or decrease in temperature, thus switching the pH value. Oxygen solubility
    will also decline with higher temperatures. The conductivity will also be affected
    by the temperature because the different ions in the water require various temperatures
    to activate. 6.3. High-Level application contexts and system integration By outlining
    high-level application contexts, we aim to emphasize the adaptability and broad-reaching
    implications of our WQMS-LoRaWAN system. This underscores the fact that although
    the system was originally conceived for monitoring water quality in rural areas,
    its applicability extends much further. Public Health Initiatives: Our WQMS-LoRaWAN
    system is designed with scalability and adaptability in mind, making it suitable
    for a range of high-level applications beyond rural water quality monitoring.
    For instance, our system can serve as an integral part of larger public health
    initiatives aimed at preventing waterborne diseases. Early warning signals triggered
    by deteriorating water quality can prompt immediate preventive actions, thereby
    protecting communities from outbreaks. Emergency Response Strategies: In the event
    of natural disasters such as floods or industrial accidents that compromise water
    quality, the WQMS-LoRaWAN system can provide real-time information that is crucial
    for emergency response teams. This aids in making quick decisions on evacuation,
    distribution of water purifiers, or targeted cleaning operations. Private Sector
    Applications: Water quality is not just a concern for public bodies; it''s also
    vital for various industries such as agriculture, brewing, and pharmaceuticals.
    Our system can be easily integrated into existing industrial processes for real-time
    water quality monitoring, helping businesses comply with regulations and optimize
    their operations. Smart Cities: As urban areas continue to grow and become smarter,
    the integration of IoT technologies like WQMS-LoRaWAN can serve as a critical
    component in larger systems of water management, waste treatment, and environmental
    monitoring. Its low energy consumption makes it ideal for long-term deployments
    in such scenarios. Potential for Integration: Given its modular design and ease
    of scalability, the WQMS-LoRaWAN system can be readily integrated into existing
    water quality monitoring infrastructures, including those that are not based on
    LoRaWAN technology. Its data output can be easily adapted to feed into other platforms
    and dashboards, thus offering flexibility and adaptability in a variety of implementation
    contexts. 7. Conclusion and future work The objectives of this study have been
    fulfilled by proposing the use of a new LoRaWAN wireless technology for IoT applications
    in rural areas. A cost-effective, portable, floating, waterproof smart, and environmentally
    friendly WQMS-LoRaWAN system for the monitoring of water’s quality parameters
    in real-time has been developed and deployed at Gambang Lake to help reveal the
    variation of water quality in real-time and update the information to the IoT
    cloud (TTN, ThingSpeak, and ThingView). Four water quality sensors, namely, pH,
    turbidity, temperature, and TDS, have been used. The system managed to enable
    the communication over LoRa and LoRaWAN network to the internet to smoothly transmit
    the data. The system could accurately and simultaneously gather the different
    sensors’ real-time data, and they can be accessed via web-based/mobile-based dashboards.
    The system is powered using a green energy source (solar cell), which can increase
    system independence and energy efficiency during continuous operation. The obtained
    results were promising, and the developed system can improve the awareness of
    people and authorities about the water quality in rural areas. This system is
    useful for people who live in rural areas that depend on lakes or rivers as primary
    water resources. Individuals can track the water quality to ensure that it is
    safe for daily usage and free of contamination. Our LoRaWAN-based IoT system allows
    for real-time monitoring of water quality, enabling rapid response to any changes
    or issues that may arise. The use of low-power and long-range communication technology
    allows our system to operate efficiently in rural areas with limited access to
    power and network infrastructure. The modular design of our system makes it easy
    to adapt to various water monitoring needs and to incorporate additional sensors
    or parameters as required. On the other hand, the performance of our system may
    be affected by environmental factors, interference from other substances, and
    network connectivity challenges, as previously discussed. The initial setup and
    calibration of the system may require technical expertise and resources that might
    not be readily available in some rural areas. The reliance on batteries for power
    supply in remote locations may necessitate regular maintenance and battery replacement,
    potentially increasing the long-term operational costs of the system. In our future
    work, we aim to conduct a more thorough and detailed analysis of the system''s
    power consumption. This analysis will extend to both the active and idle states
    of the system, enabling us to gain a deeper understanding of its energy dynamics.
    By meticulously measuring and recording the energy requirements during these different
    operational phases, we will be able to identify areas for optimization and enhance
    the overall efficiency of the system. This data will be critical in refining the
    system''s design, ensuring sustainable operation, and reducing the energy footprint,
    which is particularly important for deployment in resource-constrained rural areas.
    Our goal is to not only ensure reliable performance but also to contribute to
    the development of more energy-efficient IoT solutions for environmental monitoring.
    Detailed statistical analysis of network performance over various operational
    scenarios is a part of our future development roadmap. In future iterations, we
    plan to conduct a more thorough analysis of network performance under different
    environmental conditions and settings. This will include detailed statistical
    analysis of packet delivery rates, signal strength variations, and the impact
    of different LoRaWAN parameters on overall network performance. Our commitment
    to enhancing and refining our WQMS-LoRaWAN system will continue, with a focus
    on optimizing network parameters for diverse deployment scenarios and improving
    the system’s overall reliability and efficiency. Recognizing the benefit of community
    contributions to improve and adapt our system, we will make the schematics and
    software open-source once we complete the project and registration process of
    copyright with the Intellectual Property Corporation of Malaysia (MyIPO). The
    complete hardware design files, sensor interface codes, and communication protocols
    will be accessed from the Institutional Repository (IR UMPSA). This is to encourage
    developers and researchers to replicate and expand upon our system and contribute
    to its ongoing improvement. For the system''s future enhancement, we recommend
    adding sensors like electrical conductivity, ORP, DO, and a GPS sensor to give
    a more detailed water quality assessment. Investing in higher quality, albeit
    pricier, sensors can refine accuracy and cater to commercialization. Streamlining
    electrical connections with a printed circuit board can conserve space and boost
    efficiency. Our system presently monitors only four water quality parameters.
    Expanding this with sensors detecting parameters such as Manganese, Ammonia-Nitrogen,
    and Nitrate-Nitrogen can offer insights into water quality classifications, which
    could be integrated into our GUI dashboard. Enhancing the battery life and conducting
    thorough research on LoRa communication metrics are essential. Integrating multiple
    sensing units and employing deep learning models can help in predicting rural
    water quality. These recommendations, combined with insights from our study, can
    further LoRaWAN-based IoT applications in rural areas. For further enhancement
    of our system, we also suggest a focused integration of artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. This would empower the system to understand
    and adapt to the nuances of water quality, building on long-term monitoring data.
    Collaborating with environmental specialists could allow the inclusion of a broader
    set of sensors, thereby broadening the scope of contamination detection. Engaging
    local communities might provide invaluable insights that could be used to refine
    the monitoring approach. The application of AI and ML can transform the system
    from merely recording data to forecasting potential water quality changes, facilitating
    a proactive approach to interventions. As the system''s reach is expanded to encompass
    diverse water sources, the addition of geographic information systems (GIS) can
    significantly enhance spatial analytics, guiding water quality improvement initiatives
    in specific areas. For a comprehensive understanding of water quality in rural
    areas, future research should adopt an interdisciplinary approach, integrating
    technological advances with socio-economic evaluations. Engaging with social scientists
    and local community leaders will be crucial to unravel the intricacies of cultural
    and economic influences on water quality and to devise strategies that are both
    technologically sound and socially attuned. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an important indicator of aquaculture water quality.
    The prediction accuracy of DO content is the key role in managing and controlling
    aquaculture water quality. However, potential trends of DO under various conditions
    (such as weather) are always overlooked. This study aims to develop a novel DO
    forecasting model using the optimized regularized extreme learning machine (RELM)
    with factor extraction operation and K-medoids clustering strategy in a black
    bass aquaculture pond. We adopt the leave-one-out cross (LOO) error validation
    to obtain the optimal regularization parameter of RELM and enhance the forecasting
    accuracy. We further adjust the activation function to accelerate the RELM. Next,
    we divide the time series into day and night segments, and construct the clustering
    mechanism with the K-medoids method to extract the different patterns of data
    streams under various weather conditions. The experiments on 14 days’ data from
    a real-world aquaculture pond demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our proposed
    DO prediction model. We believe that our research will facilitate the development
    of a forecasting tool for warning hypoxia in the near future, which combines intelligent
    prediction models and real-time data. Previous article in issue Next article in

    extreme learning machine 1. Introduction Dissolved oxygen (DO) content is a crucial
    indicator in large-scale and high density aquaculture (Jasmin et al., 2022). When
    the dissolved oxygen in the water is supersaturated, the fish is prone to bubble
    disease. Meanwhile, when DO concentration is lower than 1 mg/L, it will cause
    slow growth and even death of fish by long floating head. So it is important to
    monitor and maintain an optimal concentration level of DO content more than 5
    mg/L in aquaculture water (Baghel et al., 2022). However, predicting the change
    of DO content is a nonlinear and complex task that depends largely on the historical
    water quality and meteorological conditions. Fortunately, nowadays online aquaculture
    monitoring system can regularly collect water and meteorological data streams
    in real time using various internet of things (IOT) devices (such as sensors and
    automatic meteorological station). These collected data provide the prior knowledge
    of aquaculture environment to help control and maintain the water quality during
    production. Therefore, this paper aims to develop an accurate prediction model
    using water quality and meteorological data. Refer to the prediction results,
    we can take actions in advance to maintain the DO content level. The current research
    method is mainly to use multiple correlation factors to predict dissolved oxygen
    content. Based on the different inputs of the prediction model, the major methods
    of water quality prediction can be generally categorized into two groups, which
    are based on water parameter input and mixed parameter input prediction. The principle
    of DO prediction based on water parameter input is to build a model trained based
    on only historical water parameters (Díaz Muñiz et al., 2012). Although these
    prediction models are simple, it is not accurate enough. Thus, most existing works
    adopt the mixed parameter including water and meteorological factors as input
    to realize prediction using more complex learning models (Ahmed and Lin, 2021,
    Liu et al., 2013). We review the state-of-the-art techniques for both DO prediction
    and analysis using water and meteorological factors. Many learning algorithms
    are adopted in the DO prediction models, or modified and improved to enhance the
    performance of the prediction methods, include, SVM (Li and Hu, 2012, Ouma et
    al., 2020, Li et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2013, Liu et al., 2014, Yu et al., 2016),
    and artificial neural networks (Ahmed and Lin, 2021, Çakmak and Yıldız, 2011,
    Cao et al., 2021, Guo et al., 2022, Guo et al., 2022, Huang et al., 2021, Liang
    et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2019) and etc. Support vector machine (SVM) is a traditional
    supervised learning model. When the number of observations is large, the efficiency
    of SVM is low for limited high-dimensional mapping capability of kernel functions.
    Artificial neural network (ANN) is a widely used method that can automatically
    adapt to different training data. However, these models have the limitations of
    long runtime, low generalization performance and poor universality because of
    the complexity of the DO prediction task. Among these learning algorithms, extreme
    learning machine (ELM) is an efficient neural network for its simpler structure
    (Huang et al., 2012). However, the output matrix of hidden layer is unstable,
    which reduces the generalization ability and robustness of ELM. Therefore, many
    intelligent methods have been applied to deal with these problems in different
    practical applications (Huang et al., 2019, Hua et al., 2022; Huan et al., 2023;
    Udmale and Singh, 2019; Xie et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020). In particular,
    the optimized ELM algorithms have been developed for aquaculture. The multi-scale
    character of data is often ignored in these studies. A dissolved oxygen prediction
    model based on multi-factor and multi-scale is proposed using grey relational
    analysis, EEMD, sample entropy and RELM (Cao et al., 2019). However, the diurnal
    variation characteristics of these data streams are overlooked. The intelligent
    learning algorithm and feature analysis improved the forecasting accuracy, but
    they are not efficient enough due to the aquaculture environment characteristics
    of strong disturbance and complexity. To better model the DO change, it is more
    effective to analyze the correlation among multiple water quality parameters,
    rather than only using the historical DO time series. Singh et al. (2009) computed
    the relative importance of each variable to select six variables from 11 factors
    and construct the inputs of ANN prediction model. Gazzaz et al. (2012) employed
    principal factor analysis to determine 23 variables as predictors from the initial
    36 monitored parameters ANN model. Cao et al. (2020) adopted Principal component
    analysis (PCA) to select the key factors from the original acquisition parameters
    which affect the changes of DO before constructing the prediction model. Nong
    et al. (2023) use different methods to achieve the feature selection of multi-parameters
    as a predictor for prediction model, and verified the impact of these approaches
    on prediction performance. Analysis of correlation among multiple water quality
    parameters in these studies improved the prediction accuracy, and provide the
    theoretical basis for our research. In this study, we argue that both factors
    selection and potential patterns in data streams are the most important clues
    for enhancing the prediction accuracy and efficiency. Meanwhile, the prediction
    based on multiple factors of water quality data still cannot achieve high precision
    prediction due to the lack of effective data characteristics. Similar days was
    defined to capture the characteristics of DO, then K-means method is utilized
    to cluster historical data and forecast DO content (Huan et al., 2017). Actually,
    the photosynthesis of phytoplankton is strong during the day, and DO content in
    aquaculture pond is high. At night, the photosynthesis of phytoplankton stops,
    and the respiration process of various organisms gradually reduces the amount
    of DO. Therefore, our previous work provides a clustering-based softplus extreme
    learning machine (CSELM) method to capture the characteristics of time series
    data (Shi et al., 2019). In this paper, our insight is to analyze the day and
    night variation rhythm of DO, and use an optimized ELM model to achieve DO content
    forecasting in aquaculture production. Based on these works, we propose a novel
    K-medoids and leave-one-out cross (LOO) based RELM (K-medoids-LRELM) method for
    forecasting DO content. Based on relationship analysis, the key factors impact
    on DO concentration are selected in the construction of prediction model. Meanwhile,
    the clustering mechanism based on K-medoids clustering and time series similarity
    measuring is developed to capture the feature of day and night DO time series.
    And dynamic time warping is applied to measure the similarity of time series which
    are segmented by the day and night time of aquaculture season. To solve the problem
    of over-fitting, we adopt RELM to improve the generalization ability of ELM. LOO
    error validation operation is utilized to obtain the regularization parameters
    of RELM neural network. In summary, our contributions are the following threefold.
    (1) We consider two aspects of dissolved oxygen content, i.e., day-night variation
    rhythm and correlation of all attributes, to enhance dissolved oxygen prediction.
    We believe that this real-world diurnal patterns will play a significant role
    in dissolved oxygen prediction research. (2) We conduct correlation exploration
    to extract the key factors. We calculate the similarity of weather time series
    data streams and cluster them based on similarity. This clustering mechanism can
    reduce the dimension of data and capture the potential patterns of these data
    streams. (3) We adopt the LOO approach to optimize the RELM and increase its stability.
    Meanwhile, a superior K-medoids-LRELM model is designed reasonably based on ablation
    and comparison experiments, which achieves a good efficiency and accuracy for
    diurnal data patterns. The experiments on the real-world production datasets demonstrate
    that the proposed method performs better than three counterpart methods (partial
    least squares optimized ELM, least square support vector machine and a clustering-based
    softplus ELM) in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The rest of this paper is organized
    as follows: Section 2 presents materials and methods in detail. Section 3 presents
    the results and discussion. Section 4 reports the numerical results of this paper
    to obtain some conclusions. 2. Materials and methods In this section, we present
    the data acquisition in Section 2.1, provide an overview of the proposed method
    in Section 2.2, and detail three key techniques of the proposed method: feature
    selection based on Pearson correlation coefficient (in Section 2.3.); clustering
    water quality data according to the similarity of weather data (in Section 2.4.);
    constructing prediction model (in Section 2.5.); baselines and evaluation metrics
    (in Section 2.6.); optimal activation function selection (in Section 2.7.). Table

    system to collect all data from the Nanquan fishery aquaculture test base in Wuxi
    city, Jiangsu province, China (31°43′N, 120°29′E). The base is close to Lake Taihu
    and has aquatic resources. There are four testing ponds with recirculating aquaculture
    systems, which are equipped with the IoT monitoring system, aerating equipment
    and many kinds of sensors deployed at a depth of 0.5 m underwater. These sensors
    are integrated under a float with a solar panel 5 m from the pond shore. The automatic
    weather station is installed 1 m from the pond shore. The areas of these four
    testing ponds are similar, almost 1800 square meters (30 ×60 m), the depth of
    the pond was 1.5 m. And culture species were black bass, with a stocking density
    of 2.8 tails per square meter. This study utilizes the No.1 pond monitoring data
    as the experiment dataset. The IoT monitoring system collects water quality data
    and weather data using water quality monitoring nodes and an automatic weather
    station, as shown in Fig. 1a). Water quality monitoring nodes are actually three
    types of underwater sensors to collect three types of data (namely, DO, pH and
    water temperature (WT)), and automatic weather station are deployed to gather
    nine types of weather data (namely, air temperature (AT), humidity (Hu), atmospheric
    pressure (AP), carbon dioxide (CO2), illumination intensity (II), photosynthetically
    active radiation (PAR), radiance (Ra), wind speed (WS) and wind direction (WD)).
    Both water quality data and weather data are transmitted from the aquaculture
    site to remote user terminals (e.g., PC terminal or mobile terminal) via GPRS
    server. Therefore, users can obtain real-time water quality data from water quality
    sensor nodes in Fig1 b) and meteorological data from automatic weather station
    in Fig. 1c) through accessing the server using mobile phones or computers. Download

    The IoT monitoring system for data acquisition. 2.2. Overview of the proposed
    method Considering the fact that the dissolved oxygen content changes differently
    under different weather conditions, our strategies for further improving the prediction
    precision include (1) clustering water quality data into different groups according
    to their different weather conditions and using the historical water quality data
    in the same group for prediction; (2) building a DO prediction model based on
    the regularized ELM with LOO cross validation operation (Vehtari et al., 2017).
    To capture the potential trends, all collected raw data were pre-processed by
    feature selection and data clustering. Then different optimized machine learning
    models were applied to determine the most suitable DO prediction model. Moreover,
    based on the training and testing, we verified the validity and rationality of
    the proposed model. The detailed steps are presented in Fig. 2. Download : Download
    high-res image (601KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Workflow of
    K-medoids-LRELM prediction model. Step 1: Feature selection. All data will be
    selected in the data preprocess. Pearson correlation coefficient is utilized for
    feature selection, that is, to choose key factors that have a significant influence
    on DO according to the correlation coefficient value. During the feature selection
    process, the noise interference and information redundancy may also be reduced.
    Step 2: Data clustering. After feature selection, dividing weather data sets into
    several day and night time series according to the sunrise and sunset time of
    the farming period. Based on the time similarity of segmented weather factors
    time series computed by DTW method, the clustering operation is realized to capture
    potential patterns of these time series for improving the prediction accuracy.
    Thus these time series are divided into several clusters based on time similarity
    using the K-medoids method. K groups of data sets will be obtained by two common
    cluster validity indices. Step 3: Prediction model construction. In this process,
    an improved ELM prediction model is constructed under different weather features.
    And the LOO validation approach is applied to optimize the regularization parameters
    of the ELM neural network, which ensures to solve the problem of over-fitting
    and improve the generalization ability. In different clusters, different forecasting
    sub-models are built with different regularization parameters. All datasets are
    divided into training sets and testing sets. We use the training dataset to obtain
    the optimum parameters and then construct the K-medoids-LRELM prediction model.
    Step 4: Assessment and analysis. A testing dataset is used to evaluate the performance
    of the proposed model. Meanwhile, different prediction models are chosen for comparison
    to verify the effectiveness and suitability. 2.3. Feature selection based on Pearson
    correlation coefficient Feature selection can identify and select the highly related
    factors to the target factor. Some feature selection methods are implemented to
    analyze the insights about these correlations and their importance and identify
    key factors for the target factor. They are useful for eliminating irrelevant
    features, reducing data dimensions, avoiding information redundancy, and improving
    prediction accuracy and efficiency (Cao et al., 2020, Guo et al., 2022). Pearson
    correlation coefficient is one of the most common correlation analysis method.
    It is utilized to measure the strength of the linear relationship between two
    variables. Based on the Pearson correlation coefficient results, the factors that
    have a high correlation with the target factor are selected as key factors. We
    assume that there are two correlation factor vectors, x and y. The formula of
    Pearson correlation coefficient between x and y is presented as follows. (1) where
    xi, yi are the ith element of x and y, n denotes the length of vector, and stand
    for the mean value of x and y, respectively. 2.4. Clustering water quality data
    according to the similarity of weather data 2.4.1. Computing similarity of time
    series DO content has the distinct diurnal patterns, and it is significantly affected
    by the water quality and meteorological factors. So, DO will naturally reflect
    the variations under the similar weather conditions. Meanwhile, the patterns in
    daytime and night impacted by the meteorological factors are very different (Huan
    et al., 2017, Shi et al., 2019). It is necessary to partition the DO datasets
    into two parts: day and night, and compute the similarities of these time series;
    each day time series starts at 6:00 am and ends at 7:00 pm, and each night time
    series starts at 7:00 pm and ends at 6:00 am. Thus the lengths of these segmented
    time series are different. To compute the similarity of these time series, DTW
    can be used to solve the matching problem with varying lengths. A successful example
    is, Kate (2016) utilized DTW distance to calculate the similarities of different
    length time series. In DTW distance, given the involved two time series, R= {R1,R2,…,Rm}
    and T = {T1,T2,…,Tn}, where m and n represent the length of time series R and
    T, respectively, and m may not equal to n. Thus, it forms a m-by-n matrix Dm×n
    of R and T, where each element (i, j) of Dm×n corresponds to a distance dij = (Ri-Tj)2.
    (2) The DTW distance value of R and T can be expressed as (3) where W= {W1,W2,…,Wk}
    is the warping path, and Wk denotes the kth element of W. Also, it is subject
    to the boundary condition, monotonicity condition and continuity condition. Boundary
    denotes that the warping path starts at point (i1, j1)= (1, 1) and ends at point
    (ik, jk)= (m, n). Monotonicity denotes that the warping path increases monotonically
    without retrogression. The continuity stands for that the steps in the grid are
    confined to points with ik-ik-1≤ 1 and jk-jk-1≤ 1. Based on the dynamic programming,
    the following recurrence relation is applied to find the warping path. (4) where
    S(i, j) is the cumulative distance of dij, the detailed calculation process of
    DTW distance is shown in Table 2. Table 2. Calculations of the DTW distance between
    time series R and T. 2.4.2. The K-medoids clustering based on similarity As an
    unsupervised learning method, clustering is effective to divide data into several
    types. Particularly, for the unlabeled data, clustering can search the inherent
    regularity of samples without training. The similarity of time series can reflect
    the actual relations among them. The smaller similarity value means the bigger
    difference between these time series. Based on the similarity of time series,
    clustering method can capture the features of all datasets in day and night. K-medoids
    is a classical clustering algorithm, which is related to K-means (Johnson et al.,
    2019). The basic idea of K-medoids is to minimize squared error, which denotes
    the distance between the designated point (medoid) of a cluster and points in
    the cluster. Actually, the medoid is the center of a cluster, which has the minimal
    average dissimilarity to all objects in a cluster. We suppose that there are n
    objects divided into K (K< n) clusters. The K-medoids clustering based on time
    series similarity can be detailed as follows. (1) Randomly select K objects from
    all objects as the initial centers of K clusters. (2) Assign each object to the
    nearest cluster center by applying a distance measurement to calculate the cost.
    (3) Find a new set of K objects as the medoids and calculate the cost of these
    new sets. (4) If the new sets have a greater cost than the old cost, then terminate
    this algorithm. (5) Repeat the last three steps until there is no change in the
    medoids. In the above process, the formula of the cost for current cluster configuration
    is given as follows. (5) where z stands for the set of medoids, x denotes the
    samples in each cluster Cj, d represents the distance function which can be modified,
    and Euclidean distance is adopted in this paper, zj represents the jth medoid.
    2.4.3. The clustering performance index In K-medoids, the initial parameter K,
    directly affects the clustering performance. The Elbow method is applied to find
    the best cluster number in K-medoids. In order to evaluate the performance of
    the proposed clustering method, we use two common cluster validity indices, Davies-Bouldin
    (DB) and Sum of the Squared Error (SSE), to assess the performance by selecting
    the different initial medoids (Sassi, 2012). DB index denotes the ratio of the
    average distance within each cluster to the distance between the medoids of any
    two clusters. Smaller VDB value indicates the better clustering performance. SSE
    index calculates the sum of distances, which is calculated by the distance between
    cluster distance and medoids of K clusters. VSSE value is plotted against different
    values of K and the elbow method (Liu and Deng, 2020) is used to identify the
    point where VSSE value drops sharply, indicating the optimal cluster number, K.
    Generally, the optimal cluster number, K, is chosen as the one that corresponds
    to the elbow point on the VSSE plot, K, and combines with the VDB value. Then,
    the calculation formulas for VDB and VSSE index are given as follows. (6) (7)
    (8) (9) where Si represents the compactness in Ci, Sj represents the compactness
    in Cj, Ci and Cj denote the ith cluster and jth cluster, respectively, dij denotes
    the distance between center point zi in cluster Ci and center point zj in cluster
    Cj. 2.5. Constructing prediction model 2.5.1. LOO error validation optimized RELM
    with Softplus function ELM is a simple and effective learning algorithm for single
    hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs). The notable merit of ELM is
    that the input weights and hidden biases are randomly chosen, whereby the output
    weights need to be determined using the Moore-Penrose generalized pseudo inverse.
    Given a data set, (xi, ti), i = 1,2,…,N with N samples, the standard SLFNs with
    L hidden nodes and the activation function g(x) can be expressed as (10) where
    xi= [xi1, xi2,…, xin]T is the ith input, ti= [ti1,ti2,…,tim]T is the output, n
    is the dimension of each sample, and m is class number of total samples, oi represents
    the network output corresponding to the input xi, wi and bi are the weights of
    the hidden neuron to input, and the bias of the ith hidden neuron. wj= [wj1,wj2,…,wjn]T
    and βj= [βj1,βj2,…,βjm]T are the weight vector connecting the jth hidden node
    to the input nodes, and the weight vector connecting the jth hidden node to the
    output nodes respectively, wj∙xi denotes the inner product of wj and xi. To get
    the minimum objective function , ELM utilizes random parameters wi, bi to realize
    Emof= 0 and overcome these disadvantages such as local minimals, overfitting,
    etc. Eq. (10) can be expressed as follows: (11) with (12) where H denotes the
    output matrix of hidden layer, and β represents the output weight matrix, the
    jth column of H is the output of jth hidden layer unit, j = 1,2,…, L. Actually
    the only parameter need to be calculated in ELM training is output weight matrix
    β, which is a least squares problem and can be easily done by , H+ is the Moore-Penrose
    inverse of H, which can be given through orthogonal projection, i.e., H+= (HTH)−1HT.
    Based on the ridge regression technique, the ELM algorithm can improve its generalization
    performance and stability by adding the value 1/λ to the HTH or HHT when calculating
    β. This operation can solve the problem of numerical instability of the pseudo-inverse.
    To optimize the solution, the regularized least squares method is often used (Heeswijk
    and Miche, 2015). The corresponding regression formula is expressed as (13) where
    λ stands for the regularization parameter to balance the regularization term and
    the training error term. The solution of Eq.(12) is computed in (Huang et al.,
    2015): (14) where I denotes the identity matrix. The LOO approach is well known
    for the procedure of model selection and parameter tuning. It is the most commonly
    applied in machine learning models, such as the ELM model. With N samples, the
    data is divided into a training set with N-1 samples and a test set with 1 sample.
    This is repeated N times, causing every sample to be used as test sample. For
    linear-in-parameter models, the mean square error (MSE) of the LOO computing process
    can be simplified by using the predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS) statistic
    (Heeswijk and Miche, 2015). The calculation of PRESS based MSE named (MSEPRESS)
    is given by (15) where ti is the desired output of ith sample, and oi is actual
    output value of ith sample. HATii is the ith diagonal element value of HAT matrix,
    which can be simply written as follows: (16) Different parameter values λ of RELM
    have different performances, thus, finding the optimal regularization parameter
    is important. When using the LOO validation approach, the ELM model can obtain
    the optimal regularization parameter. Although the PRESS statistic can speed up
    the LOO procedure, it still takes time to recompute the pseudo-inverse for each
    regularization parameter and select the optimum parameter. To alleviate this problem,
    the singular value decomposition (SVD) is utilized to decompose matrix H into
    H=UDVT, obtaining the following results, where D stands for the diagonal matrix,
    and HATr stands for the HAT matrix calculated in RELM. (17) (18) And the calculation
    of MSEPRESS in RELM is also redefined as (19) The calculation of MSEPRESS is closely
    related to the actual output and the diagonal of HATr. The optimal parameter,
    λ, is selected from the candidates that correspond to the minimum MSEPRESS value
    in Eq.(18). Since Eq.(16) and Eq.(17) are irrelevant with U and V, respectively,
    the calculation of H=UDVT is replaced. We decompose the HTH by HTH=VD2VT in Eq.
    (16) and HHT=UD2UT in Eq. (17). Meanwhile, these repetitive matrices like HV and
    HU in the above formulas are irrelevant with the parameter, λ. It is efficient
    to pre-compute these repetitive matrices before calculating the MSEPRESS value
    and obtaining the optimal regularization parameter λopt. Then, we can achieve
    the corresponding optimal output weight as follows: (20) (21) Activation function
    is a crucial factor that affects the ELM network performance. Standard ELM utilizes
    the sigmoid function as the activation function. However, the sigmoid function
    has a high computational complexity, and suffers from the problem of vanishing
    gradient. Softplus function is a smoothed form of the rectified linear units function
    (ReLU) and more similar to the activation model of the brain neurons than ReLU.
    It overcomes the above problems by employing lax sparse limits, which has good
    generalization performance and reduce the interdependence of parameters [Liu et
    al. (2018)]. Therefore, we adopt softplus function as the new activation function
    of the optimized RELM. This function can efficiently save time in calculation.
    The softplus formula is defined as (22) 2.6. Baselines & evaluation metrics In
    this study, we compare K-medoids-LRELM with the following models in ablation experiments
    and comparison experiments. ELM: Extreme learning machine. It is a single-hidden
    layer feed-forward neural network. In this paper, softplus function is used as
    activation function for DO prediction. RELM: Regularized extreme learning machine
    is an optimized method of extreme learning machine using regularization parameter.
    LRELM: Leave-one-out cross validation based regularized extreme learning machine
    combines leave-one-out validation approach to compute optimal regularization parameter,
    and linear regression to speed up training. PLS-ELM (Zhao et al., 2013): Partial
    least squares optimized extreme learning machine applies partial least squares
    to extract the orthogonal variable in hidden layer. LSSVM (Liu et al., 2014):
    Least square support vector machine is an optimized method of support vector machine
    using least square method. CSELM (Shi et al., 2019): CSELM applied clustering
    method to extract features information, and partial least squares to extract the
    orthogonal variable in hidden layer. This paper utilizes root mean square error
    (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), nash–sutcliffe efficiency (ENASH) (Zhou et
    al., 2021) and run time to evaluate the performance of the prediction model. RMSE
    and MAE can reflect the accuracy of prediction performance from different mathematical
    perspectives. The lower RMSE and MAE values indicate more precise model. ENASH
    can express the predictive power of constructed model. The higher ENASH value
    indicates the model has stronger predictive power. Meanwhile, we compare the prediction
    performance by computing the F1Score, F2Score and F3Score (Chen et al., 2021),
    when the evaluation metrics (i.e., RMSE, MAE, ENASH and Time) are inconsistent.
    The lower F1Score and F2Score values indicate a more precise and efficient model.
    The higher F3Score value indicates a more stable model. These indicators are computed
    by formulas (22)-(27). (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) In these formulas, N is the
    total number of data, yi is the observed data value and is the prediction value,
    denotes the average of observed value. 2.7. Optimal activation function selection
    We choose the sigmoid, radbas, hardlim, tanh and softplus functions as the activation
    functions for ELM and test their actual performance respectively. Meanwhile, we
    compare these ELM prediction models with different functions on the same dataset
    and parameters. The prediction performances in testing dataset are shown in Fig.
    3. Download : Download high-res image (389KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 3. Prediction performance values of different activation functions in ELM.
    It can be seen clearly that the ELM with hardlim function has the best performance
    in terms of RMSE and ENASH in Fig. 3. On the other hand, the ELM with softplus
    function is the fastest and has similar RMSE, MAE and ENASH values to the hardlim
    function. Moreover, the ELM with softplus function outperforms the others in F1Score,
    F2Score and F3Score, indicating its superior performance. From the analysis and
    results above, it is feasible to select the softplus as activation function in
    ELM prediction model. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. The implementations and settings
    To achieve accurate prediction of DO, we segment the data streams into day and
    night. Then, we also divide the prediction model into several sub-models. In this
    paper, the total of 8967 data sets are comprised in 126 time series (or data streams).
    These data streams include day streams and night streams. The segmentation basis
    of time series is the sunrise and sunset times throughout the experiment period.
    The final partition time point is determined as follows: each day stream runs
    from 6:00 am to 7:00 pm, and each night stream runs from 7:00 pm to 6:00 am. The
    numbers of hidden nodes for each sub-prediction model are set as 25, 41, 38 and
    75 by the empirical formula (Tang et al., 2017), respectively. The detailed structures
    are shown in Table 3. All experiments are conducted on MATLAB and run on a PC
    with 2.9 GHz Core(TM) i7–7500 U processor, 16.0 G memory, and Microsoft Windows

    the training set, and the remaining 1890 sets of data are selected as the testing
    sets. The daily mean and variation values of DO concentration from July to September

    Meanwhile, the average DO concentration of the whole dataset is 2.0717 mg/L. Table

    359 Meanwhile, all key input factors can be extracted by the correlation coefficient
    value based on feature selection. Fig. 5 shows the correlation coefficients heat
    map between DO content and the other factors by using the Pearson. It can be clearly
    seen from Fig. 5 that DO is positively correlated to pH, AT, WT, II, WS, PAR,
    Ra, and negatively correlated to Hu, AP, WD and CO2. The absolute correlation
    coefficient value of each factor is ranked from top to bottom as pH, AT, Hu, WT,
    II, WS, PAR, Ra, AP, WD and CO2. It is obviously that pH has the maximum correlation
    coefficient value, and the AP, WD and CO2 have low correlation coefficient value
    less than 0.1. Therefore, this paper chooses pH, AT, Hu, WT, II, WS, PAR, Ra as
    the input of DO content prediction model to reduce the dimension of the dataset.

    parameters for time series clustering The segmented time series are clustered
    according to DTW similarity using the K-medoids method. In order to obtain the
    optimal cluster number, we compute the different VDB values under different cluster
    numbers, and plot the results in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (125KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. The results of SSE values of each
    cluster. It is clear that when K= 2, the corresponding VDB value was lowest (0.0455),
    and much lower than the other VDB values. But when K = 4, it also achieves a lower
    VDB values. To choose and assess the optimal cluster number, K, comprehensively,
    the illustration of the cluster number, K, on the elbow method was utilized in
    this section, which is a graph of the relationship between the cluster number
    and the sum of squared errors. Generally, when the value of K increases, the graph
    will decrease slowly until the squared error value is stable. The elbow point
    in graph is always determined as the ideal cluster. Then, we used the K-medoids
    clustering and elbow method on the segmented time series to determine the optimal
    K value. The VSSE for different values of K are shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen
    clearly that the VSSE decreases drastically from K= 2 to K= 3, K= 3 to K= 4, and
    K= 4 to K= 5. Moreover, the VDB value at K= 4 is VDB = 0.5608, which is lower
    than the VDB values at K= 3, 5. Thus, we chose K= 4 as the optimal cluster number.
    The clustering results for different values of K are shown in Fig. 6. From Fig.
    7, the samples in K= 4 have a high level of concentration in each cluster, and
    a relatively high dispersion degree. The cluster number has better clustering
    effect than the cluster number in K= 2 and K= 3. Download : Download high-res

    experiment In order to verify the effectiveness of different optimization operations,
    we conducted the ablation experiment using LRELM, RELM and ELM in 14 days (almost
    1890 time points). The forecasting results of dissolved oxygen content are shown
    in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image (680KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Forecasting results of different optimized operations in ELM. So,
    from the results in Fig. 8, we can conclude that all prediction algorithms can
    achieve DO prediction, but the effect varies greatly. The proposed K-medoids-LRELM
    realize the best effect among the other algorithms. It is obvious from Fig. 8(a)-(g)
    that the prediction curve of K-medoids-LRELM is the closest one to the real data.
    Also, to illustrate the difference in prediction results more clearly, Fig. 9
    displays the forecasting errors of different optimization operations for ELM in
    14 days (almost 1890 time points). Download : Download high-res image (676KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Forecasting errors of different optimized
    operations on ELM in 14 days. It can be seen clearly from Fig. 9, the black error= 0
    line is the zero reference line. The closer to the zero reference line, the better
    the prediction curve. Although all four forecasting algorithms can predict dissolved
    oxygen, K-medoids-LRELM has the closest forecasting curve to the zero reference
    line in Fig. 9(a)-(g). However, K-medoids-LRELM has unsatisfactory results in
    some time intervals (e.g., 19:00–03:00 in Fig. 9(d), Fig. 9(g)). The main reasons
    are as follows. First, the air temperature varies greatly in 19:00–03:00, which
    also affects the frequency of DO change. Second, due to the respiration of alga,
    the patterns in this time interval are completely different from those in other
    time intervals. Thus, the forecasting results of above algorithms have large differences.
    Still, K-medoids-LRELM algorithm has the minimal error. The performance results
    of models with different optimized operations are shown in Fig. 10 and Table 5.

    RELM 1.573 0.2322 1.1663 0.0365 ELM 1.6604 0.1444 1.3218 1.3451 As illustrated
    in Fig. 10, it is obvious that K-medoids-LRELM model performed differently using
    different optimized operations. In K-medoids-LRELM, its R2 reaching 0.7168, and
    most predicted DO values can approach the observed DO. However, there are still
    some predicted values of dissolved oxygen with more deviations from the observed
    values. Combined with Fig. 4 and Fig. 9, it is obviously that when the daily variation
    value of DO concentration is large, the forecast error of the model will increase.
    Among these deviation values, most cases are lower than the observed value, and
    few cases are higher than the observed value. When analyzing these sample points
    with large continuous deviations, we find that they are mostly concentrated between
    4 pm and 7 pm. Due to the time delay of water temperature, the DO of the water
    body changes significantly in this time period, and the prediction effect of model
    is not good. Meanwhile, the proposed K-medoids-LRELM obtains the minimal RMSE
    value (0.9755) and minimal MAE value (0.6993), which are lower than the other
    three methods in Table 5. It outperforms LRELM, RELM and ELM by 29.81%, 37.98%
    and 41.25%, respectively in terms of RMSE index. When compared to the LRELM, RELM
    and ELM, it also improved 31.82%, 40.04% and 48.01%, respectively in terms of
    MAE index. The ENASH index value of K-medoids-LRELM is 0.7047, which is closer
    to 1 than the other counterpart methods (LRELM, RELM and ELM). The running time
    of K-medoids-LRELM is 0.1162 s, which is shorter than ELM and longer than LRELM,
    RELM. So, the comparison of LRELM and K-medoids-LRELM methods shows that the clustering
    operation can prolong the time of prediction and improve the forecasting accuracy.
    And the comparison of LRELM and RELM methods indicates that the LOO error validation
    optimization operation can reduce over-fitting and enhance the prediction accuracy.
    3.4.2. Comparison experiments To verify the superiority of the proposed prediction
    method, this paper compares it with the existing methods, such as PLS-ELM, LSSVM
    and CSELM methods, in terms of the actual prediction result and various performance
    indicators in 14 days (1890 time points). The predicted dissolved oxygen content
    values of these existing methods are shown in Fig. 11. Download : Download high-res
    image (710KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Predicted dissolved
    oxygen content values of different existing methods. We can see from Fig. 11 that
    all mentioned existing methods can achieve the prediction of dissolved oxygen
    content, but with varying effects. The prediction curve of K-medoids-LRELM matches
    the trend of real data well. Compared with the other three existing methods, K-medoids-LRELM
    outperforms the other three methods in Fig. 11 (a)-(f). However, its advantage
    is less evident in Fig. 11 (g). The predictive curves of the CSELM and LSSVM methods
    have poor predictive effect, the deviation degrees are also large. To demonstrate
    the superiority of K-medoids-LRELM, we plot the forecasting errors of the existing
    methods in Fig. 12. Download : Download high-res image (693KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 12. Forecasting errors of different existing methods in 14
    days. As shown in the above figure, the black line error= 0 is the zero reference
    line. The closer the prediction curve is to the zero reference line, the better
    it is. So, it is obviously shown that the forecasting curve of K-medoids-LRELM
    is the closest to the zero reference line. However, K-medoids-LRELM performs poorly
    in some time intervals (e.g., 19:00–03:00 in Fig. 12 (d), Fig. 12 (g)). The forecasting
    results are also unsatisfactory by using the counterpart methods. The predictive
    error of CSELM fluctuates sharply at some points. The predictive error curves
    of PLS-ELM and LSSVM are close. Moreover, the detail performances of the mentioned
    existing methods are shown in Fig. 13 and Table 6. Download : Download high-res

    1.5989 As illustrated in Fig. 13, it is obvious that the mentioned models performed
    differently with R2 values reaching 0.7168, 0.2458, 0.3691and 0.3243, respectively.
    Although there is still a certain amount of prediction bias, by comparison, the
    prediction results of the proposed method have smaller deviations from the observed
    values than the three counterpart models. Combined with Fig. 4 and Fig. 12, it
    is obviously that when the daily variation value of DO concentration is large,
    the forecast error of the model will increase. Meanwhile, for these biased samples,
    most of the predicted values are lower than the observed values. Although the
    prediction accuracy of proposed model under low oxygen condition is limited, it
    can still provide a basis for the regulation of DO. Meanwhile, in Table 6, K-medoids-LRELM
    achieves the lowest RMSE and MAE values (0.9755 and 0.6993), which are much lower
    than the three counterpart methods. It outperforms PLS-ELM, LSSVM and CSELM by
    40.51%, 45.91% and 55.07%, respectively in terms of RMSE index. It is also improved
    by 47.07%, 51.91% and 55.44%, respectively in terms of MAE index. These comparisons
    indicate that K-medoids-LRELM has high prediction accuracy. In terms of ENASH
    index, K-medoids-LRELM has a value close to 1, meaning it has strong predictive
    power. Moreover, K-medoids-LRELM has a shorter run time than the three counterpart
    methods, indicating it has a good prediction efficiency. To sum up, we conclude
    that the K-medoids-LRELM method is an effective method based on different optimization
    operations. They enhance the prediction accuracy and efficiency of K-medoids-LRELM
    by feature selection, clustering dataset and optimized parameters. Additionally,
    it can flexibly capture the potential patterns of data sets, improve the generalization
    ability of prediction model, and provide some reference for future research. 4.
    Conclusions This paper proposes a dissolved oxygen prediction method using the
    regularized ELM with an optimal regularization parameter and a clustering strategy.
    First, we utilize the Pearson coefficient to realize the feature selection from
    the water quality and meteorological factors. Then, the LOO error validation approach
    is applied to optimize the regularization parameter of ELM. We also use a clustering
    strategy based on time series similarity to capture data features and improve
    accuracy. To obtain the reasonable and effective clustering result, we use the
    DTW distance to measure the similarity of time series. Meanwhile, SSE and DB indicators
    are used to determine the optimal clustering number. We compare the proposed method
    with different prediction methods on the real-world monitoring data in aquaculture
    ponds. The experimental results show that our method outperforms three counterpart
    methods (PLS-ELM, LSSVM and CSELM) in prediction accuracy and efficiency. In terms
    of RMSE, it improved about 47.07%, 51.91% and 55.44%. However, the DO prediction
    performance of the proposed model is limited, and is not enough for the accurate
    management of DO concentration. This may provide potential ideas for further research.
    For instance, it is recommended to use different intelligent algorithms to optimize
    the parameter selection of RELM and improve the prediction accuracy. Also, performing
    hybrid models evaluating, as well as analyzing the association between DO and
    growth factors in aquaculture could be of interest. CRediT authorship contribution

    The Water Resources Agency of Taiwan plays a vital role in safeguarding lives
    and property by executing dredging projects to ensure the smooth flow of rivers
    and their capacity to discharge floods. However, these critical projects face
    a significant challenge, mainly involving the management of diverse and unpredictable
    dredging risks. These risks pose a multifaceted problem as even experienced dredging
    personnel, despite their extensive backgrounds, frequently need help with assessing
    and addressing these risks. As a result, senior personnel are often required to
    mentor and train recruits to complete dredging operations. Addressing the multifaceted
    challenges associated with dredging risks, which encompass diversification, unpredictability,
    and the intricate nature of these risks, is imperative. This research formulates
    effective strategies and solutions capable of managing and mitigating these challenges,
    ultimately enhancing the safety and success of dredging projects. Within this
    context, a prominent challenge is the transfer of professional knowledge. The
    retirement and resignation of experienced dredging personnel often disrupt the
    seamless transfer of their invaluable expertise. Recognizing this issue, experts
    in dredging have highlighted the potential of digitalization and systematic knowledge
    management to preserve this valuable knowledge. Despite some prior exploratory
    efforts, the implementation of expert systems in dredging projects still needs
    to be improved, particularly in addressing existing risk events. Consultations
    with experts highlight the need for more information within the knowledge base
    concerning managing dredging risk events, emphasizing the need for improvement.
    An ideal system should empower dredging personnel with tools for risk prevention
    planning and risk prediction analysis, enabling them to proactively anticipate
    the frequency, impact, and scope of risk events and to prepare for emergencies.
    Furthermore, the current knowledge base is hampered by its restricted accessibility,
    primarily dependent on computer queries. This constraint hinders knowledge acquisition
    and negatively affects its utility. To address this knowledge gap, we interviewed
    relevant personnel and dredging experts from various river management offices
    across Taiwan. These interviews were designed to gain insights into the practices
    of managing risk events during dredging projects and to gather suggestions for
    developing a dredging risk management system. The valuable insights provided by
    senior personnel played an instrumental role in creating a knowledge chatbot driven
    by deep learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP). This chatbot
    is seamlessly integrated with LINE, Taiwan''s most popular communication software,
    enabling efficient inquiries about risk knowledge. It provides immediate access
    to risk responses and practical decision-making support before and after risk
    events. This research introduces transformative solutions to the field of dredging
    project risk management. It effectively addresses long-standing challenges, providing
    a comprehensive and innovative response that significantly deviates from existing
    literature. Compared to previous works, which often needed more depth and breadth,
    this approach focuses on enriching the knowledge base and introducing an advanced
    risk classification model. It empowers dredging personnel with invaluable resources,
    facilitating well-informed decision-making and enhancing critical water conservancy
    projects'' overall effectiveness and safety. The research findings indicate that
    the adoption of a digitalized, chatbot-based system for dredging risk management
    can substantially improve the effectiveness of the Water Resources Agency of Taiwan
    in executing its crucial projects. It offers a transformative approach to addressing
    unpredictable and diverse dredging risks and ensures the preservation and transfer
    of invaluable expertise. By introducing a pioneering chatbot integrated with the
    LINE platform, this research also sets a new standard for accessibility and real-time
    interaction in the field, adding a unique dimension to the body of knowledge in
    dredging project risk management. This research flow is organized as follows.
    The relevant literature from various countries was studied, and the advantages
    and disadvantages of different risk-handling methods were identified. The knowledge
    base content and interview results were used to establish a natural-language deep-learning
    text-matching model for risk classification and response. The results obtained
    using the models were examined. Subsequently, the text-matching models were integrated
    with LINE to visualize the results. A user questionnaire was designed for personnel
    with dredging experience or knowledge, whose responses were used to improve the
    integrated system. The results of this study can serve as a reference for the
    government and the public. Conclusions are drawn, and suggestions are made at
    the end of this work. 2. Literature review 2.1. Importance of knowledge management
    in controlling dredging-related risks 2.1.1. Enhancing organizational performance
    through knowledge management Research has revealed that knowledge management has
    a positive effect on organizations. Combining knowledge and control can effectively
    reduce the negative impact of performance fluctuations and help to achieve preset
    organizational goals. However, knowledge management involves risks such as losing,
    hiding, and wasting knowledge (Durst et al., 2019). Therefore, managing knowledge
    comprehensively to reduce these risks while achieving organizational goals is
    an ongoing topic of discussion for organizations. 2.1.2. Knowledge transfer challenges
    in dredging projects Dredging projects in Taiwan frequently encounter various
    risks upon implementation (Braud et al., 2016). Owing to an organization''s lack
    of transfer of knowledge about standard operating procedures, a knowledge gap
    is created when experienced dredging personnel resign or retire. Recognizing the
    difficulty of knowledge management in dredging operations, an expert system supports
    engineering risk management by providing dredging personnel with information about
    countermeasures when dredging risks occur (Plate, 2002). Nevertheless, current
    database management systems have limited search functions, and personnel must
    first classify or determine the stage of a risk event before making further queries.
    Moreover, a generic expert system can only be operated using a computer system,
    so the time and place of use are constrained. Such a system provides no practical
    methods for handling many risk events, resulting in a low willingness to use it.
    In response to these challenges, this study has introduced deep learning and NLP
    techniques to address the limitations of previous methods. This transitioned the
    operating process of the knowledge base into an intuitive text-matching model.
    Additionally, the study upgraded the platform to be compatible with LINE, making
    it accessible to users at their convenience. Comprehensive interviews were conducted
    with dredging personnel and experts from ten river management offices to enhance
    risk management practices further. The culmination of these efforts resulted in
    the development of a chatbot capable of conveniently, rapidly, and accurately
    responding to keyword queries. This development has significantly increased user
    acceptance and contributed to the success of dredging projects, aligning with
    the broader context of knowledge management. 2.2. Use of text matching in knowledge
    management In recent years, deep learning has made substantial progress, encompassing
    improved image classification (Khan et al., 2022) and the advancement of sophisticated
    objects (Chandio et al., 2022; Lawal, 2021) and wildlife detection methods (Roy
    et al., 2023). These advancements collectively emphasize the ever-evolving nature
    of deep learning, highlighting the importance of staying at the forefront of technological
    advances to address real-world challenges effectively. In this section, we will
    introduce text matching in NLP and apply deep learning techniques to evolve text
    similarity calculations in NLP. 2.2.1. Text matching in natural language processing
    Text matching operation in the NLP model provides a question and potential answers
    (Dong et al., 2022; Longo et al., 2021). The process identifies the response that
    best answers the question by ranking the answers by the degree of matching (Nguyen
    et al., 2019). Hadi et al. developed a model based on MapReduce to improve the
    search engine results of the knowledge base in Arabic. It can compare query sentences
    with documents in the database and show the most relevant documents to the user
    (Hadi et al., 2019). This model fills the original expert system gaps and provides
    a more convenient and accurate querying method. 2.2.2. Evolution of text similarity
    calculations in NLP Conventional text similarity calculations rely on keyword-matching
    methods like N-gram (Cavnar and Trenkle, 2001). Nevertheless, the current NLP
    model constantly changes (Sung et al., 2023). The Bidirectional Encoder Representations
    from Transformers (BERT) (Devlin et al., 2018) language model that Google developed
    and the Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE) (Sun et
    al., 2019) language model that Baidu developed are now commonly used as benchmarks
    for evaluating NLP models around the world. These models are among the best for
    assessing general language understanding and perform excellently in text matching
    (Song et al., 2020). Moreover, they both provide Chinese language pre-trained
    models. Investigations have revealed that the BERT model has higher compatibility
    with other software than the ERNIE model, with comparable accuracy. Therefore,
    most studies (Song et al., 2019) that have developed NLP models have used BERT
    as the basis for subsequent expansion and application, and all of those models
    have achieved satisfactory results. Based on a comparison of models regarding
    openness, compatibility, and accuracy, the BERT pre-trained model is used herein
    as the internal text-matching model for the keyword search function to facilitate
    system querying by personnel, even with little dredging project experience. 2.3.
    Dredging risk classification 2.3.1. Conventional risk classification The conventional
    qualitative risk analysis method evaluates risk events'' occurrence rate, effect,
    and impact from interviews, questionnaires, and meetings and then classifies risks.
    Mahamid used a questionnaire to ask respondents about the impact and occurrence
    probabilities of risk factors that delay road construction projects and established
    a risk matrix divided into three categories (Mahamid, 2011). Lin et al. used the
    Improved Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP) to obtain the weight of the flash flood
    risk index, which effectively combines subjective characteristics and objective
    attributes for evaluation (Lin et al., 2020). Chou and Chiu identified 30 subclassifications
    of dredging risks and tabulated them in a questionnaire that was sent to 69 project
    management personnel; they finally established a Risk Impact-Frequency Analysis
    (RIFA) distribution map that was divided into four quadrants that corresponded
    to four main classifications (Chou and Chiu, 2021). The conventional risk classification
    method requires experts in specific fields to conduct experience-based assessments
    when encountering new risks. This process could be more convenient and conducive
    to real-time identifying unknown threats. Hence, it often results in erroneous
    judgments of risk impact, impact assessments, and poor handling of risk events.
    Therefore, this study considers the literature, and a risk classification prediction
    model that uses a deep learning technique is established to enable users to pre-classify
    risks before they occur. The RIFA distribution map developed is used for dredging
    risk classification and subsequent construction of a risk classification model.
    2.3.2. Application of text classification model to natural language processing
    Risk classification must generally be performed following expert evaluation whenever
    dredging personnel encounters new risks during dredging projects. However, quite
    apart from limited experience, human judgment and intuition are affected by prejudice
    (Escalante et al., 2015). To offset these shortcomings, in this work, deep learning
    text classification is performed using NLP to pre-classify new risk events. Text
    classification involves assigning preset categories to texts. For example, Liu
    et al. used Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify texts in the Newsgroups
    English open dataset (Hsu and Chang, 2020; Liu and Wang, 2019). After inputting
    texts into the text classification model, the model automatically analyzes and
    classifies its hidden attributes. Another application is that Quijano-Sánchez
    et al. used a combination of NLP and ML model, VeriPol, to spot and classify false
    robbery reports based solely on the text of a police report (Quijano-Sánchez et
    al., 2018). When organizing a risk event, humans judge its attributes based on
    personal experience and event descriptions. The internal mechanism is similar
    to text classification—however, variations in experience and subjectivity cause
    classification errors. The NLP model comprises two primary internal architectures,
    each offering distinct advantages. The first of these is the RNN structure, which
    includes well-established models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the
    improved Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014). RNNs are known for handling
    sequential data, making them suitable for tasks where context over time is critical.
    LSTM and GRU are extensively used and respected within the NLP community for their
    prowess in sequence modeling (Al Hamoud et al., 2022; Rafiq et al., 2023). In
    contrast, the second internal structure is the attention mechanism, exemplified
    in models like BERT and ERNIE. As per the studies conducted by various researchers
    (Kumar et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023), attention mechanisms excel in capturing
    contextual information and complex relationships within text data. Researchers
    in the field have recognized the outstanding capabilities of BERT, in particular,
    and its aptitude for handling intricate textual nuances (Beyer Díaz et al., 2023;
    Forth et al., 2023). This study aimed to evaluate and select the most suitable
    language model among LSTM, GRU, and BERT for the specific task of risk classification
    in dredging projects. Building upon the foundational work of previous researchers,
    the aim was to identify the optimal model capable of addressing the unique challenges
    posed by river dredging project risk management. 2.4. Verificatory view of chatbot
    design and development 2.4.1. Design and development Chatbots showcase their strengths
    across various domains. In the medical care sector, as exemplified by Roca et
    al. (2020), chatbots deliver specialized expertise, providing users with precise,
    domain-specific information that enhances the quality of responses. Furthermore,
    chatbots, including those in the medical care domain, as demonstrated by Kidwai
    and Nadesh (2020), harness Artificial intelligence (AI) prediction technology
    to furnish users with more accurate and relevant responses, thereby enriching
    the overall user experience. In specific contexts like disaster risk management,
    as Sermet and Demir (2018) highlighted, chatbots play a pivotal role by offering
    early warning features, especially valuable in scenarios where timely alerts are
    paramount for ensuring user safety. Furthermore, in domains like disaster risk,
    illustrated by Sermet and Demir (2018), chatbots utilize visual presentations
    to aid users in comprehending complex information through graphical representations,
    significantly enhancing data accessibility and comprehension. Additionally, chatbots
    in specific fields, such as banking, as evidenced by Doherty and Curran (2019),
    guarantee that users can access real-time information, keeping them informed with
    the latest data. A comprehensive overview of chatbot functionalities is presented
    in Table 1. It is worth noting that most systems employ NLP to make contextual
    judgments when users input text or voice. Interestingly, only two methods in the
    current literature offer prediction and early warning functions, underscoring
    the advanced capabilities of these particular chatbots. Table 1. Functions of
    chatbots in recent years. Related Paper Field Professional knowledge AI prediction

    risk knowledge chatbot (This study) Project risk Yes Yes No Yes No However, it''s
    crucial to consider the limitations. Not all chatbots, for instance, those in
    medical care, according to Beaudry et al. (2019), possess AI prediction capabilities,
    potentially depriving users of advanced AI-assisted insights that could enhance
    their decision-making processes. Additionally, some chatbots, even within the
    domain of disaster risk management, as observed in Chan and Tsai (2019), lack
    early warning functions, potentially limiting their utility in scenarios where
    advanced warnings are critical. In specific domains, like banking, as depicted
    by Nuruzzaman and Hussain (2020), chatbots do not provide visual presentations,
    which might challenge users when trying to understand complex information. Moreover,
    in some fields, such as tourism, as Casillo et al. (2020) noted, several chatbots
    do not offer real-time data, potentially affecting users'' ability to make well-informed
    decisions. Finally, in specific sectors, like medical care per Piau et al. (2019),
    chatbots may exhibit limited domain expertise, potentially offering users less
    specialized guidance than human experts, thus impacting the depth of support these
    chatbots provide. The prediction function of medical care can forecast the range
    of impacts of diseases and disasters and provide warnings of risk based on numerical
    analysis. The prediction method differs from the risk prediction model developed
    in this study. Each chatbot system above can give professional knowledge for users
    to query or lead users to answer necessary questions to help users obtain the
    required information. Some of the functions of the chatbots were applied to specific
    fields and for particular audiences. For example, the reservation function is
    inappropriate for this study. Still, artificial intelligence, prediction functions,
    and visual presentation methods are included in the design of the dredging risk
    system herein to help dredging personnel who use the developed chatbot to obtain
    information. 2.4.2. Development verification To meet users'' needs, factors influencing
    willingness to use a chatbot are investigated, and questionnaires for system verification
    are designed. A chatbot can identify meaning according to a text description that
    a user provides, and it offers appropriate responses, recommendations, and services
    to meet the user''s needs (Casillo et al., 2020). According to the literature
    review, factors that affect users’ system experiences include system aesthetics,
    customized functions (Chakrabarti and Luger, 2015), ease of operation (Agarwal
    and Karahanna, 2000), usefulness of provided information (Maybury, 2006), information
    credibility and system reputation (Chattaraman et al., 2012), system immediacy
    (McLean, 2017), and satisfaction (Guo et al., 2012). Designing systems that consider
    these factors can increase the willingness of personnel to use them and the likelihood
    of their use. Most intelligent systems are evaluated using questionnaires and
    the Likert scale herein as an evaluation benchmark (Casillo et al., 2020; McLean
    and Osei-Frimpong, 2019). The questionnaires in this work were completed by groups
    of target engineers who had used the system. An evaluation of various indicators
    can confirm system completeness and identify possible improvements. In this investigation,
    the questionnaire was designed concerning the factors that affect users’ experience
    of a system. The developed method was revised after receiving feedback. 3. Research
    methods 3.1. Deep learning-based natural language processing model 3.1.1. Bidirectional
    encoder representations from transformers BERT is a natural language model created
    by Google using an unsupervised approach that uses numerous unlabeled texts. The
    unique feature of BERT lies in its comprehensive learning of character, word,
    and sentence features, including the intricate relationships between sentences,
    all during the initial stage of pre-trained word embedding (Kishwar and Zafar,
    2023). This feature described below allows BERT to obtain results by adding a
    lightweight output layer to the final layer of the model when performing different
    language processing tasks for subsequent development of the NLP model (Li et al.,
    2022). (1) Masked Language Model: BERT achieves complete bidirectional word embedding
    by using the masked language model to mask 15% of text messages from input sentences
    randomly. The original meaning of masked words can only be predicted from its
    context, reducing the unidirectional constraint of the language model. (2) Internal
    encoder: The internal encoder of the BERT model discards convolutional neural
    networks that are unsuitable for serializing text and RNNs that cannot be parallelized.
    Using an encoder structure in the transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) that
    can stack multiple layers and process data in parallel, its internal self-attention
    layer can effectively reduce the effect of masking during training and increase
    computing speed. (3) Sentence-level representation: BERT places a special classification
    token, [CLS], in front of each input sentence, and it uses [sep] as a label to
    separate sentences (Yan et al., 2022). Due to language features, the relative
    positions of words are crucial to performing NLP tasks. Based on the input sentence
    length, BERT creates initial position embedding vectors with a random process.
    As the final input vector is formed after adding these vectors, the model is trained
    again. 3.1.2. Long short-term memory LSTM was first proposed in 1997 (Hochreiter
    and Schmidhuber, 1997) and is a variation of RNN. Relative to most conventional
    RNNs, the LSTM network has an additional input gate, output gate, and forget gate,
    as well as additional candidate memory cells to the hidden layer (Costa, 2022).
    Data can be added or deleted through each gate (Pei et al., 2019). Forget gate:
    Controls how many data to forget in the cell. (1) Input gate: When using time
    series data, current data may or may not be critical for classification or prediction.
    The input gate evaluates the importance of existing data to the overall situation
    to control whether current data must be integrated into the memory cell. (2) Output
    gate: Controls data output to the output layer. The formula is (3) Memory cell:
    Consists of two parts. The first part is the retained memory when memory cells
    from the previous time series data pass through the forget gate, and the second
    part (candidate memory cell, ) copies data that are integrated input data with
    the hidden state of the previous time series. The original data pass through the
    input gate, and the copied data determine the pointwise product after the candidate
    memory cell is calculated. Candidate memory cell: ; (4) Hidden state: After the
    input data are integrated with the hidden state, the previous time series are
    processed using the output gate. They are multiplied by after the hyperbolic activation
    function is executed. The formula is (5) (6) Regarding long-term memory, if the
    value of the forget gate is always close to one and the input gate is close to
    zero, the new data do not need to be memorized, and memory cells are retained
    and transferred to the current time step. This design can cope with the conventional
    RNN gradient decay problem when processing long-term memory and better capture
    the dependence of significant time steps in the time series data (Khodaee et al.,
    2022). In the hidden state, when the output gate is approximately one, memory
    cell data affect the hidden state when the output layer is used. The memory cell
    does not affect the output layer or the hidden state when the output gate is near
    zero. 3.1.3. Gated Recurrent Unit GRU was first proposed in 2014 (Cho et al.,
    2014). Its effectiveness is usually comparable to that of LSTM. This network only
    adds an update gate and a reset gate. It is simpler than LSTM, so the training
    speed is higher (Indra and Duraipandian, 2023). The primary equations are compiled
    as follows. (7) (8) (9) (10) Update gate: , given by Eqn 7; the update gate is
    used to control the proportion of the previous message that will be retained in
    the future state . When is smaller, more of the past messages are included. Reset
    gate: , given by Eqn 8; the reset gate is used to control the proportion of the
    previous message that enters the candidate state , a smaller corresponds to a
    smaller , and less information is added to the candidate state. 3.2. Model evaluation
    and chatbot system verification 3.2.1. Text matching model evaluation Questionnaire
    surveys are the most commonly used qualitative data collection method in various
    fields. They are divided into self-administered and interviewer-administered questionnaire
    surveys. Self-administered questionnaires can be divided into mailed, newspaper,
    periodical, and hand-delivered questionnaires. Interviewer-administered questionnaires
    are divided into telephone interviews and face-to-face interviews. Both are widely
    used in psychometrics, market surveys, and public opinion polls to analyze participants’
    ideas and situations to facilitate further research and use. A self-administered
    closed questionnaire is used herein to evaluate the effectiveness of the text-matching
    model. This method can target participants with a particular understanding of
    a dredging project to generate a high response rate, shortening the survey time.
    Such a method can reduce the time participants require to answer the questions
    and improve the response and efficiency of the questionnaire. 3.2.2. Risk classification
    model evaluation (1) Cross-Validation: Cross-validation, a method initially proposed
    by Geisser, serves to segregate training data from test data, thereby ensuring
    that all dataset entries are appropriately distributed between the test and training
    sets. This systematic approach effectively mitigates the unreliability of results
    that may arise due to overfitting. Among the myriad cross-validation techniques
    available, K-fold validation is the most prevalent. Kohavi (Kohavi, 1995) argued
    that a model can be analytically proficient when k = 10. Accuracy is calculated
    as the average of ten models to evaluate model performance. The choice of “k\"
    can be adapted to the dataset''s size. In the context of this study, given a dataset
    comprising 165 records, we have established that ten-fold cross-validation yields
    sufficient analytical power. Consequently, our study employs the 10-fold validation
    method to assess the model''s capabilities. This assessment involves averaging
    the accuracy derived from ten model iterations, allowing us to evaluate the model''s
    performance comprehensively. (2) Multiclass case indicators: The overall accuracy
    rate is typically used as the error metric for multiclass classification models.
    The value is obtained by summing the number of correctly classified datasets and
    dividing this sum by the total number of datasets. 3.3. Chatbot design and verification
    3.3.1. Design of chatbot Platform designs are typically divided into front-end
    and back-end, as shown in Fig. 1. The front-end platform is the user interface,
    a window that general users efficiently operate. In contrast, the back-end platform
    consists of related codes such as datasets, model reads, and calls. When a user
    sends a message using a chatbot, the message is received by the official LINE
    server and transmitted to the Webhook uniform resource locator bound in the LineBot
    settings as a JavaScript Object Notation. The webhook uniform can be maintained
    in the cloud or locally. After the Webhook Application Programming Interface (API)
    accepts the message, it calls the trained model and database according to preset
    logic, performs a keyword search or risk classification prediction, and sends
    the output to the user through the official LINE server. Download : Download high-res

    3.3.2. Verification of chatbot A questionnaire survey was used to conduct an overall
    system evaluation. The content focused on eight chatbot verification indicators
    (system aesthetics, customized functions, ease of operation, data credibility,
    information usefulness, system reputation, system immediacy, and experience satisfaction).
    These indicators were used as the basis for improving the content. 4. Collection
    and analysis of dredging risk knowledge 4.1. Interviews and investigation of dredging
    risks This study visited the Water Resources Agency and ten river management offices
    throughout Taiwan to perform interviews and explore the knowledge of dredging
    risks. Through direct communication and questionnaire surveys, key factors that
    affect risks existed in dredging projects, and practical methods for handling
    risk events were identified. Although the goals of every river management office
    are to perform river dredging and to protect people''s lives and property, they
    have encountered various environmental, human, and technical issues. This investigation
    systematically integrated the collected information and conducted risk analysis
    at all levels to generate relevant charts. The results of this research can be
    used for risk assessment by dredging personnel and are beneficial for other studies
    as they provide a professionally evaluated basic framework for examining risks
    associated with dredging projects. 4.2. Stakeholders in the life cycle of a dredging
    project Based on the information gathered from the interviews above, a dredging
    project is divided into nine significant stages - initiation, planning, design,
    outsourcing, preparation, construction of peripheral facilities, material discharge
    construction and monitoring, final acceptance, and project closure. Stakeholders
    are divided into four categories: internal agencies, external agencies, contractors,
    and the public. The internal agencies refer to the Water Resources Agency and
    all affiliated personnel and units. The external agencies are all agencies that
    do not fall under the Water Resources Agency. The contractors are directly involved
    in the dredging project. The public, legislators, and the media do not participate
    in the project. 4.3. Dredging project risk breakdown This section discusses the
    engineering and other possible risks faced in each stage and provides all risk
    factors. The factors that affect the benefits of dredging projects are divided
    into six significant classifications and 30 subclassifications and integrated
    into a Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS). The risk events faced by dredging projects
    can be classified and subdivided by this RBS to perform systematic transfer and
    analysis of knowledge. 4.4. Ranking of risk impact and frequency of occurrence
    After creating the RBS, 69 recovered questionnaires were analyzed using the analytic
    hierarchy process and the Likert scale. The mean score across 30 risk subclassifications
    according to the RIFA was used to plot a four-quadrant coordinate map for dredging
    risk management and is presented in Fig. 2. Different quadrants correspond to
    different risk responses such as risk control, risk anticipation, risk self-retention,
    and risk transfer. The results mentioned earlier, along with risk handling practices
    obtained from interviews, are presented in the expert system and named within
    the Dredging Risk Knowledge Base. Dredging personnel can use the RIFA distribution
    map to assess the impact and frequency of risk events and search the dredging
    risk knowledge base to identify solutions to assist in risk decision-making. Download

    Map depicting Risk Impact-Frequency Analysis (RIFA) distribution. This study improves
    the knowledge base''s integrity, operability, and practicality. Based on the research
    results, personnel at ten river management offices in Taiwan were interviewed
    to collect information about handling practices in response to risk events. Deep
    learning and NLP techniques are integrated to improve the query method of the
    knowledge base and preliminary judgments of the degree of impact and frequency
    of new risk events to support practical use and convenient searching. 5. Model
    construction and verification 5.1. Computing software and hardware The Python
    software was employed for constructing the deep-learning models, utilizing the
    Keras API within the Windows system and interfacing with the TensorFlow open-source
    software library to develop these models. Table 2 presents other hardware and
    software specifications. Table 2. Hardware and software specifications. Hardware/Software

    5.2.1. Model construction In the BERT model, each input word has a vector output,
    each sentence has a unique label [CLS] at the front, and the BERT output can be
    specified as the sentence vector of the input sentence. Risk events from the Dredging
    Engineering Knowledge Base are input to the BERT model to obtain the sentence
    vector of each text data, as presented in Fig. 3. An input sentence vector can
    be obtained through the BERT model when users enter a search keyword or dredging
    risk-related statements. The cosine distance between this vector and the sentence
    vector in the database is calculated to identify the five most relevant risk events
    in the database for the user''s reference. After the user selects the risk event
    to be queried, the system displays the risk information of that event, including
    relevant handling practices, risk classification, risk subclassification, separate
    mining and auction stages, subprocesses, project impacted scope, project management
    knowledge scope, and the RIFA classification. Download : Download high-res image
    (1MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Text matching model and user
    interaction flowchart. In particular, the project impact scope summarizes the
    impact of the risk event on the project, which is divided into time and cost.
    Scope is the area in which the project is executed, and time is the duration taken
    to complete the project. Cost is the total cost of the project. The scope of the
    project management knowledge is summarized in “A Guide to the Project Management
    Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)” domain that corresponds to the risk event. In the future,
    dredging personnel can use the corresponding project management tools for risk
    control based on the recommendations in the PMBOK guide. The meanings of the other
    risk information were provided in detail in Section 4. 5.2.2. Model verification
    5.2.2.1. Questionnaire design To test the suitability of the outputs of the text-matching
    model, experienced dredging personnel were asked to list 16 dredging risk problems,
    and the questionnaire was designed according to the text-matching process. After
    the problems were input into the text-matching model, the model output was recorded
    and included in a questionnaire completed by dredging personnel. The questionnaire
    content targeted participants’ backgrounds, introduced risk-related information,
    and quantified text-matching model performance. In the first part of the questionnaire,
    its objectives were explained, and the participants were required to fill in their
    names, highest academic qualifications, expertise or professional background,
    and years of experience in engineering. In the second part, the meaning of the
    risk information items in the questionnaire was provided to enable the participants
    to make correct judgments. The top five risk events were given from the text-matching
    model after the 16 dredging risk problems were input into the model in sequence.
    The participants had to select the risk event closest to each issue described.
    They had to score the suitability of the output after reading the corresponding
    risk information. 5.2.2.2. Analysis of questionnaire results 5.2.2.2.1. Verification
    1: can the five risk events answer the risk problems? According to the questionnaire
    results concerning the text-matching model, the participants did not identify
    similar problems in the five risk events for risk problems 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and
    15. However, these six questions were administrative questions. For example, problem
    No. 3 was, “How does the volume method work?” Such administrative process questions
    do not fall within the scope of risk events, and the text-matching model cannot
    identify corresponding risk events to answer such questions. Solutions to other
    risk problems were included in the Dredging Engineering Knowledge Base. Therefore,
    after excluding questions nonrelated to dredging risks, ten risk problems can
    find corresponding risk events, and the text-matching model search success rate
    in this study reached 100%. The success rate of searching without excluding those
    questions was 62.5%. In the future, questions about dredging risks related to
    administrative work may be included in the risk knowledge base to increase the
    success rate of searching, even if it''s irrelevant to dredging risks. 5.2.2.2.2.
    Verification 2: which ranking of risk events best fits the previous problems?
    Since the text-matching model ranks risk events and searches text in relevance,
    the risk event selected out of the five had the highest score and vice versa.
    After administrative questions were excluded, the remaining ten questions revealed
    a mean score of the model ranking ability of 3.3 points on a five scale, which
    was moderately satisfactory. Although the model cannot always present the most
    relevant event as the first displayed risk event, it can still show the most appropriate
    of the five provided events. 5.2.2.2.3. Verification 3: how suitable is information
    about risk events? Based on the answers to the risk problems, the participants
    examined information related to the selected risk event and judged the suitability
    of the information provided. A higher mean score closer to the maximum score of
    five indicated that the text-matching model''s knowledge was helpful. The average
    suitability score of the information provided by the text-matching model in this
    study was 4.5, implying that the information provided can respond to dredging
    personnel with the corresponding dredging risk events. 5.3. Establishment of risk
    classification model Once the pre-trained text-matching model is established,
    the BERT model can be adapted to predict risk classes. LSTM and GRU, for comparison
    purposes, were created herein using the same text database and were analyzed as
    follows. 5.3.1. Prediction of risk classification types 5.3.1.1. Dichotomous classification
    of external and internal risk factors The risk prediction classes were derived
    from the six major factors in the RBS of dredging projects. This investigation''s
    natural, economic & social, and legal & contractual aspects are defined as external
    factors of dredging project teams in river management offices. In contrast, technological,
    organizational, and management capabilities were defined as internal factors.
    This dichotomous classification was based on whether an element is within the
    control of the dredging project team. A risk analysis can be conducted, and the
    work execution method can be adjusted according to internal risk factors. The
    external risk factors and stakeholders involved must be identified to improve
    the execution of work. 5.3.1.2. Major risk classification As mentioned above,
    the risk prediction classes were derived from the six major factors in RBS. Based
    on the classification results, users can preliminarily define the classification
    of risk events to be analyzed and establish the direction of countermeasures for
    risk prevention. 5.3.1.3. Risk subclassification The risk prediction classes were
    further derived from the six major RBS factors affecting the dredging projects.
    Six major factors were subdivided into 30 risk subclassifications. The risk prediction
    classes can be matched with the RIFA distribution map to identify the corresponding
    risk response strategy. The risk subclassification is more refined than classifying
    the six significant risks and external and internal risk factors. The predictions
    can assist users in making more precise work adjustments, external coordination,
    and internal improvements to minimize the impact of risk and losses. 5.3.2. BERT
    risk prediction model Since BERT was trained in advance with many texts, it had
    already gained a deep understanding of the features of input characteristics.
    In text classification or text matching operations, BERT used the output of the
    first vector as the input of the final lightweight output layer and fine-tuned
    the parameters of the fully connected layer during training, as shown in Fig.
    4. The chinese_L-12_H-768_A-12 model provided by Google was used. Since the BERT
    model is pre-trained, according to official recommendations, only a dense layer
    has to be added to make predictions, as presented in Table 3. Download : Download

    5.3.3. LSTM risk prediction model The first stage of classifying text involves
    converting natural languages, such as Chinese or English, into a vector a computer
    program can calculate, known as word embedding. The embedded unit can be a word,
    sentence, or phrase in Chinese or English. The most famous word embedding model
    is word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013; Rong, 2014). In this investigation, after the
    input text was converted into a vector, it was sequentially inputted into the
    LSTM model. The output of word2vec was input to LSTM. Finally, the output vector
    of each time interval was averaged and connected to the fully connected predictive
    output layer, which could be used for risk classification, as shown in Fig. 5.

    Fig. 5. LSTM-based predictive model for risk classification types. Legal texts
    from the Chinese Wikipedia and the Regulations Inquiry System of the Water Resources
    Agency were compiled in this study. After the punctuation marks were removed,
    Jieba (a Chinese word segmentation program) was used to segment sentences, and
    word2vec was used to create a word vector model to convert an input word into
    a vector, which can then be fed into the LSTM model. After the LSTM model was
    trained, users'' input risk questions were assessed using the model to classify
    risk. For the LSTM model, the most common two-layer configuration was adopted,
    and the number of nodes was set to 128, as shown in Table 4. 5.3.4. GRU risk prediction
    model Using the word2vec model established in the previous chapter, the GRU model
    can convert the input word into a vector. After the LSTM model had been trained,
    users'' input risk questions were assessed using the model to classify risk. The
    two-layer configuration was adopted for the GRU model, and the number of nodes
    was set to 128, as presented in Table 5. 5.3.5. Results comparison This study
    established separate prediction models for the dichotomous classification of external
    and internal risk factors, the type of risks into six classes, and the 30 risk
    subclassifications. Predictive models were constructed using BERT, LSTM, and GRU,
    and their average (AVG) accuracy rates were compared in Table 6. The accuracy
    rates of the BERT and LSTM models in predicting the dichotomous classification
    results were similar, and that of the GRU model was slightly lower. However, examining
    the standard deviation (SD) of the accuracy (ACC) of the models revealed that
    the BERT model was more stable than the other two models. Table 6. Average accuracy
    and standard deviation of the predictive risk classification model for the test
    group. Type BERT (AVG) LSTM (AVG) GRU (AVG) ACC SD ACC SD ACC SD External and
    internal classification 79.4% 5.6% 78.4% 11.6% 75.8% 7.9% Six major risk classification

    23.0% 4.3% In predicting the six major risk classifications, the mean standard
    deviation of accuracy was approximately 9.6%, indicating that they exhibited similar
    levels of stability. The accuracy rate of the BERT model exceeded those of the
    LSTM and GRU models by 7.9% and 12.2%. In predicting the 30 risk subclassifications,
    the accuracy rates of the models were less than 50%. However, given the minimal
    data and the large number of classes in this study, the BERT model, which has
    the highest accuracy rate (44.2%), was chosen. The BERT model''s mean accuracy
    rate and standard deviation were better than the LSTM and GRU models. Hence, the
    BERT model was integrated into the proposed chatbot system. This study further
    examines the impact of the number of training data points on the accuracy rate
    of the BERT model. The data are randomly divided into ten sets. Table 7 presents
    the number of training data and validation data. The accuracy was from the external
    and internal classification of the BERT model. Fig. 6 demonstrates that the accuracy
    rate is approximately 60% when the data are few. As the number of data increases,
    the accuracy rate increases to 86.24%. Judging from Fig. 6, the accuracy rate
    has yet to flatten. The continued upward movement is possible, so increasing the
    data is inferred to improve the model''s accuracy. Table 7. Number of training

    study examined the correspondence between the number of classifications, the minimum
    number of data, and the expected accuracy of the prediction model, as presented
    in Table 8. Based on the training results for the aforementioned models, the accuracy
    rate for dichotomous classification reached 80% when the number of data points
    was 165. Therefore, geometric progression was used to estimate the minimum number
    of data. To achieve an 80% risk accuracy rate into six major classes, the original
    data must be multiplied by three to train the BERT model with 495 data points.
    The number of data points of the 30 subclassifications must be multiplied by 15
    (to 2475) to achieve the expected accuracy. Increasing the amount of data can
    improve the predictive accuracy of the model. Table 8. Minimum data for multi-category

    6.1. System framework design The chatbot''s front-end interface design presented
    in this study is simple, allowing users to obtain the required information quickly.
    Regarding the back end, Keras in Python was used to create a text-matching model
    and a risk classification prediction model to assist users in obtaining solutions
    for dredging risk events and determining the risk classes to which the events
    belong. The front end was connected to the back end using Python Flask and Python
    line-bot-sdk to establish a webhook API. This method enabled a smooth connection
    with LINE and deep learning models and successfully transmitted information. 6.2.
    System verification and analysis 6.2.1. System function description The chatbot''s
    functions developed in this study are divided into standard and special parts.
    The standard process involves artificial intelligence keyword query functions
    to provide dredging knowledge for users'' reference. The unique process assists
    in predicting risk classification, visually presenting the results of evaluations
    of risk events into the proposed system, as presented in Table 9. Table 9. Features
    of dredging project risk knowledge chatbot. Common feature Special feature Text
    input query Risk classification prediction Combine AI technology The results are
    presented visually Provide professional knowledge Expert system query Users can
    use the risk classification prediction function to query risk events that are
    not recorded in the system but fall into the RIFA quadrants and the 30 subclassifications.
    The system uses images of the predictions, helping users to understand them. Dredging
    personnel with little experience can use the search function to browse dredging
    risk event handling practices by risk stages or classes to retrieve the desired
    information quickly. Users can obtain the required information by text search
    or retrieval. The obtained data is divided into risk classification prediction,
    risk prevention plans, and risk handling practices, providing three systematic
    evaluation results to assist personnel in making risk decisions. 6.2.2. Design
    of questionnaire for evaluating chatbot system To understand users'' evaluations
    of the chatbot, relevant personnel were invited to complete a specially designed
    questionnaire. Their responses were used to verify the functions and practicality
    of the system. Based on a review of the relevant literature, the questionnaire
    was designed to probe the factors that affect users’ willingness to use a chatbot.
    Specifically, the questions targeted the aesthetics, ease of operation, usefulness
    and credibility of the information provided, immediacy, customized functions,
    system stability, and overall system satisfaction. Dredging personnel were invited
    to try the chatbot system and complete the questionnaire. Finally, the mean score
    of each evaluation item was calculated. 6.2.3. Analysis of questionnaire responses
    Based on the responses provided by five junior and senior dredging personnel,
    the colorful interface is easy to use, the images presented in the system are
    attractive, and the text and images are clear and easy to read. The system provides
    numerous functions and simple query operations, and the respondents gave a mean
    score of between 4.6 and 5 points for these functions. Concerning the usefulness
    of the provided information, most respondents asserted that the system is conducive
    to risk decision-making and highly credible. The system is stable when running,
    but its response speed remains to be improved; the respondents gave a mean score
    of 3.3 points for each feature. Overall, the dredging personnel were satisfied
    with the chatbot that was developed. The low response speed is attributable to
    the presence of millions of hidden layers and parameters in the text-matching
    model and the limitations on the rate of TensorFlow in reading and calling the
    model. This problem cannot be solved and should be further explored, as shown
    in Table 10. Table 10. Average score from a questionnaire about chatbots. Description
    Average score (Full score of 5) The chatbot''s user interface has a pleasing color

    intelligent risk prevention and decision analysis → risk classification and decision
    → RIFA distribution map, and system response measure. The system''s predictions
    and the information provided help determine dredging risk responses. 4.6 Simulation

    of soil price with market demand” by accessing intelligent risk prevention and
    decision analysis → long keyword search. After selecting similar risk events,
    the system''s information is conducive to risk prevention. 4.4 Simulation problem:

    risk event. 4.6 The information provided by this chatbot was compiled from interviews
    with ten river management offices. Does this source of information have high reliability?
    4.6 Does this chatbot system have high stability? 4.8 Does this chatbot system
    respond instantly? 3.2 Are you satisfied with this chatbot overall? 4.4 6.3. Demonstration
    of system operation Users of the Dredging Project Risk Knowledge Chatbot can choose
    to perform an Intelligent Risk Prevention and Decision Analysis (IRPDA) or to
    use an Intelligent Risk Management System (IRMS) to predict/search for information
    about their risk problems, as presented in Fig. 7. Regarding the difference between
    these two options, the intelligent risk prevention decision analysis system can
    be used before risk problems occur, and it includes an internal long keyword search
    as well as risk prediction and decision analysis functions. The IRPDA system uses
    the text matching model to identify risk events from the risk knowledge base that
    best matches the risk questions used in the long keyword search, and related risk
    information and a prevention plan for a particular risk event can be obtained.
    If a risk question for which a user queries is not included in the risk knowledge
    base, then the risk prediction and decision analysis function can be used. After
    the risk question is input, the system predicts the risk subclass to which the
    risk question belongs, its corresponding quadrant in the RIFA distribution map,
    and suitable risk response measures. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    Project Risk Knowledge Chatbot. The IRMS can be used after a risk occurs. Users
    can search for risk event-handling practices by inputting long keywords or using
    structured expert systems. By entering the risk question in the long keyword search,
    users can display risk events that match the risk question in the risk knowledge
    base. Next, the users can click these events to obtain the corresponding handling
    practices and information to support decision-making. Furthermore, users can determine
    to which of the six major risk classes a question refers to or the dredging risk
    occurrence stage by querying related risk events in the expert system, quickly
    benefiting from the extensive accumulated experience, or searching conveniently,

    chatbot (Translated version). 6.4. Scenario analysis and contribution of system
    to project risk management 6.4.1. Risk prediction before risk occurrence Although
    the prevention plans that are output by the IRPDA system cover most risk events
    that various river management offices may encounter, certain risk events might
    not be accounted for or have yet to occur in the past. For example, large populations
    of Eriocheir rectus (one kind of crab) are present near rivers during their breeding
    season, affecting the implementation of river dredging projects and preventing
    machinery, equipment, and dump trucks from entering the work area. The risk classification
    prediction function for assessment reveals that this problem is located in the
    third quadrant in the RIFA (risk self-retention) and falls into the natural ecosystem
    subclass. Based on the information provided by the system, dredging personnel
    can first address this problem by drawing on relevant experience and then share
    handling methods of this particular dredging risk event with other dredging personnel
    in all river management offices in Taiwan. 6.4.2. Solutions from the knowledge
    base before risk occurrence During dredging operations, users anticipate possible
    risk events based on experience and attempt to reduce losses caused by risk events
    by risk prevention. Keyword searches in the IRPDA system result in the proposal
    of risk prevention plans, scopes of impact, PMBOK knowledge domain scopes, and
    RIFA classifications; dredging risk decision analysis can thus be conducted using
    relevant information. The National Audit Office may question the effectiveness
    of the dredging project if the actual dredging volume is less than the expected
    dredging volume. Therefore, dredging personnel can use this system to identify
    risk prevention measures. The system can provide detailed recommendations about
    the actual dredging situation to support rolling plans, erosion and siltation
    analysis, communication and coordination with superior officers and personnel
    from the Water Resources Agency for objective analysis, and the adjustment of
    projects according to river conditions. 6.4.3. Text matching after risk occurrence
    The transportation road in a dredging area can be affected by strong winds and
    rain when typhoons strike. Heavy rain and turbulence can cause the river water
    level to rise and flow turbulently. A road can be destroyed by a flood, hindering
    the progress of the dredging project. To mitigate such risk problems, dredging
    personnel can use the IRMS in the Dredging Project Risk Knowledge Chatbot generated
    in this study to perform a keyword search or query solutions according to the
    stage of dredging and classification of the risk event. 7. Conclusion and recommendations
    Dredging projects involve many risks. Taiwan''s ten river management offices have
    encountered various environmental, time, and weather risk events. The knowledge
    gap produced by the resignation or retirement of experienced dredging personnel
    and the need for a sharing platform has prevented the punctual sharing of risk
    experience and practical solutions among colleagues in river management offices.
    Therefore, a dredging risk knowledge base was constructed herein as a reference
    for dredging personnel to make risk decisions when encountering a risk event.
    However, the handling practices archived in the dredging risk knowledge base system
    must be more comprehensive, and the query design could be more intuitive, albeit
    currently limited by temporal and spatial searches. Therefore, this study expanded
    the knowledge base regarding risk-handling practices and prevention measures.
    It also involved the development of a chatbot system compatible with LINE, enhancements
    to the search function, and the introduction of additional risk prediction classifications
    to assist users in making informed decisions. This section describes the main
    findings of this study and provides comprehensive conclusions and recommendations.
    a) Interviews were carried out with dredging personnel to improve handling practices.
    Prevention plans for risk events were added to the risk knowledge base, increasing
    the applicability of risk knowledge base system content before and after risks
    occur. However, owing to limitations on interview time and personnel, only 165
    risk events were collected. Interviews should continue to include various risk
    events and enrich the knowledge base. b) This study established a risk classification
    prediction model to classify risks and determine response measures. The risk classification
    model was built using BERT, LSTM, and GRU, and the classification accuracies regarding
    internal and external risk factors, six major risk classes, and 30 risk subclasses
    were compared. Thus, The statistical results revealed that the BERT model outperformed
    the LSTM and GRU models in classifying internal and external risk factors and
    risks into six significant classes or 30 risk subclasses. Therefore, the BERT
    model was identified as the optimal model for risk classification in this system.
    c) A text-matching method was developed using the BERT pre-trained model. Using
    user-input keywords, the system will select the five most similar events based
    on a vector calculation and rank them by similarity with the event in the query.
    Users can quickly identify required risk-handling practices or prevention plans.
    This system reduces the search times and the probability of query errors for risk
    events. d) The trained text matching model (BERT) was verified using new dredging
    risk problems, and the search success rate was 62.5%. The search success rate
    was 100% when questions unrelated to dredging risk questions were excluded. To
    further enhance user experience, efforts should ensure that irrelevant queries
    are independent of search results. The relevance ranking function scored above
    average (3.3/5), and the suitability of the risk event information cut close to
    the maximum (4.5/5), indicating that the findings from the interviews were comprehensive
    and practical and that the system content can assist dredging personnel in making
    decisions related to dredging risk. Moreover, future research can remain current
    by embracing more advanced deep learning-based NLP models and comparing them with
    the BERT model. e) Based on the relationship between the amount of training data
    and the accuracy rate, the accuracy rate of dichotomous classification was used
    as the benchmark for evaluation. Classification accuracy into six major classes
    reached 80% when the number of training data was 495; that into 30 subclasses
    was 80% when the number of training data was 2475. The amount of data collected
    to generate the model was closely related to the model''s accuracy. Future studies
    should include annual interviews of relevant personnel to collect data on dredging
    risk events to refine the risk classification model. f) “The intelligent risk
    prevention and decision analysis system” and “the intelligent risk management
    system” were integrated into the dredging project risk knowledge base. The intelligent
    risk prevention and decision analysis system can be used before dredging risks
    arise; it visually provides users with intuitive and comprehensive assessment
    results. The intelligent risk management system can be used after dredging risks
    arise; users can query it regarding risk handling practices to assist in making
    decisions related to dredging. Both methods can be queried using keyword or text
    searches, and the intelligent risk management system performs searches by dredging
    stage or risk classification of risk events to provide the required information
    quickly. g) The dredging project risk knowledge base is displayed in LINE using
    the API combined with the local server model. This knowledge base employs a chatbot
    to assist dredging personnel in finding risk event-related information and making
    risk-related decisions anytime and anywhere. h) The functionality of the chatbot
    was verified using a questionnaire. Dredging personnel with relevant experience
    were invited to complete a system verification questionnaire, evaluate the system''s
    practicality, aesthetics, operability, and functionality, and indicate their overall
    satisfaction. Most participants gave high scores for all assessment indicators.
    However, they noted that the system response speed must be improved. Enhancements
    in response time are needed to provide a smoother user experience. The chatbot
    of the dredging project risk knowledge base developed in this investigation can
    assist dredging personnel in assessing dredging risk and provide them with references
    for decision-making. Its use is not temporally or spatially constrained, and users
    need only to enter keywords in LINE to retrieve quickly the required information.
    Although the accuracy of the risk prediction model remains to be improved, increasing
    the amount of data collected regarding risk events can also enhance it. The proposed
    dredging risk chatbot can be used to manage risk in the future. Accordingly, the
    system can perform diverse and reliable functions for dredging personnel in hydrological
    management. CRediT authorship contribution statement Jui-Sheng Chou: Conceptualization,

    The environment can be characterized simply as the total influence of all living
    and non-living elements on human life. Non-living components include land and
    water, as well as warm temperatures, stones, and the atmosphere, whereas all living
    elements include organisms such as plants, woodlands, fisheries, and raptors.
    Biotic element-related things, especially people of different sections like farmers,
    sailors, voyagers and mine workers, are regularly connected with ecological variables
    like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, air-related factors called air
    quality, CO2, methane-like gases, wind speed and direction, water-related factors
    called rainfall, pH levels, moisture in the soil, quantity of water, and light
    quality and turbidity [1]. Commonly used traditional forecasting techniques include
    trend, persistence, climatology, and analogues of weather systems. All of these
    techniques rely on a few fundamental presumptions to extrapolate the weather into
    the future [2]. In the meantime, the world''s population has expanded, leading
    to developments in urbanization, industrialization, agricultural land, and energy
    utilization. To keep up with increased demand, technological developments that
    enable precise monitoring of environments are required. Also, due to their ignorance
    of modern farming practices, Indian farmers are not producing the appropriate
    amount of food [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]. Accurate yield prediction will be aided
    by predictive analytics, which will require knowledge about the functional relationship
    between yield and environmental factors, which is delivered in the form of a dataset
    [8]. Remote sensors are used to monitor environmental characteristics that vary
    from place to place. The intention for environmental monitoring aims to control
    and reduce an activity''s adverse environmental effects along with the risks of
    adverse effects on the natural environment, and also to safeguard the health of
    humans. Environmental monitoring employs methods that discover and analyze environmental
    conditions to determine the environmental impact of an activity [9,10]. Environmental
    monitoring is used to observe the overall quality of an environment, environmental
    factors, and the influence of a specific action. Such types of monitoring practices
    may be set up to identify irregularities or specific situations and then send
    alerts by email or text message, as well as activate automated operations. The
    consistent gathering of measurements and data from our physical surroundings using
    sensors and connected devices is what IoT-based smart environmental parameter
    monitoring is all about [11]. Sensors built into agricultural systems, pipelines,
    tanks, climate stations, oceanic applications, and industrial machinery may record
    temperature, moisture, water content, water leaks, and various other physical
    attributes all around the world. Intelligent, interconnected devices with inbuilt
    connectivity modules are able to analyze that information and immediately send
    extremely important information to the cloud or a data center for additional action
    or analysis using edge computing technology. An IoT-enabled environmental monitoring
    system acts as an application''s eyes, ears, and mouthpiece, watching, listening,
    reporting, and even taking action to prevent damage [12,13]. Modern digital farming
    employs datasets containing data from decades with numerous parameters required
    for yield prediction, such as soil type, soil nutrients, soil pH, area of cultivation,
    production history, and so on. Prediction in traditional farming is based on farmer
    experience, which is time-intensive and inefficient. As a result, a move from
    traditional farming to digital farming is required, which is doable with data-driven
    Internet of Things technology [14,15]. Most researchers never looked into usage
    other than agriculture or weather monitoring stations in depth. Most modern technologies
    just use only one of a few sensors, which are again ineffective at collecting
    any useful data. The accuracy of the sensor also plays a vital role. If multiple
    sensors are used, then power issues creep into the system. Data analytics can
    be employed to evaluate features including climate change, variation in rainfall,
    groundwater resources, variations in human metabolism, and plantations using data
    from the sensor. The following literature from the same research work is reviewed:
    In order to get data on an OLED display, Kishore et al. [16] monitored the weather
    conditions using sensors connected to WeMo and cloud services. ZigBee was used
    by Saini et al. [17] to connect a PC with a GUI; data was downloaded from the
    internet and displayed on an LCD screen. To detect temperature and humidity, Palle
    et al. [18] employed the CC3200, which is a basic Link Wi-Fi internet chip. Three
    meteorological variables were measured by Shaout et al. [19]: temperature, wind
    speed, and wind direction. The information was delivered to an LCD. Amber Katyal
    et al. [20] used an Arduino Uno-based system to find out if the environment had
    light, cloudy weather or not. Instead of using sophisticated weather observatories,
    which may perform on a large scale, this device''s distinctive feature is that
    it can be implemented in any critical situation or local region. These also function
    on public wireless LANs on a smaller scale. A few sensors are employed to find
    a few parameters and lack the ability to display and send data. Abu Saleh Bin
    Shahadat et al. [21] created a system for measuring weather forecast conditions
    with the NodeMCU Board and Blynk IoT technology, which measures meteorological
    data such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and rainfall. Shubham R. V. et al.
    [22] developed an IoT-based weather monitoring system using a Raspberry Pi to
    collect data related to the environment called the atmospheric pressure, rainwater
    level and light intensity. But they did not mention the display method of the
    collected information. R. Kavin et al. [23] introduced a model in which sensors
    are set up to track factors like temperature, humidity, and CO value, and data
    is gathered using the IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The final client
    will receive the outcome evaluation over Wi-Fi. Through every phase of detection,
    the devices are controlled by an AT Mega 328 controller, which also accumulates
    sensor information and sends it to end clients via the cloud. Mohit Tiwari et
    al. [24] suggested a wireless and IoT-based weather observation mechanism. Their
    systematic development of a framework uses a Wi-Fi module, sensors, and an Arduino
    UNO board to transfer data to cloud computing offerings. Additionally, a webpage
    is made that demonstrates all of the information and shows the information to
    clients. Pasika and Gandla [25] suggested a system for monitoring that comprises
    a range of sensors to assess different environmental parameters such as viscosity,
    pH levels, the level of water in the tank, moisture of the surrounding environment,
    and the temperature of the water. The sensors and the microcontroller unit (MCU)
    are linked, and the remote monitoring tool (PC or mobile) provides further processing.
    The collected data will be uploaded to the cloud using the Internet of Things
    (IoT)-based ThingSpeak application to follow the water quality under test. Kumar
    et al. [26] suggested a low-cost, IoT-based solution for monitoring the water''s
    quality at the moment. The system that was developed employs a range of detectors
    that determine both the physical and chemical characteristics of the water that
    it contains. A Raspberry Pi processor is associated with many different kinds
    of sensors, including carbon dioxide (CO2) sensors, pH level sensors, turbid detectors,
    thermometers, and water depth sensors, in this sophisticated system for monitoring
    water quality. These sensors oversee the entire process, with monitoring handled
    by cloud-based wireless communication devices. Gupta et al. [27] offer a model
    that autonomously examines water''s biological attributes such as viscosity, pH
    level, and temperature. The ESP32 chip was used for underwater communication due
    to its low power consumption and built-in Wi-Fi. The Internet of Things-connected
    model was created by combining communication modules called a turbidity detector
    and an acidity detector (a pH sensor). Using multilevel IoT architecture, Vasanth
    K. Babu et al. [28] created a system that tracks environmental factors. Utilized
    various sensors to gather data on various environmental characteristics, which
    is then sent through SMS or to a webpage. Farmers are given information about
    the environment, and the experiments'' results are summarized. The proposed system
    is more than just a model for gathering data; it also accesses data and evaluates
    it to provide farmers with a yield indicator. The research project demonstrated
    by Varsha et al. [29] is an effective IoT-based strategy for measuring the quality
    of water in addition to a comprehensive examination of the different methodologies
    of water quality monitoring and the origins and effects of water contamination.
    Despite the existence of numerous superb smart water quality monitoring systems.
    They formed a system with various sensors to detect the pH level, turbidity, conductivity
    of water and CO2, humidity, and temperature in the open air. The proposed model
    by Puja Sharma et al. [30] is intended to make the system cost-effective and affordable.
    So that anyone can freely use it. In their suggested system, information is obtained
    by multiple sensors, which are then transmitted to websites via the request form
    of the HTTP protocol to the website. But the lack of this method means that it
    focuses only on a few parameters, such as rain and temperature-related ones. Monica
    J. et al. [31] suggested a weather monitoring system based on Internet of Things
    (IoT) technology to be built with the Proteus simulation tool. It collects all
    the required environmental information employing a sensor for temperature (LM35),
    a sensor for pressure (BMP180), a sensor to detect soil moisture, a rainfall detector,
    and a Raspberry Pi computer (RPI3) and then transmits that data directly into
    the ThingSpeak platform in order to predict the optimal conditions that are necessary
    for the growth of crops and yield enhancement. The IoT-based RTWMS created by
    A. Naveena et al. [32] allows for continuous monitoring of weather parameters
    involving the temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, rainfall, wind speed
    and gases including LPG, CO, and smoke. Through the ESP32''s integrated Wi-Fi
    module, the sensor data is transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud platform. Utilizing
    MATLAB analysis tools, this data is examined. In MATLAB, this data is read. On
    the ThingSpeak platform, the analysis is presented as a graph. The real-time weather
    monitoring system that was created in this way successfully monitors data and
    gives consumers trustworthy data, together with its graphical representation,
    all over the world. L.B. Imran et al. [33] proposed a Node MCU based temperature,
    turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen findings in the smart city. Sensed data has been
    communicated and stored in LoRa cloud platform. H. Fuentes et al. [34] proposed
    a NodeMCU ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi based automatic smart water measurement and
    leakage finding system in smart cities. IBM cloud platform called NoSQL (Cloudant)
    used to display the information on webpage. Sree Harini T et al. [35] proposed
    an intelligent environment monitoring system using IoT to get the information
    from regularly used weather variables and ThingSpeak cloud platform used to publish
    the information. Sudan Jha et al. [36] proposed smart city monitoring using IoT
    to find the air, noise, light and waste related atmospheric parameters in smart
    cities and also connected to GIS and solar. T.M. Bandara et al. [37] proposed
    an IoT based smart farm monitoring to protect the crop fields. Abdullah I et al.
    [38] proposed an IoT based smart waste water management, named “IoT-WMS” in Urban
    areas with five layers of blockchain technology which helped to reuse the waste
    water properly. P. Rathod et al. [39] developed a container monitoring system
    using IoT to safe the logistics using ATMega 328 and Node MCU processors along
    with DHT11 sensor, Smoke sensor and Magentic. Adafruit IO Cloud using the MQTT
    platform used to publish the data. The summary of the literature survey of the
    present experiment is illustrated in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of the literature

    The proposed research article is structured as follows: Section 1 gives the introduction
    about the environmental parameters and possibilities of smart monitoring of them.
    Also provides the literature survey related to the projects, research findings
    and organization of the present article. Section 2 describes the methods and materials
    such as hardware & software components and schematic diagram. Section 3 presents
    the results and discussion. At final section 4 gives conclusion and future scope
    of the project. 2. Materials and methods The proposed system is designed to monitor
    and measure various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, atmospheric
    pressure, hazardous gases, air quality, raindrops (rainfall detection), rain gauges
    (flood alert and water level measurement), water quality such as pH and turbidity,
    light intensity, soil moisture, wind speed, and direction. The main goal of our
    design is to demonstrate sophisticated real-time smart monitoring of environmental
    factors based on IoT and sensor networks that keeps track of weather conditions
    independently of forecasting agencies. By placing sensor modules in the surrounding
    area and analyzing real-time data gathered and monitored on a webpage by utilizing
    a Wi-Fi-based HTTP IoT platform, the system''s performance is made possible [40].
    Arduino Uno and other diverse sensors are used in the hardware configuration to
    collect field data and manage various environmental-related operations. The hardware
    and software used for the experiment are illustrated in Fig. 1. Download : Download
    high-res image (441KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Block diagram
    of a smart environmental parameter monitoring system. The prototype produced in
    this experiment monitors several meteorological factors in the atmosphere, such
    as temperature, pressure, gas, smoke, air quality, humidity, wind speed and direction,
    rainfall, rain level, pH value, and turbidity [41]. There are four operational
    layers in the proposed concept. The first one is the sensor deployment layer,
    which is used to sense the data from the atmosphere. The second is the middleware
    layer, which sends the collected data from sensors to a microcontroller based
    on the Arduino Uno that supervises the whole process. The third one is the communication
    layer, which is in control of interfacing with all of the installed sensors from
    the microcontroller to the output modules. That collected data is transferred
    to the output modules called buzzer, LCD, and GSM. The fourth is the cloud analysis
    layer, or application layer, which is responsible for a Wi-Fi-enabled IoT-based
    HTTP webpage to communicate the information wirelessly to a remote user to report
    and alert. IoT-based monitoring systems rely on microcontroller local storage
    for offline storage and quick data access. Real-time data transmission entails
    transferring sensor data to a central server or cloud for control and scaling.
    The Arduino Uno microcontroller is suited for small-scale, but not frequent, storage.
    SD card modules and serial connectivity are both options for additional storage.
    2.1. Hardware components The aforementioned components for data collection, data
    transfer, data processing and analysis are employed in developing of the proposed
    IoT-based wireless smart monitoring system for parameters associated with the
    environment. For smart monitoring of environmental parameters different sensors
    are used in this work. The sensors are selected based on the numerous significant
    variables like accuracy, calibration, power consumption, compatibility, atmospheric
    condition, dependability, durability, and cost. After extensively investigated
    and analyzed different sensor solutions based on these requirements the effective
    sensors are used for environmental monitoring. 2.1.1. Arduino Uno (ATMega1280)
    A microcontroller board based on the ATMega1280 is called the Arduino Mega. It
    has 16 analogue inputs, 4 physical serial connectors (UARTs), a crystal oscillator
    with a bandwidth of 16 MHz, 54 logical input/output data transfer pins (14 of
    which serve as PWM signals, a USB interface, an external power connector, an ICSP
    header for communication, along with a reset switch. Another Type-B USB interface
    for supplying and coding a microcontroller is located on the board''s left short
    edge. It serves as an open-source and free platform for electronic development
    that comprises adaptive and intuitive both software and hardware. It has several
    features, such as operating on a 5V power source and operating between 5V and
    20V, 28 KB of flash memory, 4 KB of which is required for the boot loader, 8 KB
    of SRAM, and 4 KB of EEPROM. The ATMega 2560 has same features but only difference
    is it offers additional 128 KB of flash memory [42]. 2.1.2. Temperature & humidity
    sensor (DHT11) An effortless, inexpensive digital temperature cum humidity detector
    is the DHT11 which records temperature and humidity data at regular intervals
    depending on the adjusted digital signal output. It has a 5% accuracy over a humidity
    range of 20–80% and a temperature range of 0–50 °C. To determine the current temperature,
    A thermistor and a capacitive humidity sensor are both used by the DHT11. It runs
    at 5 V with a maximum current of 2.5 mA [43]. 2.1.3. Pressure sensor (BMP280)
    BMP280 is a piezo-resistive digital pressure sensor that measures barometric pressure,
    temperature humidity and altitude. It supports both SPI and I2C communication
    interfaces. This system has been used to measure surrounding atmospheric pressure
    using a serial I2C interface directly to a microcontroller [44]. 2.1.4. Gas sensor
    (MQ2) Chemiresistors are another name for MQ2 gas sensors. When the gas makes
    contact with the sensor material, the resistance changes, which is detected and
    converted to an analogue form. The gas content is determined using a voltage divider
    structure. It operates at 5V DC and consumes approximately 800 mW of power. The
    exhaust via the sensing device gets transformed into a voltage that is an appropriate
    representation (i.e., PPM). The design measures natural gas (LPG smoke, beverages,
    transportation fuel, and greenhouse gases such as methane, hydrogen, and CO) across
    an identification spectrum that includes 200 to 10,000 PPM [45,46]. 2.1.5. Air
    quality sensor (MQ135) The MQ135 serves as a gaseous or alcoholic analyzer, which
    examines the condition of the air around it. The oxide of tin (SnO2) is the most
    significant constituent. It recognizes ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and benzine moisture,
    as well as pollutants and various other poisonous gases. The device is economical
    and can be employed for an assortment of objectives, including detecting hazardous
    gases and smoke. It is useful for NH3, nitrogen oxides (NO), and other smoke findings.
    It identifies gasoline and alcohol in a form of electricity that is voltage (i.e.,
    PPM) [47]. 2.1.6. Rain drop sensor Raindrops were successfully detected by raindrop
    sensors. The design comprises a pair of autonomous modules: a rain panel to monitor
    rainfall and a control module for analyzing and contrasting conventional and digital
    measurements. It is a simple and inexpensive device that assists in sensing rainfall
    and functions at 5 V by triggering a switch when drops descend on the sensor panel
    [48]. 2.1.7. Rain gauge (ultrasonic sensor) This sensor is set at the leading
    edge of a container and directed downward. It emits waves and counts the amount
    of time that it requires to get the response signal from the water to reach the
    sensor for the purpose to estimate the levels of any kind of liquid or solid.
    This sensor operates by emitting high-frequency sonic waves at regular time intervals,
    and the quantity of returned sound waves is proportional to the distance between
    the transducer and the object to be determined. For example, water range information
    is provided from 6 inches to 254 inches with a measurement accuracy of 1 inch,
    and the informational sheet for this particular item indicates that the surface
    of the ocean object covers a distance of 0 inches–254 inches (6.54 m) [49]. 2.1.8.
    pH sensor It uses three separate that are soil, liquid and light test meters in
    one gadget to correctly and efficiently assess pH/acidity level, moisture content,
    and light amount. It does not require a battery and can be readily plugged into
    the soil to detect results automatically. Compact and portable, it is able to
    be used in lawns, gardens, potted plants, industrial settings, and many other
    places [50]. 2.1.9. Turbidity sensor (SEN0189) Through the measurement of turbidity,
    water quality is determined. By detecting light transmittance and producing signals
    in either analogue or digital formats, depending on the microcontroller unit (MCU),
    the turbidity sensor makes it possible to identify suspended particles in water.
    Nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) are used to measure water quality; less than
    1 NTU is considered good, 1 to 5 NTU is considered fair, and more than 5 NTU is
    considered poor [51]. 2.1.10. Wind speed and direction sensor (DC motor with propeller)
    A device used to measure the direction and speed of the wind is an anemometer.
    It is a typical piece of weather station equipment. The wind anemometer in our
    suggested system was a DC motor. The flux change that causes the generation of
    EMF on an ATMega microcontroller is measured and proportionate wind speed is calculated.
    The direction of the wind is measured using digital compass-based equipment [52].
    2.1.11. ESP8688 Wi-Fi module The hardware is dependent on the ESP12E Module, and
    Node MCU has firmware that is compatible with and works on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi System
    on Chip (SoC). The ESP8266 is inexpensive, includes an in-built Wi-Fi module,
    and uses ultra-low-power technologies [53]. 2.1.12. Buzzer A buzzer is an auditory
    signaling device that can be mechanical, electromechanical, or both (piezoelectric).
    It is used to sound an alert when the parameter value reaches a particular threshold.
    2.1.13. LCD The capacity of liquid crystals to control light is used to produce
    the text or image on a flat-panel electronic visual display known as a liquid-crystal
    display (LCD). An alphanumeric monochrome 20x4 LCD was employed. The 20x4 format
    enables the simultaneous display of 20 characters in each of the 4 rows of the
    20x4 LCD, for a total of 80 characters. 2.1.14. GSM GSM - The GSM module is a
    dual-mode information transfer module. The main parts of a GSM module are the
    GSM baseband CPU, flash, GSM Radio Frequency (RF), power, antennas and their jacks.
    SIMCOM manufactures the module, which has an operational voltage range of 3.2V–4.8V
    and low power consumption. It supports the 900 MHZ and 1800 MHZ frequency bands.
    Data and voice are transported safely and quickly within the frequency spectrum.
    Two different SMS modalities are supported by the GSM module called a text mode
    and a PDU mode respectively [54]. Due to technology''s ability to deliver digital
    communications, we selected text mode. 2.1.15. Communication devices and protocols
    To transfer the data from the microcontroller to other peripherals the communication
    protocols are commonly used. In this work SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is
    used for high-speed communication from microcontrollers to other peripherals like
    sensors, memory chips, and displays. The USB (Universal Serial Bus) is used for
    both power and data transfer. It supports various data transfer speeds and device
    classes. Finally, the wireless protocols such as Wi-Fi are used to access the
    data through internet. 2.2. Schematic diagram Various components are interfaced
    in the design of the proposed system to develop a smart system for monitoring
    weather parameters. interfaced Table 2 lists the components provided with diagrams.
    As a result of the connecting of the components, a schematic diagram has been
    shaped. The schematic diagram of the hardware components and their connections
    is shown in Fig. 2. Table 2. List of the hardware used components used develop
    the proposed system. Download : Download high-res image (894KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Schematic diagram of a smart monitoring system for measuring
    environmental parameters. 2.3. Software requirements Each piece of hardware must
    be properly configured in accordance with the schematic diagram and programmed
    to work with the other pieces of hardware in order for the environmental parameter
    monitoring system to work. The Arduino microcontroller, which also contains the
    code to direct and manage the operation of the other gear, acts as the system''s
    processor. In this proposed work the Arduino IDE 1.8.13 version is used because
    it is widely used for writing computer programs that can be transferred directly
    to a hardware board. Also in this work, the libraries like Wire (Version 1.0.1),
    SPI (Version 1.0.1), Adafruit GFX (Version 1.10.0), Adafruit Motor Shield (Version
    1.0.2) were utilized. The entire monitoring system was written in C, with assembly
    language incorporated [55]. The programming environment of the Arduino IDE includes
    a number of useful sample codes that can be expanded to carry out more complex
    functions through connected libraries which created an HTTP-based webpage to remotely
    monitor and examine the data. The user interface on an HTTP-based webpage for
    an environmental monitoring system should prioritize user friendliness and accessibility
    to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience for users. It can be considered in
    various aspects, such as clear and intuitive navigation, understanding and interacting
    with the system to access and analyze the collected data effectively, responsive
    design, visual presentation, dashboard overview, interactive controls, data visualization
    and analysis, alerts and notifications, and accessibility considerations. Implementing
    security measures is critical for safeguarding data transmission and ensuring
    the system''s resilience to potential cyber assaults. Transport Layer Security
    (TLS) ensures secure communication between the user''s browser and the server
    that hosts the website. It encrypts data sent across the network to prevent unauthorized
    access or interception. 2.4. Power requirements (regulated power supply) The power
    supply method of a system has a substantial impact on its energy efficiency, power
    management, power storage, and sustainability. These are the factors for building
    a power supply framework that supports energy efficiency and sustainability while
    lowering the system''s environmental impact and ensuring long-term survival. The
    power supplies are intended to convert high-voltage AC mains electricity into
    a suitable low-voltage supply for electronic circuits and other devices. A power
    supply can be broken down into a series of blocks, each of which serves a specific
    purpose. The term \"regulated DC power supply\" refers to a DC power source that
    keeps the output voltage constant despite fluctuations in the AC mains or load.
    Batteries and a solar panel with an inverter were used as a backup power supply
    mechanism. 2.5. Ethical considerations Ethical considerations play a crucial role
    in environmental monitoring, particularly when data collection involves sensitive
    areas. Ethical considerations should be an integral part of the planning, implementation,
    and ongoing management of environmental monitoring projects. When conducting environmental
    monitoring in sensitive areas, it is important to obtain informed consent from
    individuals or communities affected by the monitoring activities. This ensures
    that they are aware of the purpose, potential risks, and benefits of the monitoring
    project. Adhering to ethical principles ensures that monitoring activities are
    conducted in a responsible, respectful, and data-protective manner. Transparency
    builds trust and allows for public scrutiny, enabling stakeholders to understand
    and engage with the data collection process in an accountable manner, considering
    any potential ecological or social risks, fostering trust, and promoting the well-being
    of both the environment and the communities involved. 2.6. Societal impacts The
    proposed real-time smart environmental parameter monitoring technology using IoT
    and sensors has the potential to create significant societal impacts, particularly
    in terms of environmental conservation and safety, by enabling continuous and
    accurate data collection of environmental parameters such as air quality, water
    quality, noise levels, and GSM, TFT, W-Fi, and other libraries more. This data
    can provide valuable insights into the health and condition of ecosystems, helping
    in the identification of environmental issues, pollution sources, and ecological
    changes. With this information, timely and targeted interventions can be implemented
    to mitigate environmental degradation, protect biodiversity, and promote sustainable
    resource management. This system served as an early warning system for detecting
    and alerting to potential environmental hazards or safety concerns, data-driven
    decision-making, public awareness and engagement, and improved resource efficiency.
    These advancements have the potential to create a more sustainable and resilient
    future where the well-being of both the environment and the communities that depend
    on it is safeguarded. 3. Results and discussion The experiment is conducted at
    ‘KLM College of Engineering form Women’ and its surroundings, Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh,
    India from April to July 2023. When the RPS is turned on by connecting a pin to
    the appropriate slot, all the sensors that are pressure sensor, humidity & ambient
    temperature sensor, wind speed and direction sensor, raindrop sensor, rain gauge
    sensor, pH sensor, MQ2 gas sensor, MQ135 air quality sensor, and turbidity sensor
    are initialized and comes under the process of sensing the environmental parameters
    data, LCD displays a welcome note on its screen. GSM which we had previously installed
    into the GSM module slot is automatically initialized by sending a text message
    to the registered mobile number from another GSM number which we want to receive
    the collected data. Sensor data collection and storage-based timeframes depend
    on factors like application, sensor type, and desired analysis level. Real-time
    monitoring requires short intervals, while long-term trend analysis may require
    longer ones. So, In this work here the data from sensors are collected for different
    time slots like every minute and every 10 min regularly at ‘KLM College of Engineering
    for Women’ and its surroundings, Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh, India, from April to
    July 2023, and provided meaningful analysis. Initialized the Wi-Fi by turn on
    the Wi-Fi connection and keep it active until the relevant data is obtained. So
    once the initialization of all the components has been completed then the sensors
    started continuously sensing the environmental conditions by respective sensors.
    All the components are working under the supremacy of ATMega 1280 MCU. The sensed
    data from sensors are fetch onto the LCD. The same data simultaneously send from
    the GSM to registered mobile number, Wi-Fi also communicate simultaneously and
    automatically sent data same sensed environmental information to display on the
    website by HTTP-based protocol. The proposed system will sound a warning through
    a buzzer if it detects changes in the environmental parameters above the threshold
    values. By taking account of all the processes it is clear that the proposed system
    has been developed with the goal of multiple offers of communication for any individual
    to monitor the atmospheric changes remotely. Those are 1). LCD for direct monitoring,
    2). Buzzer to alert when threshold level reached, 3). GSM to monitor by receiving
    the SMS when the people at distance from the system and 4) Webpage to monitor
    even at far long distance. Here, the visual and digital findings of the experiment
    are available. Fig. 3 illustrates the experimental setup of a smart monitoring
    system for environmental parameters. Fig. 4 illustrates the environmental findings
    of various parameters by various wireless sensors, including a pressure sensor,
    a humidity & ambient temperature sensor, a pressure sensor, a wind speed and direction
    sensor, a raindrop sensor, a rain gauge sensor, a pH sensor, an MQ2 gas sensor,
    an MQ135 air quality sensor, and a turbidity sensor on an LCD and GSM. To inform
    the remote user and control the appropriate atmosphere to prevent dangers, the
    detected reading of the proposed experimentation is also presented on the webpage
    using the Internet of Things. Results from wireless sensors are shown on an HTTP-enabled
    webpage which is illustrated in Fig. 5. The real time environmental parameters
    obtained at KLM College of Engineering for Women, Kadapa are tabulated in tables
    from Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10,
    and their graphical representations shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig.
    10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13 are generated automatically by the software code
    which is developed to interface the hardware components used in the proposed system
    and their respectively. Based on the above results, it is feasible to send alerts
    to those who need to be aware and professional depending on the atmospheric conditions.

    detects rain when any drop placed on the sensor. Fig. 5 shows ‘Rain’ when there
    is water drop on the sensor. 3.2. Rain gauge (ultrasonic sensor) Since the ultrasonic
    sensor detects the digital value unambiguously, it is interpreted as the duration
    of time in seconds. Eq. (1) is used to determine distance with the help of the
    duration. (1) Distance = (Duration) / 58.8 3.3. Temperature and humidity sensor
    Temperature and humidity of the environment around KLMCEW, Kadapa are determined
    from the DHT-11 sensor module and updated in the HTTP based webpage, as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. The temperature is measured in degrees Celsius, while the humidity
    is expressed as a percentage with units measured in g/kg. Because the pH and turbidity
    sensors provide reliable values in specified air conditions, the temperature of
    the surrounding area is computed. As illustrated Table 3, Table 4 provided the
    measured values of temperature and humidity respectively. Similarly, Fig. 6, Fig.
    7 offered the graphical representation of temperature and humidity of the surrounding
    atmosphere are additionally recorded in the serial monitor interface of the Arduino
    IDE with Wi-Fi and PHP webpage by HTTP. The maximum temperature computed at time
    our experiment is 38 °C and minimum temperature is 36 °C., maximum and minimum
    humidity percentage findings are 43 g/kg and 38 g/kg respectively. 3.4. Atmospheric
    pressure sensor The test is carried out by comparing the data from the BMP280
    Pressure sensor measurement results, which are displayed in Table 5. Fig. 8 depicts
    a graphical representation of a pressure sensor. The pressure values obtained
    a maximum of 33,928 hpa and minimum of 33,641 which are observed in Table 5. 3.5.
    Gas sensor Gas sensor is used find the harmful gases in the atmosphere. The experimental
    finding of the gas identification is shown in Table 6 and the same readings are
    represented graphically as shown in Fig. 9. 3.6. Air quality sensor Air quality
    by using MQ135 sensor is used find the air pollution in the atmosphere. The air
    quality is measured with the unit “ppm” means part per million. The minimum and
    maximum values of air quality are 91 ppm and 94 ppm respectively. Experimentally
    obtained reading are placed in Table 7 and same are graphically represented in
    Fig. 10. 3.7. Anemometer (wind speed and direction) General DC motor with propeller
    is used here as anemometer to find the wind direction. Here, the reading 1 represents
    the clockwise direction and reading 2 represents counter clockwise direction.
    Table 8 and Fig. 11 gives the wind direction. Note the propeller placed in east
    face direction. 3.8. pH sensor Every 20 s, the computer that hosts the server
    has been upgraded. The water''s electricity is computed and updated from the sensor
    in Field 1. The pH level of the water source is being adjusted in Field 2. Water''s
    pH is directly related to its voltage. It is given in Equation (2). (2) E = E0
    +(RT/zF) pH Where E represents the cell potential under the current parameters,
    E0 denotes the cell''s potential at normal pressure and temperature, R the common
    gas constant, and T the value of the temperature, z is the total amount of electrical
    units delivered to the response, while F denotes the rate constant Faraday. Different
    observation obtained in the experiment are provided in Table 6 and the respective
    graphical representation is shown in Fig. 12. 3.9. Turbidity sensor Table 10 and
    Fig. 8 shows how the Server calculates and updates the turbidness measurements
    in the units called NTU and water''s electricity (in volts). According to Eq.
    (3), the turbidity of water is inversely correlated to water''s voltage. (3) z
    = −1120.4y2+5742.3y–4352.9 In Eq. (3), ‘z’ represents the value of the turbidity
    and ‘y’ represents the voltage. If the suggested system detects changes in environmental
    factors that exceed the threshold values, it will sound a warning via a buzzer.
    Environmental conditions significantly impact the reliability and performance
    of environmental monitoring systems. Extreme temperatures, humidity, pH levels,
    raindrop sensors, flood alarm sensors, turbidity sensors, and wind sensors can
    all affect their accuracy and stability. High temperatures can cause overheating,
    low temperatures can cause sensitivity, and humidity can cause corrosion. pH sensors
    require regular calibration and maintenance to extend their lifespan. Raindrop
    sensors should have high water saturation tolerance, sensitivity levels, fast
    response times, and durable construction. Rain gauge sensors should be robust,
    reliable, and calibrated to withstand high rainfall rates. The proposed advanced
    real-time smart environmental parameters monitoring system offers several unique
    features and improvements compared to existing monitoring systems. The improvements
    are real-time monitoring of environmental parameters, wireless connectivity, data
    integration and analysis, advanced sensor technology, customizable alerting and
    reporting, scalability and flexibility, and a user-friendly interface. Therefore,
    overall, the proposed advanced real-time smart environmental parameters monitoring
    system offers enhanced capabilities. Also, the proposed method provides a comprehensive
    solution for monitoring and measuring multiple environmental parameters simultaneously,
    facilitating better environmental management and decision-making. The effectiveness
    of a real-time smart environmental parameter monitoring system is determined by
    several aspects, including wireless connectivity range, sensor location, network
    architecture, geographical scope, scalability, and remote monitoring capabilities.
    Wireless communication can extend up to a few hundred feet indoors, and sensor
    placement assures optimal coverage. This Arduino Uno and ESP8266-based system
    can collect and send data from a variety of environmental sensors. The system''s
    range and coverage are determined by the exact sensors utilized as well as the
    ESP8266 module''s communication capabilities. The ESP8266 module, which provides
    Wi-Fi connectivity, has a typical range of approximately 100 m in an open area.
    Network infrastructure may limit coverage to locations with adequate network coverage.
    Geographical scope can be limited by physical location and deployment strategy.
    Scalability can be achieved by adding more sensors, microcontrollers, and communication
    infrastructure, but associated costs and logistics must be considered. The range
    and coverage of the system can also be influenced by power supply limitations
    and environmental constraints. Real-time monitoring systems for environmental
    parameters can offer several cost-effective advantages compared to traditional
    monitoring methods. This system requires an upfront investment in equipment and
    infrastructure, but it can provide significant long-term cost savings compared
    to traditional monitoring methods. The ability to continuously collect accurate,
    immediate data, reduce labor costs, and make timely decisions based on real-time
    information can lead to improved efficiency and precision, risk mitigation, cost
    savings in maintenance and repair, scalability, and flexibility. 4. Conclusions
    Everyone needs to be aware of the changes in the environment. Maintaining a positive
    atmosphere becomes important in enclosed and open workspaces like underground
    mines, office buildings, rooms, indoor, outdoor, or rooftop farms, seashores,
    mountains, and so on. Therefore, persistent observation of the environment employing
    real-time smart technology contributes to the collection of data required to recognize
    patterns, make estimations, and set variables, all of which are critical for early
    warning techniques. Accountability is one significant benefit of the growth of
    real-time monitoring of the environment. IoT has a significant impact on raising
    environmental standards. It has clever and cutting-edge methods for water treatment
    and air quality testing that significantly advance sustainable living. Hence,
    proposed an advanced real-time smart environmental parameters monitoring system
    using IoT and wireless sensors. That system captures real-time data through the
    use of several sensors which related sense the data of air, water, waste, energy
    and soil. The sensor network used here includes a temperature & humidity sensor,
    pressure sensor, gas sensor, air quality sensor, rain gauge, raindrop sensor,
    pH sensor, wind speed and direction sensors, soil moisture and light intensity.
    The sensed data is then sent to an Arduino Uno-based microcontroller, which communicates
    it via GSM, LCD, buzzer and Wi-Fi enabled HTTP based webpage. To facilitate data
    collecting and display, and to take advantage of technological improvements, a
    Wi-Fi module is used here to communicate the detected environmental parameters
    to a webpage where the recorded data can be viewed on an IoT-based mobile or personal
    computer. Perhaps the most beneficial IoT application is environmental monitoring.
    It promotes improved sustainability by using modern sensor devices to identify
    the presence of contaminants in the soil, waste, water, air, and energy. Using
    smart environmental monitoring technology can help you keep your premises safer
    and cleaner. Implementing this IoT-based environmental parameter monitoring system
    can present a number of challenges and limitations, including connectivity issues,
    security and privacy concerns, scalability and interoperability, power constraints,
    data management and analytics, cost considerations, user experience, and adoption.
    Being aware of these challenges and restrictions allows you to plan and strategize
    accordingly, ensuring the successful installation of this IoT-based monitoring
    system. Two important things to take into account for future work, first, the
    proposed architecture becomes more sophisticated when a greater number of sensors,
    communication, and alarm components are interconnected. The global positioning
    system (GPS) cannot be interfaced due to its complexity. Second, the proposed
    system''s continually sensed data will be compared with data from forecasting
    agencies using various data analysis techniques to determine accuracy. Data availability

  description: Efficient characterization of wastewater stream quality is vital to
    ensure the safe discharge or reuse of treated wastewater (WW). There are numerous
    parameters employed to characterize water quality, some required by directives
    (e.g. biological oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphates (TP)),
    while others used for process controls (e.g. flow, temperature, pH). Well-accepted
    methods to assess these parameters have traditionally been laboratory-based, taking
    place either off-line or at-line, and presenting a significant delay between sampling
    and result. Alternative characterization methods can run in-line or on-line, generally
    being more cost-effective. Unfortunately, these methods are often not accepted
    when providing information to regulatory bodies. The current review aims to describe
    available laboratory-based approaches and compare them with innovative real-time
    (RT) solutions. Transitioning from laboratory-based to RT measurements means obtaining
    valuable process data, avoiding time delays, and the possibility to optimize the
    (WW) treatment management. A variety of sensor categories are examined to illustrate
    a general framework in which RT applications can replace longer conventional processes,
    with an eye toward potential drawbacks. A significant enhancement in the RT measurements
    can be achieved through the employment of advanced soft-sensing techniques and
    the Internet of Things (IoT), coupled with machine learning (ML) and artificial
    intelligence (AI).

    content Under a Creative Commons license open access Abstract Efficient characterization
    of wastewater stream quality is vital to ensure the safe discharge or reuse of
    treated wastewater (WW). There are numerous parameters employed to characterize
    water quality, some required by directives (e.g. biological oxygen demand (BOD),
    total nitrogen (TN), total phosphates (TP)), while others used for process controls
    (e.g. flow, temperature, pH). Well-accepted methods to assess these parameters
    have traditionally been laboratory-based, taking place either off-line or at-line,
    and presenting a significant delay between sampling and result. Alternative characterization
    methods can run in-line or on-line, generally being more cost-effective. Unfortunately,
    these methods are often not accepted when providing information to regulatory
    bodies. The current review aims to describe available laboratory-based approaches
    and compare them with innovative real-time (RT) solutions. Transitioning from
    laboratory-based to RT measurements means obtaining valuable process data, avoiding
    time delays, and the possibility to optimize the (WW) treatment management. A
    variety of sensor categories are examined to illustrate a general framework in
    which RT applications can replace longer conventional processes, with an eye toward
    potential drawbacks. A significant enhancement in the RT measurements can be achieved
    through the employment of advanced soft-sensing techniques and the Internet of
    Things (IoT), coupled with machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).

    1. Introduction Health hazards and diseases caused by improperly treated wastewater
    (WW) are critical problems that humanity still faces today. Poor water quality
    may cause severe infections in humans and animals, limit food production, reduce
    the ecosystem’s functions and biodiversity, obstruct economic growth, and result
    in an environmental, social, and political disaster [1]. The United Nations (UN)
    adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the so-called “2030 Agenda
    for Sustainable Development” in 2015 [2]. The subject of the included sixth SDG
    refers to “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation
    for all”. The SDG 6 progress summary reveals that in 2020 two billion people (26%
    of the world’s population) were lacking access to a safe drinking water source,
    resulting in unnecessary suffering due to water-borne diseases [3]. Furthermore,
    the progressing climate change and the continuous surface water pollution from
    contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), such as pesticides, pharmaceutics, drugs,
    personal-care chemicals, and long-lasting chemicals [4], represents a grave and
    long-term threat to the whole of humanity and the ecosystem in which we live.
    Therefore, WW quality characterization and measurement needs to be drastically
    improved to monitor the WW treatment and to identify pollutants of concern, ensuring
    its sustainable discharge in surface basins or soils. The characterization is
    performed by calculating specific parameters, classified into physical, chemical,
    and biological [5]. The physical parameters (e.g., turbidity, color, odor, solids
    concentration, temperature, conductivity, pH), chemical properties (e.g., chemical
    oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), TN, TP, chlorides, sulfates,
    alkalinity), and biological characteristics (e.g., total coliforms, Escherichia
    coli (E. Coli), total nematodes) have to be measured throughout the wastewater
    treatment plant (WWTP) to control the variability of the load [6] and the subsequent
    effluent quality. Discharging thresholds and sampling frequencies may vary in
    accordance with national or international regulations and guidelines [7]. Nowadays,
    WW characterization state-of-practice relies mainly on standardized laboratory
    tests. These may require expensive instrumentation, specific chemical reagents,
    and complex, and time-consuming tests in critical environments [8]. The sample
    collection, preservation, and analytical procedures (including all the required
    reagents) are typically noted in the Standard Methods for the examination of water
    and wastewater [9]. Based on the investigated pollutants, the analytical experiments
    may be performed through titrations, spectrophotometric measurements, sensor analyses,
    and many other methods. Each laboratory-based analysis is unavoidably time-consuming,
    and results are delayed as the data must be processed [8]. Despite their widespread
    use, we are facing an ever-growing request for rapid procedures for the quality
    characterization of the WW flows. There exist real-time (RT) methods which address
    the time concerns, however, they are not considered entirely dependable and thus
    are not widely adopted yet [10]. Before proceeding, it is necessary to establish
    a nomenclature regarding WW monitoring. The two main monitoring methods typically
    employed in WWTPs are (a) traditional laboratory-based, and (b) real-time, as
    illustrated in Fig. 1. Within each, there are two different monitoring approaches
    that will be discussed. Download : Download high-res image (328KB) Download :

    (a) Traditional laboratory-based and (b) real-time methods. The traditional laboratory-based
    methods, including off-line and at-line analyses, require identical steps from
    sampling to laboratory controls. However, in the off-line processes the sample
    is delivered to an external laboratory and not tested in the proximity of the
    sampling point [11]. The at-line analyses are processed near the location where
    the sample is collected [12]. However, building an additional area inside the
    WWTP may be challenging in terms of space, security (usage of chemical reagents,
    suitable temperature, and pressure may be required), and costs. It is possible
    to operate through automatic samplers, reducing the operator efforts. In any case,
    unavoidable delays between sample collection and data acquisition are occurring.
    Switching to a RT monitoring means to obtain a processed output data in a restrained
    timespan after the on-field acquisition. Even though in-line (also referred to
    as In situ) or on-line (typically installed on a bypass if in-line installation
    is not possible) measurements have existed since the 1970s for many applications,
    they have been expensive and required extensive maintenance [13]. Improvements
    in their operation have brought about great opportunities to attain high-performing
    RT WW characterization. The employment of RT approaches should effectively substitute
    the current methods which are demanding of both time and reagents and enable rapid
    data availability for post-processing or remote-control uses [14]. As mentioned,
    the availability of reliable RT data has become essential for advanced process
    control in the WWTP [15]. Hence, this drives the development and optimization
    of sensors. Being the WW a complex mixture, sensors still need developments in
    order to reliably detect trace amounts of pollutants. Improved sensor capabilities
    allow for a more integrated control system, which in turn can lead to better management
    of the WW treatment plant in terms of energy and chemical reagent usage [16].
    Digitalization of the WW monitoring process can be enhanced through emerging technologies,
    such as artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT) [17]. A review
    focusing on WW online monitoring is presented by Bourgeois et al. [11]. The authors
    introduce standard methods and then further discuss alternative techniques including
    biosensors, optical sensors, sensor arrays and briefly mention soft sensors. Korostynska
    et al. [18] review traditionally laboratory-based and modern RT approaches in
    a book chapter. The most commonly measured water parameters, current techniques
    in monitoring wastewater quality and their limitations are presented. Furthermore,
    a comprehensive description regarding sensors (electromagnetic, electronic, and
    biosensors) for RT monitoring is reported. A review on water quality sensors is
    authored by Kruse [19], presenting various water quality parameters and how these
    can be determined, dedicating special attention to chemical sensors, mechanical,
    optical, and electric transduction-based sensors in a view of a reagent-free,
    low-maintenance and continuous monitoring application. Conventional methods and
    emerging technologies for general water quality monitoring were also reviewed
    by Ahmed et al. [20], including detection systems based on statistical inference,
    machine learning (ML), and IoT devices. A more recent review by Thakur and Devi
    [21] noted material advances, status, and future perspectives on water pollution
    monitoring. Further focuses on electrochemical, electrical, and optical sensors
    are reported. Special attention is then dedicated to IoT devices for water quality
    monitoring and emerging pollutants. While the available reviews provide broad
    and comprehensive overviews of WW monitoring, they do not provide deep enough
    insight into the main characteristics of WW and practices for traditional laboratory-based
    methods as well as RT measurements. Moreover, they do not thoroughly explore the
    transition from laboratory-based tests to RT sensors in WWTP, nor do they offer
    an outlook of water quality characterization opportunities in a European context.
    A more comprehensive study focusing on these aspects is therefore needed. The
    present literature review aims to address these gaps while highlighting algorithm-based
    sensors and cutting-edge monitoring technologies. The present review includes
    seven sections. The first section introduces the theme of the paper with an in-depth
    focus on the definition of WW monitoring, while the second describes the method
    for literature search and analysis. The third chapter identifies the main characteristics
    of WW and typical concentrations in urban WWTPs. The fourth section is dedicated
    to traditional laboratory-based measurements offering an extensive summary of
    methods, instruments, and main principles of analysis. An important passage is
    dedicated to the time required for each analysis to be performed and references
    to the new proposal concerning urban wastewater treatment. The fifth unit introduces
    RT measurements, summarizing parameters that are measured and sensors. The sixth
    section focuses on the future perspective of WW quality characterization, including
    emerging pollutants as well as new frontiers for RT measurements and soft sensors.
    The last chapter concludes the paper. 2. Literature analysis method Publications
    between 2010 to 2022 have been the focus of this review. Several large scientific
    databases (Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Dimension AI) were used
    to identify the topic research trend. The investigation examines the keywords
    “wastewater quality”, inquiring about the interest in the document’s title or
    abstract. To define the literature research trend, all types of available documents
    were included, i.e. research and review articles, book chapters, journal and conference
    papers, theses and dissertations, short reviews, encyclopedias, academic books,
    pre-prints, abstracts, short communications, technical reports and other scholarly
    literature. All the publishing access classes were considered. The total number
    of outputs was reported on a yearly basis and can be seen in Fig. 2. Note that
    the exact numbers may differ slightly based on the organizational login. The methodology
    to identify the research trend is comparable to several previous works [14,22,23].
    The results show a consistent increase in the number of publications on the topic
    of WW quality. Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Dimension AI give respectively
    a +190%, +198%, and +341% increase in publications over the period 2010-2022.
    Considering the field of science and engineering (S&E, all fields) from the 15
    largest production countries, the mean increase in the published literature is
    around 52% above the same period [24]. Therefore, comparing the relative increase
    in the whole S&E area with the wastewater quality field, it is possible to identify
    the latter as attractive for researchers during recent years. Download : Download

    in the current review, the aforementioned scientific databases were used in combination
    with Google Scholar. Documents were identified using the keywords “wastewater
    quality” in addition to one of the several selected knowledge-based appropriate
    terms, such as “biosensors”, “real-time”, “characterization”, “IoT”, and more.
    Relevant guidelines, handbooks, and regulations were also included as necessary.
    3. Main characteristics of wastewater The following two categories of WW are distinct
    from one another: (a) domestic wastewater (DWW), and (b) non-domestic wastewater
    (N-DWW). DWW is defined as water altered in quality after being in contact with
    anthropic activities, such as human metabolism and household uses. Whereas N-DWW
    is discharged into collecting systems from other processes, mainly industries,
    exercises of trade, and institutions. The mixture of these two different wastewaters
    and the run-off stormwater is called urban wastewater (UWW) [25]. The composition
    and the load of organic compounds, solids, nutrients, micropollutants, and microorganisms
    may vary based on the different WW sources. Large discrepancies in properties
    (amount and kind of contaminants) of DWW, N-DWW, and UWW result in challenging
    measurements [26]. These heterogeneities may require different measurement campaign
    designs and equipment, adding extra cost and complexity to the characterization
    process. Countries and organizations commonly define specific guidelines or regulations
    to standardize the number of parameters (physical, chemical, and biological) needed
    for WW characterization. Different criteria may be required depending on the discharge
    location [4]. The prevailing pollutants residing in the WW are summarized in Table

    ⁎⁎⁎ CFU: Colony forming unit Commonly only a few of the parameters specified in
    Table 1 are mandatory water quality measurements in the treatment process. The
    European Council Directive 91/271/EEC defines the “Requirements for discharges
    from urban wastewater treatment plants” as a broad threshold or a percentage of
    reduction (effluent concentration compared to the influent characteristics) [32].
    The WW quality is defined through an organic matter content, BOD (BOD5 without
    nitrification) or COD, total suspended solids (TSS), and nutrients, through TN
    and TP. The discharge of WW is allowed when the analysis returns a concentration
    below the given limits or a reduction percentage higher than the one established
    by the Directive. Knowledge of the parameters at the inlet and the outlet of the
    WWTP is required to monitor the WW treatment progress [33]. Moreover, the European
    Directive suggests specific evaluation methodologies to be followed [32]. For
    further characterizations, COD is generally divided into its Total, Suspended,
    and Soluble fractions. Solids, specifically the suspended and volatile parts,
    are important in the treatment processes. WW streams contain concentrations of
    nutrients (N-P-K are the predominant ones) which vary in magnitude from 1’s to
    10’s of mg L-1. These compounds may be traceable under several forms: nitrogen
    as ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite; phosphorus as orthophosphates and polyphosphates,
    having both organic and inorganic forms. All of them are essential for nourishing
    numerous life forms [34]. An excessive amount of nutrients discharged in static
    water basins may provoke the eutrophication of the environment [35]. Nevertheless,
    the European Council Directive 91/271/EEC does not consider heavy metals (HMs),
    pathogens, and surfactants as mandatory quality controls, even though WW possesses
    significant amounts. HMs and microorganisms must be considered for an ecotoxicity
    analysis [36]. However, due to demanding analysis (mainly in terms of sample preparation
    and cost) less frequent HM tests are made. Microorganisms are an essential indicator
    due to their potential long-lasting impact on human health [37]. Moreover, surfactants
    are widely employed in households’ activities and discharged in the drainage systems,
    reaching a WWTP with significant concentrations [38]. A recent proposal for a
    directive of the European Parliament and of the Council [25] concerning urban
    wastewater treatment from 26/10/2022, updated the 1991 Directive. The proposal
    substitutes the old thresholds and introduces relevant requirements that must
    be satisfied before WWTP effluent is discharged into receiving water bodies. On
    top of that, a quaternary treatment is requested, and “substances that can pollute
    water even at low concentrations” became mandatory to analyze. The latter compounds,
    being part of the CECs, are not given a concentration threshold but rather a minimum
    percentage of removal to be reached. A list of twelve compounds, divided into
    two groups, is reported by the new proposal. Category 1 (substances that can be
    very easily treated): (i) Amisulprid, (ii) Carbamazepine, (iii) Citalopram, (iv)
    Clarithromycin, (v) Diclofenac, (vi) Hydrochlorothiazide, (vii) Metoprolol, (viii)
    Venlafaxine; Category 2 (substances that can be easily disposed of): (i) Benzotriazole,
    (ii) Candesartan, (iii) Irbesartan, (iv) mixture of 4-Methylbenzotriazole and
    6-methyl- benzotriazole. Remarkably, being these compounds currently part of the
    proposal, slight changes may occur when it is implemented. Looking at a global
    perspective, regulations or guidelines adopted to assess the WW flows can be even
    stricter than EU legislation, adding a larger number of requirements or lower
    thresholds [7]. 4. Traditional laboratory-based measurements Several laboratory-based
    methods are available and recognized by the international scientific community.
    The most common are spectrophotometric, colorimetric, and titration measurements
    [39]. Sampling campaigns, obtaining appropriate containers for storage, and transportation
    to the laboratory are required steps preceding analysis [40]. These steps represent
    a non-negligible time delay toward a measurement output. As expressed in Table
    2, several standardized methods are available. By reason of well-established analytical
    approaches in WW laboratories, brief descriptions are given as in-depth details
    (such as preparation, calibration of instruments, interferences, and more) are
    specified in manuals and standards [9,41]. Parameters in Table 2 are categorized
    in alphabetical order. Table 2. Main traditional laboratory-based procedures for

    - [9,10] ⁎ Methods reported with the number of references and name The followed
    procedures during laboratory-based analysis are mainly reported within the Standard
    Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater [9]. Moreover, the Water Analysis
    Handbook from Hach [41] serves as an additional reference. The handbook contains
    approved methods by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)
    or patented by the HACH Lange company. As mentioned above, the prevailing parameters
    that must be monitored in an urban WWTP are defined by the European Council Directive
    91/271/EEC [32]. In addition, the new proposal [25] introduces the TOC measure
    as an alternative to COD and sets the parameter TSS as optional. BOD5, TOC, and
    COD measurement procedures are often time demanding. For instance, BOD5 or ultimate
    BOD20 require 5 and 20 days, respectively, to complete the analytical process
    [42]. A respirometric test to fractionate the COD could take more than 24 hours
    [43,45]; even if less time is required to attain the output values, a delay between
    the sampling and the availability of the result is unavoidable. Different interferences
    are observed inside WW when analyzed via light penetration for example TSS can
    inhibit adequate light transmission and reduce the accuracy of the measurements.
    Filtration is commonly adopted to remove settleable solids from a liquid sample.
    Other solid removal procedures are centrifugation or flocculation [46,47]. The
    standard laboratory tests for nutrient estimation, including nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium, are mostly spectrophotometric- or colorimetric-based. Careful considerations
    on each test range define the requirements for sample dilution. Other parameters,
    such as color, DO, turbidity, temperature, pH, alkalinity, and conductivity, are
    widely monitored through optical and membrane probes and can also be characterized
    with spectrophotometric or colorimetric methods [9]. Available tests for pathogens
    are mostly related to the most probable number (MPN) and membrane filtration.
    These processes are characterized by a long preparation and incubation of the
    cultures [48]. The Table 2 parameters not covered by the directive, such as surfactants
    and HMs, can be assessed with a vast range of laboratory instruments. Almost all
    laboratory-based analyses are time intensive, from the sample preparation (i.e.
    filtration, dilution) to the duration of the laboratory analysis (i.e. digestion,
    reaction time, mixing) [41]. Table 3 reports the mean duration of the overall
    laboratory test, maintaining the parameters defined in Table 2. Table 3. Relation
    between the compound measured in the laboratory and the duration of the analysis.

    to clarify that these durations must be considered as the time needed to perform
    the test and read the result on the device, starting with a sample fully prepared.
    The sample collection (normally 24 hours), transport to the laboratory location
    (variable from minutes to hours), and preparation (variable from minutes to hours)
    are not included. Moreover, the reagents preparation and the test management may
    augment the required time. In addition to the aforementioned methods, high-precision
    instruments (tracing parts per billion (ppb) concentrations) may be employed to
    characterize the liquid matrix [50]. However, longer sample preparations, expensive
    reagents, and higher process complexity are possible drawbacks. Instruments, such
    as Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry/mass spectrometry
    (ICP-OES/MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and high-performance liquid chromatography
    (HPLC), are typically used for qualitative assessments [[51], [52], [53]]. However,
    the requirements and costs for installation, standard references, and maintenance
    requirements are onerous. The ICP-OES/MS principle is based on a coupled effect
    between inductively coupled plasma (ICP), optical emission spectrometry (OES),
    (sometimes also referred to as atomic emission spectrometry (AES)) and mass spectroscopy
    (MS). This instrument can determine the concentration of metallic and non-metallic
    inorganic substances at ppb [54]. Gas chromatography (GC) is used for the characterization
    of several WW micropollutants [55]. Moreover, fluorescence techniques are employed
    for WWTP process control [42,56]. Laboratory analyses along with nuclear magnetic
    resonance (NMR) are useful to detect liquid organic contents. A wide variety of
    compounds may successfully be quantified through the 1H NMR [57]. Furthermore,
    solid-state 13C NMR revealed promising features for its application as a qualitative
    detection of organic matter [58]. Evaluations of several HMs have been performed
    through flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS) on water samples [20,59,60].
    Towards the assessment of the twelve emerging compounds from the 2022 proposal
    [25], a brief investigation is reported. The following references are obtained
    by searching in the above-mentioned databases for the name of the substance and
    “wastewater”. The most relevant results were examined and reported in Table 4.
    It is common that no standard laboratory tests (i.e. titration, colorimetric evaluations)
    are available for their measurement except advanced and demanding instruments,
    such as liquid chromatography (LC), HPLC, ultra HPLC (UHPLC), reversed-phase LC
    (RPLC), diode-array detection (DAD), and GC, regularly coupled with MS. Table

    The identification of a single compound inside WW can be challenging due to the
    large number and variety of compounds present and potential interferences. The
    availability of a reference standard for the compound of interest can impact the
    applicability of the analytical methodologies, such as LC which is not suitable
    to identify a single target without a reference [86]. However, analytical procedures
    that do not require standard references for target identification are potential
    solutions (non-target screening) [87]. The concentrations of micrograms per liter
    or lower are currently challenging to be measured. Regardless of the difficulties,
    the monitoring of WWTP discharges into water bodies must consider these CECs.
    Removal through tertiary [88] or quaternary [25] treatments is required to meet
    new regulatory requirements. 5. Overview of real-time measurements RT techniques
    may provide a solution to overcome struggles regarding the preparation, collection,
    and storage of WW samples, resulting in faster data acquisition from WWTP flows
    [89]. The RT measurements, as previously mentioned, are carried out with sensor-based
    in-line or on-line monitoring. Precise, accurate, cost-effective, operator-friendly,
    and fast-response procedures must be introduced to optimize the WWTP and improve
    control and the detection of abnormalities throughout the processes [15]. Among
    all the above-mentioned parameters, WW inflow concentrations of BOD, COD, TN,
    and TP and DO values throughout the treatment are most influential to the performance
    of WWTPs [90]. By characterizing the inflow, aeration processes and chemical addition
    can be optimized in RT [91,92]. Focusing on the energy and the operational costs,
    several literature studies reported monitoring strategies for process control.
    Continuous influent RT characterization of pilot- and full-scale plants are shown
    to be capable of reducing the annual energy consumption from 13 to 30%, through
    improving the accuracy of process control [15]. So, developed sensors may improve
    WWTP supervision, leading to an optimal management and overview of the WWTP’s
    energy consumption [93]. Overall, it appears that implementing RT measurements
    of relevant parameters can improve the operation of the WWTP [94]. However, as
    with most technologies, improper use can cause malfunctions which represents a
    grave drawback [93]. The sensor installation and maintenance need to be considered;
    periodic calibration and repairs could be an inconvenience for the WWTP administration
    [95,96]. Furthermore, a robust elaboration/processing model is needed to set the
    variables and manage the extensive datasets acquired during the continuous measurement
    [89]. The main RT available technologies are reported in Table. Parameters are
    listed in alphabetical order. Available sensors allow the measurements of a wide
    range of parameters, useful for characterizing WW. Each parameter reported in
    Table 5 is related to an appropriate sensor for its evaluation. Principles of
    measurement are also reported. Innovative applications consist of fiber optics,
    potentiometric, and electrochemical biosensors, adopted in the In situ WW quality
    assessment [103,108]. Table 5. Available real-time measurement processes for wastewater

    Electrochemical sensor Potentiometric, conductometric [19] In general, a sensor
    is responsive to changes of certain liquid properties. The acquired signal is
    transduced into a readable value [109,110]. Input sources may vary from sensor
    to sensor: voltage, current, conductivity, and dielectric constant are monitorable.
    5.1. Optical sensors Optical sensors are referred to when a direct optical property
    of WW can be measured [111] differencing from chemical-optical sensors where an
    analyte-sensitive receptor is required [112,113]. Optical ultraviolet-visible
    (UV-Vis) sensors are widely employed; however, issues during In situ analysis
    such as sensor fouling (i.e. various deposit accumulation on the optical surfaces)
    often occur [98]. Among all the traceable WW compounds, only a fraction of them
    absorb light in the UV-Vis range (wavelength from 190 to 850 nm) [114]. This results
    in a need to combine UV-Vis sensors with other optical analytical methods in order
    to cover a wider wavelength spectrum. Infrared (IR), fluorescence, and Raman spectrophotometric
    investigations are nowadays applied in WWTP RT monitoring [10]. Despite technological
    developments with the achievement of higher precisions, optical methods still
    in many cases remain bound to laboratory validation and the reusability of these
    sensors has still to be assessed [107]. Promising In situ analysis can be achieved
    by optical fiber sensors that are easy to place in hard-to-reach areas due to
    small probe size and are resilient in tough conditions (i.e. noise, vibrations,
    and heat) [115]. The composition of optical fiber sensors differs from the electrical
    due to the introduction of glass fibers instead of copper cables, capturing light
    as an indicator. The fiber’s protective coating plays a significant role in avoiding
    external interferences [116]. In addition, transducers and detectors are required
    [98]. Polymeric fibers are also used in these sensors. Nowadays, commercially
    available fiber optic sensors may cover the whole UV-Vis-IR spectrum. Detection
    limit improvements are under development, with novel materials implementation
    [108]. 5.2. Chemical sensors Chemical sensors are able to detect particular chemical
    properties from an analyte. The detected input has to be further transduced into
    a readable physical signal. Three main mechanisms of transduction are available:
    (a) mechanical, (b) optical, and (c) electrical [19]. To elaborate on these: (a)
    An atom, composing a molecule, fills a precise amount of physical space (i.e.
    steric effect concept). Mechanical transduction works through the understanding
    of this physical space taken by an analyte species. Therefore, the signal, converted
    before the final recognition, is uniquely defined. Previous studies employed mechanical
    sensors for the evaluation of ammonium ions [117] and total hardness [118]. Continuing
    to (b), optical transduction identifies changes in the electronic structure of
    the receptor molecule. An analyte detector is required to provide acquirable optical
    signals [113,119]. Absorbance, chemiluminescence, fluorescence, and phosphorescence
    are evaluated as optical properties [15]. Optical fibers are adopted as transductor
    as well [120]. As reported in Table, chemical sensors with optical transductor
    may identify several parameters, such as pH, total hardness, nitrates, phosphates,
    different metal cations, DO, and surfactants [19]. Finally, (c), the electrical
    transductor requires direct contact with the liquid sample. The presence of high
    solid concentrations or aggressive compounds may lead to malfunctions in sensors
    of this type. The principle of detection is based mainly on potentiometric, amperometric,
    voltametric, and electrochemical impedance measurements [19]. Recent studies have
    revealed that the chemical sensors may be applied successfully for RT In situ
    analyses [14,100]. Further studies are needed to evaluate their long-term applicability,
    overtaking additional WW pre-treatments to enhance the signal’s acquisition [121].
    5.3. Biosensors Biosensors are currently employed for the evaluation of organic
    compounds, microorganisms, and heavy metals [103]. Biosensors are made up of two
    main components: a bioreceptor and a transducer [122]. Amperometric biosensors
    are used for BOD and COD assessments [123]. Heat variations are also considered
    in COD measurements [124]. Persistent organic compounds are traceable in WWTP
    connected to industrial discharges [125]. Microbial fuel cell (MFC)-based biosensors
    have been introduced in the detection of organic compounds [97,126]. The application
    of biosensing techniques may also provide RT controls for microorganisms [127].
    European guidelines and regulations for the assessment of Total Coliforms, E.
    Coli, Enterococcus, and Intestinal Nematodes as microorganism indicators [7] have
    conferred even more importance to their RT surveillance [102]. Recent studies
    focused on the detection of microorganisms in WW through optical and electrochemical
    biosensors. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [128,129], resonant mirror (RM) [106],
    sensitive chemiluminescence immunosensors [130], and amperometric biosensors [131,132]
    were reviewed, resulting in precisions closer to μg L-1. Increasing attention
    is also given to the assessment of HMs in waste liquids [133]. Biosensors and
    nano-biosensors have been introduced in WW analysis as a substitute for analytical
    methods. Even though laboratory analysis possesses sufficient precision and reliability,
    the establishment of sensor-based In situ measurements is preferred due to the
    faster response time, as previously mentioned. Taking advantage of bacteria as
    a bioluminescence source, microbial biosensors are able to detect the presence
    of low-concentrated HMs [104,134]. Nano-biosensors, based on the fluorescence
    resonance energy transfer (FRET) principle, can measure trace concentrations of
    metals. A broad range of enzymes have been applied in these RT monitoring techniques
    through enzyme-based electrochemical biosensors and aptasensors [135,136], with
    the potential addition of nanomaterials to enhance their detectable capabilities
    [137]. Moreover, ion-selective polymer membranes [138,139] and fluorescent-based
    microfluidic devices [[140], [141], [142]] have shown potential in pollution control
    of aqueous solutions. A combination of two or more methods [143] or materials
    [144] may be convenient. Recent studies have reported that MFC-based biosensors
    have the potential to be a cost-effective device for WW RT monitoring [23,97].
    Small-scale devices were developed even though their stability, sensitivity, repeatability,
    and selectivity have still to be validated. MFCs have been additionally tested
    for the investigation of BOD, COD, and DO [[145], [146], [147]]. 5.4. Ion-selective
    membrane sensors Ion-selective membrane (ISM) sensors are established detectors
    for measuring the ammonium concentration in water [148]. A new generation of solid-state
    ion-selective membranes (S-ISMs) is studied to overtake the high costs and fragility
    of the available ISMs [149]. S-ISM performances have shown to be more durable,
    accurate, have a more rapid response time, and be cheaper than ISM sensors [105].
    Moreover, electrospray printing technology was successfully employed in the preparation
    of an ultrathin S-ISM. Results showed an increase in the sensor response, still
    maintaining a restrained error [149]. Metal ions are also monitored in RT within
    industrial WW flows [150,151] and WWTPs [152] using these technologies. 5.5. Lab-on-chip
    and electrochemical sensor-based systems Lab-on-chip (LOC) and electrochemical
    sensor-based systems were tested for WW characterization [153]. The introduction
    of In situ LOC aimed to transform the whole analytical laboratory process (sampling,
    preparation, addition of reagents, chemical reactions, and measurements) into
    a simplified, fast-responding, and restrained-volume approach. The integration
    of microelectrodes and microelectromechanical systems with potentiometric and
    voltametric sensors was assessed. Applications on real plants for nutrients evaluation
    are reported in the literature [154,155]. 5.6. Electromagnetic wave sensors Recent
    applications of electromagnetic wave (EM-W) sensors aimed to control WW pollution
    through important parameters like COD and nitrates [156], HMs [157], E. coli,
    and Pseudomonas Aeruginosa [99] with frequencies in the range of 0-15 GHz. In
    order to evaluate Cu, Ni, and Zn concentrations, the EM-W reflection technique
    was flanked with an open-ended coaxial sensor. Moreover, phosphates, ammonium,
    and other HMs (Hg, Pb, Cr) were tested at 1-10 GHz [158]. The electromagnetic
    waves, interacting directly with the analyte, generate a singular response that
    is specifically related to the WW properties [159]. Microwave sensing allows the
    non-invasive RT characterization of WW. Considering variations between the output
    transmittance (or reflectance) wave and the input signals at peculiar frequencies,
    the composition of the liquid can be established. The fluctuations of the surrounding
    environmental conditions (temperature, pH, turbidity, etc.) have to be taken into
    account while comparing analyses along time [160,161]. 5.7. Electronic tongues
    An electronic tongue (ET) structure is based on a group of low selective sensors
    that, through the avail of data processing analysis, emerged to be suitable for
    a quantitative WW characterization [162]. The voltametric ET is the most diffused
    detector, assessing the potential variations over time. These devices are composed
    of a set of metallic sensors covered with films (useful for sensitivity improvement)
    coupled with a reference electrode [163]. ETs are efficient, low-volume requiring,
    cost-effective, faster-response, and automatic detectors. Moreover, the In situ
    measurements do not require qualified operators [164]. Amperometric bioelectronic
    tongues are likewise considered in literature [165]. principal component analysis
    (PCA), partial least square analysis (PLS) and neural networks analysis (NNA)
    are diffused elaboration processes to handle the huge quantity of output acquisitions
    [15]. 5.8. Final remarks The use of hardware redundancy, multiple sensors for
    the same parameter placed at a single measurement location, is a common way to
    detect errors in the measurements provided by RT sensors. Another approach is
    the use of sensor fusion technology, which leads to an improved ability to detect
    errors through combining information from multiple measurement types [130]. Sensor
    fusion can also take the form of analytical redundancy, as opposed to hardware
    redundancy, through the use of different models, soft sensors, or analyses of
    the measurements [166]. Despite having a single sensor, more signals could highlight
    a malfunction, or error, in the measurements [167]. Similarly, data reconciliation
    techniques can be employed to correct, validate, and harmonize data from disparate
    sensor sources, enhancing accuracy and reliability in the detection of discrepancies
    or errors [168]. Several devices are being, and have been, developed for RT measurements
    of WW quality parameters. However, a small percentage of them are suitable for
    multiple purposes. Sensors are ordinarily built for a specific purpose and are
    not reusable in other environments [21]. Several challenges are faced during RT
    analysis, exceeding precision and general applicability. The harsh conditions
    in WW flows require sensors either specifically designed to withstand the hostile
    environment or extensive maintenance [169]. Both cases are costly and time-consuming.
    Fault detection is likewise essential. For instance, air bubble interference may
    alter the optical sensor outputs, and clogging due to the presence of small particulates
    can cause permanent damage [170]. Moreover, biofouling (an undesired formation
    of bacteria colonies that alters the sensor performance [171]) is a challenge
    for any sensor in direct liquid contact. Copper-based and plastic protections
    are valid anti-biofouling countermeasures [19]. Thus, the sensors'' lifetime and
    performance in WW are strongly impacted by these malfunctions. As briefly mentioned
    earlier, the need for correct installation, maintenance, and continuous calibration
    of these RT sensors is therefore essential for ensuring measurements of a good
    and reliable quality. The question of when to calibrate a sensor is of great importance,
    and, when laboratory measurements are used for calibration of RT sensors, an awareness
    of the uncertainties introduced is essential [172]. Data validation and fault
    detection methods should be considered and prioritized when working with RT measurements.
    For example, monitoring of measurement ranges, variance analysis, and well-known
    control chart techniques are commonly used tools for validating the quality of
    the signal [173]. Notwithstanding, it is still possible to notice a dearth in
    RT monitoring towards the contaminants of emerging concerns. The 2022 proposal
    forces the WWTP stakeholders to control the removal rate of twelve emerging pharmaceutical
    parameters. Nowadays, exclusively the non-targeted advanced laboratory analysis
    can determine their concentration [67]. Moreover, WW flows may contain microplastics,
    personal care products, pesticides, and drugs [174,175] which are not required
    to be monitored but can be harmful to the surrounding environment. Thus, WW flows
    are one of the hardest liquid solutions to deal with, especially due to the heavy
    load of hazardous micropollutants. In-line sensor-based processes are not recognized
    as reliably able to monitor trace elements at low concentrations (below a ppm).
    So, WW outflows could not be completely characterized in RT as soon as all the
    trace contaminants are. Further studies need to be designed to give solutions
    for their employment in real WWTPs. Furthermore, high-sensitivity sensors are
    required to reach advanced precision, moving closer to the μg L-1 thresholds and
    beyond. 6. Future prospectives of wastewater quality characterization As the requirements
    placed on WWTP discharges become stricter, evidenced by changes to the urban WW
    treatment directives (for instance, Council Directive 91/271/EEC required a 80%
    reduction in TP and minimum 70% reduction in TN [32]; these will change to 90%
    and 85% reductions respectively considering the recent proposal for a directive
    of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning urban wastewater treatment
    26/10/2022 [25]), some adjustments in the WWTP have to be considered. While these
    changes may involve infrastructural modifications, a more cost-effective first
    approach would develop the monitoring and control of the process. Various studies
    over the years have shown that significant improvements on nutrient removal and
    process efficiency can be made simply through the use of advanced process control
    [13,176], and as the available sensor and measurement technology for water quality
    characterization improves so do the options and opportunities for the implementation
    of control. Another important aspect of the tightening of regulations is the increase
    in monitoring requirements described in the directives that has been discussed
    in previous sections. Currently, in order to show compliance with regulatory limits,
    parameters must be monitored through reference measurement methods which are often
    time-consuming and expensive (Section 4). A question that should be pursued by
    the research community is: How can the RT measurement become reliable enough to
    be included in directives and regulations and carry some of the regulatory monitoring
    burden? This will require extreme improvements in trust of the technology, as
    well as methods for proving its trustworthiness. However, this is immensely important
    for the field of RT WW quality characterization – while not all treatment plants
    may be interested in the potential of improved monitoring capabilities with regards
    to control opportunities, all treatment plants must be concerned monitoring with
    regards to regulations. Advancing technology to enhance efficiency and reduce
    costs in this domain is of significant importance. While the focus of the discussion
    thus far has been on the treatment of WW, additional parameters must be characterized
    to support water reuse [177] due to increased water scarcity and deterioration
    of water quality caused by climate change, increasing unpredictable weather events
    and drought [178]. In line with this, the restrictions for reuse of water have
    been defined (Regulation (EU) 2020/741 [179] on minimum requirements for water
    reuse). These reuse restrictions detail quality parameters such as E. coli, BOD5,
    TSS, Turbidity and Legionella spp. which must be monitored with specifically defined
    frequencies. There are also requirements to perform risk assessments, possibly
    identifying additional or stricter limitations; including HMs, pesticides, disinfection
    by-products, pharmaceuticals, and micro-plastics. A special attention must be
    dedicated to antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), antibiotic resistant bacteria
    (ARBs) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are toxic, persistent,
    and bio-accumulative chemicals [180]. This introduces yet another driving force
    behind the improvement and development of RT water quality characterization methods,
    for possibly an even wider range of quality parameters than those required by
    urban WW treatment regulations. Aside from regulatory push factors, there are
    many technological factors that are currently impacting the research progress
    in these areas. Readily available computing power, the sudden improvements to
    AI and ML and their accessibility, as well as the quality of cheap and readily
    available IoT sensors, to name a few, are major contributors to the direction
    that research in this field will likely take over the coming years. Many of these
    technologies are not new, but the prevalence of their use and their general acceptance
    is expected to improve greatly. 6.1. Soft sensors and IoTs Soft sensors have emerged
    as one of the critical technologies for monitoring and controlling WW treatment
    processes in RT, thanks to advances in data analytics, digitalization, and increased
    availability of computational power. Soft sensors are developed by using data
    from multiple hardware sensors to create a mathematical model that outputs a target
    parameter estimation (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (235KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Soft sensor concept overview, adapted from
    [94]. The status and advances of soft sensors are extensively discussed in several
    comprehensive studies, such as Haimi et al. [181], that focus on advancing biological
    WW treatment through data-driven soft sensors, emphasizing their utility in RT
    monitoring and optimization. The review summarizes mathematical methods, processes
    where soft sensors are employed, if the soft sensors are practically implemented,
    and presents a list of estimated target parameters. Special attention is dedicated
    to process monitoring and fault detection. A more recent review by Ching et al.
    [94] extensively examines soft sensor development methods and their effectiveness
    in relation to hardware technology. The authors list input sensors used for soft
    sensor development, mathematical methods as well as target parameters and resulting
    model performances. Furthermore, artificial neural network (ANN) applications
    for soft-sensing and comparison of different architectures are reviewed by Wang
    et al. [182]. The study outlines challenges in soft-sensing model applications,
    including low data effectiveness (high complexity and external disturbances of
    WWTP) and the need for robust, efficient, and accurate models as well as the importance
    of reliability and uncertainty analyses. Based on current literature, the input
    sensors (i.e. predictors) utilized for development of soft sensors typically include
    the following parameters, ranging from influent to effluent: TSS [[183], [184],
    [185]], COD [[185], [186], [187]], TP [183,187], TN [183,186], ammonia [185,188],
    oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) [187,189], DO [187,190], flowrate [186,191],
    pH [184,185,192], temperature [184,185], BOD [183,184,187], nitrite and nitrate
    [185,188], filling time [193], reaction time [193], aeration rate [193,194], recycling
    rate [194], volume of WW [185], alkalinity [195,196], and turbidity and colour
    [188]. Models estimating target parameters (i.e. soft sensor readings) are then
    primarily developed for prediction of effluent properties as well as other parameters:
    BOD [[197], [198], [199]], COD [195,198,200], TSS [188,201], nitrogen [202,203]
    and phosphate [189,200,204] contents, turbidity [201,205], DO [206], E. Coli [188,207],
    as well as energy consumption [16] and a weather signal [208]. Among the examined
    soft sensors, several studies reported on-going developments while others are
    well-established full-scale industrial applications. Mathematical models used
    for soft sensor development include multivariate linear methods such as PCA, PLS,
    MLR and other ML and AI methods including neural networks (NN), kernel machines,
    decision tree-based methods and autoregressive and time series models. Traditional
    statistical and multivariate linear methods are however considered not sufficient
    for such applications therefore adaptive nonlinear models and ANN, especially
    feedforward NN with backpropagation, should be preferred in soft sensor development
    to achieve higher accuracies [181]. Furthermore, the deep learning (DL) methods
    extensively reviewed by Alvi et al. [209] demonstrate superior capabilities not
    only in soft sensor development but also fault detections, including long short-term
    memory (LSTM) - a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) [210]. Aside from NN
    based methods, decision tree-based and adjunct statistical methods have high potential
    to improve soft sensor performance [94]. Recent popularity was gained by transformer
    models that are based on multi-head attention mechanism requiring less training
    than RNN [211,212]. The increased availability of algorithms and computational
    power, combined with continuous hardware input sensor accuracy and durability
    improvements are key in expanding soft sensors in WW treatment sector. In parallel,
    IoT technology is driving the development towards fully connected WWTPs. This
    interconnected network of sensors and actuators will enable RT data collection
    and analysis, resulting in more responsive and adaptive WW treatment processes.
    As extensively reviewed by Thakur and Devi [21], IoT sensor networks may include
    electrochemical sensors [213], electrical and optical sensors (absorbance, fluorescence,
    colorimetric, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and chemiluminescence) and biosensors
    [214], as well as surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and SPR sensors
    and other devices. However, because of advancements in digitalization, traditional
    at-line methods such as titration, colorimetry, chemiluminescence, ion selective
    sensors (ISE), and voltammetry that are integrated into modern instruments also
    have a considerable potential for use in IoT networks. These methods can measure
    properties such as biological contamination (through portions of adenosine triphosphate
    (ATP)), toxicity, trace metals, as well as organics, inorganics, and nutrients
    [215]. Advanced data analytics and cloud computing will play a crucial role in
    managing big data from these sensors, facilitating RT decision-making and predictive
    analytics [216]. An important advance is the development of automated control
    systems that use IoT data to dynamically adapt WW treatment processes. This automation
    aims to optimize efficiency and reduce manual intervention, resulting in cost
    savings and lower error rates [217]. In addition, these technologies are expected
    to improve energy optimization and resource recovery in WWTPs and contribute to
    their transformation into water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) [218]. However,
    these advancements also bring challenges in terms of data security [219], scalability
    and maintenance that need to be addressed for widespread adoption. Further integration
    of soft sensors and IoT technologies into WW management will significantly revamp
    the WWTPs RT monitoring and control [94]. In essence, the integration of soft
    sensors and IoT represents a step towards more efficient, accurate and sustainable
    WW treatment that aligns with broader urban sustainability and environmental protection
    goals [217]. 6.2. Smartphone-based sensors Smartphone sensors are emerging as
    cost-effective, user-friendly, and quick RT analyzers. Various studies showcase
    different sensors linked with smartphone apps. An integrated electrochemical device
    measured pH, free chlorine, temperature, pharmaceuticals, and HMs [220]. Metal
    ions like mercury, lead, chromium, nickel, copper, and iron were analyzed using
    a paper-based microfluidic device (μPAD), transforming the smartphone into a triple-indicator
    sensor [221]. Another μPAD, utilizing a smartphone camera, monitored hardness
    (calcium and magnesium ions), total phenols, and pH [222]. Additionally, water
    quality parameters such as nitrites, phosphates, and chromium were tracked via
    smartphone camera and analyzed with a reference model [223]. The device also processed
    colorimetric data for mercury concentration [224,225]. Furthermore, a miniaturized
    smartphone fluorescence microscope detected mercury, serving as both a signal
    collector and image processor [226]. Recent literature, mostly within 2-3 years,
    indicates ongoing advancements in this field. Currently, the smartphone-based
    devices are not commercially available, and measurements are best performed on
    tap water or clear samples, as high solid concentrations hinder sensor performance
    [227]. 6.3. Aquaphotomics Aquaphotomics is an innovative field that utilizes mainly
    near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to analyze the interaction between water and
    light, revealing insights into water’s structure and function in various systems
    [228]. This discipline examines water’s absorbance patterns in the NIR region
    (traditionally in the area of first overtone of water i.e. 1300-1600 nm, but more
    recently also in other wavelength ranges) to study water content, hydrogen bonds,
    and hydration states in a range of applications [229], from WW treatment [230]
    and agriculture to pharmaceutical sciences [228]. Central to aquaphotomics is
    the “water mirror approach,” which detects changes in water molecular networks
    due to physical or chemical perturbations, reflected in altered NIR spectra. The
    technique introduces water absorbance spectral patterns (WASPs), which capture
    these changes and serves as holistic markers in diverse applications. Key to successful
    aquaphotomics studies is the precise experimental setup, including high-quality
    spectral signals and specific instrument requirements, to accurately analyze and
    interpret the complex water species in aqueous systems [231]. While aquaphotomics
    presents a revolutionary approach, the industrial implementation of the technology
    is anticipated to be a gradual process due to the complexities involved in this
    advanced scientific field. 7. Conclusions This review focuses on WW quality characterization
    and measurement technologies while including the main characteristics of WW, traditional
    laboratory-based assessments, an overview of RT process monitoring, and a future
    perspective on water quality control with emerging technologies. The following
    conclusions can be drawn: - WW quality characterization today is proven to be
    still ruled mainly by traditional laboratory-based measurements; - The employment
    of sensors is getting more attention, and it is demonstrated that a vast number
    of parameters needed for a WW evaluation could be monitored through RT acquisitions;
    - Advantages in the introduction of RT sensors throughout the treatment processes
    include faster, more frequent, and effortless ways of characterizing the WW, thus
    avoiding delays in time and sampling procedures; - Currently, non-target screening
    measurements are the preferred solution to evaluate persistent compounds and hazardous
    chemicals; - Breakthrough developments regarding modeling and optimization processes
    could be developed exclusively with the introduction of RT sensors within the
    WW treatment plant process control; - Soft sensors employed to predict values
    of several WW target parameters as well as IoT technologies are gradually becoming
    established practices, with several examples reported, emphasizing their usefulness
    for a RT monitoring; - Further advantages may derive from the implementation of
    new mathematical and statistical methods, such as AI and ML. Aquaphotomics methodology
    reveals its potential to extract important characteristics from NIR wastewater
    spectra; - Future needs for WW quality characterization will be driven by the
    implementation of new legislative frameworks and new technological developments
    in analytical chemistry and sensors, that are becoming more accessible and affordable;
    - Important roles will be also played by new scientific findings regarding pollutants
    and their potential effects on human health and the environment; - Future works
    should be dedicated to the development of robust, long-lasting, and precise RT
    technologies allowing the detection of low concentrated pollutants with minimum
    sample preparation requirements. Economic and feasibility assessments should be
    considered before designing and implementing RT sensors In situ. List of abbreviations

    1. Introduction Forests are indispensable in fighting the ongoing climate change.
    Trees are recognized as crucial carbon sinks due to their capacity to absorb CO2
    from the atmosphere and to allocate it for their growth, thereby decreasing the
    concentration of greenhouse gases (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
    2018). However, the increase in temperatures and frequent occurrence of extreme
    weather events like droughts and heatwaves are profoundly impacting the physiological
    functioning of trees (Adams et al., 2017) making stands and whole forests vulnerable
    to disturbances and mortality (McDowell, 2011). Enhancing our understanding of
    the water use and growth dynamics of forests in response to climate change is
    of crucial importance because it allows us to comprehend their adaptations to
    environmental factors, evaluate their resilience to stressors, as well as to plan
    effective strategies for their conservation and management. In the last decade,
    the advent of high-frequency monitoring techniques for eco-physiological parameters
    in trees has provided researchers with a more comprehensive understanding of forest
    responses to climatic stresses (e.g. Aguadé et al., 2015; Cocozza et al., 2015;
    Dukat et al., 2023; He et al., 2020). Several multifunctional devices based on
    new technology exists (Tognetti et al., 2022) providing valuable insights into
    different eco-physiological tree parameters and overall into forests health. Recently
    the Tree Talker® (hereafter TT+) commercial device (Valentini et al., 2019) has
    been used to quantify the ecosystem services provided by different tree species
    in Moskow (Matasov et al., 2020), as well as to follow the transpiration dynamics
    of a burned stand of Pinus pinaster in Italy in order to understand better the
    physiological mechanisms behind the reduced growth of the studied trees (Niccoli
    et al., 2023a). The TT+ device can record sap flow, tree growth, trunk temperature,
    air temperature and humidity and incoming radiation under the canopy (Vaglio Laurin
    et al., 2024). Further, it is integrated with other ancillary devices: the TT-Reference,
    useful for measuring the abovementioned meteorological variables outside of the
    forest, and the TT-Soil, meant to monitor the soil water content and temperature
    (Valentini et al., 2019). Monitoring the tree physiological parameters with a
    high frequency offers the opportunity to individuate stressful climatic events
    and their impact on transpiration, wood formation phenology and growth, especially
    when coupled with other monitoring techniques, such as xylogenesis, wood anatomy,
    dendrochronogy and isotopic analysis of tree rings (Niccoli et al., 2023b). The
    TT+ system collects multi-parameter data every hour and uploads them to a dedicated
    web server for remote access, providing real-time monitoring of physiological
    and environmental parameters. The raw data generated are digital numbers and characters,
    separated by semicolons, and catenated all together in strings that need to be
    properly handled in order to convert them into physical quantities for being analysed
    (Tomelleri et al., 2022). To provide a robust code infrastructure to process the
    TT+ data, in 2022 a dedicated R package, called ttprocessing was released (Kabala
    et al., 2022). The publication of new equations for sap-flux calculation, the
    availability of calibration equations for the TT-soil device, the experience gained
    from practical usage of the TT+ , the feedback received from the TT+ user community,
    and the production by the company of a new, enhanced version of the device, raised
    the necessity to update the package. In this technical note we present the updates
    that have been made to the ttprocessing package. 2. Summary of the Tree Talker
    system functioning The TT+ device consists multiple sensors integrated into a
    single device, powered by high-performance lithium batteries that provide up to
    4 months of autonomy, enabling continuous and uninterrupted monitoring. A hygrometer
    accurately measures the temperature and humidity of the surrounding air. An infrared
    dendrometer allows to track the growth patterns of trees over time. Additionally,
    a spectrometer, located on the top of the device''s case, measures the amount
    of incoming radiation under the canopy across 12 different spectral bands. All
    the data are collected at an hourly resolution. An example of experimental plot
    equipped with TT+ devices is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image
    (347KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Example of an experimental
    plot monitored with the Tree Talker® system. Finally, the TT+ device is equipped
    with two probes (reference and heating respectively) to be inserted into the xylem
    of a tree, positioned 10 cm apart along the vertical axis of the trunk. The reference
    probe, placed at the bottom, measures the temperature of the trunk, that can be
    coupled to wood formation data in xylogenesis studies, and the water content of
    the trunk. The heating probe is used to measure the sap flux trough the TTD technique
    (Do et al., 2011). In particular, the heating probe works applying a cycle of
    10 min heating and 50 min cooling (Asgharinia et al., 2022). 3. Summary of the
    functionalities already present in the previous version of the ttprocessing package
    The ttprocessing package provides functionalities for: • Downloading the raw TT+ data
    from the server. • Converting properly the digital numbers to physical quantities.
    • Sap flux estimation from temperature data of the sap flux probes. • Cleaning
    the data, by removing unreasonable values and days with incomplete records. •
    Plotting, for visual inspection of the data. • Technical management of the monitoring
    system: battery voltage and sensor functioning assessment. Data can be read with
    the dedicated function readTTData, which accepts as parameter the link to the
    server hosting the TT+ data, or the path to the local CSV file storing the raw
    data. Then, the functions for extracting data of eco-physiological relevance from
    the different raw strings are: clean4DData, clean59Data, string45Handling and
    string49Handling. Each of them needs to be applied to the raw data to extract
    the information corresponding to that kind of “data string” (Fig. 2). Those functions
    accept additional parameters, that allow the user to remove invalid values; the
    studied species can be selected in order to use the specific calibration equation
    for the Stem Water Content sensor (Asgharinia et al., 2022). A further recommended
    pre-processing step is the removal of days when some of the sap flux records are
    missing (Chan and Bowling, 2017), that can be performed in the ttprocessing package
    with the h24Clean function. The outlier removal functions available are described
    in the dedicated section (Outlier Removal). The package contains several plotting
    functions, for a first visual inspection of the data, and some functions dedicated
    to the technical management of the devices (more details in the dedicated section
    Technical Management of the monitoring system). The whole workflow is summarised
    in Fig. 2, and the procedures can be performed also through a GUI (Graphical User
    Interface) that is provided with the package (see section Availability). Download

    Updates and new features in the ttprocessing package Main new features: 1) Support
    for the 45 strings, typical of the old generation devices (TT+ 2.0) and for the
    59 strings typical of the new generation devices (TT+ 3.4). 2) Implementation
    of the TT-soil calibration equations. 3) Implementation of the equations of Asgharinia
    et al. (2022) for sap flux. 4) Function for removing the outliers according to
    the Tukey boxplot rule. 5) Facilities for detection of functioning issues of the
    system. 4.1. Old and new hardware support The old generation devices (2.0 ones),
    and the new generation ones, are based on slightly different hardware and firmware,
    so the raw data produced by them must be handled in a proper way. The functions
    (respectively string45Handling and clean59Data) implement the calibration equations
    reported in the TT+ 2.0 manual and TT+ 3.4 manual; and return a dataframe with
    the same output variables as clean4DData. This step is necessary to ensure the
    inter-compatibility of the data produced by the different devices, and the interoperability
    with the other functions implemented in the package. 4.2. TT-soil data support
    The TT-soil is a device designed for monitoring the soil water content, and when
    coupled with the Tree Talkers that measure the sap flux can provide insights in
    the plant responses to soil moisture. The TT-Soil manual contains several calibration
    equations, for soils with different properties, and for the different kind of
    soil moisture sensors that can be mounted on the device. The procedure to handle
    the TT-Soil data is implemented in the ttSoilDataProcessing function. The arguments
    to be provided to the function are: • A data frame with the TT-Soil raw data to
    be processed. • A string identifying the equation to be used. Equations are labelled
    from “S1” to “S7”, their coefficients and details on each of them can be found
    in the TT-soil manual and are reported also in the function documentation. • Thresholds
    of maximum and minimum water content and soil temperature, to remove invalid values.
    4.3. Implementation of sap flux calculation Currently the Tree Talker community
    decided to adopt, for the calculation of sap flux, as unit of measurement, grams
    per square meter of sapwood per second. This change was then applied to the ttprocessing
    code (Eq. 1). In 2022 a new calibration equation (Eq. 2), for estimating sap flux
    from temperature data of the TTD system implemented in the Tree Talkers has been
    published in (Asgharinia et al., 2022). It has been implemented in the ttprocessing
    package, and integrated in the clean4DData function, that now returns sap flux
    values calculated using both the equations, each in its dedicated column: respectively
    “do_sap_flow” and “asgharinia_sap_flow”, in order to enable the users to choose
    the one they need for their study cases. Moreover, instead of computing the ΔT
    between the heating and reference probe, in order to reduce the possible effects
    of daily temperature gradients in the sapwood, the ΔT is now computed as the difference
    between the temperature of the heating probe after the heating phase and T’. T’
    that is the result of the linear interpolation between the heating probe temperature
    before the start of the heating cycle, and the temperature after the cooling phase
    (Isarangkool Na Ayutthaya et al., 2011a), following Eq. 4. The delta T calculated
    with this new equation serves now to compute the K index (Eq. 3). The maximum
    ΔT is computed for each calendar day, as in the previous version of the package.
    Equation 1 (sap flux according to Do et al., 2011), expressed with the new unit
    of measurement): Where: SFD is sap-flux density; K is the K index, computed according
    to equation 3. Equation 2 (sap flux according to Asgharinia et al., 2022): Where
    SFD is sap-flux density; K is the index computed in equation 3. Equation 3 (K
    index equation): Where ΔTi is the delta T for hour i computed according to the
    equation 4; ΔTmax is the maximum delta T recorded during that day. Equation 4
    (Delta T following Isarangkool Na Ayutthaya et al., 2011b): Where Theat1t is the
    temperature of the heating probe after the heating cycle; Theat0t is the temperature
    of the heating probe before the heating cycle; Theat0t+1 is the temperature of
    the heating probe after the cooling cycle. 4.4. Outlier removal As data might
    contain outliers, specific functions for detecting them in the TT+ data are provided
    in the ttprocessing package. Specifically, the two functions designed for dealing
    with that task are: flagOutliers and removeOutliers. The first one, takes as input:
    • A data frame of TT+ elaborated data, like the ones returned by: string45Handling,
    string49Handling, clean4DData, clean59Data. • A character vector containing the
    names of the columns to be processed. • The timeperiod parameter, with possible
    values: “week”, “month” “all”. The function groups the data by device id, and
    for each of the variables to be processed creates a new column, named as the original
    variable followed by “_o”, containing the outlier flag, that is set to TRUE if
    the corresponding value is an outlier, and to FALSE if it’s not. The flag is assigned
    based on the Tukey’s boxplot rule (Shevlyakov et al., 2013), the quartiles are
    computed on the data of each individual device, and of each timeperiod. If timeperiod
    is set to “all”, all the data are considered to compute the quartiles. The function
    removeOutliers allows the user to process the flagged dataframe, by replacing
    all the values flagged as outliers with NA. The procedure is split into two steps
    to eventually allow the user to inspect manually the flagged values instead of
    removing them directly. 4.5. Technical management of the monitoring system The
    devices proper functionality is extremely important to ensure the data acquisition,
    thus it is necessary to provide an efficient and easy technical management of
    the monitoring system (Zorzi et al., 2021). A new function in the ttprocessing
    package, that is called deviceFunctioningAssesment allows the user to check the
    completeness of the records of each individual device, by specifying its ID and
    the number of valid observations. The function returns a raster plot, with time
    on the x axis, and the names of the probes on the y axis, days when the probes
    recorded enough valid data are marked in green, while otherwise they are marked
    in red. An example of the output is provided in Fig. 3 A. The function can also
    be run in the Graphical User Interface (Fig. 3 A), which enables the user to check,
    for example, the batteries level, thus allowing the user to maintain the system
    working properly, and to make some basic plots of the data (Fig. 3B). Download

    ttprocessing R package is available on GitHub at the following url: https://github.com/jpkabala96/ttprocessing.
    It can be installed in R by executing the following code: library(devtools) install_github(“https://github.com/jpkabala96/ttprocessing”)
    The package can be loaded with library(ttprocessing) The package is provided also
    with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that enables the user to exploit the functionalities
    of the package by a point and click interface, uploading the raw TT+ data and
    saving the processed data as CSV files, for analysing them further in other software.
    This aims at (i) enabling users without coding skills in R to benefit from the
    ttprocessing package and (ii) speeding up a first inspection of the data through
    a user-friendly system. The new version of the GUI supporting data of the new
    and old versions of the TT+ devices, can be launched with the command: launchNewGUI()
    The already existing launchGUI() function, supporting only the 4D and 49 data
    strings, was kept to avoid compatibility issues for code written with the old
    version of the package. Four example datasets are provided along with the package:
    • raw4d_ex_data composed of data of the “4D” and “49” string type, recorded by
    3 TT+ devices, recorded between the 12th and 20th March 2021, between the 11th
    and 20th June 2021, and between the 11th and 20th October 2021, with the corresponding
    TT-cloud logs. • raw45_ex_data composed of the data of 2 TT+ 2.0 devices, with
    examples of “45” and “49” data strings recorded between the 6th August 2023 and
    the 12th August 2023, and the corresponding TT-Cloud logs. • raw59_ex_data containing
    data of 2 TT+ of the 3.2 version, containing the “59” and “49” type data strings,
    recorded between the 1st July 2023 and the 10th July 2023, with the corresponding
    TT-cloud logs. • ttsoil_example dataset contains data of a TT-soil, recorded during
    the month of June 2022. The old version of the ttprocessing package is still available
    as source code (release 0.1.0): https://github.com/jpkabala96/ttprocessing at

    learningEnvironmental monitoring 1. Introduction Water serves as a crucial natural
    resource, sustaining life on our planet. Ensuring the quality of water is imperative
    for the well-being of humans, the preservation of the environment, and fostering
    economic growth. However, the global community faces formidable obstacles in effectively
    monitoring and managing water resources. The availability of safe and clean drinking
    water is not only a basic human right but also a pivotal factor in promoting public
    health and sustainable development. While progress has been made in enhancing
    access to improved water sources, the prevalence of water scarcity remains worrisome,
    affecting a significant proportion of the global population, estimated at around
    four billion people, for at least one month annually [1]. The factors influencing
    water quality (WQ) are intricate and diverse, encompassing natural phenomena such
    as erosion and sedimentation, as well as human activities like agriculture, industry,
    and urbanization. Furthermore, challenges are compounded by the exacerbating impacts
    regarding climate change and population increase. Water pollution has severe consequences,
    as it leads to the outbreak of waterborne illnesses like cholera, dysentery, and
    typhoid fever, posing significant threats to human health. Moreover, the adverse
    effects of poor WQ extend beyond individual well-being, impacting and impeding
    economic development. The United Nations'' Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG
    6), titled \"Clean Water and Sanitation,\" is a crucial initiative designed to
    ensure access to safe and clean drinking water and proper sanitation facilities
    for all people worldwide. SDG 6 encompasses targets related to enhancing WQ, expanding
    access to clean water sources, improving sanitation services, and addressing issues
    related to water scarcity and pollution. This goal plays a vital role in promoting
    public health, reducing waterborne diseases, and fostering overall sustainable
    development [2]. Water is susceptible to the impacts of climate change. The research
    conducted by Duran-Encalada et al. [3] reveals that climate change can significantly
    affect both the quantity and quality of available water, in addition to other
    water features. Furthermore, the exacerbation of this issue is evident due to
    the escalating demand of the increasing population, which has led to a decline
    and degradation of receiving surface water [4], as well as a reduction in the
    chemical WQ of rivers [5]. As a consequence, a significant number of individuals,
    particularly in developing nations, suffer fatal consequences due to water-related
    issues as illustrated in Fig. 1 [6]. Download : Download high-res image (367KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Estimated annual number of deaths
    related to unsafe water per 100,000 people (2019) [6]. Water quality monitoring
    (WQM) is a crucial task that requires an interdisciplinary approach and involves
    the understanding of factors that impact WQ, the development of strategies to
    enhance and manage water resources, and the implementation of policies and regulations
    to regulate human activities that can potentially affect WQ. Moreover, engaging
    local communities and stakeholders, as well as promoting public awareness and
    education about the importance of WQ, is also vital for successful WQM. The continuous
    development of IoT technology has revolutionized the WQM, making it more streamlined
    and affordable. The utilization of IoT devices has gained significant traction
    in recent times and is anticipated to persist as a growing trend. The global count
    of connected devices is estimated to reach 30.9 billion by 2025, signifying a
    noteworthy surge in the adoption of IoT technology to monitor WQ [7]. IoT devices
    growth has been facilitated by low-cost, high-performance hardware, and wireless
    communication technologies, which have made it easier and more affordable to deploy
    these devices. The increasing adoption of IoT technology is expected to have a
    significant impact on WQM, as more devices are deployed to monitor WQ parameters
    in real-time, leading to better protection and management of our water resources.
    IoT wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi, RFID, LpWAN, and cellular networks,
    have revolutionized WQM, allowing for the remote and real-time monitoring of WQ
    parameters. This eliminates the need for physical sampling and analysis, resulting
    in improved accuracy and reliability of WQM. Additionally, remote monitoring enables
    proactive and timely responses to any anomalies or changes in WQ, which ultimately
    leads to better protection of our water resources. IoT technology offers advantages
    over traditional WQM methods by enabling continuous remote monitoring for real-time
    anomaly detection, providing cost-effective and comprehensive coverage, and collecting
    data for analysis and informing management strategies. The use of IoT devices
    for WQM alone does not guarantee improved WQ. To improve WQM, the data collected
    through these devices must be analyzed and interpreted. Fortunately, advancements
    in technology have made ML a powerful tool for WQM. There are four main types
    of ML techniques used in WQM, namely supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement,
    and semi-supervised learning. Supervised learning is employed to classify WQ data
    based on specific parameters and detect anomalies or changes. Unsupervised learning
    identifies patterns or clusters within data to detect unusual WQ events or identify
    new patterns. Reinforcement learning optimizes treatment processes by providing
    feedback to control systems. Semi-supervised learning uses a combination of labeled
    and unlabeled data to perform classification or clustering. These ML techniques
    provide valuable insights into WQ trends and patterns and help in the development
    of effective WQM strategies. The integration of IoT devices with ML algorithms
    holds great promise for enhancing WQM by facilitating real-time data collection
    and analysis. This combination empowers the early detection and timely response
    to WQ issues, effectively safeguarding water resources and public health. Furthermore,
    IoT devices and ML algorithms can uncover the root causes of WQ problems through
    pattern recognition, shedding light on potential sources of contamination and
    the impact of human activities on WQ. This valuable information can serve as a
    foundation for policymakers and stakeholders to devise effective strategies for
    the preservation of water resources and the promotion of sustainable water management
    practices. Our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the use of Internet
    of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) to WQM systems, demonstrating its flexibility
    in many domains. Our goal is to demonstrate the various uses of this integration,
    in many domains such as wastewater treatment and household WQM. by integrating
    IoT sensors and the power of ML algorithms for real-time monitoring, this paper
    highlights the ability to quickly identify pollutants and support well-informed
    decisions on purification systems, so guaranteeing the safety of drinking water.
    Moreover, our paper highlights its applicability in industrial settings, aiding
    in meeting regulatory standards for WQM, and in agricultural areas to improve
    water management practices. Through these varied applications, our goal is to
    underscore the transformative potential of the IoT and ML synergy in advancing
    WQM across different sectors (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (416KB)

    Fig. 3. Mapping the review elements. 2. Related works Many previous reviews and
    research papers have been dedicated to the exploration of WQM, encompassing a
    wide range of topics, methodologies, and technologies. These endeavors seek to
    deepen our understanding of WQ parameters and develop effective monitoring systems.
    Jiang et al. [8] discussed quantitative design approaches for surface WQM networks,
    with an emphasis on cost-effective design. It identifies gaps and challenges in
    sampling frequency, WQ indicators, and pollution management. Behmel et al. [9]
    proposed a holistic strategy to support WQM programs. The paper addresses challenges
    in planning and optimization, emphasizing reliable WQ assessment, stakeholder
    involvement, and the integration of resources into an intelligent decision support
    system. Karydis and Kitsiou [10] focused on marine WQM principles, design, and
    data analysis procedures. The review highlights the use of statistics, simulation
    models, and multiple criteria analysis for compliance, trend detection, and policy
    assessment. The design of ground WQM networks is discussed by Loaiciga et al.
    [11], considering hydrogeologic and statistical approaches. Factors such as spatial
    scale, sampling objectives, and data requirements are taken into account. In the
    context of IoT-based aquaculture, Prapti et al. [12] focused on WQM in fishponds.
    The review provides insights into research approaches, common parameters, and
    types of solutions provided. Banna et al. [13] evaluated emerging technologies
    for online WQM, with a specific focus on the need for low-cost sensors. The paper
    discusses the potential of data processing algorithms and envisions a future with
    widespread deployment of affordable WQ sensors. The potential of IoT technology
    for water management systems is explored by Singh and Ahmed [14], who conducts
    a comprehensive survey of existing IoT-based systems. The study discusses system
    architecture, and measurement parameters, and proposes future designs that integrate
    IoT and ML for predictive analytics. The potential of remote sensing, particularly
    deep learning (DL), in accurately estimating optically active parameters in WQM
    is emphasized by Sagan et al. [15]. The review emphasizes the need for improving
    remote sensing capabilities to enhance water resources management. Zhu et al.
    [16] explored the application of ML algorithms in evaluating WQ across different
    environments, including surface water, groundwater, drinking water, sewage, and
    seawater. They discussed challenges related to data acquisition, algorithm applicability,
    and interdisciplinary expertise. The review suggests future research directions
    to address these challenges. The review conducted by Dogo et al. [17] compared
    traditional ML and DL methods for detecting anomalies in WQ data. They favor DL
    approaches and propose a hybrid framework for further investigation in WQ anomaly
    detection. Ighalo et al. [18] performed a systematic literature analysis on artificial
    intelligence models in surface WQM. The paper identifies commonly used models
    such as the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Artificial Neural
    Networks (ANN). The paper highlights knowledge gaps in the field and proposes
    future research directions. Ewuzie et al. [19] provided an overview of DL techniques
    in WQ modeling and prediction. The chapter covers topics like data acquisition,
    preprocessing, and model selection. It also discusses prospects in water research.
    Wagle et al. [20] examined the application of ML and remote sensing data for estimating
    WQ parameters. The integration of regression algorithms and ANN is explored, and
    the potential of real-time AI-enabled WQM systems is discussed. Previous studies
    on WQM have focused on particular topics, like IoT technologies, ML approaches,
    and sensor techniques. Our study, however, adopts a different strategy. It focuses
    on combining ML techniques with wireless IoT technology to monitor WQ. It analyzes
    several IoT wireless technologies, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, RFID, LpWAN,
    and cellular networks. The investigation seeks to bridge knowledge gaps and investigate
    the benefits and prospective applications of ML algorithms with IoT wireless connectivity
    options. To streamline monitoring systems and foster the development of more advanced
    and effective water monitoring technology, the study underlines the significance
    of ML methods and IoT wireless technologies. 3. Method Our systematic review used
    the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)
    procedure [21]. PRISMA offers an organized and transparent approach to thorough
    literature reviews, hence improving rigor and repeatability. It entails developing
    research topics, choosing studies, evaluating quality, and synthesizing results.
    Using PRISMA, we collected current publications on IoT, ML, and WQ, with an emphasis
    on environmental concerns in urban areas. For this purpose, a comprehensive set
    of keywords and key phrases were meticulously chosen, aligning with the research
    objectives and scope (WQ, Urban environment, Environmental monitoring, ML, IoT,
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, Predictive modeling, etc.) Specialized databases are
    searched using these keywords. This produced 141 relevant articles for our comprehensive
    analysis (Fig. 4). ● database collection Download : Download high-res image (709KB)

    process. The process of conducting the review was initiated by undertaking a collection
    of academic articles that focused on the intersection of ML, IoT, and WQ. To ensure
    a comprehensive scope, renowned databases including but not limited to Google
    Scholar, IEEE, Springer, and Elsevier were meticulously leveraged. These platforms
    facilitated access to a wide-ranging assortment of journal articles, thereby enriching
    the diversity of the gathered literature. In line to keep the review both pertinent
    and up-to-date, particular emphasis was placed on sourcing recent publications
    that encapsulated the latest advancements and insights in this evolving field.
    ● initial data collection From the original compilation of approximately 504 articles,
    the subsequent phase encompassed a preliminary screening procedure designed to
    discern articles harmonizing with the designated research focus. This preliminary
    screening primarily scrutinized titles and abstracts, thereby singling out articles

    pivotal studies and their potential to shape forthcoming research and urban planning
    strategies. 4. Results 4.1. Water quality field 71 percent of the surface of the
    Earth is covered by water, with freshwater making up only 2.5 percent of that
    area [22]. Water is a vital component of human life that is utilized in important
    spheres of society like industry, agriculture, and households. Water quality and
    quantity are being threatened by misuse as a result of the increasing population,
    economic and industrial growth. The two forms of water resources are groundwater
    and surface water. 60 percent of the world''s freshwater requirements are met
    by groundwater [23],30 percent of the freshwater on Earth is found in groundwater,
    while the remaining 69 percent is found in rivers, lakes, glaciers, ice sheets,
    icebergs, and ice sheets [24]. The identification of groundwater pollution is
    a big concern, because it is more challenging than the detection of surface water
    contamination. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a state of emergency
    over water availability, emphasizing that half of the world''s population will
    live in water-stressed areas and recognizing the human right to a safe, adequate,
    and uninterrupted supply of water [25]. WHO also declared that nearly two billion
    people worldwide consume polluted water [26], their health is negatively impacted
    by contaminated water, bad sanitation, and unhygienic living conditions. Safe
    water might save 860,000 cases of malnutrition, 500,000 cases of malaria, and
    1.4 million cases of diarrhea in children [27]. ● pollutants and standards of
    water quality In addition to scarcity, water contamination is a serious problem,
    With the help of the thresholds of contaminants, WQ can be characterized, There
    are around 101 key factors that are utilized to control WQ, according to the Environmental
    Protection Agency [22], WHO has defined and set the ranges and limits of drinking
    water parameters [28], these are the key parameters of WQ (Fig. 5). Download :
    Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Key
    parameters for water quality assessment. Salinity, Heavy metals (HMs) Chlorine
    (Cl−), Total Phosphorus (TP), Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca2+), Sodium (Na), Potassium(K),
    Fluoride(F−) Nitrate (NO3−) and other substances also have an impact on WQ. These
    characteristics become detrimental to water and a host of health problems when
    they surpass the standards ([23,24,29,30]). A wide range of commercially accessible
    WQ sensors are designed to measure various water characteristics. For instance,
    pH sensors (DPD1R1-WDMP), which are essential for determining the acidity or alkalinity
    of water by measuring the concentration of hydrogen ions on a scale from 0 to
    14. Oxygen dissolved in water is measured by DO sensors (YCS-2000 DO sensor).
    Turbidity sensors (LXV423.99.10100) employ light-scattering techniques to measure
    the cloudiness induced by suspended solids in order to calculate the amount of
    suspended solids. Additional sensors include conductivity sensors (D3725E2T-WDMP)
    and ORP sensors (DRD1R5-WDMP), which measure the EC of water and provide information
    on the concentrations of ions or dissolved salts. Temperature sensors (DPD1R1-WDMP
    and Pt1000 temperature sensor) track the temperature of the water, which is a
    critical factor influencing many aspects of WQ. Every sensor has distinct sensitivities
    and measuring ranges. ([31,32]). To efficiently describe WQ, Horton proposes the
    water quality index (WQI) [33] (Fig. 2). WQI is a numerical index that provides
    a summary measure of the overall WQ of a particular water body. Different methods
    and approaches are employed to calculate the WQI, depending on the assessment
    objective, data accessibility, and local regulations. Among the commonly used
    methods are the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) WQI, National
    Sanitation Foundation (NSF) WQI and Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI). These methods
    take into account various parameters, assign weights to them, and integrate the
    scores to derive the overall WQ [34]. The WQI ranges from 0 to 100, where a higher
    WQI value indicates better WQ (Fig. 6). The index can be used to compare the WQ
    of different water bodies, monitor WQ over time and identify areas where WQ needs
    improvement. The WQI is a useful tool for water resource management and decision-making,
    as it provides a simple and straightforward way to communicate complex WQ data
    to stakeholders the parameters influencing WQI the most are pH, BOD, COD, TDS,
    DO, and ammoniacal nitrogen [35]. ● limitation of traditional methods in WQM Download

    Ranges of WQI Traditional WQM methods are associated with several limitations
    that impede their effectiveness. These constraints stem from factors such as the
    methodology used for sample collection, the time required for laboratory analysis,
    and the restricted geographic coverage. It is crucial to acknowledge and understand
    these limitations in order to expand and enhance our WQM techniques effectively.
    One of these limitations is the limited sample frequency. Traditional approaches
    frequently rely on manual sampling, which can only produce a certain number of
    data points over time. An insufficient understanding of changes in WQ may result
    from this occasional sampling, which may not adequately capture the dynamic nature
    of WQ measures. For conventional water-quality monitoring programs, the significant
    temporal variability in pollutant concentrations presents a difficulty. Inaccurate
    maximum and average concentration estimates may result from infrequent grab sampling
    techniques missing instances with high pollutant concentrations. This makes it
    challenging to precisely capture the spatial diversity of WQ indicators [36].
    Lack of Real-time and reliable Data is another issue, traditional approaches use
    batch analyses of water samples, which can take hours or even days to complete
    and are only available for a limited amount of time. This implies that transient
    changes in WQ, such as pollution spikes or tidal oscillations, may be overlooked
    or misreported. In addition, the time it takes to get results limits the real-time
    data that is needed for prompt decision-making and efficient pollution management.
    This limits our ability to swiftly detect and respond to abrupt changes in WQ.
    Traditional methods often focus on a small set of predetermined WQ criteria. This
    sparse parameter coverage can overlook newly emerging contaminants or other crucial
    markers of WQ. The amount of factors that present sensors can measure is constrained,
    and they frequently fall short of users ‘expectations [37]. Given the variety
    of hazards, groundwater monitoring, for instance, should give preference to site-specific
    parameters to identify WQ issues [38]. Due to the necessity of physically collecting
    samples from specific monitoring locations, traditional approaches sometimes suffer
    from geographical restrictions. This method falls short of offering a thorough
    knowledge of how WQ varies over bigger water bodies or watershed areas. This limitation
    may cause localized sources of contamination to go undetected or may result in
    inaccurate spatial patterns and gradients of WQ measurements being recorded. Investigating
    spatial WQ trends and fluctuations is difficult, especially in large water bodies.
    Entire water bodies may be difficult or impossible to monitor, forecast, or manage,
    especially when topographic restrictions apply. Due to errors in both field sampling
    and laboratory analysis, the precision and accuracy of the in-situ data acquired
    may be in doubt [39]. The traditional approaches are labor-intensive, expensive,
    and time-consuming; they frequently involve fieldwork, sample collection, transportation,
    trained personnel, laboratory analysis, and sampling equipment. Real-time monitoring
    and rapid action are hampered by these labor- and time-intensive processes, which
    cause delayed results. Traditional techniques of WQM might incur large costs for
    equipment, labor, and laboratories. Particularly in locations with limited resources,
    this high cost may limit the frequency and scope of monitoring. Traditional methods
    for measuring WQ indicators involve costly and time-consuming laboratory analysis,
    which makes it challenging to identify contaminants quickly and understand their
    effects [40]. Invasive sampling is another problem with traditional WQM methods.
    These techniques frequently involve physically taking water samples at certain
    locations, which could harm the environment. The reliability and caliber of the
    data acquired are impacted by the collection, transportation, and storage of samples
    since they increase the number of potential sources of contamination and impede
    natural processes. Early warning systems that use traditional event detection
    techniques to identify contamination events frequently experience large error
    rates. These techniques mostly depend on the variance between observed and predicted
    sensor responses, which can result in inaccurate detection [41]. 4.2. Wireless
    communication protocols in WQM Traditional WQM methods have been time-consuming,
    costly, and often result in inadequate data collection. However, with the advent
    of IoT wireless technologies, it has become possible to monitor WQ in real time,
    providing accurate and reliable data on the health of water resources. The introduction
    of IoT technology has transformed the way WQ data is gathered. IoT enables continuous
    monitoring and transmission of various WQ parameters by deploying a network of
    interconnected sensors. These sensors, strategically deployed throughout water
    bodies, pipelines, treatment plants, and distribution networks, can measure a
    broad spectrum of parameters, encompassing temperature, turbidity, pH levels,
    and the presence of contaminants such as chemicals or heavy metals. These IoT-enabled
    sensors collect data in real-time, allowing for the early detection of abnormalities
    or departures from established standards. Traditional centralized systems and
    manual procedures may be improved with the use of wireless sensor networks, resulting
    in decentralized smart WQM systems that are adaptable enough to accommodate the
    diverse and dynamic water distribution networks of cities [42]. Moreover, IoT
    technology makes it easier to combine and send the data that these sensors gather
    to a cloud-based platform or centralized system over the internet. The complete
    gathering of data from several dispersed sensors is made possible by the devices''
    continuous connection with each other. Using web-based dashboards or mobile applications,
    stakeholders—such as environmental agencies, water treatment authorities, and
    researchers—can access this data remotely and in real-time. aiding in efficient
    water management and decision-making processes [43]. The IoT capacity to store
    WQ data opens up the possibility of applying advanced analytics techniques to
    uncover patterns, trends, correlations, and potential risks. This information
    empowers predictive maintenance strategies, enabling the early detection of anomalies
    and optimizing resource allocation for efficient water management. By integrating
    IoT-collected data into decision-making systems, water treatment processes, distribution,
    and resource allocation can be further optimized, leading to improved operational
    efficiency and higher WQ outcomes. IoT wireless technologies, including short-range
    technologies such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee, RFID, and Bluetooth, and long-range technologies
    like LpWAN and Cellular networks, have transformed the way we monitor WQ. These
    technologies enable seamless communication between sensors and devices, facilitating
    the collection and transmission of data to monitoring systems. This real-time
    data collection allows for more efficient and effective WQM, resulting in improved
    resource management and preservation. RFID, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Wi-Fi have
    all played crucial roles in the development of wireless communication technologies.
    RFID''s origins can be traced back to its use in identifying aircraft during World
    War II [44], and later it found its way into commercial applications such as access
    control systems, supply chain management, inventory tracking, and contactless
    payment systems. Bluetooth, which emerged in the 1990s [45], revolutionized the
    way devices connect by eliminating the need for cables and enabling wireless communication
    between mobile phones, computers, and peripherals. Zigbee, introduced in the early
    2000s [46], focused on low-power communication for home automation and sensor
    networks, providing the ability to create mesh networks for seamless device integration.
    Wi-Fi, introduced in 1997 [47], brought wireless internet connectivity to homes,
    businesses, and public spaces, offering data exchange capabilities within a specific
    range. Over the years, Wi-Fi has seen remarkable advancements in terms of speed,
    range, and security protocols, fueling the proliferation of smart devices and
    applications. Today, Wi-Fi has become an integral part of our daily lives, allowing
    us to stay connected and empowering the seamless operation of a wide range of
    smart devices. Cellular networks have a rich history that goes back to the late
    20th century. It all began with the first-generation (1G) analog networks in the
    1980s. Then, in the late 1980s, second-generation (2G) networks were introduced,
    bringing digital voice transmission and SMS capabilities. As we entered the new
    millennium, third-generation (3G) networks came into play around 2000, making
    mobile internet, video calling, and multimedia messaging widely accessible. Later,
    in the late 2000s, fourth-generation (4G) networks emerged, offering faster speeds
    and fueling the growth of mobile applications. More recently, fifth-generation
    (5G) networks have taken the spotlight, promising blazing-fast speeds and enabling
    transformative technologies like IoT [48]. Alongside the evolution of cellular
    networks, LpWAN technologies have emerged to cater to specific connectivity requirements.
    LpWAN have a relatively recent history starting from the early 2010s. At that
    time, there was a growing demand for connectivity solutions that could provide
    long-range and low-power connections for IoT applications. Companies like Sigfox
    and LoRaWAN came up with their own technologies using unlicensed spectrum bands
    to extend coverage. In 2016, the standardization efforts by 3GPP led to the development
    of the NB-IoT standard, which enabled LpWAN capabilities on licensed spectrum
    bands [49]. Since then, LpWAN technologies have continued to evolve and find their
    way into various industries. Ongoing advancements and deployments indicate that
    LpWAN will have an important role in connecting a wide range of IoT devices in
    the future. Fig. 8 represents a chronological overview of the advancements in
    wireless IoT technologies. This timeline offers a visual journey through the evolution
    of IoT communication protocols. The selection of an appropriate IoT wireless technology
    for WQM entails considering multiple factors such as the specific application
    requirements, environmental conditions, and budgetary limitations. Due to the
    diverse range of wireless technologies available for this purpose, selecting the
    most suitable technology for a given application can be a challenging task.To
    facilitate the technology selection process, Fig. 7 provides a comprehensive representation
    of the bandwidth and range characteristics associated with various wireless technologies,
    such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee, RFID, Bluetooth, LpWAN, and Cellular networks, typically
    employed in WQM. By evaluating these features, it becomes easier to identify the
    most appropriate technology for a specific application. Download : Download high-res

    Short-range wireless connectivity applications Short-range wireless technologies,
    such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee, RFID, and Bluetooth, are designed to provide wireless communication
    over a limited distance, typically within a few hundred meters. These technologies
    are ideal for applications where the devices are in close proximity to each other,
    such as in a smart home or building automation environment. One of the significant
    advantages of short-range technologies is their low power consumption, which extends
    the battery life of connected devices. These technologies are also relatively
    low cost, making them accessible for a wide range of applications. In addition,
    they offer the ability to form mesh networks, allowing devices to relay information
    to each other for increased reliability. ● Bluetooth technology for WQM IoT Bluetooth
    technology is a highly popular option for many IoT applications, primarily due
    to its low power consumption and ease of use. This technology enables devices
    to exchange data over short distances without requiring complex wiring or internet
    connectivity. Moreover, it is also an ideal solution for WQM and management due
    to its cost-effectiveness. By integrating Bluetooth technology into sensors, WQ
    parameters like pH, DO, and Temp can be measured, and the data can be transmitted
    to a central database or monitoring system for real-time analysis. Several studies
    have utilized Bluetooth technology for data transmission and analysis. For instance,
    in a study conducted by Ijaradar and Chatterjee [50], Bluetooth-enabled sensors
    were employed to measure WQ parameters such as pH, TUR, and Temp. The collected
    data was then transmitted to a cloud-based database. Similarly, Jha [51] evaluated
    groundwater using Bluetooth-enabled sensors and implemented a system to send data
    to mobile devices via GSM and Bluetooth in case the parameters exceeded standard
    limits. This approach facilitated timely detection of potential issues and enabled
    effective WQM. In the realm of mobile applications, Bluetooth communication has
    played a significant role in WQ assessment. The study conducted by Srivastava
    et al. [52] developed an Android app that utilized Bluetooth connectivity to display
    real-time WQ characteristics and upload it to the cloud. Mabrouki et al. [53]
    developed an app with an incorporated predictive model to estimate WQI, This approach
    enabled users to conveniently access real-time WQ information, Bluetooth was employed
    to transmit water parameters, such as Temp, TUR, EC, and DO, to smart objects
    like a smartwatch. Additionally, Jindal et al. [54] proposed a smartphone-based
    Bluetooth framework that employed multi-parametric sensors to determine the physical
    characteristics of sewage water, including pH, and EC. The collected data proved
    to be valuable for WQM and treatment processes. Additionally, Jo et al. [55] proposed
    an innovative solution by developing an USV controlled via Bluetooth through an
    Android app. This USV allowed users to view sensor and GPS data, including TUR,
    and pH near the water surface. Such advancements in Bluetooth-based technologies
    contribute to improved WQM and management, offering efficient and convenient solutions
    for data collection and analysis. ● RFID-based systems for enhanced WQM RFID technology
    is an emerging field that uses radio waves for the transfer of data between a
    reader and a tag, enabling the identification and tracking of an object. In the
    realm of WQM, RFID technology is being utilized to enhance the effectiveness and
    accuracy of monitoring systems. Instead of using conventional monitoring methods
    that necessitate manual sampling and laboratory testing, RFID-based systems utilize
    sensors affixed to RFID tags to collect real-time data, reducing the requirement
    for manual intervention. Several research papers have proposed innovative wireless
    monitoring systems for waterways that utilize portable sensor nodes integrated
    with RFID technology. These systems enable the measurement and transmission of
    various WQ parameters, including pH, Temp, DO, and TUR. The collected data is
    then processed and analyzed at a centralized location, facilitating effective
    monitoring and analysis of WQ [56]. In one study, researchers described the use
    of low-cost analog sensors, 1-wire networking, and passive tags to ensure compatibility
    with IEEE 1451.4 standards [57]. Another research introduced a novel wireless
    passive sensing platform that combined inkjet printing, microfluidics, and RFID
    technology to monitor WQ parameters [58]. These advancements demonstrate the potential
    of RFID technology in WQM applications. Furthermore, authors have explored the
    integration of RFID technology with other sensing techniques to enhance the reliability
    and efficiency of WQ measurements. For instance, one study proposed the use of
    an analog pH sensor with IP-based communication and RFID technology, offering
    improved pH measurement capabilities [59]. Additionally, Cook et al. [60] presented
    a real-world implementation of RFID-based sensors for monitoring various environmental
    parameters. This study highlighted the potential of RFID-based sensors in monitoring
    applications and provided valuable insights into their implementation and deployment
    in real-world scenarios. These research findings contribute to the development
    of advanced monitoring systems that leverage RFID technology, enabling more efficient
    and accurate assessment of WQ in different contexts. ● Wi-Fi networks for real-time
    data collection In some studies, existing Wi-Fi networks were utilized for real-time
    data collection. For instance, Chen and Han [61] made use of the “Bristol Is Open”
    infrastructure to collect real-time WQ data using a multiparameter sonde. The
    Wi-Fi transceiver module has also played a crucial role in transferring WQ data
    to cloud-based servers for further processing and analysis. Parameswari and Moses
    [62] utilized the Wi-Fi transceiver module in conjunction with water sensors to
    transmit data to a cloud node server via an Arduino microcontroller. This cloud-based
    approach facilitated centralized data storage, analysis, and access. In certain
    cases, Wi-Fi connectivity has been used to enable remote monitoring and control
    of WQ assessment systems. For example, Melo et al. [63] developed a robotic airboat
    equipped with WQ sensors, which transmitted data through a Wi-Fi connection to
    a base station. This setup allowed users to monitor the vehicle and plan routes
    based on the WQ information. Moreover, the combination of Wi-Fi and other wireless
    communication technologies has been explored for WQM applications. Jindal et al.
    [54] utilized multi-parametric sensors to monitor sewage WQ and connected them
    to a smartphone or laptop using both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi technologies, enabling
    versatile data transmission options. ● Zigbee mesh networks for scalable WQM Zigbee
    is a wireless communication technology that has gained popularity in recent years
    for its low-power, low-cost, and reliable capabilities. It uses mesh network architecture
    to create large and scalable networks, making it an ideal technology for a range
    of applications, including WQM. Traditional WQM systems typically involve manual
    sampling and laboratory analysis, which may be time-consuming and prone to errors.
    However, Zigbee-based WQM systems use sensors connected to a Zigbee network to
    collect real-time data on parameters such as pH, Temp, and DO levels, reducing
    the need for manual intervention and providing real-time data for early problem
    detection. Zigbee technology offers significant benefits in WQM systems. In a
    study by Jha (2020) [51], microcontrollers and sensors for various parameters
    are connected through Zigbee/Wi-Fi technology to monitor WQ in tanks and wireless
    sensor zones. This enables the creation of large-scale monitoring networks that
    provide valuable insights into WQ over time. The study also includes alerts to
    promptly address unsafe drinking water conditions and prevent degradation. Another
    study by Usha Kumari et al. [64] utilizes Zigbee technology to monitor WQ in a
    specific area, employing sensors for pH, TUR, TDS, and Temp. The integration of
    solar power modules and GSM allows for autonomous control, facilitating continuous
    monitoring without manual intervention. Real-time monitoring enables early problem
    detection, enabling timely intervention to prevent further deterioration. Additionally,
    Al-Dahoud et al. [65] implements a hierarchical sensor network to lower costs
    and increase sensor node deployment density. Each node is equipped with low-power
    panels, two solar collectors, and utilizes low Zigbee radio power for data transmission.
    The microcontroller processes the sensor data before sending selected information
    to the gateway via an Xbee module. This approach significantly reduces the cost
    of sensor node deployment, making it more accessible for diverse applications.
    4.2.2. Wide area connectivity applications ● Cellular Networks: Enabling Real-time
    WQM with Reliability and Cost-effectiveness In the context of WQM, cellular networks
    provide a reliable and cost-effective option for transmitting real-time data remotely
    to servers, enabling efficient WQM. The use of cellular networks, including 2G,
    3G, 4G, and 5G, has been explored in various studies, depending on the specific
    requirements of the application. For instance, Ionel et al. [66] proposed an experimental
    virtual instrumentation system based on General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) for
    the automatic measurement and assessment of nitrates (NO3-), copper (Cu++), and
    chloride (Cl-) levels in water. The system enabled users to access data using
    a mobile device, and automated SMS and email notifications were sent when monitored
    metrics exceeded predetermined levels. Similarly, Adamo et al. [67] developed
    an in situ and continuous monitoring system for seawater parameters, such as Temp,
    EC, TUR, and chlorophyll levels, using GPRS and GPS modules, along with smart
    sensors. The wireless communication facilitated real-time probe tracking and data
    interpolation. Saravanan et al. [68] proposed a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
    (SCADA) system that utilized 4G/5G technologies to transfer data and GSM connection
    for continuous monitoring of WQ parameters across multiple stations. The SCADA
    system recorded real-time and accurate flow, Temp, color, and TUR readings from
    the sensors utilizing GSM connectivity. The automated system has been implemented
    within the Tirunelveli Corporation (a metropolitan area in the state of Tamil
    Nadu, India) to collect sensor data automatically, including information from
    pressure, pH, level, and energy sensors. This technological method demonstrates
    versatility in various global settings, providing effective WQM in diverse geographical
    areas and environments. Esakki et al. [69] developed an unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV)-based monitoring system that used a 4G-LTE network for data transmission
    to the ground station through Firebase cloud services. The system facilitated
    real-time measurements of WQ parameters, such as pH, DO, TUR, and EC, and enabled
    remote and continuous monitoring of water bodies. ● LpWAN: energy-efficient and
    extended-range technologies for WQM Numerous investigations have examined the
    application of LpWAN in WQM systems. For instance, Huan et al. [70] described
    an NB-IoT-based system that continuously transmits real-time data on environmental
    factors, including Temp, pH, DO, and other parameters, in aquaculture ponds. Similarly,
    Elijah et al. [35] uses NB-IoT and LoRa to monitor various WQ parameters, like
    pH, AN, SS, and DO of Malaysian rivers, via UAV surveillance. Moreover, the use
    of LoRa technology is also prevalent in WQM systems, as demonstrated in many studies.
    Madeo et al. [71] employed LoRa technology for data transmission in an USV to
    collect WQ data, such as Temp, pH, ORP, DO, and salinity in rivers, lakes, and
    oceans. Meanwhile, Simitha and Subodh Raj [72] utilized LoRaWAN to remotely monitor
    WQ parameters, including pH, TUR, Temp, and DO. The system''s energy efficiency
    is improved by the low energy consumption of LoRaWAN, allowing for an extended
    battery life for sensor nodes. Additionally, Sigfox is chosen as the communication
    protocol for WQM by Di Gennaro et al. [73], and Boccadoro et al. [74]. Sigfox''s
    IoT platform provides secure communication and enables extensive transmission
    of WQ measurements. For example, Boccadoro et al. [74] used Sigfox communication
    technology to remotely relay measurements and forecast WQ metrics, such as pH,
    EC, oxygen, and Temp, via the WaterS IoT WQ prediction system. Silva [75] developped
    a web-based system for WQM, which collects various WQ information using a WiMax
    network and a local Zigbee network. DO, EC, Temp, pH, and ORP sensors are among
    the other monitored parameters. The data from sensor nodes is transmitted via
    WiMax to the web server using the Zigbee gateway. These studies demonstrate that
    while there is a lot of research being done on smart WQM, relatively few initiatives
    get full and ongoing government backing. Many natural disasters over the past
    10 years, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and droughts, have compelled governments
    and water utilities to create proactive measures in order to ensure water security.
    Diverse global approaches have been employed to protect the quantity and caliber
    of water required for urban areas. Few governments—like Singapore''s Water Supply
    Network Department (PUB) and Australia''s South East Queensland (SEQ) Water Grid—have
    been successful in developing innovative water management systems. The South East
    Queensland (SEQ) Water Grid and the Water Supply Network Department (PUB) in Singapore
    have implemented comprehensive water strategies to improve WQM. The SEQ Water
    Grid uses climate-resilient water sources like desalination and purified recycled
    water, as well as rainwater, to ensure water security. Meanwhile, the PUB collects
    rain and storm water, treats it, and integrates it into the water network to maintain
    WQ. Both systems have integrated information and communication technology (ICT)
    into their water management systems to improve WQ. The SEQ Water Grid uses standardized
    sensor systems for WQ, quantity, and pressure, while the PUB plans to spend several
    billion USD on projects to establish and extend their smart water management system,
    integrating ICT-based solutions for WQM and management. These initiatives highlight
    the importance of integrating ICT in water management systems for sustainable
    water resources [76]. Table 1 provides an overview of IoT wireless technologies
    employed in WQM, highlighting the parameters being monitored. Fig. 9 presents
    a graphical representation of the percentage breakdown of monitored contaminants,

    Percentage breakdown of utilization in WQM 4.3. Machine learning applications
    on WQM IoT technologies ensure WQ collection from various sources, including sensors,
    satellites, and citizen science initiatives. ML with its different techniques
    (Fig. 11) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting WQ parameters,
    enabling the identification of patterns, relationships, and anomalies that traditional
    statistical methods may not readily discern. By leveraging these insights, WQ
    managers can make more informed decisions about managing and protecting water
    resources, preventing pollution, and maintaining ecosystem health. In this section,
    we focus on supervised and unsupervised learning techniques inWQM. Supervised
    Learning uses labeled data sets to develop models that predict specific WQ parameters,
    while unsupervised learning identifies patterns and relationships in unlabeled
    data sets to inform decision-making. Understanding the applications of both techniques
    provides insight into how ML can improve water resource management practices.

    Fig. 11. Different types of machine learning. 4.3.1. Supervised learning ML is
    a natural outgrowth of the intersection of Computer Science and Statistics [129].
    Supervised learning is a branch of Machine Learning. It uses labeled datasets
    to train algorithms capable of categorizing input and predicting outcomes. Its
    origins may be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s, when scientists developed linear
    regression models to investigate and predict correlations between variables. Supervised
    learning trains a model using previously labeled data or input/output pairs to
    predict future results. To reliably predict outputs from novel inputs, a function
    that may be reasonably approximated must be built. Two sorts of challenges that
    may occur with supervised learning are regression and classification [130]. Researchers
    began developing more complex supervised learning algorithms in the 1970s and
    1980s, as computers became more widely available. For example, decision trees
    (DT) were developed in the 1970s as a tool to represent complex decision-making
    processes [131]. ANN have significantly advanced supervised learning by allowing
    the modeling of intricate nonlinear interactions between variables. Interest in
    supervised learning has been rekindled by the availability of big datasets and
    better computer capabilities. A variety of techniques, including support vector
    machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and DL algorithms, have been created and
    used by researchers in a variety of domains, including remote sensing [132], computer
    vision [133], image processing ([[134], [135]]) natural language processing [136],
    health [137], andWQM. Bagging, k-nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Logistic Regression
    (LR), Naive Bayes, and Bayesian Networks are more examples of supervised learning
    algorithms. Supervised Learning models have been extensively studied for their
    application in WQM and prediction. Among these models, ANFIS algorithm has emerged
    as a particularly effective tool. Hmoud Al-Adhaileh and Waselallah Al- saade [27]
    focused on developing ANFIS to evaluate WQI. Additionally, they employed k-NN
    and feed-forward neural network (FFNN) techniques for WQ classification. Their
    research showcased the versatility of ANFIS in addressing different aspects of
    WQ analysis. The FFNN method had the greatest classification accuracy. Another
    study conducted by Pham et al. [138] recognized the strength of ANFIS and utilized
    it alongside ANN and the group data processing approach (GMDH) to forecast WQI.
    The results clearly indicated that ANFIS outperformed other techniques employed
    in their comparison. This finding highlights the superior predictive capability
    of ANFIS in WQ forecasting tasks. Similarly, Abba et al. [139] proposed a comprehensive
    approach for WQI forecasting along the Yamuna River in India. Their methodology
    incorporated various models, including Backpropagation neural networks (BPNN),
    ANFIS, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).
    By doing so, they aimed to harness the power of ANFIS in combination with other
    models to achieve accurate WQI predictions. In a study conducted at Bansong in
    South Korea, a hybrid approach combining ANFIS with k-means clustering was proposed.
    The findings reveal that the sub-models generated by the k-means-ANFIS hybrid
    outperformed both standalone ANFIS models and seasonal models constructed using
    ANN. By harnessing the power of ANFIS, this approach proved effective in accurately
    forecasting settling water TUR and determining the most suitable coagulant dosage
    [140]. In WQ research, there have been notable contributions focusing on the application
    of ANN. Imani et al. [141] aimed to enhance WQ resiliency, while Srivastava et
    al. [52] focused on forecasting WQI. Furthermore, Deng et al. [142] developed
    a model to predict algal growth by employing two ML techniques: ANN and SVM. For
    this model, water temperature, flow travel time, and DO were selected as initial
    inputs, enabling the estimation of total nitrogen (TN) and TP concentrations at
    any given point in the river. Interestingly [143], found that SVM models exhibited
    higher prediction accuracy compared to equivalent ANN models. Moreover, Guo et
    al. [144] investigated water-quality monitoring in small urban water bodies and
    evaluated three ML models: RF, SVR, and ANN. RF algorithm has proven to be a valuable
    tool in forecasting various parameters for groundwater monitoring. In studies
    comparing different ML models, including Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), RF, and
    SVR. RF consistently exhibited superior performance. Researchers have successfully
    employed RF and Adaboost models to forecast parameters such as potential salinity,
    sodium adsorption ratio, and exchangeable sodium percentage, utilizing inputs
    such as EC, Temp, and pH [145].Similarly, researchers have explored the combination
    of RF with other algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy. For instance, Lu and
    Ma [146] developed Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN)-RF
    and CEEMDAN-XGBoost models by incorporating RF or eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
    algorithms with CEEMDAN. These models successfully predicted water temperature,
    DO, pH value, specific conductance, TUR, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter,
    showcasing the effectiveness of RF in capturing complex relationships within WQ
    data. Valerio et al. [26] utilized RF in conjunction with Gradient Boosted Regression
    Trees (GBRT) to monitor real-time WQ parameters and assess the impact of anthropogenic
    stressors on freshwater flora and fauna. This approach allowed them to gain insights
    into the intricate dynamics between WQ and ecological systems, with RF contributing
    to accurate predictions and a comprehensive understanding of the environmental
    factors at play. Regarding specific parameters, Heddam and Kisi [147] estimated
    DO concentration using Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) models, outperforming Multi-Layer
    Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) and MLR. Chen et al. [148] used a convolutional
    Neural Network (CNN) architecture and DT algorithm to determine the COD values
    of water samples. Ewusi et al. [149] predicted TDS content in groundwater, surface
    water, and drinking water using hybrid predictive models combining Gaussian Process
    Regression (GPR), BPNN, and Principal Component Regression (PCR). Barzegar et
    al. [150] predicted EC using ELM and wavelet-extreme learning machine hybrid (WA-ELM)
    models, with the hybrid models exhibiting higher performance. Shah et al. [24]
    estimated both TDS and EC using Gene Expression Programming (GEP), ANN, MLR, and
    Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNLR) methods, with GEP showing the best performance.
    For the estimation of Escherichia coli (E.coli) levels, Wang et al. [151] employed
    linear regression models (MLR, PLS, and SPLS) and nonlinear models (RF and Bayesian
    Network) as input features. Li et al. [152] assessed E. coli levels and other
    indicators of effluent WQ, while Deng [142] used ANN and SVM to predict algal
    growth. 4.3.2. Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning is a form of self-organization
    in which learning takes place without the involvement of a teacher. As researchers
    investigate its potential and importance in expanding our understanding of learning
    processes, it has emerged as a prevailing field in neural networks [153]. It was
    first proposed in the 1950s, but it only became widely accepted after the development
    of clustering techniques like k-means and hierarchical clustering (HC), as well
    as the application of neural networks [154]. The shift from supervised to unsupervised
    learning methods marks a significant change in how data exploration is approached,
    particularly in WQM. Supervised learning relies on labeled datasets to make precise
    predictions, while unsupervised learning delves into uncharted territories without
    explicit labels. This transition unlocks the potential of vast amounts of unlabeled
    data to unveil hidden patterns, anomalies, and latent structures. Unlike the explicit
    predictions of supervised learning, unsupervised methods identify hidden patterns,
    complex relationships, and emerging groupings within datasets. When combined supervised
    techniques allow for targeted forecasts, while unsupervised techniques reveal
    underlying trends, providing a more thorough grasp of the dynamics of WQ and a
    wider range of insights. The emergence of DL and generative models has resulted
    in a greater emphasis on unsupervised learning use inWQM [155], which employs
    a variety of methods to detect patterns, connections, and structures in data that
    lacks labeled information. Applications include dimension reduction, cluster analysis,
    and anomaly detection. These techniques offer important new understandings of
    the origins of pollution, seasonal patterns, spatial and temporal variability
    [156], and the identification of newly emerging contaminants. These approaches
    can reveal previously unknown correlations between WQ parameters, allowing for
    a more in-depth knowledge of WQ dynamics and underlying mechanisms. Anomalies
    or deviations from the standard can also be detected, allowing for early warning
    systems and preventive maintenance. Unsupervised learning algorithms may also
    segment and categorize WQ data, decrease the dimensionality of high-dimensional
    data, identify latent variables and hidden elements affecting WQ trends [157].
    Unsupervised learning techniques'' potential to improve WQ assessment, monitoring,
    and management will grow as they evolve and integrate with IoT-driven WQM systems,
    paving the way for a more comprehensive and proactive approach to protecting water
    resources. PCA played a pivotal role in many studies. Krishnaraj and Deka [156]
    utilized unsupervised ML techniques, including cluster analysis (CA) and PCA,
    to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of river WQ in the Ganga River Basin.
    Notably, PCA was employed to establish correlations among variables such as EC,
    pH, TDS, T, Ca, Cl, HCO3, Mg, NO2+NO3, SiO2, and DO. Additionally, the researchers
    used PCA in conjunction with the K-means clustering method to group the monitoring
    stations into distinct clusters based on the dry and wet seasons. Likewise, Cao
    et al. [158] leveraged PCA to identify the main variables influencing fluctuations
    in DO. By applying PCA, they extracted the essential components associated with
    DO variations. Subsequently, DO time series data was organized, and predictions
    were made using both K-means clustering and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural
    network. Haghnazar et al. [159] investigated the potential sources of heavy metals
    in groundwater and their relationships with hydro-chemical parameters. In their
    study conducted in the Urmia basin, known for hosting the largest lake in the
    Middle East, PCA was employed in combination with Pearson correlation analysis.
    This allowed for a comprehensive exploration of the associations between hydro-chemical
    parameters and the sources of heavy metals. PCA was a key component in the study
    conducted by Al-Sulttani et al. [160], where they integrated solo models such
    as Quantile Regression Forest (QRF), RF, SVM, and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
    with different feature extraction methodologies. The performance evaluation of
    these models revealed that PCA-QRF model proposed in their study exhibited significantly
    better performance compared to both the standalone models and the Genetic Algorithm
    (GA)--integrated models, specifically about BOD. This underscores the crucial
    role played by PCA in improving the effectiveness and overall performance of the
    integrated model. PCA proved to be an invaluable tool in these studies, facilitating
    the identification of crucial variables, establishing correlations, grouping data,
    and extracting essential components for further analysis. Its application enabled
    dimensionality reduction and provided valuable insights into the relationships
    and patterns within the datasets, enhancing the understanding of spatiotemporal
    variations and sources of WQ parameters and heavy metals. Numerous studies have
    utilized k-means to explore and analyze various datasets. For instance, Visalakshi
    and Radha [161] employed the k-means algorithm to divide a dataset into clusters,
    enabling the identification of outliers within each cluster through outlier detection
    techniques. This approach enhanced the understanding of the drinking water dataset
    and facilitated the identification of abnormal instances. In another study by
    Mohammadrezapour et al. [162], clustering techniques, including k-means, were
    applied to determine homogeneous zones based on groundwater quality (GWQ). By
    analyzing hydrochemical parameters from wells, the researchers identified distinct
    clusters using both k-means and Fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithms. This clustering
    analysis helped in delineating different zones characterized by GWQ patterns.
    Moreover, Kim and Parnichkun [140] proposed a hybrid approach combining k-means
    with ANFIS. They applied this approach to forecast settling water TUR and optimize
    coagulant dosage at a Water Treatment Plant. The k-means-ANFIS hybrid outperformed
    standalone ANFIS models and seasonal models constructed using ANN, indicating
    the effectiveness of incorporating k-means clustering into the prediction framework.
    By leveraging the power of k-means clustering, these studies have demonstrated
    its usefulness in various domains, including outlier detection, zoning analysis,
    and prediction modeling. The ability of k-means to partition data into clusters
    based on similarities has provided valuable insights, enabling researchers to
    uncover hidden patterns and structures in the datasets they investigated. Groundwater
    plays a central role in many studies, which focuses on its pollution source identification
    and apportionment. Meng et al. [163] conducted an investigation to determine potential
    pollution sources and analyze their spatial distribution in groundwater between
    2006 and 2016. They employed the Absolute Principal-Component-Score Multiple-Linear
    Regression (APCS-MLR) and PCA/Factor Analysis (FA) methodologies. The results
    highlighted that heavy metals (iron and manganese), nitrogen compounds (ammonia
    nitrogen, nitrite, and nitrate), and organic pollution (COD) were the primary
    contributors to groundwater pollution. Zhang et al. [164] focused on groundwater
    pollution source identification and apportionment. They utilized the Probabilistic
    Matrix Factorization (PMF) and PCA-Adaptive Principal Component Analysis (APCA)-MLR
    receptor models for their analysis. This integrated approach, incorporating PCA,
    aimed to accurately identify and allocate pollution sources in groundwater, providing
    valuable insights for effective environmental management in the region. Table
    2 provides a comprehensive overview of the ML techniques utilized in the review.
    Fig. 12 visually represents the percentage distribution of predicted pollutants
    in the review, giving us a clear understanding of how prevalent and significant
    each contaminant is. Additionally, Fig. 13 shows the frequency of ML methods used,
    giving us an idea of the popularity and effectiveness of different algorithms
    in analyzing WQ data. These figures contribute to a better understanding of the
    research findings, providing both visual and quantitative information about the
    ML techniques and their impact on WQ assessment. Table 2. Machine Learning techniques

    methods used in WQM 5. Discussions 5.1. Findings and challenges In the quest to
    efficient WQM, the use of IoT and ML technologies has become increasingly popular
    for WQM. In this survey article, we delved into the different networks commonly
    used in WQM, as well as the most frequently monitored parameters. In terms of
    parameters, our survey article found that pH, Temp, TUR, EC, DO, humidity, and
    TDS are the most frequently monitored parameters for WQ in the context of IoT-based
    systems. These parameters are important for assessing the health of aquatic ecosystems,
    detecting contamination events, and supporting regulatory compliance. Monitoring
    these parameters can enable real-time detection of WQ changes, making it possible
    to respond quickly to potential contamination events and improveWQM. The frequency
    of WQ parameter monitoring is influenced by practical considerations and cost,
    as well as the specific concerns related to the WQ at the monitored site and the
    objectives of the monitoring program. Fortunately, the measurement of these parameters
    is straightforward, thanks to the accessibility and affordability of sensors.
    An effective strategy in WQM programs involves tracking variations in pH and Temp,
    which can serve as early indicators of potential WQ issues. However, the inherent
    unpredictability of factors like temperature and pH can make it challenging to
    detect changes caused by pollution. Therefore, it is crucial to account for this
    natural variability when analyzing WQ data and identifying long-term trends. In
    contrast, some parameters may be less frequently monitored due to factors such
    as the cost and availability of sensors or the less immediate impact on WQ. For
    example, the monitoring of metals and metalloids can be expensive, and sensors
    for these parameters may not be as widely available as those for other parameters.
    Similarly, monitoring for nitrate and phosphate may be more important in agricultural
    areas where runoff can be a concern, but may be less relevant in other contexts.
    Emerging contaminants, such as microplastics, pharmaceuticals, and personal care
    products, are a growing concern in WQM. These contaminants are often present at
    low concentrations, and their effects on human health and the environment are
    not well understood. This makes it challenging to assess the risk they pose and
    identify appropriate monitoring strategies. IoT-based WQM systems have numerous
    advantages over traditional methods such as Real-time WQM. Because of the improved
    data gathering and analysis made possible by this real-time monitoring, the outcomes
    are more precise. Additionally, because of their high scalability and affordability,
    these systems are ideally suited for low-income communities and developing nations.
    In such areas, where WQM is crucial but may be financially challenging, IoT-based
    systems provide a viable solution. Nevertheless, current monitoring practices
    have their limitations. These practices only occur in specific locations and monitor
    limited parameters, which may not provide a comprehensive understanding of WQ
    and potential contaminants. Additionally, the frequency of monitoring could miss
    transient changes that have a big effect on the environment and human health.
    The high expense of monitoring can also be a barrier, especially in low-income
    areas and developing nations where it may be difficult to construct monitoring
    systems. Low-quality sensors in WQM can lead to incomplete or inaccurate data,
    resulting in incorrect assessments of WQ. In addition to being less reliable and
    requiring more frequent calibration or replacement, low-quality sensors can lead
    to false alarms or missed detections, hindering the development of effective management
    strategies to mitigate water pollution and ensure the safety of water resources.
    One of the major challenges in IoT-based WQM is selecting the appropriate sampling
    frequency and location. This is because the ideal frequency and location vary
    based on the water body being monitored, the location, and the pollutants present.
    Additionally, the sensitivity of analytical methods used in WQM is a limitation,
    with some contaminants being present at very low concentrations that standard
    methods may not detect. This requires more advanced and expensive equipment. The
    lack of standardization across regions or jurisdictions further complicates data
    comparison and the development of a comprehensive national or global picture of
    WQ. Our research shows that LPWAN and cellular networks have become widely utilized
    in water monitoring applications. These networks are widely available, and the
    necessary infrastructure is already in place in many locations, making them a
    convenient and cost-effective option for deploying IoT devices and sensors. However,
    both LPWAN and cellular networks encounter challenges related to coverage gaps,
    which can hinder their effectiveness in ensuring ubiquitous connectivity. LPWAN
    technologies like LoRaWAN and Sigfox offer long-range communication with low power
    consumption, but they face coverage gaps due to limited infrastructure deployment
    and difficulties in penetrating dense urban areas or remote regions. Cellular
    networks, encompassing various generations like 2G, 3G, and 4G LTE, have notably
    enhanced connectivity by offering higher data rates and broader coverage. However,
    despite these advancements, coverage gaps endure in specific geographical areas,
    notably in rural regions or underground environments(Zhang et al., 2021) [196].
    The reliance of WQM systems on LPWAN and cellular networks for consistent data
    transmission renders them highly susceptible to severe disruptions caused by these
    network coverage gaps. These breaches cause data loss or disappearance from sensors
    situated in these places, which obscures critical information regarding WQ indicators
    and possible pollution occurrences and leaves monitoring gaps. This leads to a
    lack of environmental oversight, which affects the system''s capacity to fully
    monitor circumstances. Furthermore, data transmission delays brought on by sporadic
    coverage lessen the system''s ability to react quickly to critical events like
    abrupt spikes in contamination. The reliability of the system is further compromised
    by coverage gaps that cause communication disruptions between sensors and the
    central monitoring platform. These disruptions may result in issues with sensor
    management, design and coverage problems [197]. The advent of 5G technology brings
    substantial advancements in wireless communications, with higher data rates, lower
    latency, and improved spectral efficiency, making it capable of addressing coverage
    gaps in LPWAN and cellular networks. This survey article has found that LoRa is
    the most commonly used LpWAN technology for WQM. LoRaWAN is a wireless communication
    protocol that has gained popularity in the IoT industry because of its ability
    to transmit data over long distances with low power consumption. One of the main
    reasons why LoRaWAN is preferred over other LpWAN technologies, such as Sigfox
    and NB-IoT, is its longer range, which makes it well-suited for WQM applications
    that require long-range communication. LoRa''s lower power consumption is also
    an advantage for WQM applications where sensors may need to operate for long periods
    on battery power. LoRaWAN is an open standard technology with a large community
    of developers and users who are actively working on developing new solutions and
    improving the technology. Finally, LoRaWAN is relatively cost-effective compared
    to other LpWAN technologies, as it does not require expensive infrastructure or
    licenses. This makes LoRaWAN an attractive option for implementing WQM solutions.
    When it comes to WQM, LoRaWAN is commonly used as a LpWAN technology. However,
    there are instances where other LpWAN technologies like NB-IoT and Sigfox might
    be more suitable. NB-IoT has the advantage of operating within existing cellular
    networks, making it easier to deploy in urban areas where there is already cellular
    coverage. This can be beneficial for WQM in densely populated areas with a higher
    concentration of potential contamination sources. On the other hand, Sigfox is
    optimized for transmitting small amounts of data over long distances while consuming
    minimal power. This makes it well-suited for WQM in remote locations where there
    is no cellular or internet connectivity available, such as rural or isolated areas.
    Ultimately, the choice of LpWAN technology depends on the specific requirements
    of the application, including the desired range, data rate, power consumption,
    and the availability of infrastructure. Wi-Fi technology is preferred for WQM
    because of its practicality, affordability, real-time monitoring capabilities,
    and data management features. There are restrictions on its use, nevertheless,
    that must be taken into account. Wi-Fi signals have a limited range, making them
    less appropriate for monitoring in rural regions or vast bodies of water that
    are not connected to a Wi-Fi network. The accuracy of data gathered by Wi-Fi-equipped
    sensors can potentially be impacted by interference from other electrical devices.
    Wi-Fi sensors also need a power source, which might be difficult to provide in
    rural locations without access to energy. security vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks
    could jeopardize the accuracy of data gathered by Wi-Fi-equipped sensors. The
    findings of the state-of-the-art paper suggest that RFID, Bluetooth, and Zigbee
    technologies are less commonly used in WQM compared to LpWAN and cellular networks.
    Nonetheless, Zigbee, RFID, and Bluetooth are preferred in low-power, short-range,
    and low-cost communication situations where a large number of small devices need
    to communicate with each other in a confined area. Zigbee can create a mesh network
    of sensors, which can transmit data to a nearby gateway, a cost-effective and
    power-efficient alternative to cellular networks that consume more power and require
    dedicated network infrastructure. RFID and Bluetooth are beneficial for localized
    data collection scenarios in WQM. But even with these advances, problems remain,
    particularly with regard to signal interference. Within residential environments,
    problems with transmission attenuation and interference from reflecting surfaces
    arise for communication protocols like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee. Variations
    in the power transmission ranges of wireless devices within residences might lead
    to possible issues with signal interference. Maintaining dependable connection
    across several wireless devices requires effective interference management [198].
    When it comes to sensor deployment, careful thinking and analysis are required
    to address the interference risk. It is crucial to comprehend the intricate details
    of signal overlap and investigate methods to reduce interference-induced false
    alarms. Over half (51%) of industry professionals believe that Industrial Control
    Systems (ICS) do not have enough protection, according to a 2020 analysis based
    on data from the USA. Furthermore, 55% of respondents are concerned about these
    systems'' susceptibility to cyberattacks [199]. The water and wastewater sector
    ranks as the third vulnerable sector susceptible to cyberattacks [200]. Which
    constitutes a significant concern, especially considering the integration of SCADA
    (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems in monitoring and controlling
    essential infrastructure like water distribution networks. SCADA systems, which
    are a type of Industrial Control System (ICS), oversee large geographic areas
    and are pivotal in managing vital utilities such as gas pipelines, electric power
    transmission, and water distribution systems. the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems,
    can endanger public health and the environment. Hackers can exploit these vulnerabilities
    to manipulate water treatment processes, increase chlorine concentration beyond
    safe levels, disrupt transportation tanker tracking systems, and cause environmental
    disasters. To mitigate these risks, industry stakeholders and government authorities
    should implement robust cybersecurity measures, foster collaboration among stakeholders,
    and strengthen the security posture and resilience of critical infrastructure
    systems [201]. Water purification and distribution systems need a multi-layered
    security approach to protect against cyber threats. This includes regular vulnerability
    assessments, robust security measures across physical, cyber, and network domains,
    and safeguarding sensitive data. Fault tolerance mechanisms ensure uninterrupted
    operation, and advanced attack detection techniques like ML aid in early detection
    and mitigation. Standardized interfaces and protocols enhance interoperability,
    and employee training in cybersecurity best practices prevents social engineering
    attacks. Intrusion detection and prevention systems monitor malicious activities,
    while data encryption secures sensitive information. Multi-factor authentication
    adds an extra layer of security. Continuous monitoring, resilience testing, collaboration,
    and ongoing research are essential for a robust security posture) [200]. Based
    on The survey of the use of ML techniques for WQ analysis, the most predicted
    parameters are WQI, (DO, pH, EC, and TP. These parameters are widely employed
    in the analysis of WQ, and their accurate prediction is crucial for effective
    monitoring and management of water resources. Leveraging ML techniques for predicting
    these parameters can offer valuable insights into trends, aid in identifying potential
    pollution sources, and facilitate decision-making in WQM. However, it is important
    to recognize that relying solely on these parameters may oversimplify the assessment
    of WQ, potentially overlooking its intricate complexities and resulting in insufficient
    or misleading evaluations. Furthermore, the absence of standardized practices
    in parameter usage can impact the comparability of results across various studies.
    This approach may not consider the interactions between parameters, which can
    lead to incomplete or incorrect assessments of WQ. This highlights the need to
    consider a broader range of parameters and to standardize their use to ensure
    comprehensive and comparable assessments of WQ. Additionally, to give reliable
    assessments of WQ, it is also crucial to take into account regional and temporal
    fluctuations as well as the interactions between parameters. Based on the survey
    paper, the most commonly used algorithms in WQM are designed for regression or
    classification purposes, as well as clustering and dimensionality reduction. Among
    the most commonly used algorithms are random RF, SVM, ANNs, MLR, DT, PCA, k-means
    clustering, SVR, MLP, Xgboost, and LR. In WQM, algorithm selection relies on factors
    such as monitoring program goals, data type, volume, and available resources for
    analysis. The choice of algorithm is influenced by the strengths and limitations
    of each. For instance, some algorithms such as RF and SVM are better suited for
    classification tasks, while ANNs are useful for modeling complex relationships
    between predictors and outcomes. MLR is often used to model the relationship between
    environmental variables and WQ parameters, while DT is effective in identifying
    the most significant predictors. PCA is useful in detecting patterns in data,
    and k-means clustering can identify groups of samples with similar WQ characteristics.
    The selection of algorithms should be carefully considered, taking into account
    the specific research question and the characteristics of the data under analysis.
    Regression algorithms are valuable tools for predicting WQ parameters like pH,
    DO, and nutrient concentrations. However, they might struggle to capture complex
    relationships between these parameters and environmental factors such as temperature
    or land use. For handling non-linear relationships, tree-based algorithms prove
    to be more suitable, although their accuracy can be compromised when dealing with
    high-dimensional data. On the other hand, algorithms like SVR, multilayer perceptron
    (MLP), and Xgboost are effective options for modeling complex non-linear relationships
    and handling large and intricate datasets with numerous predictors. SVR and MLP,
    in particular, exhibit prowess in capturing intricate nonlinearities. Xgboost,
    on the other hand, shines when it comes to managing complex datasets with a multitude
    of predictors. Another commonly utilized algorithm in WQM is LR. LR is frequently
    employed to predict the probability of a binary outcome variable based on one
    or more predictor variables. It is also adept at estimating the likelihood of
    surpassing regulatory thresholds, making it a valuable tool in regulatory compliance
    assessments. Clustering algorithms offer valuable assistance in identifying similar
    WQ samples, aiding in the exploration of patterns and similarities among different
    observations. However, the accuracy of clustering results can be subjective and
    dependent on the user''s interpretation. For visualizing high-dimensional WQ data
    and identifying important features, dimensionality reduction techniques come into
    play. These techniques help simplify the data and enable easier visualization.
    Nevertheless, it is crucial to note that in the process of dimensionality reduction,
    relevant information may be discarded, potentially oversimplifying the data. 5.2.
    Future prospects and emerging trends in WQM In recent years, the water sector
    has undergone a remarkable transformation, spurred by advancements in data science,
    analytics, and digital technologies. These advancements have revolutionized WQM
    practices, with ML algorithms and techniques emerging as a pivotal force in shaping
    this future. ML plays a crucial role in data analytics, empowering water utilities
    to extract valuable insights from complex datasets and make informed decisions.
    By continuously analyzing real-time data collected through sensors and IoT devices,
    machine learning models enable real-time assessment of WQ parameters, anomaly
    detection, and optimization of water treatment processes. The integration of ML
    into intelligent water networks has significantly enhanced water distribution
    efficiency. ML algorithms can detect leaks, optimize pressure levels, and improve
    overall system performance, ensuring a reliable and sustainable water supply.
    ML also holds immense potential for promoting water conservation. By analyzing
    smart meter data, ML techniques can identify abnormal consumption patterns, pinpoint
    leaks, and provide personalized insights to consumers. This empowers individuals
    to make informed choices and optimize their water usage. Predictive maintenance,
    driven by ML algorithms, has revolutionized maintenance practices by predicting
    equipment failures and maintenance requirements. This proactive approach reduces
    downtime, extends equipment lifespan, and optimizes resource allocation. Real-time
    WQM, facilitated by ML, has become a critical component of WQM. By detecting contamination
    events early, ML enables swift intervention and prevents the spread of waterborne
    diseases. Decision support systems integrated with ML models are transforming
    WQM by providing WQ professionals with real-time data and advanced analytics.
    This empowers them to make informed decisions regarding treatment strategies,
    resource allocation, and risk assessment, ensuring the timely and effective WQM
    challenges. These emerging trends in WQM, powered by ML, hold immense promise
    for ensuring the availability of clean and safe water for future generations.
    Machine learning is not only transforming WQM practices but also paving the way
    for a sustainable and resilient water future [202]. The future of WQM is intertwined
    with technological advancements and strategic innovations. IoT and ML technologies
    are poised to play an increasingly pivotal role in shaping this landscape. The
    quest for accurate and comprehensive WQ assessments necessitates the adoption
    of sophisticated sensors with an expanded detection range. These sensors, equipped
    with enhanced sensitivity and selectivity, can effectively capture the presence
    and concentration of various contaminants, enabling a more thorough evaluation
    of WQ parameters. The significance of high-quality resonators transcends the realm
    of WQ assessments, extending to various domains, including lasers, sensors, and
    optics. These resonators, capable of confining and amplifying electromagnetic
    waves, play a pivotal role in shaping light''s behavior and enabling various applications.
    Fano resonance, a remarkable phenomenon, emerges from the interplay of distinct
    resonances within a material. This interplay produces unique spectral signatures
    that serve as distinctive fingerprints of the material''s properties. Fano resonance
    not only enhances the resonances in the material but also introduces a sharp dip
    in the spectral response, a characteristic feature of this phenomenon. It is similar
    to electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), an optical transparency phenomenon
    [203]. In sensing technologies, Fano resonances with high Q factors are crucial
    for improving sensor performance. A higher Q factor signifies a sharper and more
    distinct spectral response in the sensing system. This enhanced sharpness enables
    sensors to detect smaller changes in the environment or target parameters, improving
    sensitivity. Additionally, the narrower spectral response enhances selectivity,
    allowing sensors to discern specific targets or analytes from complex backgrounds
    more accurately [204]. These sensors can more precisely identify specific pollutants,
    decreasing false positives and enabling for early identification of contaminants.
    Bioreceptors and nanomaterials integrated into sensors will allow for the exact
    identification of new contaminants such as microplastics and medicines. However,
    the adoption of advanced technologies for WQM may be impeded by complex, expensive,
    and data management system problems. Standardization efforts must provide data
    comparability between research and geographic locations. Adoption is hampered
    by a number of factors, including a lack of expertise, expense, incompatibility
    with existing infrastructure, security, and privacy concerns, along with resistance
    to change, a lack of necessary skills, and inconsistent regulations, pose challenges
    to the adoption of large-scale IoT. The dynamic environment further complicates
    matters, while issues like evolving stakeholder roles and restricted co-creation
    stem from advanced technology [205]. To surmount these challenges, organizations
    have to develop communication, implement robust cybersecurity protocols, broaden
    their outreach and education initiatives, explore other funding options, and incorporate
    stakeholders in the decision-making procedures. Alternative finance models including
    grants, subsidies, and public-private partnerships can be used to promote adoption.
    Strong cybersecurity, data transparency, and infrastructure compatibility can
    all be increased through pilot projects and phased rollouts. 6. Conclusion The
    utilization of ML and IoT in managing WQ has proven to be highly effective, revolutionizing
    the precision, speed, and efficacy of monitoring, analyzing, and predicting WQ.
    Consequently, smart water systems have been developed to instantly detect and
    address any fluctuations in WQ, ensuring the safety and security of water consumed,
    used for agriculture, and maintained for the environment. The implementation of
    IoT wireless technologies has been crucial in advancing smart water systems for
    WQM. These technologies enable the gathering and analysis of vast amounts of data
    on WQ, facilitating the creation of accurate and reliable models for forecasting
    WQ. Real-time monitoring and response to changes in WQ, made possible by wireless
    sensors, communication networks, and cloud computing platforms, guarantee water
    safety for human consumption, agriculture, and the environment. The application
    of ML algorithms in WQM has enhanced the efficiency of WQM, analysis, and prediction.
    Supervised ML algorithms have proven effective in predicting and classifying WQ
    parameters such as pH, Temp, TUR, and DO. These algorithms enable the identification
    of patterns and relationships within the data, leading to improved understanding
    and WQM. Unsupervised ML algorithms like clustering and anomaly detection have
    also been employed in WQM, enabling the detection and response to changes in WQ
    that may not be immediately apparent, allowing for corrective action before situations
    worsen. However, several challenges remain to be addressed. Standardized protocols
    for data collection, processing, and analysis are needed to ensure consistency
    in data quality. Additionally, the development of efficient and cost-effective
    IoT devices capable of withstanding harsh environmental conditions and maintaining
    accuracy and reliability over time is crucial. Continuous monitoring and maintenance
    of IoT devices pose another challenge that must be tackled to ensure the longevity
    and effectiveness of WQM systems. Regular calibration of sensors, replacement
    of worn-out components, and software updates are essential maintenance practices
    for optimal functioning of IoT devices. Collaboration among researchers, policymakers,
    and water management authorities is essential in developing robust and sustainable
    solutions for WQM. Their collective efforts can result in effective and practical
    solutions to address the challenges faced in the application of ML and IoT in
    WQM. In conclusion, this survey paper highlights the significant contributions
    of ML techniques and IoT to the field of WQM. The successful integration of these
    advanced technologies has showcased their potential to accurately predict WQ parameters
    and promptly detect contaminants, promoting public health and environmental sustainability.
    Nevertheless, there are still areas for future research in this domain. Investigating
    the development of ML models capable of effectively handling missing or incomplete
    data, a common challenge in WQM, holds promise. Additionally, incorporating emerging
    technologies like blockchain and edge computing enhances WQM system precision
    and efficiency. Research efforts can also focus on optimizing sensor networks
    to improve reliability and reduce maintenance costs. Overall, the future of WQM
    appears promising, and ongoing research endeavors in this field will undoubtedly
    yield more effective and efficient systems for safeguarding our water resources.

  description: In this article, a low-cost hydrostatic liquid level transmitter is
    presented, utilizing a diaphragm as the primary sensing element and a capacitive
    sensor as the secondary transducer. We investigate a capacitive pressure sensor
    configuration that employs two metal plates separated by a specific gap distance.
    Traditionally, capacitive pressure sensors utilize an elastic diaphragm with fixed
    edges and a sealed cavity. However, the proposed design manipulates the capacitance
    at the observer unit to detect changes in capacitance resulting from the hydrostatic
    pressure exerted by the liquid. This configuration enables accurate measurement
    of liquid level based on frequency, making it suitable for low-power and telemetric
    applications. Capacitive pressure sensors are particularly advantageous as they
    operate without drawing dc power and can form passive inductor-capacitor (L-C)
    tank circuits. The hydrostatic liquid level transducer described in this article
    offers a reliable and efficient solution for measuring liquid levels in various
    applications, such as industrial processes, environmental monitoring, and liquid
    storage systems. The proposed sensor design provides accurate and real-time level
    measurements, contributing to enhanced control and monitoring of liquid systems.

    In this article, a low-cost hydrostatic liquid level transmitter is presented,
    utilizing a diaphragm as the primary sensing element and a capacitive sensor as
    the secondary transducer. We investigate a capacitive pressure sensor configuration
    that employs two metal plates separated by a specific gap distance. Traditionally,
    capacitive pressure sensors utilize an elastic diaphragm with fixed edges and
    a sealed cavity. However, the proposed design manipulates the capacitance at the
    observer unit to detect changes in capacitance resulting from the hydrostatic
    pressure exerted by the liquid. This configuration enables accurate measurement
    of liquid level based on frequency, making it suitable for low-power and telemetric
    applications. Capacitive pressure sensors are particularly advantageous as they
    operate without drawing dc power and can form passive inductor-capacitor ( L –
    C ) tank circuits. The hydrostatic liquid level transducer described in this article
    offers a reliable and efficient solution for measuring liquid levels in various
    applications, such as industrial processes, environmental monitoring, and liquid
    storage systems. The proposed sensor design provides accurate and real-time level
    measurements, contributing to enhanced control and monitoring of liquid systems.

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Accurate and efficient level measurement
    is crucial across a wide range of industries, including chemical processing, oil
    and gas, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals, and environmental monitoring. The
    ability to precisely determine the level of liquids, granular materials, or bulk
    solids in storage vessels, tanks, and pipelines is essential for maintaining optimal
    process control, ensuring product quality, and preventing costly operational issues
    [1]. Traditionally, level measurement has been performed using various conventional
    methods, such as sight glasses, float and tape systems, differential pressure
    sensors, and ultrasonic devices. While these techniques have provided satisfactory
    results in many applications, they often suffer from limitations in terms of accuracy,
    reliability, and ease of installation and maintenance. Over the years, researchers
    and engineers have developed and refined various techniques for measuring the
    level of liquids, granular materials, and bulk solids in storage vessels, tanks,
    and pipelines. Reverter et al. [2] developed a liquid-level measurement system
    utilizing a remote grounded capacitive sensor. The electrodes of the capacitive
    sensor are constructed using cost-effective materials, including a stainless-steel
    rod and a poly-tetra-fluoro-ethylene (PTFE)-insulated wire. The interface circuit
    is designed around a straightforward relaxation oscillator and a microcontroller.
    Bera et al. [3] designed an affordable non-contact capacitance-based level sensor
    for conducting liquid. The sensor takes the shape of a uniform circular cylinder,
    constructed from insulating materials like glass, ceramic, or plastic. It is connected
    to a metallic or non-metallic liquid storage tank, where the conducting liquid
    column serves as one electrode, and a non-inductively wound short-circuited external
    coil acts as the other electrode of a variable capacitor. The variation in capacitance
    resulting from changes in the liquid level is measured using a modified linear
    operational-amplifier (op-amp)-based De’ Sauty bridge network, incorporating adjustable
    bridge sensitivity. Khan et al. [4] designed the modified bridge network based
    on an op-amp to detect capacitance variations in a proposed level-sensing probe.
    The design aims to reduce the impact of stray capacitance between the output leads
    of the bridge network. Lee et al. [5] designed a straightforward approach for
    measuring water levels is introduced and tested using wavelength division multiplexing
    (WDM). The method relies on the alteration of Fresnel reflection at the tip of
    an optical fiber tip (OFT). Canbolta [6] designed a novel technique for sensing
    the level of liquid introduced using a capacitive method. Most current approaches
    are based on estimates derived from the significant contrast in dielectric constants
    between liquids and air. This proposed method removes the influence of air and
    provides precise measurements of liquid levels in containers. One major benefit
    of this method is that it can be used to measure the level of any non-conductive
    liquid directly without the need for calibration. This technique relies on assessing
    the capacitances of three distinct parallel-plate capacitive structures referred
    to as level, reference, and air sensors. Zhang et al. [7] have suggested approach
    for gauging liquid level concentrates on the ultrasonic impedance and echo energy
    that occur within a metal wall where the sensor is affixed. It does not rely on
    ultrasonic waves that enter the gas-liquid mix present in the container. Bento
    et al. [8] proposed an instant capacitive sensor that utilizes a capacitance step
    technique is created, constructed, and utilized to determine the immersion-based
    liquid level. The sensor comprises two electrodes crafted from copper-plated phenolite
    plates and separated by a specific distance, mounted within a non-conductive container
    that holds water as the dielectric material. The analysis of the sensor’s performance
    when the liquid level varies is semi-linear, and it is derived from the changes
    in output voltage after implementing a suitable signal conditioning circuit. Instead
    of the usual bridge circuit, a parallel R – C circuit is employed to transform
    the voltage shift into a change in level. Chakraborty et al. [9] introduced an
    opto-electronic method for transmitting the liquid level of conductive liquids
    typically stored in tanks. The transmitter unit’s electronic component includes
    a modified capacitive transducer and a signal conditioner that generates a linear
    dc output voltage linked to the conducting liquid’s level in the tank. A Mach-Zehnder
    Interferometer (MZI) based electrooptic converter is utilized to convert this
    dc voltage into an optical signal. Hanni and Venkata [10] have a new type of capacitance
    level sensor that aims to enhance sensitivity and decrease sensor delay. The authors
    conducted a performance analysis of the traditional parallel rod and cylindrical
    type sensors to evaluate their sensitivity and delay. Based on the findings, they
    suggest a novel design that modifies the electrode structure from the standard
    design to a helical one. Díaz et al. [11] presented a new method for measuring
    liquid levels using a fiber optic sensor. The system utilizes a special type of
    fiber, called a silica fiber Bragg grating (FBG), which is placed within an epoxy
    resin diaphragm. This diaphragm is connected to a temperature sensor, allowing
    for compensation of temperature-related inaccuracies and thus enhancing the precision
    of liquid level measurements. Gong et al. [12] have proposed an affordable capacitive
    sensing device designed for measuring liquid levels. We have devised a unique
    electrode pattern resembling a comb, which plays a crucial role in this device.
    By placing this electrode within a container, a capacitor is formed with the liquid,
    and the capacitance value is directly proportional to the electrode’s area. As
    a result, when the liquid level reaches a larger area of the comb electrode, there
    are notable and distinct changes in the capacitance gradient. The experimental
    findings demonstrate a variation error of approximately 6%. Islam et al. [13]
    designed capacitive sensors are extensively employed in various applications for
    liquid level measurement. Conventional contact-based capacitive sensors often
    encounter issues such as frequent maintenance requirements and drift in sensor
    output over time. To address these challenges, this work introduces a straightforward
    solution: a non-contact interdigital (IDT) fringing field capacitance sensor for
    liquid level measurement. This sensor design offers simplicity and eliminates
    the need for physical contact with the liquid. Kulha et al. [14] designed the
    manufacturing process and characterization of cost-effective electrodes intended
    for capacitive level sensors implemented on a flexible substrate. For the purpose
    of conducting a comparative analysis, both individual IDT capacitors and a system
    with embedded microcontroller readout were designed. The individual capacitors
    were constructed as IDT electrodes (IDT) with varying finger width/spacing dimensions
    ranging from 300/300 to 800/ 800μm . The finger length was set at either 10 or
    15 mm, while the overall length of the capacitors was 100 mm. Ali et al. [15]
    suggested a transducer which is an innovative liquid level measurement technique
    based on surface acoustic waves (SAWs), which distinguishes it from the traditional
    methods used for liquid level measurement. Xu et al. [16] proposed a liquid level
    measurement principle using acoustic resonance, the level height is typically
    determined by analyzing the fundamental resonance frequency (RF) detected. Uhov
    et al. [17] presented a noninvasive optical method for liquid level measurement.
    The characteristics of the employed instrumentation technique are examined, and
    the functional diagram and electrical circuit of the developed measurement setup
    are provided. Zhang et al. [18] studied a continuous sound wave amplitude-based
    approach for exogenous liquid level assessment. Geethamani et al. [19] employed
    Arduino Uno and the FDC1004 capacitance sensor breakout board to monitor and regulate
    the water level at every point within the tank. An essential advantage of this
    project is its non-contact nature with the liquid, ensuring accurate measurements
    of the liquid level. Jin et al. [20] designed a liquid-level measurement system
    that relies on a grounded cylindrical capacitive sensor tailored for conductive
    liquids. The fabrication process for the cylindrical capacitive sensor employs
    an innovative method utilizing shielded cables. In this approach, the inner conductor
    of the shielded cable is grounded, while the outer conductor serves the purpose
    of liquid level measurement. Sengupta et al. [21] designed a Hydrostatic pressure
    based liquid level measuring system. In this research, a novel liquid level sensor
    utilizes an FBG attached to a bourdon tube to detect variations in hydrostatic
    pressure. Liu et al. [22] implemented a system wherein both temperature and liquid
    levels are concurrently monitored using a tilted FBG (TFBG). By capitalizing on
    the distinct responses of cladding modes and Bragg resonance in the TFBG spectrum
    to variations in liquid level and temperature, this technique enables the accurate
    measurement of both parameters while mitigating undesirable cross-sensitivity
    effects. Campbell and Mutharasan [23] designed the cantilever sensor which was
    partially submerged to a depth of 1 mm in two volatile fluids and one non-volatile
    fluid. In this article, we have proposed a hydrostatic liquid level transducer,
    also known as a hydrostatic level sensor. It is device used to measure the level
    of a liquid by sensing the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the liquid column above
    the sensor. This system consists of a pressure sensing element, a housing, and
    electrical connections. The pressure sensing element is in direct contact with
    the liquid and converts the hydrostatic pressure into an electrical signal, usually
    a voltage or current output. A diaphragm, essentially a pressure sensor, can act
    as a primary sensing element for hydrostatic level measurement. The diaphragm
    is situated close to the tank’s bottom and measures the liquid level height in
    terms of the hydrostatic pressure at that point. In our design, the sensing unit
    is placed at a height of 0.5 cm above the datum level. Traditionally capacitive
    pressure sensors employ an elastic diaphragm with fixed edges and a sealed cavity
    between the diaphragm and the underlying substrate. This study investigates a
    capacitive pressure sensor configuration comprising two metal plates separated
    by a specific gap distance. The changes in capacitance resulting from hydrostatic
    pressure exerted by a liquid can be detected by manipulating the capacitance at
    the observer unit. A capacitive pressure sensor is designed for this purpose,
    and it is preferred in low-power and telemetric applications due to its ability
    to operate without drawing dc power. They conveniently form passive inductor-capacitor
    ( L – C ) tank circuits, allowing for pressure measurement based on frequency.
    The wireless interrogation can be achieved by utilizing an inductor that is magnetically
    coupled with the L – C tank device. This research article is structured as follows.
    The transduction mechanism of the capacitive pressure sensor is explained in the
    section titled “Methodology.” The design details of the sensing unit are presented
    in the section titled “Design of sensing unit.” The results are explained and
    analysis has been done in the sections titled experimental result. These are followed
    by a discussion in the section titled “Discussion.” Finally, the article concludes
    with the section titled “Conclusion and future work,” summarizing the overall
    efforts and suggesting potential future research directions. SECTION II. Methodology
    In this study, the diaphragm serves as the primary transducer responsible for
    converting the hydrostatic pressure resulting from the liquid level’s height into
    linear displacement, as depicted in Fig. 1(a) and (b). In hydrostatic liquid level
    measurement, the hydrostatic pressure is generated at the lower part of the container
    or tank as shown in Fig. 2(a). Fig. 1. (a) Schematic of proposed level sensor.
    (b) Schematic of diaphragm based capacitive sensor. Show All Fig. 2. (a) Measuring
    concept utilizing the concept of capacitors. (b) FEM based analysis of displacement
    of capacitive plate with respect to liquid level. Show All Assume the hydrostatic
    pressure is represented by ΔP and the height of the liquid level is denoted by
    h . Therefore, the hydrostatic pressure can be expressed as follows: ΔP=ρgh. (1)
    View Source Considering that ρ represents the density of the liquid in the tank
    and g represents the acceleration due to gravity, it can be noted that both ρ
    and g remain constant in this context. The above equation can be written as ΔP=
    C 1 h. (2) View Source A diaphragm is affixed to the base of the glass chamber,
    which is positioned within the tank, as depicted in Fig. 1(a). As the hydrostatic
    pressure builds at the tank’s bottom, it causes displacement in the diaphragm.
    The displacement occurring at the diaphragm’s center within its elastic region
    can be denoted as w as shown in Fig. 3 ΔP= C 2 w (3) View Source where C 2 is
    constant. Fig. 3. Conventional diaphragm displacement with hydrostatic pressure.
    Show All Combining (2) and (3), we have w= C 1 C 2 h. (4) View Source A. Mechanism
    of Capacitive Pressure Sensor The operation of the sensor relies on the applied
    pressure, which leads to a change in the distance between two electrodes, resulting
    in a variation in capacitance, as depicted in Fig. 2(a). As illustrated in the
    diagram, the movable plate of the capacitor is firmly connected to the center
    of the diaphragm via a central post. However, it is electrically isolated from
    the diaphragm used for pressure sensing. The center post is designed to be small
    enough that its impact on the deflection of the diaphragm can be considered negligible.
    The fixed plate is positioned parallel to the movable plate, creating a parallel
    plate capacitor. Additionally, the fixed plate encloses the movable plate within
    a sealed cavity. When the diaphragm is subjected to a pressure load, both the
    diaphragm and the moving plate of the capacitor experience an equal amount of
    deflection from the center of the diaphragm. This means that the deflection of
    the diaphragm can be easily converted into a change in capacitance. In the case
    of a circular-shaped pressure sensor, the sensitivity of capacitance can be expressed
    as follows: ΔC P = 3(1− v 2 ) R 4 16E T 3 ε 0 ε r A g 2 . (5) View Source The
    equation provided relates to the change in capacitance ( ΔC ) of the sensor with
    the hydrostatic pressure resulting from the liquid level’s height. It is dependent
    on several factors, including the pressure difference across the diaphragm ( P
    ), the radius ( R ) and thickness ( T ) of the diaphragm, Young’s modulus ( E
    ) and Poisson’s ratio ( ν ) of the diaphragm material, the area of the moving
    plate ( A ), and the sensing gap ( g ) between the moving and fixed plates. B.
    LC -Based Sensing Unit Even in challenging environmental conditions, the sensor
    accurately detects changes in capacitance and enables wireless transmission through
    an inductively coupled tank circuit, which incorporates resistance due to the
    presence of an inductor. To enable wireless operation of the proposed design at
    the observer unit, an inductively coupled tank circuit is employed. This circuit
    utilizes the change in resonant frequency resulting from the fractional variation
    in capacitance caused by the variation in the hydrostatic pressure resulting from
    the liquid level’s height. To achieve the LC-based measurement system, two coils
    are employed and coupled together through mutual inductance. The circuit diagram
    of the entire LC-based measurement system is depicted in Fig. 4. The simulation
    result of the proposed spiral inductor used for transmission is shown in Fig.
    5. On the primary or reader side of the system, there is an inductor (Lp) along
    with its corresponding resistance (Rp). An ac voltage of (Vp) is applied to this
    setup. The secondary side of the system includes an inductor (Ls), an equivalent
    resistance (Rs), and a variable capacitance (Cs). In this configuration, the sensing
    capacitor serves as the variable capacitor and its value varies in response to
    the liquid level. Fig. 4. LC passive wireless sensor. Show All Fig. 5. Simulation
    result of the spiral inductor. Show All As per (5), the capacitance of the sensing
    capacitor in this design undergoes a linear change corresponding to the hydrostatic
    pressure resulting in liquid height in tank. The inductors on both sides are circular
    planar spiral coils. The mutual coupling ( M ) between these coils is influenced
    by the variations in capacitance, resulting in a shift in the RF (fs). This enables
    the passive and wireless measurement of the flow rate in the measured parameter
    across the pipeline section. To determine the changes in RF and impedance properties,
    an impedance analyzer is connected to the reader coil. This impedance analyzer
    serves as the source of ac voltage for the antenna. From the perspective of the
    reader, the impedance is described by the following expression: Z R Z R = R R
    +j2Πf L R + (2ΠfM ) 2 ( R 0 +j (2Πf L 0 − 1 2Πf C 0 ) 2 ) = R R +j2Πf L P ⎛ ⎝

    value are assessed to establish a correlation and determine the height of liquid
    level in tank. SECTION III. Design In this study, a primary sensor is utilized
    in the form of a thin rubber diaphragm. The rubber diaphragm measures 12 cm in
    diameter and has a thickness of 2 mm. The diaphragm is carefully stretched and
    affixed to the lower part of the glass chamber. The capacitive sensor is designed
    using two parallel plates, one is a moving plate and the other is a fixed plate.
    A cavity-supporting structure is constructed within the given framework. The structure’s
    design takes into consideration the required pressure range for sensing and the
    assembly settings. Typically, a rigid supporting structure is necessary for high-pressure
    sensors. Once the size of the membrane is determined, the gap size is calculated
    based on capacitor calculations. The research utilizes COMSOL Multiphysics to
    optimize a 3-D capacitive sensor structure through various interfaces. These interfaces,
    including electrostatics, solid mechanics, and moving mesh, address electrical,
    structural, and dynamic aspects, respectively. The holistic integration of these
    interfaces is illustrated in Fig. 2(b). The capacitive sensor, constructed with
    polysilicon, operates in air and features carefully chosen geometric parameters
    for practicality. This approach aims to comprehensively refine the sensor’s design
    and enhance its performance. This sensor has an air gap of 15 mm, a membrane radius
    of 255 mm, and electrode/membrane thickness of 7 mm. The construction of the tank
    involves connecting an inductor coil to the sensor separately. Wireless communication
    and data retrieval can be achieved by utilizing an inductor that is magnetically
    linked to the L – C tank. Both the reader coils and sensor coils share identical
    designs. Two double-sided glass epoxy printed circuit boards (PCBs) measuring
    60 mm by 60 mm have been manufactured, each equipped with square planar circular
    coils. The copper tracks on these PCBs have a width of 0.254 mm and are separated
    by a distance of 0.254 mm as well. A single platform serving as a support for
    the reader coil has been constructed to facilitate easy adjustment of the distance
    between the sensor coil and the reader coil. Specifically, the distance between
    the two coils is set at 3 mm. SECTION IV. Experimental Results In this work, regular
    tap water is used as a process liquid in the tank at room temperature. The tap
    water used in the experiment is the water supplied by Dhanbad Municipal Corporation,
    Dhanbad, Jharkhand state with conductivity in the range of 250–350 mS/cm. The
    tank is cylindrical in shape having 24 cm diameter and 110 cm height. The pictorial
    view of the proposed level measurement system is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6. Pictorial
    view of experimental setup. 1. Proposed capacitive based sensor. 2. Network analyzer.
    3. Level measuring tank. 4. Storage tank. Show All Initially, the experiment focused
    on the capacitive pressure sensor. The diaphragm is attached to one plate and,
    the other plate is fixed with a certain gap. Subsequently, the liquid level was
    incrementally raised in 10 cm intervals. With the variation in liquid level, the
    hydrostatic pressure is exerted on the diaphragm. The same causes the displacement
    of the diaphragm. Which overall decreases the gap between the two electrodes of
    the capacitive sensor. At each step, the capacitance of capacitive sensor was
    measured using inductance, capacitance, and resistance (LCR) meter. The maximum
    height of the tank at which the capacitive sensor voltage was recorded was 100
    cm. By plotting the capacitance of the capacitive sensor against the tank’s height,
    the static characteristics of the hydrostatic pressure level sensor were graphically
    represented, as shown in Fig. 7(a). To assess the repeatability and uncertainty
    of the capacitive based sensor, the experiment was conducted in both increasing
    and decreasing modes, with three trials for each. The experimental data obtained
    was analyzed using MS Excel (Microsoft) to calculate the percentage deviation,
    standard deviation, and error. These calculated values are presented in Fig. 7(b)–(d).
    In the next stage, E5061B network analyzer (manufactured by Agilent, Santa Clara,
    CA, USA) is linked to the reader coil via an external coaxial cable. This network
    analyzer is responsible for analyzing the frequency and S 11 data of the liquid
    level sensor within the experimental setup. The reflection coefficient S 11 change
    with the level and the same has been represented in Fig. 8(a). The resonant frequency
    with respect to change in liquid level is sown in Fig. 8(b). The percentage deviation
    from linearity has been calculated and shown in Fig. 8(c). To ensure accurate
    measurement, the distance between the coils was maintained for a constant coupling
    factor, and the results were validated by varying the coil distance to analyze
    the sensor’s characteristics. The precision of the sensor’s measurements was assessed
    using the standard deviation, which measures the consistency and reproducibility
    of repeated measurements. A smaller standard deviation indicates higher precision,
    indicating tight clustering of measurements around the mean value. The standard
    deviation was calculated to analyze the repeatability of the proposed system and
    the results are depicted in Fig. 8(d). The frequency sweeping range was configured
    to cover 600–900 MHz to validate the capacitive sensing concept of the proposed
    liquid level sensor; the experiment was conducted in both increasing and decreasing
    modes, with six trials performed for each. To demonstrate the sensor’s hysteresis
    and repeatability. The repeatability graph, displayed in Fig. 8(e), illustrates
    this behavior against the different liquid level. Fig. 7. (a) Characteristics

    sensor. (c) Repeatability curve. (d) Percentage deviation curve. Show All Fig.

    curve. Show All SECTION V. Discussion The linear characteristics of the proposed
    level sensor are evident from the plot in Fig. 7(a). The capacitance of the capacitive
    sensor is influenced by changes in pressure exerted on the diaphragm due to changes
    in the liquid level. The output of the capacitive sensor is expected to exhibit
    a linear relationship with the displacement, which corresponds to the change in
    liquid level. The diaphragm serves as the primary sensor for measuring hydrostatic
    pressure. When the liquid level in the tank rises, the hydrostatic pressure at
    the bottom of the container increases. The maximum pressure exerted on the diaphragm
    is at the center, which moreover causes the linear displacement of the movable
    plate of the capacitive sensor. This observation was further confirmed by utilizing
    COMSOL, a multiphysics software based on finite element analysis. This pressure
    change is sensed by the diaphragm, resulting in displacement, which causes a decrement
    in the gap between two electrodes, and leads to a change in the capacitance. Gradually,
    we increase the liquid level in the tank in step, and corresponding to that, the
    change in capacitance is noted. Based on the figure, it was noted that when the
    height of the liquid level was raised from 10 to 100 cm, there was a linear increase
    in capacitance. The standard deviation is a measure commonly used to evaluate
    the precision of a sensor’s measurements. Precision refers to the consistency
    and reproducibility of repeated measurements. A smaller standard deviation indicates
    higher precision, as it suggests that the measurements are tightly clustered around
    the mean value. By calculating the standard deviation, we can assess the level
    of precision exhibited by the proposed sensor system. The standard deviation for
    the proposed sensor is calculated and it is represented in Fig. 7(b). From that
    graphs, it has been noted that the maximum deviation is noted as 0.75. Therefore,
    it has been observed that the value is small, it means that it has very small
    deviation from the mean value. The proposed sensor is said to be précised in nature.
    The repeatability of a sensor refers to its ability to consistently produce the
    same output or measurements when subjected to repeated tests or experiments under
    the same conditions. In other words, it indicates how well the sensor can reproduce
    its measurements. This same is represented in Fig. 7(c). A high level of repeatability
    implies that the sensor yields consistent and reliable results with minimal variation.
    Evaluating the repeatability of a sensor involves examining its performance over
    multiple trials or tests and analyzing the consistency of the obtained measurements.
    According to American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards, the
    formula for calculating the repeatability of a measurement is as follows: Repeatability=2.8×Standard
    Deviation. (9) View Source The percentage deviation for non-linearity has been
    calculated and represented against the level. The same is shown in Fig. 7(d).
    The percentage deviation for the sensor is a measure of the difference between
    the measured values and the expected or reference values, expressed as a percentage
    of the expected value. It quantifies the level of deviation or error in the sensor’s
    measurements. To calculate the percentage deviation, you can use the following
    formula: = Percentage Deviation ((Measured Value−Expected Value)/Expected Value)
    ×100. (10) View Source The sensor design exhibits non-linearity that is within
    acceptable limits, comparable to other designed level measurement systems and
    commercially available level sensors. An analysis of the repeatability of the
    measuring system under consideration has been conducted. By examining the data
    presented in the figure, it is evident that the maximum repeatability of the proposed
    measuring system is 3.64%. This indicates that the system consistently provides
    measurements within an acceptable range. As a result, the overall accuracy of
    the proposed system can be evaluated as satisfactory. In order to achieve wireless
    transmission, the design of an LC resonating circuit was implemented. Additionally,
    a readout probe with an inductor coil was utilized to measure liquid level wirelessly.
    The measurements were conducted six times, with three instances in an increment
    mode and three in a decrement mode. From the figure provided, it can be observed
    that the RF reflection coefficient ( S 11 ) and resonant frequency exhibit variations
    in response to the liquid level. To examine the responses of the resonant frequency
    to the level of liquid, the liquid level was initially increased from 10 to 100
    cm at room temperature. The results, depicted in Fig. 8(a) and (b), illustrate
    that the frequency of the sensor decreased during the increment in the level of
    liquid. The sensitivity of a sensor refers to its capability to detect and respond
    to small changes or variations in the measured quantity. The sensor sensitivity
    is calculated and it found to be around 2.78 MHz/cm. The percentage deviation
    from the best fit curve is calculated and from the Fig. 8(c), it has been found
    that the non-linearity is around 1.87%. The Fig. 8(d) displays the plot of the
    standard deviation, which serves to assess the precision and repeatability of
    the proposed measuring system. By analyzing the data, it was determined that the
    maximum standard deviation recorded was 0.65. This observation indicates that
    the proposed sensor exhibits minimal deviation from the mean value, implying a
    high level of precision. The repeatability of proposed measuring system has been
    calculated and it is plotted against the level and shown in Fig. 8(e). The repeatability
    of proposed sensor is around 1.65%. The designed sensor demonstrates measurement
    errors repeatability that fall within an acceptable range. The proposed design
    presents a wireless-level measurement technique, offering numerous advantages
    over wired systems that directly measure changing capacitance. In industrial applications
    involving multiple units, individual signal conditioning circuits are not necessary
    for each system when using the designed sensor. Instead, only the sensor needs
    to be installed on the exterior wall of the container or tank. This LC-based level
    sensor design is highly versatile and applicable to various scenarios due to its
    passive and wireless properties. In contrast, the proposed transducer in this
    study eliminates the need for mechanical linkages between the primary sensor and
    secondary sensing element. This feature significantly enhances its utility compared
    to conventional elastic-type transducers, as it employs a non-contact technique.
    Consequently, the proposed transducer is immune to errors caused by mechanical
    linkages. The diaphragm employed in the proposed transducer is securely fixed
    at the bottom of a circular glass chamber under normal atmospheric conditions.
    Therefore, the liquid used for the level measurement is at room temperature since
    the proposed transducer is also kept at room temperature. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This study introduces, describes, and validates a contactless passive LC-sensing-based
    level sensor and a novel readout system for LC tags. The level sensor utilizes
    the capacitive sensor principle, while a planar spiral inductor and coplanar capacitor
    form the LC tank circuit. A planar reader coil is used to detect the measuring
    parameter. The designed level sensor is versatile and suitable for various applications,
    including solid materials, corrosive substances, and reactive materials. The proposed
    readout method is based on a capacitive sensor and has been successfully applied
    to the designed level sensor, yielding satisfactory results that confirm the feasibility
    of the concept. Therefore, the proposed system and methodology offer a cost-effective,
    compact, and user-friendly concept for wireless measurement systems. Changes in
    water conductivity within the range of 250–350 mS/cm can influence hydrostatic
    pressure measurements and sensor outputs. Higher conductivity levels may slightly
    impact water density, affecting hydrostatic pressure. Sensor calibration might
    be needed to account for conductivity variations, as they can alter sensor accuracy
    and sensitivity. Specific effects depend on the sensor type and setup, requiring
    consideration of the sensor’s specifications and potential adjustments for accurate
    readings. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This Design and

    Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) based sensors have been widely investigated and
    played crucial roles in various public fields owing to their outstanding sensitivity
    and selectivity [1], [2], [3], [4]. However, water vapor, the widespread toxicity
    species for MOS in air, should never be ignored in the typical sensing processes.
    The deterioration of sensitivities and the alterations in the sensors’ baseline
    resistances under variable humidity have been universally reported [5], [6]. The
    foremost influence of water vapor on MOS is that the H2O molecules react with
    chemisorbed oxygen to form hydroxyl groups, inhibit the adsorption sites along
    with the diffusion pathways of target gases [7], [8], [9]. Regrettably, the as-formed
    hydroxyl groups cannot totally desorb at operating temperatures even higher than
    500 ℃ [10]. Therefore, it is of much great significance to eliminate ambient humidity
    interference on gas sensors. Moreover, under some specific circumstances, MOS-based
    sensors are obliged to be utilized confronting high ambient humidity. For instance,
    the continuous monitoring of skin moisture contributes to check the healing progression
    of skin burns [11]. Human breath detections, as a vital early-stage human disease
    diagnosis and non-invasive medical technology, have widespread applications in
    disease screenings [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Potential biomarkers such as
    acetone, ammonia, isoprene and H2S were considered for early diagnosis for specific
    diseases via breathing patterns monitoring [17]. Among the exhaled breath components,
    H2S is considered as the biomarker of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    and halitosis [18]. For healthy individuals, the normal concentration of H2S in
    exhaled breath is about 0.1 ppm while a higher value in that of suspected patients
    [19]. In these cases, MOS-based gas sensors are widely used due to their high
    sensitivity, fast responding/recovering characteristics and simple fabrications
    [20], [21]. However, as most reported, the exhaled water vapor largely deteriorates
    gas sensing properties of sensors as stated [22], [23], [24], [25]. To date, studies
    have been devoted to materials modifications for optimizing gas sensing characteristics
    under humid atmospheres of MOS. Hydrophobic material coatings such as polyvinylidene
    fluoride (PVDF) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) have been applied to inhibit the
    humidity impact on MOS [26], [27]. However, the hydrophobic composites will cover
    the valid gas adsorption and reaction sites of MOSs thus declining their sensitivities.
    The adverse thermal stabilities of coatings limit their high-temperature applications
    as well. Recently, favorable humidity-tolerant enhancements of lanthanide oxides
    on MOS have also reported [28]. For instance, CeO2 is expected to optimize the
    moisture resistance of In2O3 [29]. The humidity immune mechanism of the cyclic
    redox reaction of multivalent lanthanides (Ce3+/Ce4+) to eliminate surface hydroxyl
    groups has been proposed and also validated for Pr and Tb [10], [30]. The coexistence
    of tri/tetravalent states of lanthanides and the multi-valence redox reaction
    is needed to scavenge chemisorbed hydroxyl groups on the surface of MOS. Kim [31]
    et. al. have posed a strategy to promote the humidity tolerance of SnO2 via NiO
    surficial decorations where the NiO plays a key role as a strong humidity absorber
    and protects the SnO2 from being affected by water-derived species. Other hydrophilic
    metal oxides such as CuO [32], Co3O4 [33] have also been found to have the ability
    to reduce the humidity effect on MOS-based gas sensor. However, deteriorated sensitivities
    have also reported on MOS by hydrophilic metal oxides decorations applied at different
    operating temperatures [34], [35]. The relevant anti-humidity mechanisms based
    on hydrophilic metal oxides modifications required further investigated with considering
    the diverse humidity interfering modes on MOS under various operating temperature.
    Nd2O3 is a kind of lanthanide oxide exhibiting superior affinity to water vapor
    though scarcity of variable valence states such as Ce, Pr and Tb [36]. Nd2O3 is
    more capable of adsorbing water molecules than many other metal oxides including
    ZnO [37] and In2O3 [38]. The temperature dependence of the water affinity behavior
    of Nd2O3 has also been adequately verified that Nd2O3 acts as strong hydrophilic
    at low temperature while almost non-water absorber at higher one [39]. In this
    study, pristine In2O3 and Nd2O3-loaded In2O3 porous nanorods were synthesized
    and fully investigated on their gas sensing and humidity-dependent behaviors at
    various temperatures. The INd20 (20 at% Nd2O3-loaded In2O3 nanorods) based sensor
    performed almost immutable H2S sensing characters in a broad relative humidity
    range (30–80% RH) at 300 ℃ along with the exceptional sensitivity and selectivity
    towards H2S among interfering gases. The disparate humidity dependence of Nd2O3-loaded
    In2O3 at diverse operating temperatures proved the contributions of Nd2O3 on reforming
    anti-humidity stabilities of MOS. In-situ DRIFTS was utilized to validate the
    temperature-dependent humidity-interference on MOS, switching from water molecules
    to hydroxyls with operating temperature rising. H2S sensing mechanisms with regard
    to the water vapor immunity of Nd2O3 at high operating temperature and the effect
    of inhibiting chemisorbed oxygen on surface hydroxyl groups eliminations were
    systematically studied. 2. Experimental Section 2.1. Chemicals Indium chloride
    tetrahydrate (InCl3·4 H2O, 99.9%), urea (CH4N2O, 99.5%) and neodymium nitrate
    hexahydrate (Nd(NO3)3·6 H2O, 99.0%) were purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation.
    Co., Ltd. and used without further purification. Deionized water (DI) and absolute
    ethanol were also used in the syntheses. 2.2. Preparation of In2O3 nanorods In2O3
    nanorods were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. Firstly, 2.5 mmol
    InCl3·4 H2O was dissolved in 20 mL of DI. 24 mmol urea was consequently added
    into the solution under vigorous stirring. After continuously stirred for 30 min,
    the uniform solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel
    autoclave and hydrothermally processed at 130 ℃ for 12 h. After cooling down to
    room temperature, the white products were centrifuged and washed with DI and ethanol
    several times. Dried at 80 ℃ overnight, the obtained products were calcined at
    500 ℃ for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 ℃/min to acquire porous In2O3 nanorods
    (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (283KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Schematic illustrations of the synthesis and sensors fabrications
    process. 2.3. Preparation of Nd2O3-loaded In2O3 nanorods A chemical impregnation
    method was applied to synthesize Nd2O3-loaded In2O3 nanorods. 0.1 mmol of obtained
    In2O3 nanorods were dispersed in 20 mL absolute ethanol and the suspension was
    continuously stirred for 30 min. Then, a certain molar ratio of Nd(NO3)3·6 H2O
    (Nd2O3 molar percentages were accordingly 0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% to In2O3)
    was added into the solution and vigorously stirred for another 60 min. The final
    suspension was dried at 80 ℃ until completely steamed. Afterward, the residue
    was calcined at 400 ℃ for 3 h with a heating rate of 5 ℃/min. The pristine In2O3
    and Nd2O3 decorated In2O3 nanorods were denoted as INd0, INd1, INd5, INd10, INd20
    and INd30 respectively (Fig. 1). Pristine Nd2O3 was also prepared via the identical
    synthesis process without the addition of In2O3. 2.4. Characterizations The crystallite
    structures of the obtained In2O3-based nanorods were recorded via a DMAX-2500PC
    apparatus with the radiation source of Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the range of 10–90°
    with a scanning speed of 10°/min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU-70) was
    applied to analyze the micro-nano morphologies of materials with an accelerating
    voltage of 15 kV. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attached to SEM and HAADF-STEM
    (High angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy) was
    recorded to investigate the elemental distribution and composition of the fabricated
    materials. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission
    electron microscopy (HRTEM) were performed to analyze the fine nanostructures
    and crystallite of materials with a JEM 2100 electron microscope (accelerating
    voltage of 200 kV). X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) experiments were applied
    on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB Xi+ spectrometer with Al Kα as the radiation source
    (hν = 1486.6 eV) to research the chemical states of the existing elements. Room-temperature
    ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (Uv-DRS) were analyzed via a UV-3600i
    plus Ultraviolet-visible near-infrared spectrophotometer in the wavelength range
    of 200–800 nm. The specific surface areas and pore size distributions were evaluated
    based on the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods
    (ASAP 2460), respectively. The samples were pre-degassed at 300 ℃ for 6 h. Current-voltage
    characteristics of all the samples were tested via a Hall Effect Measurement System
    (HMS-5000). In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy
    (in-situ DRIFTS) spectra were obtained via a FTIR spectrometer (Bruker TENSOR
    27). The test temperature and relative humidity conditions of the test chamber
    were controlled by a hot plate and balanced humid air. 2.5. Fabrications and gas-sensing
    measurements of gas sensors The synthesized powders were mixed with deionized
    water in a mass ratio of 1:5 to make a uniform paste. Afterward, the obtained
    paste was coated onto an Al2O3 substrate (1 mm × 2 mm) and dried at 80 ℃. This
    process was repeated several times to acquire a uniform sensing layer. The substrates
    were then welded on a basement via four Pt wires to prepare gas sensors (Fig.
    1). The gas sensors were aged at 5 V for 7 days before gas-sensing tests. Gas
    sensing performances were analyzed via a WS-30B gas sensing instrument (Zhengzhou
    Winsen Electronics Co., Ltd., Henan, China). The instrument was used at normal
    temperature and pressure conditions (25 °C, 1 atm). Operating temperature of all
    the sensors was manipulated in the range of 100–300 ℃ by altering the heating
    voltage of the instrument. For adjusting the testing humidity conditions, the
    deionized water was injected onto the evaporator of WS-30B at room temperature
    (25 ℃), Relative humidity values of the test chamber at room temperature arouse
    with the evaporation of deionized water in the test chamber and were recorded
    via the built-in humidity sensor of WS-30B. The testing humidity conditions were
    changed from 35% RH to 80% RH in the test chamber at the ambient temperature of
    room temperature (25 ℃). 1.6 μL of deionized water (approximately 324 ppm) was
    injected to the test chamber for 1% relative humidity elevations at room temperature
    and the gas distribution formula was provided in Supporting Information. In a
    typical gas-sensing test procedure, gas sensors were connected to the gas-sensing
    system in the test chamber. After the baseline resistance kept stable, a certain
    amount of target gases was injected into the test chamber. In our study, the gases
    H2S, CH4, CO, CO2, NH3, NO2 and SO2 used are standard dry gases purchased from
    Jinan Deyang Special Gas Co., LTD. The concentrations of standard H2S, CH4, CO,
    CO2, NH3, NO2 and SO2 are 10000 ppm with N2 as the equilibrium dry gas. The tested
    concentrations of all the target gases were adjusted via changing the injection
    volumes of the standard dry gases. As the resistances stabilizing, target gases
    were exhausted and the resistances of sensors recovered to the initial states.
    Responses toward gases (S) was defined as S = Ra/Rg for reducing gas and S = Rg/Ra
    for oxidizing gas, in which Ra and Rg respectively stood for the stable resistance
    of gas sensors in air and target gas. Response and recovery time was defined as
    the required time for 90% resistance change between the stabilized status in target
    gas atmospheres and in air conditions. 3. Result and discussion 3.1. Structural
    and morphological characteristics XRD patterns of all the samples in Fig. 2a exhibit
    cubic In2O3 structures (JCPDS card No. 06–0416) with high crystallinity. No extra
    diffraction peaks belonging to Nd2O3 can be distinctly discovered, imputing to
    the insufficient concentration and the high dispersion of Nd2O3. To further explore
    the crystallite structure alternations of samples after Nd2O3 loading, as depicted
    in Fig. 2b, magnified XRD patterns provides that the (222) plane of In2O3 has
    no obvious deviations which validly testifies that Nd3+ does not exist in the
    lattice of In2O3 as dopants. Moreover, due to the pinning effect of Nd2O3 on the
    surface of In2O3, the grain growth process of In2O3 is inhibited and the calculated
    grain sizes of INd0, INd1, INd5, INd10 and INd20 are respectively 19.0, 18.3,
    17.6, 14.6 and 14.4 nm via Debye-Scherrer equation (Fig. S1) [40], [70], which
    are all lower than the Debye length of In2O3 materials (ca. 25 nm) which will
    facilitate the completely depleted status thus promoting gas sensing characters
    [41]. Download : Download high-res image (304KB) Download : Download full-size

    (b) The magnified XRD patterns in the range of 29–32°. SEM and EDS measurements
    are depicted in Fig. 3 to analyze the morphological structures and elemental distributions
    of the synthesized materials. In Fig. 3a1-a2, the pristine In2O3 exhibits nanorod
    structures with an average diameter of ca. 500 nm. The nanorods tend to be self-assembled
    as flower-like microstructures. After the introduction of Nd2O3, for INd1, INd5,
    INd10 and INd20 samples displayed in Fig. 3b1-e2, the dominant nanorods structures
    of In2O3 are not destroyed after Nd2O3 loading. Consequently, in order to analyze
    the distributions and existences of Nd, EDS mappings demonstrate the uniform dispersion
    of Nd elements on the In2O3 surface (Fig. 3f-i). Nd2O3 coverage does not change
    the morphological features of In2O3 nanorods. Download : Download high-res image

    mappings of INd20 samples. To further explore the distinct morphological and crystal
    structures, TEM and HRTEM analyses are depicted in Fig. 4. For INd0, the porous
    In2O3 nanorods with an approximate diameter of ca. 500 nm are composed of substantial
    nanoparticles (Fig. 4a-b). The calculated interplanar spacings of 0.287 nm and
    0.406 nm (Fig. 4c) are assigned to the (222) and (211) planes of cubic In2O3 (Fig.
    4c1-c2) [42]. In regard to INd20, the porous nanoparticle-like structures of In2O3
    disappear, which is much probably ascribed to the formation of Nd2O3 as a coverage
    of ultra-thin nanosheets (Fig. 4d-e). The interplanar spacings of 0.287 nm and
    0.300 nm shown in Fig. 4f respectively belong to the (001) plane of Nd2O3 (Fig.
    4f1) [43] and (222) plane of cubic In2O3 (Fig. 4f2) [43], which adequately proves
    the coverage of Nd2O3 on In2O3 surface and porous structures occupations. The
    uniformly dispersed Nd is further authenticated via HAADF-STEM shown in Fig. S2
    which further certificates the existence of Nd2O3. Download : Download high-res

    compositions and chemical states of the samples are investigated via XPS shown
    in Fig. S3 and Fig. 5. The characteristic peaks concerning In, O, and C background
    can be observed in the full XPS survey spectra. Nd signals in INd1, INd5, INd10
    and INd20 are also observed (Fig. S3). According to In 3d spectra in Fig. 5a1-a5,
    the characteristic peaks located at ca. 451.8 eV and ca. 444.4 eV respectively
    correspond to In 3d3/2 and In 3d5/2 for In3+ [44]. Additionally, diffraction peaks
    at ca. 451.3 eV and ca. 443.8 eV are assigned to In 3d3/2 and In 3d5/2 of In0–2+,
    which demonstrates that structural defects lead to electronic vacancies of In3+
    to form In0–2+ [45], [46]. As depicted in Table. S1, no obvious shifting of In
    3d peaks can be observed after Nd2O3 loading, which validly proves that Nd2O3
    additions do not affect binding energies of In. The spin-orbit peaks in O 1 s
    spectra in Fig. 5b1-b5 located at ca. 529.4 eV, 531.0 eV and 532.3 eV are respectively
    assigned to lattice oxygen (OL), oxygen vacancy (OV) and chemisorbed oxygen (OC)
    [1]. High OV proportions of all the samples can be readily observed. It is noteworthy
    that the area percentage of OC sharply decreases with the introduction of Nd2O3.
    Table 1 detailly records the percentage of oxygen species for all the samples.
    Clearly as can be discovered, the proportions of chemisorbed oxygen decrease from
    10.04% for INd0 to merely 2.26% for INd20. From the perspective of surficial hydroxyl
    bonding under high humid conditions, water molecules tend to combine with chemisorbed
    oxygen to form hydroxyl groups and occupy the active adsorption sites of sensing
    materials [47]. The active adsorption sites with hydroxyl affinities are largely
    inhibited which is much profitable for refraining the formation of surface hydroxyls.
    Furthermore, in Nd 3d spectra shown in Fig. 5c1-c5, several characteristic peaks
    are allocated to Nd3+, the corresponding satellite peaks of Nd3+ and the auger
    electron characteristic peak of oxygen [48]. For INd0, no diffraction signals
    belonging to Nd 3d3/2 and Nd 3d5/2 of Nd3+. With higher Nd2O3 concentrations,
    the intensity of characteristic peaks relating to Nd3+ gradually strengthens as
    well. Download : Download high-res image (689KB) Download : Download full-size

    The calculated surface area of INd0 and INd20 are respectively 23.92 m2g−1 and
    22.97 m2g−1. Two kinds of pores centered at ca. 9 nm and 25 nm of INd0 appear
    while the mesopores of ca. 25 nm decrease attributing to mesopores occupation
    by Nd2O3 for INd20. The slightly reduced surface area and porosity prove that
    Nd2O3 loading will not impede the adsorption and diffusion processes of target
    gases. Additionally, as displayed in Fig. S5, the calculated band gap of materials
    gradually decreases after Nd2O3 loading (3.15 eV for INd0 to 3.00 eV for INd20),
    which is as well conducive to electron transmissions and promoting gas sensing
    performances [50]. 3.2. Gas-sensing characteristics Sensing properties of INd0,
    INd1, INd5, INd10 and INd20 sensors to 10 ppm H2S at 300 ℃ are shown in Fig. 6a-e.
    All the sensors perform typical n-type semiconductor behaviors, that is, the resistance
    of sensors sharply decreases when exposed to H2S. The baseline resistances of
    sensors gradually increase from INd0 to INd20, which is caused by the establishment
    of heterojunction between Nd2O3 and In2O3 and the enlargement of potential barriers
    [47]. With higher Nd2O3 additions, INd30 sensor exhibited further increased baseline
    resistance while the pristine Nd2O3 sensor showed the largest one (Fig. S6). As
    the current-voltage curves of all the samples displayed in Fig. S7, the resistance
    of samples gradually increase with the addition of Nd2O3 composites and the pristine
    Nd2O3 exhibits the highest value, which is consistent with the gas-sensing testing
    results. Considering the humidity interference, for the INd0 sensor in Fig. 6a,
    the baseline resistance significantly reduces and the sensor perform disparate
    sensing behaviors with the increment of relative humidity from 30% to 80% RH.
    For INd1, INd5, INd10 and INd20 sensors, the slightly reduced baseline resistances
    and similar H2S sensing characteristics in variable humidity conditions indicate
    that the combination of Nd2O3 can promote the moisture resistance of In2O3. With
    higher Nd2O3 additions, for INd30 and Nd2O3, the obviously decreased resistances
    under high humidity indicate that excessive Nd2O3 loading amounts are disadvantageous
    for stabilizing baseline resistance under variable humid conditions (Fig. S8a1-a2).
    Moreover, for INd20 sensor, almost no resistance changes both in air and in H2S
    atmospheres testifies the superior anti-humidity properties of it. Download :

    sensors toward 10 ppm H2S at 300 ℃ under 30%, 55%, 80% RH, respectively. To explicitly
    evaluate the effect of humidity conditions on H2S sensing behaviors of the fabricated
    sensors, the baseline resistance of the sensors under 30%, 55% and 80% RH and
    the calculated ratios of the sensor’s resistances (RRH/R30%) under different humidity
    conditions are detailly recorded in Fig. 7. The ratio of RRH/R30% near to 1 represents
    the excellent humidity tolerance of sensors. The ratios lower than 1 demonstrate
    the downward trend of the sensor resistances poisoned by moisture. According to
    the literature, water molecules can combine with chemisorbed oxygen to form surface
    hydroxyl species, occupying the adsorption sites for target gases and releasing
    extra free electrons to the conduction band of the materials thus causing the
    decreased resistance for n-type semiconductors including In2O3 as the following
    reaction occurs:[51]. (1) Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    respectively stand for the resistance under any relative humidity and 30% RH).
    As the recorded resistance changes under various temperatures and relative humidity
    conditions in Fig. 7, with the ascent of relative humidity, the resistance of
    the INd0 sensor exhibits an obviously descending trend in a wide operating temperature
    range (100–300 ℃). It is reported that elevating the operating temperatures can
    partially suppress the water poisoning on MOS but a certain amount of surface
    hydroxyls exists even at a temperature beyond of 500 °C [53]. Moreover, INd0 sensor
    exhibits relatively low R55%/R30% and R80%/R30% indexes of 0.58 and 0.37 at 300 ℃,
    which undoubtedly obstructs the real-time monitoring of H2S in mutable humid atmospheres.
    For Nd2O3-loaded In2O3, more significantly deteriorating tendencies of the R80%/R30%
    values can be observed at low temperatures. The R80%/R30% value of INd1, INd5,
    INd10 and INd20 sensors are respectively 0.33, 0.47, 0.10 and 0.28 at 100 ℃ even
    lower than that of INd0 sensor, which performs stronger humidity dependences.
    While at higher temperatures of 300 ℃, the resistance values under high humidity
    perform more stable (0.80 for INd1, 0.73 for INd5, 0.76 for INd10 and 0.96 for
    INd20 of R80%/R30% values) and the calculated R80%/R30% values of INd30 and Nd2O3
    at 300 ℃ are respectively 0.42 and 0.29 (Fig. S8b1-b2). Among them, INd20 sensor
    performs negligible resistance changes at high temperatures, sufficiently demonstrating
    that Nd2O3 is advantageous of stabilizing baseline resistance of sensors. Similarly,
    as we realized, response values of all the fabricated sensors towards 10 ppm H2S
    at various operating temperatures and relative humidity conditions exhibit analogous
    tendencies, that is, the sensors exhibit inferior H2S sensitivities at low working
    temperatures and a much more stable response values at higher temperatures when
    exposed to humid atmospheres as displayed in Fig. 8 and Fig. S9. S80%/S30% ratios
    for INd0 at 100 ℃ and 300 ℃ are respectively 0.06 and 0.56 (Fig. 8a1-a2) while
    the ratios for INd20 are respectively 0.05 and 0.96 (Fig. 8e1-e2). Under high
    atmospheric humidity, the deposited H2O molecules on MOS obstruct the charge transportation
    and inhibit the gas-sensing performance [52]. There is no doubt that the humidity
    tolerance of In2O3-based sensors can be optimized with promoted operating temperatures.
    Nevertheless, H2S sensitivity of pristine In2O3 under humid conditions is still
    largely disturbed even at higher temperature. In addition, chemisorbed H2S molecules
    are difficult to desorb from the In2O3 surface at low temperatures due to their
    strong reducibility, while the desorption process achieves at 300 ℃ with abundant
    thermal energies (Fig. S10). In light of all the gas-sensing characteristics including
    sensitivity, responding/recovering speed as measured in Fig. S11 and humidity-independent
    properties, INd20 based sensor operated at 300 ℃ is capable of detecting H2S with
    high response, fast responding/recovering speed and especially the excellent anti-humidity
    characteristics. Download : Download high-res image (362KB) Download : Download

    The selectivity of INd0 and INd20 sensors under 30% and 80% RH were further investigated
    under 100 ℃ and 300 ℃ in Fig. 9 and Fig. S12. Several biomarkers (including CH4,
    CO, CO2, NH3, NO2 and SO2) aiming at various early diseases diagnoses are selected
    to investigate the selectivity. When applied at 100 ℃ (Fig. 9a-d), for both INd0
    and INd20 sensors, the responses towards 10 ppm H2S exhibit high values of 636.4
    and 523.7, which are quite higher than the sensitivities towards other interfering
    gases (Fig. 9a, c). However, the sensitivities significantly deteriorate under
    80% RH (Fig. 9b, d). At 300 ℃ (Fig. 9e-h), INd20 sensor exhibits virtually identical
    sensitivities toward H2S under 30% and 80% RH by contrast with INd0 sensor. Additionally.
    as displayed in Fig. S12, the pristine Nd2O3 exhibits almost no response towards
    these target gases under 30% RH and 80% RH at 300 ℃, indicating that In2O3 provides
    the dominant H2S adsorption and reaction sites instead of Nd2O3. The outperformed
    H2S selectivity of INd20 sensor ensures the accurate real-time diagnosis in ignorance
    of various interfering gases and humidity interferences. Download : Download high-res

    resistance changing curves of INd0 and INd20 sensors towards various concentration
    of H2S at 300 ℃ under 30% and 80% RH. As can be clearly discovered, the baseline
    resistance and response of INd0 sensor distinctly decreases under high humidity
    conditions, while INd20 sensor exhibits humidity-independent baseline resistances
    and response values. Fig. 10c-d further shows the response-concentration curves
    of INd0 and INd20 sensors towards H2S of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 20 ppm at 300 ℃
    under 30% and 80% RH. Obviously, INd20 sensor exhibits a minor diversity between
    the response fitting curves under 30% and 80% RH. The detection limit of the INd20
    sensor under high humid conditions (80% RH) is recorded to be 100 ppb with a response
    value of 1.37, which effectively proves that INd20 sensor can reliably detect
    H2S in a wide range of 0.1–20 ppm with superior humidity-independent characteristics.

    work 3.3. Gas-sensing mechanism Fig. 11 demonstrates H2S sensing and H2O interactions
    mechanisms of Nd2O3/In2O3 composites. For n-type MOS, when exposed in air, oxygen
    molecules can spontaneously capture free electrons from the conduction band of
    materials thus an electron depletion layer forms with the generations of abundant
    chemisorbed oxygen and the enlarged resistance [61]. The type of chemisorbed oxygen
    is dominantly determined by the operating temperature for MOS ( , O- and O2-)
    [62]. Reducing gases will react with chemisorbed oxygen and release free electrons
    back to the conduction band. However, water molecules seriously interfere with
    sensing performances of the MOS. As stated, there are two major ways of interactions
    between water molecules and MOS. At relative low temperatures, water molecules
    mainly adsorb on the MOS surface through weak physical adsorptions (i.e. hydrogen
    bonds) due to insufficient thermal energies [63]. While at higher temperature,
    water molecules can compete with other reducing gases, react with chemisorbed
    oxygen, produce surface hydroxyls, and greatly occupy the adsorption sites of
    reducing gases, thereby reducing the baseline resistance and sensitivities of
    the sensor toward target gases as follows:[50]. (2) (3) Download : Download high-res
    image (160KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Schematic illustrations
    for H2S sensing and anti-humidity mechanisms. For the pristine In2O3, the reduced
    baseline resistances and H2S sensitivities in a wide temperature range (100–300 ℃)
    under higher humidity conditions demonstrate the deteriorated sensing behaviors
    of the sensor to H2S and the strong interferences of water molecules. However,
    Nd2O3-loaded In2O3 porous nanorods perform disparate H2S sensing properties at
    various operating temperatures. The interaction mode of Nd2O3 composites and water
    molecules significantly change at different temperatures. At low operating temperatures,
    Nd2O3-loaded In2O3-based sensors exhibit an enhanced humidity dependence which
    is probably attributed to the strong hygroscopicity of Nd2O3 [64]. The strong
    H2O affinity of Nd2O3 will promote the interactions between water molecules and
    Nd2O3-In2O3 composites, inducing the coverage of adsorption sites with water molecular
    membrane at low operating temperature (Fig. S13). At high temperature of 300 ℃,
    the almost invariant baseline resistance (R80%/R30% = 0.96) and H2S sensitivity
    (S80%/S30% = 0.93) prove that Nd2O3 is conducive to suppress the humidity-dependence
    of In2O3 based sensors. For the humidity influence mechanism of Nd2O3, it mainly
    attributes in two aspects of inhibiting the generation of chemisorbed oxygen and
    protecting H2S adsorption sites of In2O3 from being occupied by surface hydroxyl
    groups. From the perspective of restraining chemisorbed oxygen, according to XPS
    O 1 s spectra in Fig. 5b, the percentage of chemisorbed oxygen amount significantly
    declines with the increments of Nd2O3 (only 2.26% for INd20 sample). The decrease
    of chemisorbed oxygen effectively decreases the reactive sites for chemisorbed
    water molecules while responses to H2S do not exhibit a downward tendency. In
    H2S sensing reactions, as is widely acknowledged, H2S molecules can react with
    the chemisorbed oxygen and generate SO2 and H2O molecules [65]. Considering its
    strong reducibility, H2S is also capable of directly reacting with lattice oxygens
    of In2O3 and inducing In2S3 and H2O as the following formulas recorded:[66], [67],
    [68]. (4) (5) Therefore, In2O3-based materials can react with H2S in our work
    although chemisorbed oxygen contents stand in a quite low index. More importantly,
    the decline of chemisorbed oxygen will greatly downscale the chemisorption of
    H2O and the formation of surface hydroxyls, which is very beneficial to eliminate
    humidity interference on gas sensors. On the other hand, due to the strong hygroscopicity
    of Nd2O3, it will preferentially adsorb surface hydroxyl groups on the surface
    to avoid their bonding to In2O3 and further protect the gas sensing reaction sites.
    To confirm the existence of surface hydroxyls on Nd2O3-In2O3 composites, in-situ
    DRIFTS measurements of INd0 and INd20 samples are carried out under variable temperature
    and humidity conditions (Fig.S14a-d). A strong band peak was observed in the region
    of 3200–3600 cm−1, which is attributing to the vibrational modes of Nd–OOH [69],
    validating the function of hydroxyl adsorptions of Nd2O3, thus protecting the
    adsorption sites on In2O3. Based on above discussions, it is reasonable that Nd2O3
    is much instrumental in improving the humidity-independence of In2O3. The Nd2O3-In2O3
    composites can be applied for real-time H2S monitoring in disease surveillance
    and many other fields. 4. Conclusion Humidity-independent H2S sensors are designed
    based on Nd2O3-loaded porous In2O3 nanorods synthesized via a simple method of
    chemical impregnation. The composites of Nd2O3 prominently inhibit the humidity
    dependence both of the baseline resistance and H2S sensitivity. Among all the
    gas sensors, INd20 sensor exhibits resemble H2S sensing characteristics in a wide
    humidity range (30–80% RH) as well as a low detection limit (100 ppb) and splendid
    selectivity towards H2S. The mechanisms for the improvement of anti-humidity properties
    of Nd2O3-In2O3 are discussed via XPS and in-situ DRIFTS measurements. The humidity-independent
    characteristics are mostly ascribed to the inhibiting of chemisorbed oxygen on
    the surface of In2O3 and the absorbance of surface hydroxyls of Nd2O3 to scavenge
    the adsorption sites of In2O3. The high humidity dependence of the INd20 sensor
    at low temperatures proves high hygroscopicity of Nd2O3 and diverse interaction
    modes between water molecules and MOS. Nd2O3 is promising novel modifiers for
    designing humidity-independent MOS sensors with excellent sensitivity and selectivity.
    The humidity-independent H2S sensing characters of Nd2O3-In2O3 provide a prospective
    candidate for real-time disease diagnoses. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: In Germany, modern digital technologies like Internet of Things (IoT)
    have been increasingly promoted for better environmental and natural resources
    management through “smart” monitoring and real-time data. However, adopting such
    advanced technologies is complex and brings a wide array of risks and challenges,
    and it remains unclear whether local actors are in fact willing and sufficiently
    equipped to adopt them. Using the Motivations and Abilities (MOTA) framework,
    and quantitative data collection and analysis methods, this study explores the
    motivations and abilities of German local (governmental) actors by focusing on
    the adoption of IoT-based forest and water monitoring systems. The findings reveal
    an early-stage adoption of IoT environmental monitoring, with limited awareness
    and no plans for adoption. The lack of willingness, however, is not attributed
    to a lack of motivation; it is, rather, influenced by perceived insufficient financial
    and technical capacities and resources. This study provides novel insights for
    understanding the complex relationship between actors’ behavior and the adoption
    of advanced digital technologies in the realm of environmental and natural resources
    management. The results provide a robust foundation for future research, and inform
    policy and practice aimed at facilitating digitalized natural resources management.

    Abstract In Germany, modern digital technologies like Internet of Things (IoT)
    have been increasingly promoted for better environmental and natural resources
    management through “smart” monitoring and real-time data. However, adopting such
    advanced technologies is complex and brings a wide array of risks and challenges,
    and it remains unclear whether local actors are in fact willing and sufficiently
    equipped to adopt them. Using the Motivations and Abilities (MOTA) framework,
    and quantitative data collection and analysis methods, this study explores the
    motivations and abilities of German local (governmental) actors by focusing on
    the adoption of IoT-based forest and water monitoring systems. The findings reveal
    an early-stage adoption of IoT environmental monitoring, with limited awareness
    and no plans for adoption. The lack of willingness, however, is not attributed
    to a lack of motivation; it is, rather, influenced by perceived insufficient financial
    and technical capacities and resources. This study provides novel insights for
    understanding the complex relationship between actors’ behavior and the adoption
    of advanced digital technologies in the realm of environmental and natural resources
    management. The results provide a robust foundation for future research, and inform
    policy and practice aimed at facilitating digitalized natural resources management.

    1. Introduction The sustainable management and conservation of natural resources—encompassing
    forests, land, soils, water, energy, and biodiversity—is high on the political
    agenda for both the European Union (EU) and Germany alike [1]. Accurate and timely
    information on the state and condition of natural resources is essential for tracking
    changes, evaluating the progress and effectiveness of natural resources policies,
    and guiding adaptive management strategies. In Germany, with the advances in the
    Internet of Things (IoT) and the development of modern sensors, considerable effort
    and resources have been invested in the past years to expand and improve data
    collection and analysis on the state and condition of natural resources. Numerous
    companies, start-ups, research institutes, and initiatives have emerged developing
    various IoT-based environmental monitoring systems as a promise of more effective
    and efficient protection measures [2]. The IoT monitoring, also known as “smart”
    or “intelligent” technology, is based on the use of wireless sensor networks,
    which are relatively affordable and allow the remote and real-time measurement
    of multiple environmental parameters (e.g., humidity, water levels, leaks, temperature,
    and other physical properties) with minimal human intervention [3,4,5]. Smart,
    connected devices with embedded communication modules can then process this information
    using computing technology and quickly send the data to the cloud or a data center
    for further actions or analyses. This enables managers, decision-makers, and scientists
    to monitor changes on the state and condition of natural resources in real time
    and more precisely, with an optimal control of pollution and other undesirable
    effects [6]. IoT environmental monitoring, thereby, facilitates proactive and
    faster responses to natural disasters and pollution threats, enables the development
    of more efficient and sustainable policies and management strategies, and fosters
    collaboration to address numerous environmental challenges [7,8]. However, the
    adoption of modern digital technologies (such as the IoT environmental monitoring
    systems) by local (government) actors in Germany is not always feasible, as revealed
    by recent studies in the field of digital transformation [9,10,11]. It is a part
    of a complex digital transformation process [10,12] which is often confronted
    with different obstacles, such as regulations, infrastructural limitations, technological
    and usability constraints (i.e., lack of qualified staff and know-how), as well
    as financial constraints. Additional bottlenecks are due to weak leadership and
    management skills regarding reform implementation, change management, and process
    re-engineering [9,10]. In the field of natural resources management and the environment,
    a growing number of publications reveal similar constraints and challenges in
    the adoption of new digital technologies [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. For example, a recent
    report from the German Environment Agency [13] revealed that major risks and challenges
    in digitizing natural resources management might encompass concerns that relate
    mainly to digital infrastructure and security, data governance and compliance,
    data standardization and integration, knowledge and technical expertise, as well
    as potential environmental and societal impacts. Similar (potential) risks and
    challenges have been revealed in the field of water management [13,14,15], nature
    conservation [14], as well as forest management [15,16], land management, and
    agriculture [17,18]. The wide array of (potential) hurdles and challenges leads
    to the question of whether local actors are in fact willing and sufficiently equipped
    to adopt new digital tools in the field of natural resources management. Yet,
    still little is known about the motivations and abilities of German local actors
    to adopt advanced digital tools, particularly in the field of natural resources
    management and IoT environmental monitoring. To date, most recent studies proceed
    from a technoengineering perspective and focus on the technical aspects of advanced
    digital tools and their potential for increasing information capabilities. For
    example, Liesch et al. (2020) developed a comprehensive system that combined IoT
    and AI processes with methods from environmental informatics and the water domain
    in particular to monitor groundwater pollution [19]. Similarly, Kenebel et al.
    (2022) designed and tested a bark beetle early-warning system with modern sensors
    and AI-based data analysis [20], while Bolte et al. (2021) examined the potential
    of IoT in national forest monitoring [21], and Heller and Teschenmacher (2018)
    investigated whether IoT technology lived up to its promise by implementing the
    technologies in a practical case of hydrological research for direct flow measurements
    [22]. While these studies have made notable strides from a technological and engineering
    perspective, predominantly focusing on the technical intricacies of advanced digital
    tools and their potential to enhance information capabilities, a significant research
    gap persists in comprehending the motivations and abilities of local actors. The
    main objective of this empirical study is to fill in the research gap. By applying
    a social science perspective, we aim to explore the motivations and abilities
    of German local actors to adopt IoT environmental systems in the field of natural
    resources management. More specifically, we focus on the adoption and use of IoT
    systems for monitoring the state and conditions of forest and water resources.
    The selection of forest and water monitoring as our empirical focus was determined
    by the practicality and feasibility for data collection within a broader research
    project on forest and water management in Germany (see Section 2.2), along with
    heuristic considerations. In particular, the latter played an important role,
    as our study aims to provide initial insights and develop further research ideas
    rather than definitive conclusions and generalizations about the findings. Theoretically,
    by employing the Motivation and Ability (MOTA) framework [23], we investigate
    actors’ motivations and abilities and identify their correlations (influence)
    to the adoption of IoT environmental monitoring systems. Empirically, we focus
    on the motivations and abilities of mainly local governmental actors (public authorities
    and organizations) involved in forest and water management and/or monitoring activities
    (see Section 2.2). For this, we leverage quantitative data collection and analysis
    methods. Through this investigation, our study does not only enhance the understanding
    of the motivations and abilities of local actors to adopt and utilize IoT environmental
    monitoring systems, it also sheds light on the complex interplay between technology
    adoption and actors’ behavior, paves the way for future research, and assists
    decision-makers and other relevant actors in setting the interventions and actions
    necessary to address technological adoption challenges. We proceed as follows:
    Section 2 presents the conceptual and methodological considerations, including
    the MOTA framework and its elements, data collection, and analysis methods. The
    empirical results are presented in Section 3. Finally, the discussion is presented
    in Section 4. 2. Conceptual and Methodological Considerations There are many social
    science theories that set out to explain technology adoption. However, most models,
    with few exceptions, make use of predictors that are exclusively cognitive, relating
    the adoption of a new technology to actors’ attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions,
    and do not sufficiently consider external variables, such as their abilities,
    resources, and capacities [24]. In the pursuit of a more holistic approach, we
    opted to apply the Motivations and Abilities (MOTA) framework [23], which, despite
    its recent development, has so far proven to render successful results in exploring
    the motivations and abilities of actors [25]. Although it has been mainly developed
    and applied in the context of water resources management to assess the adoption
    of projects, policies, and plans, we recognize and explore its potential applicability
    in the context of technology adoption and environmental monitoring. This would
    provide an opportunity to identify its adaptability and limitations, and thus
    contribute to its further development. The MOTA framework and its elements are
    presented in the sections below, as well as the corresponding data collection
    and analysis methods. 2.1. Motivations and Abilities (MOTA) Framework Rooted in
    social science, the MOTA framework [23] interlinks existing actor analysis methods
    and behavioral models to provide a structure for exploring behavioral action,
    which happens when motivations, abilities, and triggers act together [25]. In
    other words, what actors do (e.g., adopting IoT) is based on their perception
    of some causative factor (trigger), their preference and level of commitment (motivation),
    and their capacity to act in a given manner (ability) [26]. In this realm, there
    are several distinctive elements in the MOTA framework, namely: action, trigger,
    motivation, ability, and outcome. The action is defined as the target behavior
    of actors regarding a specific project or plan. In our study, the action refers
    to the adoption of IoT environmental monitoring systems by relevant local actors
    (see Section 2.2). Adoption is here understood as the planning/development stage
    and use of IoT environmental monitoring systems. The outcome is the visible result
    of an action, which happens when motivation and ability act together. In our study,
    the outcome relates to digitalized natural resources management; yet, it falls
    beyond the scope of this study and is not considered in the analysis. In the sections
    below, we operationalize the MOTA elements relevant to our analysis in the context
    of technology adoption, i.e., motivations, abilities, and triggers, and summarize
    them in Figure 1. Figure 1. MOTA framework for adoption of IoT environmental monitoring
    (adapted from Sadik et al., 2021) [26]. 2.1.1. Motivation Motivation refers to
    the factors that drive an actor to engage in a particular action, i.e., the adoption
    of IoT monitoring systems. Following Phi et al. (2015) [23], we define motivation
    as the function of perceived opportunities (“benefits”) and threats (“challenges”).
    By reviewing the academic literature on the advantages and challenges of the digitalization
    and adoption of advanced digital tools, not only within the field of natural resources
    management but also in broader contexts, both within Germany and globally, we
    identified a list of opportunities and threats that could potentially increase
    or undermine the motivation of German local actors to adopt IoT monitoring systems.
    The most prominent opportunities encompass enhanced risk assessment and the early
    detection of natural disasters [13,27,28,29], and improved decision support and
    strategy development [14,30]. IoT technologies have also been advocated to facilitate
    access to real-time information, and hence public participation, as well as information
    exchange and cooperation among local actors [7]. IoT systems contribute to enhanced
    transparency, legitimacy, and trust of local public authorities [31,32]. Yet,
    the adoption of IoT has been related to various challenges and risks as well.
    So far, data security and privacy are outlined as one of the biggest challenges
    to the adoption of modern digital tools, both within natural resources management
    and beyond [14,28,31,32,33,34]. Furthermore, increased information exchange and
    accessibility increases the risk of data misuse and misinterpretation [32,35],
    potentially leading to false environmental assessments and conflicts among stakeholders
    [36]. Concerns also arise over the loss of legitimation and public trust, as real-time
    data may reveal the underperformance of actors involved in natural resources management
    [37,38]. The adoption of IoT systems may also trigger organizational changes,
    from job eliminations to modified work routines [7,32]. 2.1.2. Abilities While
    actors’ motivations shape what they are willing and interested to do, their abilities
    determine if they can do it [23]. In the MOTA framework, abilities are defined
    as the financial, institutional and technical skills, resources, and capacities
    of the actors. Following these three categories, and by reviewing the relevant
    literature, we identified six major categories of abilities that are relevant
    for local actors to effectively adopt modern digital tools. Financial and technical
    resources is key for local actors adopting new technologies, as their adoption
    often involves significant initial investments in infrastructure, skilled staff,
    training, and ongoing maintenance [7,9,29]. Technical know-how and knowledge of
    digital benefits are also crucial assets [9,15,29,32]. Robust digital data strategies
    and regulations form the basis for successful digital transformation [12]. Collaborative
    public–private partnerships, political support, and local networks also play pivotal
    roles in IoT adoption [9,39]. Moreover, the general actors´ attitudes toward digital
    technologies matter, as integrating modern digital tools can lead to concerns
    about job security and resistance from employees [9,10,13,32]. 2.1.3. Triggers
    In the MOTA framework, triggers are defined as events or external circumstances
    that can influence the perceived opportunities, but also the abilities of actors
    to adopt a certain plan or project. Triggers can be thought of as “prompts” that
    initiate a particular action. Since a trigger is a causative factor, the influence
    of a trigger would depend on the intensity of the trigger [40]. The triggers in
    our study refer to environmental risks and natural hazards, such as floods, droughts,
    forest fires, soil erosion, water pollution, pests and diseases, etc. Very often,
    these risks can serve as catalysts, prompting local actors to adopt IoT monitoring
    systems to enhance their capacity to respond to and mitigate these environmental
    issues more effectively. 2.1.4. Research Questions Based on the above, the following
    empirical research questions emerge: (1) How do environmental risks serve as triggers
    for adopting IoT monitoring systems? (2) How do perceived opportunities and threats
    influence the adoption of IoT environmental monitoring systems? (3) How do actors’
    perceived abilities (financial, technical, and institutional) influence the adoption
    process? 2.2. Data Collection We utilized quantitative data collection, which
    is an effective tool in exploratory research to gain preliminary insights and
    provide the foundation for further research [41]. Empirical data on the motivations
    and abilities of German local actors were collected through an online survey,
    which was conducted between February and March 2022 as a part of a large-scale
    survey within the framework of a research project. The MOTA part of the survey
    comprised of five sections including background information on IoT monitoring
    and questions about triggers, motivations, and abilities. The metrics used for
    each question followed the MOTA guidelines for assessing the triggers, motivations,
    and abilities of actors [42]. First, to ensure data validity, respondents rated
    their awareness of IoT forest and water monitoring systems on a Likert scale ranging
    from 1 (good) to 5 (never heard). The purpose of this metric was to quantify respondents’
    awareness of IoT forest and water monitoring systems, and it was measured through
    Likert scale responses that provided a structured and numerical representation
    of their awareness levels. Next, we explored whether forest- and water-related
    risks triggered the adoption of IoT monitoring systems. Respondents were asked
    to indicate if their organizations were planning or already using IoT monitoring
    for risks such as floods, water shortages, water quality, forest fires, insects/fungal
    decay, storms, forest drought, and soil erosion. The purpose of this question
    was to assess the relationship between specific environmental risks (forest- and
    water-related) and the adoption of IoT monitoring systems. Following the MOTA
    framework, the metric aimed to understand if these risks act as triggers for organizations
    to either plan or already use IoT monitoring systems. To gain insights into the
    motivations of relevant actors, we asked the respondents to evaluate potential
    opportunities and threats related to IoT technologies, as described in Section
    2.1.1. They used a four-point Likert scale to express their agreement or disagreement
    with five statements about IoT monitoring opportunities and five statements about
    potential threats. At last, following the MOTA guidelines and to yield insights
    into actors’ abilities, we asked the respondents to rate their abilities to adopt
    IoT monitoring, covering institutional, financial, and technical aspects (see
    Section 2.3) on a scale from 1 (low) to 3 (high). While primarily quantitative,
    our survey also allowed respondents to supplement their Likert-type answers with
    comments. This gave them the chance to elaborate, provide examples, and express
    their perspectives openly. The survey questions were developed in German and underwent
    a pilot test with field experts. The feedback on question wording and clarity
    was invaluable in identifying and rectifying any potential issues related to understanding
    and ambiguity. We distributed the survey to a wide range of relevant actors across
    all 401 administrative districts in Germany. These included mainly public authorities
    and organizations involved in forest and water management and/or monitoring activities,
    such as: (1) state administrations for forest, water, or environmental/nature
    conservation, (2) local water management authorities, and (3) research organizations.
    Yet, we also included forest owners and service providers who also conduct monitoring
    activities to improve their forest management practices. We did not include, however,
    environmental NGOs, as they are not as involved in monitoring activities, as they
    are in other aspects of forest and water management, such as advocacy and conservation
    efforts [43]. Although we considered actors from two different sectors, conducting
    a comparative analysis is beyond the scope of this study. Such a comparison, however,
    could be a valuable avenue for future research. We informed the participants that
    survey participation was voluntary, and assured their anonymity and confidentiality.
    As part of the large-scale survey, we received a total of 154 responses, with
    the majority coming from the forest sector (86/154), followed by environmental/nature
    conservation (38/154), and water management (23/154). These respondents represented
    one or more of the actor groups outlined in Table 1. Yet, it may appear that the
    sum of responses across actor groups in Table 1 exceeds the total number of 154
    responses. This is due to the nature of the survey design, allowing participants
    to associate themselves with multiple actor groups. Consequently, some responses
    are counted in more than one category, contributing to the individual counts within
    each group while maintaining the consistent total response number of 154. Table
    1. Actor groups and number of responses. Among the 154 respondents, a significant
    portion (43%, 67/154) reported they were unaware of IoT monitoring systems, and
    thus did not complete the related survey questions. The lack of awareness varied
    across the different actor groups, with 27 responses from water management authorities,
    20 responses from forest owners and service providers, 7 responses from the state
    administration, 2 responses from research organizations, and 11 responses from
    other categories. This resulted in a reduced dataset of 87 responses and introduced
    a self-selection bias, as organizations lacking awareness of IoT chose not to
    participate. Of course, this limits the generalizability and applicability of
    our findings beyond this specific context. Nevertheless, the study retains an
    exploratory nature, which allows the utilization of small-scale data collection
    and the use of results for heuristic purposes rather than seeking broad representativeness
    or generalizability [44]. 2.3. Data Analysis In our research, we employed descriptive
    statistical analysis as an initial step to gain insights into the triggers, motivations,
    and abilities of the relevant actors. Descriptive statistical analysis is a widely
    recognized method in empirical research within social sciences, well-suited for
    simplifying and summarizing complex datasets [41]. To be more specific, we began
    by calculating the frequency distribution of the various key independent variables,
    including forest and water risks, perceived opportunities and threats, as well
    as institutional, technical, and financial abilities. The resulting frequency
    distributions are visually presented in figures (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4,
    Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7), offering a clear and structured overview of
    the prevalence and patterns associated with triggers, motivations, and abilities.
    These distributions served as a foundational step in our data analysis, assisting
    us in answering the empirical research questions. Subsequently, we conducted bivariate
    tests to explore the correlations between the independent variables and the dependent
    variable (i.e., the adoption of IoT monitoring), enabling us to obtain valuable
    insights into how motivations and abilities influence the adoption process. These
    tests were carried out using the SPSS 28.0.1 (Statistical Package for the Social
    Sciences) software program. Given that our data had ordinal and nominal scaling,
    and considering the relatively small sample size, we utilized cross-tables and
    the Chi-square test. This statistical approach allowed us to identify significant
    interrelationships between triggers, motivations, and abilities and the level
    of IoT adoption, with the significance determined by a p-value below 0.05. It
    is important to note that, while the Chi-square test assesses the relationship
    between one independent variable and the dependent variable at a time, it remains
    a valid method for exploring correlations between different variables [45]. However,
    we acknowledge that the influence of multiple independent variables may be at
    play, and these potential factors should be further investigated using multivariate
    tests to control for their effects. 3. Results 3.1. Environmental Risks as Triggers
    for Adopting IoT Monitoring Systems In Germany, the adoption of IoT forest and
    water monitoring currently seems to be in a nascent stage (Figure 2). So far,
    IoT systems have been mostly adopted (in use, development, or projected) for monitoring
    water-related risks, such floods (50 %), water shortage (42%), and water quality
    (37%). In this context, many respondents referred to specific water conditions
    or events as triggers for adopting the new technology. Examples included the 2021
    flood catastrophe, the decreasing levels of groundwater in the drought period
    2018–2020, as well as the deterioration in the water quality. Similarly, more
    than half of the respondents (34%) reported the (planned) use of IoT technology
    for detecting and forecasting forest fires due to their increased intensity and
    frequency in the period 2018–2019. Furthermore, the results showed that forest
    damage caused by insects/fungal decay (e.g., bark beetle infestations) (28 %),
    storms (23%) or forest drought, e.g., tree mortality or canopy damage (19%), have
    also prompted some authorities and organizations to adopt IoT monitoring systems.
    Yet, although soil erosion, exacerbated by climate change, poses risks to forest
    soils and water quality in Germany [46], the results showed that, currently, IoT
    technologies for monitoring soil erosion are not being adopted. In summary, although
    forest and water risks may have prompted some local actors to consider the adoption
    and use of IoT monitoring, the majority stated that their organization or authority
    had no plans to adopt them. For deeper insights, we present the findings from
    the analysis on the motivations and abilities in the sections that follow. Figure
    2. Adoption of IoT monitoring for forest and water risks, n = 87. 3.2. Perceived
    Opportunities and Threats, and Their Influence on Adoption of IoT Environmental
    Monitoring The majority of the respondents appeared to have a positive perception
    and provided mostly affirmative responses in regards to the opportunities of IoT
    monitoring. Yet, there was some variation in the level of agreement. For example,
    as shown in Figure 3, more than 70% of respondents expressed agreement regarding
    the potential of IoT to improve access to real-time information and public participation,
    with 43% fully agreeing and 31% somewhat agreeing. Similarly, a substantial portion
    of participants agreed that IoT monitoring systems, due to their connectivity
    features, facilitate information exchange and collaboration among various sectors
    and administrative levels, with 39% in full agreement and 36% somewhat in agreement.
    This trend continued with the perceived ability of IoT monitoring systems to enhance
    decision support and strategy development, where 39% fully agreed and 36% somewhat
    agreed. Many respondents also saw the promise of IoT monitoring in advancing risk
    assessment and early detection of natural hazards, like floods and forest fires,
    with 37% fully agreeing and 31% somewhat agreeing. Furthermore, it was widely
    agreed that IoT monitoring, by increasing the availability and accessibility of
    real-time information, contributes to improved transparency, trust, and legitimacy
    of local authorities, with 32% fully agreeing and 38% somewhat agreeing. Figure
    3. Perceived opportunities of IoT environmental monitoring (forests, water). In
    summary, the results indicate that, while most respondents acknowledge the benefits
    of using IoT monitoring in forest and water management, it remains unclear how
    these perceptions influence actual IoT adoption. To explore this further, we examined
    the correlation between perceived opportunities and the current adoption of IoT
    systems for forest and water monitoring (Figure 4). Our findings reveal that,
    when respondents hold a more optimistic view (i.e., they agree or somewhat agree)
    regarding the utility of IoT monitoring systems, they are more inclined to adopt
    these technologies for monitoring three or more forest and water risks. Conversely,
    in organizations and authorities where skepticism prevails (i.e., less optimistic)
    regarding the potential benefits (i.e., respondents disagree or somewhat disagree),
    IoT monitoring systems tend to be limited to one or two specific forest or water
    risks. Figure 4. Correlation between perceived opportunities and IoT adoption.
    Regarding the potential threats (Figure 5), nearly half of the respondents, accounting
    for 48%, identified data privacy and security as a substantial risk for their
    organization or authority, with 17% in complete agreement and 31% somewhat in
    agreement. Another significant risk, as perceived by approximately one-third of
    the respondents (36%), was the potential for misuse/misinterpretation of information,
    with 10% in complete agreement and 26% somewhat in agreement. Contrary to the
    widely recognized notion that fear of organizational structure change often acts
    as a significant barrier to IoT technology adoption, our study revealed that a
    majority of respondents (56%) did not view it as a major threat. In fact, 24%
    disagreed and 32% somewhat disagreed with the idea that organizational change
    posed a significant risk in our study. Similarly, the risks of increasing conflicts
    between actors (17% disagreed, 38% somewhat disagreed) and the loss of legitimation
    and trust (23% disagreed, 39% somewhat disagreed) were also not considered significant
    threats by the respondents. In the subsequent phase of our analysis, we conducted
    correlation tests to examine how perceived threats influence the adoption of IoT
    monitoring systems in the context of forest and water management. In contrast
    to the perceived opportunities, we found that perceived threats exerted minimal
    or no influence on the adoption of IoT monitoring for natural resources management.

    Perceived Abilities (Financial, Technical, and Institutional), and Their Influence
    on Adoption of IoT Environmental Monitoring The findings indicate that most respondents
    perceive their organizations to have insufficient abilities for adopting IoT monitoring
    systems (Figure 6). Specifically, more than half of the respondents perceived
    their organization’s financial capacities for implementation and operations low
    (51%), while nearly half regarded technical know-how and IT competence as low
    (38%), with a quarter rating it as average (25%). Additionally, respondents expressed
    dissatisfaction with the diversity of the professional network and the level of
    political support for adopting new technologies, as 36% considered it low and
    27% considered it average. The findings also suggest the need for more tailored
    strategies for digital transformation, as 35% of respondents evaluated the presence
    of a coherent strategy for technological innovation as low and 29% as average.
    Similarly, knowledge about IoT possibilities was deemed low by 34% of respondents,
    with 26% rating it as average. Interestingly, almost half of the survey participants
    (48%), primarily from the forest sector, assessed their authority’s general attitude
    toward advanced technologies as average (48%). Figure 6. Perceived abilities to
    adopt IoT environmental monitoring (forests, water). We also investigated the
    correlation between actors’ perceived abilities and the adoption of IoT technology
    for forest and water monitoring. The ability index was computed as an average
    of all perceived abilities (Figure 7). The results reveal that organizations and
    authorities that perceive themselves as possessing high abilities in terms of
    financial resources, technology, and infrastructure are more inclined to embrace
    IoT technology for monitoring three or more forest- and water-related risks. Conversely,
    those that perceive their abilities as weak (low, medium) tend to adopt advanced
    monitoring systems for less risks, or do not have plans to adopt new technology
    at all. It is yet worth noting that, while this finding suggests that abilities
    may play a significant role in the adoption of new technologies, our study focused
    solely on the correlation between abilities and IoT technology adoption. It did
    not explore the relative importance of abilities compared to perceived threats
    and opportunities in influencing the adoption decision, a topic that merits a
    consideration in future research. Figure 7. Correlation between perceived abilities
    and adoption of IoT monitoring. 4. Discussion 4.1. Adopting IoT Forest and Water
    Monitoring Systems in Germany—A Digital Opportunity or a Threat? This empirical
    study aimed to provide initial insights into the motivations and abilities of
    German local actors to adopt IoT environmental monitoring systems. The MOTA framework
    was used here to explore actors’ motivations and abilities, and their influence
    on the adoption of IoT forest and water monitoring systems in Germany. Although
    the overall aim of this analysis was solely explorative, and it was beyond the
    scope to make any theoretical contributions to the framework, we reflect on its
    application and offer suggestions for further improvement. The study relied on
    quantitative data collection and analysis methods, and the ensuing results are
    discussed in the sections below. The first empirical research question of the
    study focused largely on exploring environmental risks acting as triggers for
    adopting IoT forest and water monitoring systems. As the results showed, IoT systems
    have been mostly adopted for monitoring water-related risks, such as floods, water
    shortage, and water quality, but also forest fires. The fact that numerous respondents
    referred to specific recent weather conditions and events as triggers for embracing
    the new technology could be attributed to the escalating impacts of climate change
    on forest and water systems in Germany in recent years [47]. Nevertheless, although
    forest and water risks may have prompted some local actors to consider the adoption
    and use of IoT monitoring, the analysis showed that the adoption of IoT monitoring
    for forest and water is still at a nascent stage, with many still even unaware
    of the emerging technologies. This is surprising considering the rapid development
    of IoT environmental systems and federal policy developments such as the Digital
    Agenda for the Environment [2]. While organizations may require more time and
    adaptability to stay current with new technologies [48], we argue that understanding
    the lack of awareness across different sectors and actor groups requires further
    research. In this realm, exploring the role of individual characteristics, like
    educational background, age, or gender [49], could provide valuable insights.
    Furthermore, understanding the influence of cultural and historical contexts might
    also shed light and explain the lack of awareness. For example, Germany’s rich
    history in water and forest management, coupled with substantial expertise and
    infrastructure for risk evaluation, underscores the importance of historical context
    [50]. Established monitoring practices, proven over decades or even centuries,
    maintain a central role in natural resource management, deeply ingrained in institutional
    memory and practices. This reliance on traditional methods may lead authorities
    and organizations to overlook or remain “blind” to novel and innovative tools
    and approaches [51]. The second question of the study centered upon perceived
    opportunities and threats, and their correlation to the adoption of IoT environmental
    monitoring. Although many respondents declared no plans to adopt new monitoring
    systems, the lack of intention does not appear to stem from a lack of motivation.
    As indicated by the findings, a significant proportion of the respondents clearly
    acknowledge the numerous advantages offered by IoT monitoring systems. This suggests
    that IoT monitoring systems are generally regarded as a valuable opportunity for
    forest and water management and policy. Moreover, a more favorable perception
    of the effectiveness of IoT monitoring systems correlates with an increased propensity
    to adopt these technologies. Conversely, in instances where skepticism about potential
    benefits dominates, the adoption of IoT monitoring systems tends to be confined.
    Aligned with previous research [52], this underscores the connection between positive
    perceptions of effectiveness and the extent of technology adoption. Conversely,
    although major concerns such as data privacy, security, and misuse have been largely
    acknowledged, the analysis revealed that perceived threats or risks do not influence
    the willingness of actors to adopt IoT technology. This contradicts the prevailing
    consensus among most studies and scholars in the field, which often argue that
    perceived threats and risks can act as major impediments to the adoption of IoT
    technology [32,53]. In this context, it becomes imperative to critically examine
    how such concerns are being framed and whether they reflect genuine risks or are
    used strategically to resist technological change, as our study did not reveal
    a correlation between perceived threats and IoT adoption. Considering that the
    lack of intention to adopt new IoT monitoring systems is not rooted in the lack
    of motivation, we can infer that the major factors contributing to this lack of
    intention are actors´ abilities. The third empirical question focused on exploring
    perceived institutional, financial, and technical abilities, and their relationship
    to the adoption of IoT environmental monitoring. As the results clearly demonstrate,
    financial and technical capacities and resources were viewed as insufficient for
    effectively adopting IoT monitoring technologies. In fact, this aligns with previous
    research on digital transformation in Germany, revealing that a lack of technical
    competence and funding are among the major barriers hampering the adoption of
    new digital technologies at the local level [9,10]. The results also revealed
    that the willingness to adopt IoT technology for monitoring various forest and
    water risks is closely linked to the perceived level of resources and capabilities
    within the organizations and authorities. Organizations with a positive perception
    of their financial, technological, and infrastructural capacities are more inclined
    to embrace IoT solutions. On the other hand, those who perceive their abilities
    as inadequate are less likely to consider adopting this technology. The results
    highlight the importance of organizational readiness and resources in shaping
    the adoption decisions of IoT technology for environmental monitoring in the context
    of forest and water management. This, however, gives rise to a number of critical
    questions about the political and normative dimension in which technology adoption
    is embedded. For instance, it would be interesting to explore how new digital
    technologies gain political support and legitimacy at the local level, and who
    determines, and how, whether there will be any funding available for the adoption
    of new digital solutions, particularly in public authorities. In this context,
    an exploration of the political and strategic interests that may advocate for
    or against specific digital technologies also becomes essential [54,55]. 4.2.
    Methodological Reflection and Limitations This study provides valuable initial
    insights into the complex interplay between actors’ behavior and technology adoption,
    particularly in the context of emerging new monitoring technologies and natural
    resources management. Its findings provide guidance for decision-makers and practitioners
    aiming to leverage IoT monitoring for the more efficient sustainable management
    of natural resources, and lay a robust foundation for further scholarly inquiry
    and discussions. In this regard, the MOTA framework, although mainly developed
    and used in the context of water resources management and policy, proved useful
    and applicable as a heuristic research tool for scrutinizing actors´ motivations
    and abilities, and investigating their correlation to technology adoption. However,
    as already discussed in a recent study [56], there is a notable gap in the MOTA
    framework regarding its treatment of the institutional dimension. The MOTA framework
    presently lacks the specific and precise concepts and relationships necessary
    for a comprehensive integration of the institutional dimension, which can be delineated
    as a distinct category influencing not only actors'' perceptions, but also their
    capabilities [57]. Furthermore, considering the study´s limitations (see Section
    2.2 and Section 2.3), we acknowledge that our findings and suggested avenues for
    future research may not encompass all perspectives on IoT monitoring in the field
    of natural resources management. Therefore, we recommend further comparative analysis
    and case studies to validate the applicability of our findings in broader contexts.
    5. Conclusions In summary, this study provides valuable empirical insights into
    the complex interplay between actors’ behavior and technology adoption for natural
    resources management. It also lays a robust foundation for further scholarly inquiry
    and discussions in the field of social science and digital transformation within
    the context of natural resources management. In this context, we argue that technology
    adoption does not exist in a vacuum. Instead, it is embedded within a multifaceted
    web of intricate political, normative, historical, and sociocultural contexts
    that profoundly influence the adoption process and actors’ behavior. Understanding
    these influences would add an important layer to the critical understanding of
    actors’ behavior and technology adoption in the context of natural resources management.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract In the last decade, digital twin (DT) technology
    has received considerable attention across various domains, such as manufacturing,
    smart healthcare, and smart cities. The digital twin represents a digital representation
    of a physical entity, object, system, or process. Although it is relatively new
    in the agricultural domain, it has gained increasing attention recently. Recent
    reviews of DTs show that this technology has the potential to revolutionise agriculture
    management and activities. It can also provide numerous benefits to all agricultural
    stakeholders, including farmers, agronomists, researchers, and others, in terms
    of making decisions on various agricultural processes. In smart crop farming,
    DTs help simulate various farming tasks like irrigation, fertilisation, nutrient
    management, and pest control, as well as access real-time data and guide farmers
    through ‘what-if’ scenarios. By utilising the latest technologies, such as cloud–fog–edge
    computing, multi-agent systems, and the semantic web, farmers can access real-time
    data and analytics. This enables them to make accurate decisions about optimising
    their processes and improving efficiency. This paper presents a proposed architectural
    framework for DTs, exploring various potential application scenarios that integrate
    this architecture. It also analyses the benefits and challenges of implementing
    this technology in agricultural environments. Additionally, we investigate how
    cloud–fog–edge computing contributes to developing decentralised, real-time systems
    essential for effective management and monitoring in agriculture. Keywords: digital

    1. Introduction Agriculture, the primary source of the majority of the globe’s
    food, is one of civilisation’s most challenging issues. To match the growing population’s
    demand for food, advancements in agricultural production need to be sustainable;
    with increasing environmental variability due to climate change and the unsustainable
    dependency on agrochemicals, this is an increasingly difficult task. Technology
    advancement and increasing availability of low-cost sensors have led to a rise
    in the popularity of precision agriculture and smart farming to address the food
    production concerns [1]. Precision agriculture and innovative farming technologies
    enable farmers to be better informed and more adaptive in their response to changing
    weather conditions. Furthermore, the increased data help farmers to move away
    from traditional approaches of broadcasting agrochemicals towards target applications,
    which has both financial and environmental benefits. The latest technologies,
    including sensors, computing edge devices, monitoring devices, smart agricultural
    equipment, and cloud services, are essential for enabling smart agriculture [2],
    precision agriculture, and Agriculture 4.0/5.0 [3,4]. These technologies have
    enabled the rapid adoption of advanced techniques in agriculture, such as cloud–fog–edge
    computing [2], digital twin [5], the Internet of Things (IoT) [6], big data analytics
    [7], machine learning [8], augmented reality [9], and robotics [10]. By utilising
    these technologies, farmers can improve sustainability, enhance productivity,
    and optimise resource utilisation. As these technologies continue to develop and
    become more accessible, we can expect to see more significant advancements in
    smart agriculture in the future. Digital twin is an evolving technology that is
    gaining more attention in all domains. DT can be defined as a digital equivalent
    of a real-life object that mirrors its behaviour and states over its lifetime
    in a virtual space [11]. Although there are a number of studies available in other
    domains using the concept of a DT, it is still in the early stages in agriculture
    [5]. In recent years, agriculture has also received a lot of interest; development
    and implementation are still in progress as stakeholders and researchers work
    to find sustainable and efficient methods to produce food while also reducing
    the impact on the environment. Farming can be generally categorised into two types:
    Open Environment Agriculture (OEA) and Closed Environment Agriculture (CEA). The
    implementation of DT in CEA is relatively easier because of the controlled nature
    of environmental factors. However, implementing DT in OEA is challenging because
    it involves unpredictable natural weather conditions and various other external
    factors. While a significant amount of research focuses on CEA, with studies exploring
    its application in greenhouse [12], aquaponics [13], vertical farming [14], hydroponics
    [15], studies on OEA are comparatively fewer. DT in agriculture is an emerging
    topic that has the potential to bring about significant change. Since a few studies
    are available for OEA, it is clear that there is a need for customised DT frameworks
    specifically for OEA. This gap has motivated us to propose architecture and application
    scenarios for open-environment crop farming. The detailed related work on DT for
    agriculture is discussed in Section 3. This research introduces a novel architecture
    for a DT by integrating multi-agent systems and cloud–fog–edge computing. This
    is designed to rapidly provide necessary decision-making information to farmers
    for “what-ifs” scenarios. It also directs farmers in critical areas and offers
    a dynamic list of prioritised actions that adapt to evolving environmental conditions.
    Moreover, the proposed architecture has the capability to automate certain farm
    tasks based on farmer inputs. Therefore, it enhances overall farm productivity
    and effectively manages various tasks. Additionally, the paper explores a few
    detailed use cases, demonstrating the practical application of DT technology through
    integrated architecture in agricultural environments. The remainder of this work
    is structured as follows: In Section 2 we describe smart crop farming (Section
    2.1), digital twin technology (Section 2.2), and cloud–fog–edge computing (Section
    2.3) as the background of this work. Section 3 discusses related works on Digital
    Twins in the agricultural domain. A high-level architecture for the proposed DT
    agricultural use cases is presented in Section 4. Section 5 explores possible
    application scenarios with digital twins, consisting of the overall scenario for
    agriculture (Section 5.1) and then describing specific scenarios, such as irrigation
    systems in Section 5.2 early alerts on fields in Section 5.3, nutrient management
    recommendations in Section 5.4, and nutrient deficiency risk identification in
    Section 5.5. Finally, Section 6 concludes the discussion and discusses future
    work. 2. Background 2.1. Smart Crop Farming Agriculture plays a crucial role in
    today’s world, as it is essential for feeding the global population. With a growing
    global population and limited resources [16], it is crucial to find innovative
    solutions to maximise crop yield and ensure food security. One such solution is
    the application of smart agriculture techniques, which utilise advanced technologies
    such as satellite imaging and remote sensing, drones and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs), artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics. Smart
    agriculture, often referred to as precision farming, digital farming, or agriculture
    5.0 [4], aims to optimise agricultural practices by utilising the power of data
    and technology. Smart agriculture, also known as precision farming or digital
    farming [17] or agriculture 5.0 [4], aims to optimise the farming process by increasing
    accuracy and customisation for specific fields or crops. Using these technologies,
    farmers can collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels,
    and pest infestations. These data can then be analysed and used to make data-driven
    decisions about irrigation, fertiliser application, pest control, and crop management.
    By integrating smart technologies into agriculture, farmers can not only increase
    crop yields but also reduce resource wastage. Crop farming is generally complex
    and relies heavily on various factors such as weather conditions, soil quality,
    irrigation management, fertiliser and nutrient availability, and pest control.
    In the past, farmers had to rely on traditional methods and intuition to make
    informed decisions [18]. However, with the introduction of smart agriculture or
    smart farming, farmers now have access to real-time data and accurate weather
    forecasts compared to the past. This helps them make timely decisions regarding
    when to plant, irrigate, or harvest their crops to optimise yield. To address
    this challenge, farming now demands a decision support system and monitoring system
    [19]. This is where the IoT plays a crucial role. The IoT refers to the connection
    of physical objects, devices, and sensors through the internet to gather data
    for decision-making [20]. By implementing IoT technology in agriculture, farmers
    can collect data from various sensors and devices placed throughout their fields.
    This data can then be analysed using artificial intelligence algorithms to provide
    insights and recommendations for improving crop production. Other technologies,
    such as machine learning, blockchain, and robotics, can also be integrated into
    smart agriculture systems to automate tasks, reduce labour costs, and improve
    efficiency. Digital twin technology in agriculture is another emerging concept
    that holds great potential in smart agriculture. Overall, smart crop farming is
    transforming traditional methods of farming, bringing about a new era of efficiency
    and productivity in the agricultural sector. 2.2. Digital Twin In recent years,
    the DT concept has garnered global attention. It involves creating a virtual or
    digital replica of a physical object, such as machinery, buildings, farms, fields,
    plants or even human beings, using real-time data from these physical entities.
    This approach allows for comprehensive analysis, simulation, and optimisation.
    The term digital twin, introduced by Grieves in a 2003 presentation and later
    elaborated in a white paper [21], has provided the foundation for its development
    across various domains. Digital models are created by collecting real-time data
    from IoT solutions, such as sensors and other sources. DT systems are different
    from other systems as they not only simulate predicted futures but also provide
    real-time insights. Unlike simulations [22], DTs use real-time data and can provide
    quick and valuable information by incorporating the latest available data. Although
    DT technology originated in manufacturing [23], its application has broadened
    to sectors such as healthcare [24], energy [25], urban planning [26], and recently
    in agriculture [27]. In agriculture, digital twins have revolutionised practices
    by simulating farming cycles such as soil conditions, weather patterns, crop growth,
    and pest infestations and utilising real-time data for decision-making. This approach
    allows for customised recommendations, optimising crop yields, efficient resource
    use, and minimising environmental impacts. Digital twins improve precision farming
    by creating accurate digital replicas of farms, enabling remote monitoring and
    management. Farmers can customise irrigation and fertilisation plans and accurately
    predict harvesting times. As advanced predictive tools, these models help manage
    risks like crop diseases and pest infestations effectively. Integrating artificial
    intelligence and machine learning [28] further provides advanced analytics and
    predictive insights essential for sustainable food production and climate change
    adaptation. Even though introducing DTs in agriculture offers many benefits, adopting
    this technology faces challenges [29], including the need for significant initial
    investment, a robust technological infrastructure, and concerns regarding data
    privacy. Despite these limitations, the future of DTs in agriculture and beyond
    looks promising, with potential advancements such as enhanced integration with
    advanced technologies. 2.3. Cloud–Fog–Edge Computing Cloud–fog–edge computing
    is a paradigm that combines the power of cloud computing, fog computing, and edge
    computing to create a distributed and collaborative computing platform. At its
    core, cloud–fog–edge aims to optimise the processing and storage of data by leveraging
    the strengths of each computing model. Utilising cloud computing, this architecture
    can benefit from its vast resources and scalability for handling large-scale data
    processing and storage [30]. Fog computing, on the other hand, brings the computational
    power closer to the data source, reducing latency and improving real-time processing
    capabilities [31]. Edge computing enables processing and storage to be performed
    at or near the edge devices themselves, reducing the need for data transmission
    and thus improving efficiency. This combination of cloud, fog, and edge computing
    addresses the limitations and challenges of traditional centralised computing
    models. As the agriculture domain evolves with the integration of cloud, fog,
    and edge computing, a powerful architecture emerges that significantly impacts
    farming practices. Edge computing, situated closer to on-field devices, ensures
    fast data processing and minimal latency, which is essential for real-time decision-making
    [32]. However, fog computing plays a pivotal role in this integration, not only
    seamlessly connecting with edge devices but also conducting intelligent analysis
    [33,34]. The unique capability of fog computing to extend its reach to both the
    edge and the cloud makes it an indispensable component of agricultural systems.
    The introduction of mobile fog zones, actively gathering data from the fields,
    and static fog zones, providing localised storage and computing capabilities for
    immediate data analysis, marks a crucial transformation [35]. This cloud–fog–edge
    combination architecture not only optimises data processing and decision support
    at the field level but also leverages cloud resources for comprehensive analysis.
    The importance of fog computing in agriculture is underscored by its role in bridging
    the gap between on-field operations and broader cloud-based insights, thereby
    enhancing the efficiency, scalability, and adaptability of agricultural practices.
    3. Related Work Recent reviews show that interest in DTs in agriculture has notably
    increased in the last few years. For instance, the authors of [27] presented an
    extensive literature survey on DTs in agriculture, establishing a foundational
    understanding of the topic. The authors of [36] examined the application of the
    DT paradigm in assessing soil quality, highlighting the technology’s potential
    to revolutionise traditional practices. Further, Ref. [13] introduced a pioneering
    case study on urban farming technology. This study explored how a cyber-physical
    aquaponics system, augmented with a DT and machine learning, could gain adaptive
    capabilities, showcasing the practical implementation and benefits of DTs in enhancing
    agricultural systems. Verdouw et al. [11] analysed how DTs could advance smart
    farming. The authors defined the concept of a DT, developed a typology of different
    types of DTs, and proposed a conceptual framework for their design and implementation.
    The authors mentioned that DTs in agriculture include six distinct types: imaginary,
    monitoring, predictive, autonomous, and recollection DTs, each serving different
    control purposes. The authors also proposed a framework and applied and validated
    it in five smart farming use cases in the European IoF2020 project, covering arable
    farming, dairy farming, greenhouse horticulture, organic vegetable farming, and
    livestock farming. The case studies have offered valuable insights into how DTs
    can improve and optimise smart farming systems. In 2021, Pylianidis et al. [27]
    published a literature review on digital twins in agriculture from 2017 to 2020.
    The authors identified 28 use cases and compared them with other domains’ use
    cases. The authors compared reported benefits, service categories, and technology
    readiness levels to assess the level of digital twin adoption in agriculture.
    The authors also proposed a roadmap inspired by other domains of DT applications.
    This paper concluded by identifying distinctive characteristics of agricultural
    DTs. However, this paper did not provide specific examples of implemented DT applications
    in agriculture or the latest advancements in this field. It also did not cover
    potential benefits in detail or the latest advancements in DT applications in
    agriculture. Nasirahmadi et al. [5] presented a general framework of DTs in soil
    irrigation, robotics, farm machinery, and food post-harvest processing in the
    agricultural field. The authors emphasised the need to develop DT systems further
    in the agricultural context. These systems should be able to monitor, record,
    and analyse data to predict and prescribe the best decision for digital farming
    management. Also, the authors identified the need for further research and development
    in applying DT concepts in agriculture, particularly in addressing practical challenges,
    integrating advanced technologies, and developing robust DT models for different
    aspects of agricultural operations. Few other studies are available that apply
    the concepts of DTs to smart agriculture. For example, Ref. [37] proposed a DTs-based
    smart agriculture framework utilising LoRaWAN for sensor networks in farm fields
    and the intelligent processing of aerial imagery to detect plant diseases and
    nutrient deficiencies. The authors of [13] have proposed a framework for a decision
    support system to coordinate decentralised urban agricultural production units.
    The authors of [38] discussed the principles of developing a multi-agent DT of
    plants using broccoli as an example. The results of the reviews clearly show that
    the concept of DTs in agriculture is still in its early stages and has not been
    fully explored in research. Although the agricultural sector presents numerous
    opportunities for the application of DT technology, its development and implementation
    are still in progress. Therefore, this paper proposes a set of DT use cases designed
    for the agricultural domain. The aim is to bridge the current research gap and
    contribute to sustainable agriculture and enhanced production goals. This paper
    focuses on applying the innovative DT concept to real-world scenarios in smart
    agriculture. Our goal is to tackle key challenges in this field, with the promise
    of revolutionising efficiency and yield through this approach. 4. High Level Architecture
    for Proposed Digital Twin Use Cases in Agriculture Figure 1 illustrates the proposed
    architecture of a DT system for smart agriculture that integrates cloud, fog,
    and edge computing layers and multi-agent systems. Farmers or users can access
    a DT system through a farm management GUI (Graphical User Interface). The overall
    architecture consists of three layers: Cloud, Fog, and Edge. Figure 1. Proposed
    Architecture for Digital Twins in Smart Agriculture. The Cloud layer plays multiple
    roles, including accessing external services like growth stage estimators, weather
    services, routing services, and disease identification tools. It also offers data
    storage and anonymisation services for farm data and supports machine learning
    and data analysis. Additionally, data collected from satellites that help with
    growth stage estimation, weather prediction, and disease identification are stored
    in this layer. This layer is also responsible for handling complex processing
    tasks that are not time-sensitive and can utilise the vast resources of cloud
    computing. The Fog layer consists of two sub-zones: the Static Fog Zone and the
    Mobile Fog Zone. In a smart or precision farming setup, an array of sensors and
    actuators are employed, along with machinery like harvesters, tractors, and innovative
    devices such as drones and agricultural robots. These devices function as mobile
    fog nodes, gathering data directly from the fields. Located at the field level,
    the Static Fog Zone hosts agents, microservices, and digital twins, providing
    localised data storage and computing capabilities for immediate analysis of farm
    data. The mobile fog nodes serve to extend the reach of the Fog network, ensuring
    data collection and processing capabilities in parts of the farm that may have
    intermittent or no internet access. Furthermore, the Fog layer incorporates a
    collection of microservices, which facilitate access to both internal APIs for
    farm data retrieval and third-party APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
    for extended functionality. It also houses various agents, such as the Farm Manager
    and Field Agents, who are tasked with resource scheduling, task management, and
    the execution of field plans. These components function seamlessly within both
    the static and mobile zones of the Fog layer. The Edge layer comprises various
    devices with embedded sensors and actuators utilised in agricultural environments.
    These devices can include soil moisture sensors located directly in the field
    or NDVI sensors mounted on farm machinery such as tractors. These Edge devices
    connect to the static Fog layer to transmit data when internet connectivity is
    present. In the absence of connectivity, mobile Fog nodes provide data collection
    services, gathering information from the Edge devices either opportunistically
    or upon request. This allows for continuous data acquisition and integration into
    the farm’s DT system, ensuring that the farm management has access to the most
    updated information for decision-making. Additionally, the overall architecture
    incorporates MAMS (Multi-agent Micro-services) [39] as illustrated in Figure 2.
    In this setup, microservices are tasked with ongoing activities like weather monitoring
    and are engaged in the continuous processing of data. The system’s flexibility
    allows seamless transitions between different data sources, like switching from
    one weather station to another, by simply re-configuring the appropriate microservice.
    This adaptability level is a fundamental feature of DT technology and is further
    enhanced by the integrated multi-agent system. In this interconnected environment,
    actions in one field can influence outcomes in another. The DT plays a crucial
    role in fine-tuning these decisions, utilising data-centric simulations. At the
    core of this architecture is the utilisation of established agricultural guidelines,
    such as the RB209 recommendations, providing a solid foundation. These guidelines
    are not just followed; they are dynamically adapted to suit the real-time conditions
    of the farm, ensuring the advice provided is both reliable and contextually relevant.
    Figure 2. Cloud–Fog–Edge and MAMS Overview. On the other hand, agents play a crucial
    role in the DT framework, particularly in decision-making, task allocation, and
    resource management. These intelligent agents utilise the data gathered by microservices
    to make not only decisions but also recommendations. A comprehensive knowledge
    graph is built by a variety of microservices, such as those collecting weather
    data, nutrient recommendations, and decision-making services. This interconnected
    data representation enables agents to coordinate system activities effectively.
    This ensures the maintenance of the most accurate model of the field’s state.
    The agents are focused on developing an efficient plan for the field. Although
    this plan is not a built-in feature of the DT, it is significantly influenced
    by the data collected and analysis from the DT. This field plan directly impacts
    nutrient levels, which in turn affects the growth stages of the crops. Efficient
    management of the DT, coupled with the use of intelligent agents for decision
    support, enables us to recommend strategies that maintain optimal field conditions,
    enhancing both the productivity and efficiency of agricultural practices. The
    agents can also analyse patterns, predict outcomes, and allocate tasks efficiently
    across the farming operation. Their capabilities include assessing the best planting
    strategies, optimising irrigation schedules, and managing resource allocation
    to maximise yield and efficiency. Overall, the proposed architecture depicted
    in Figure 2 enables farmers to utilise a DT that integrates cloud computing, fog
    computing, and edge computing, thereby simplifying and improving farm management.
    This approach significantly enhances farm management and decision-making through
    a comprehensive, multi-layered computational framework. The incorporation of agents
    in this architecture allows for autonomous data collection and processing, ensuring
    timely and accurate information. Microservices, meanwhile, offer modular and scalable
    solutions, facilitating the flexible integration of various farm data sources
    and services. The combined use of cloud, fog, and edge computing layers ensures
    efficient data processing: cloud computing handles complex, non-time-sensitive
    tasks; fog computing provides localised data analysis; and edge computing enables
    real-time data capture directly from farm devices. Collectively, these technologies
    form a digital replica of the farm that includes all important factors, thereby
    streamlining decision-making. In this way, the proposed architecture offers numerous
    advantages in overall farming processes compared to the existing agricultural
    systems. 5. Possible Application Scenarios with Digital Twin In the labour-intensive
    field of agriculture, many interrelated and variable factors play a role in daily
    farming decisions. Despite being well-planned with expertise, unforeseen circumstances
    often cause plans to be changed or abandoned in cases such as unexpected rainfalls
    or the emergence of crop diseases. In these circumstances, an adaptive approach,
    a fast decision, and good organisation are essential to maintain efficiency and
    prevent yield losses (subsequently financial losses) and environmental damage.
    This section discusses example use cases using DTs. 5.1. Overall Scenario of Digital
    Twin in Agriculture The proposed DT model of agriculture includes a digital representation
    of farms, fields and other related factors. This complex model dynamically integrates
    various data sources to replicate the current state of the farm. This model is
    also continuously updated with real-time data, allowing it to reflect current
    conditions and predict future states accurately. For instance, if we consider
    a farm with n fields, the DT model would have the exact representation with details
    such as: Farm: Farm ID, Farm Name, Number of Fields, Field IDs. Field: Field ID,
    Farm ID, Field Name, Crop Info, Soil Info, Historical Information such as Last
    Cropping Date. Zone: Zone ID, Zone Name, Field ID, Farm ID, Weather Data. As illustrated
    in Figure 3, digital twins assist in decision-making and predictions based on
    historical and real-time data analysis and provide recommendations and suggestions
    to farmers and other stakeholders. Figure 3. Digital Twin for Agriculture. Digital
    twins can be applied to various aspects of agriculture in order to help farmers,
    including: Real-time Monitoring and Prediction [5]: DTs can monitor crop health
    and growth in real-time and predict future outcomes based on data such as weather
    patterns, soil moisture, and nutrient levels. This information can help farmers
    make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilisation, and other factors that
    impact crop growth. Enhanced Productivity and Efficiency: By simulating various
    scenarios, farmers can identify the most efficient use of resources, such as water
    and fertilisers, and optimise crop yields [5,12]. As new data are collected and
    analysed continuously, farmers can continuously refine their practices, adapting
    to changing conditions and incorporating the latest insights for ongoing improvements
    in productivity and efficiency. Resource optimisation and management: DTs can
    optimise farmers’ use of resources like water, fertilisers, and pesticides by
    providing real-time data on their application and effectiveness. It also helps
    in task scheduling and management of farm equipment, including tractors, harvesters,
    and other agricultural machinery. This can help farmers reduce waste and improve
    efficiency. Quality control: It can monitor crop quality and identify potential
    issues, such as pests or diseases, before they become significant problems. This
    can help farmers take proactive measures to protect their crops and maintain high-quality
    yields. Collaboration: DTs can facilitate collaboration among farmers, researchers,
    agronomists, and other stakeholders, allowing them to share real-time data and
    insights. This can accelerate the development of new techniques and technologies
    in smart crop farming. Data-Driven Decision-Making: DTs offer farmers a comprehensive
    perspective of their agricultural operations. This enables data-driven decision-making,
    as farmers can analyse soil conditions, weather patterns, and crop health data
    to make informed choices toward improving yields. Continuous data collection and
    analysis enable better management of agricultural processes, leading to more informed
    decisions [5]. The implementation of a DT in agriculture is a powerful step towards
    more efficient and sustainable practices. This approach offers a holistic overview
    of the farm, enabling farmers to optimise processes throughout the entire agricultural
    cycle, from planting to harvesting. The DT also has features for predicting the
    future and a comprehensive understanding of farm processes. Farmers can more efficiently
    use resources like water, fertilisers, and pesticides. As a result, this reduces
    waste and operational costs and addresses the specific needs of crops at different
    growth stage levels at the right time. These all help in maximise yields. Integrating
    data from diverse sources and analysing them are significant features of DT. This
    integration includes real-time data from IoT devices distributed across the farm,
    which monitor key factors such as soil moisture and nutrient levels. Weather patterns
    are important in making decisions about farming activities. The data coming from
    local weather stations can offer valuable insights in terms of how the weather
    patterns could change. Additionally, the DT utilises high-resolution satellite
    imagery to monitor larger-scale changes in crop health and environmental conditions.
    The DT improves its predictive accuracy by accessing agricultural databases to
    collect data on crop varieties, pest/disease patterns, and historical data. This
    can result in guiding farmers towards more informed decision-making in modern
    agriculture. The DT not only simulates and predicts the outcomes of different
    farming strategies under varying environmental conditions but also continuously
    updates its model to reflect real-time changes on the farm. This dynamic model
    ensures that the virtual farm environment is always in sync with the actual farm,
    allowing farmers to visualise the consequences of their actions before implementing
    them. By acting as a decision-support tool, the DT enables farmers to efficiently
    manage risks, such as pest infestations or disease outbreaks, and test different
    scenarios, including best and worst-case situations. Ultimately, this approach
    supports sustainable and environmentally friendly farming practices, empowering
    farmers with the tools needed for success in the ever-evolving world of agriculture.
    In the following section, we will explore a few use cases that demonstrate the
    potential of DTs in agriculture: irrigation systems and early disease detection.
    Specifically, we will compare the processes for these use cases with and without
    DT technology. Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate these processes and highlight
    the benefits of using a DT. Figure 4. Irrigation Systems. Figure 5. Early Alters
    on Fields. It is worth noting that with DTs, it is necessary to consider all related
    factors before making a decision instead of only considering a single factor.
    This feature enables farmers to make more accurate decisions that consider the
    potential future effects of the decision rather than simply deciding whether to
    irrigate or manually identify diseases. This is one of the key advantages of DTs
    compared to other modern digital systems. 5.2. Scenario 1: Irrigation Systems
    Agricultural irrigation systems are frequently closed systems, which require the
    farmer to turn the irrigation system on or off. More advanced systems are available
    on the market, which utilise either soil moisture sensors [40] or rainfall sensors
    [41] to automate irrigation and reduce water usage. The sensors for automated
    irrigation systems are typically expensive. As technology advances, progressively
    more straightforward, low-cost sensors capable of sensing soil moisture and rainfall
    are entering the market. Connecting these simple sensors to nodes would create
    an affordable irrigation management system. This would lower the cost barrier
    and allow greater access to precision technologies, particularly for smaller farms
    [40]. A DT for an irrigation system in agriculture is a digital replica of the
    physical irrigation system used in the field. It is created by collecting data
    from sensors and other sources such as weather forecasts, soil moisture sensors,
    and crop growth models. Using this data, the DT replicates the functioning of
    the irrigation setup and the behaviour of the crops under irrigation. This enables
    farmers and other stakeholders to monitor system performance, optimise irrigation
    schedules, and make better decisions to maximise crop yield while minimising water
    usage. For example, the DT can help farmers decide when and how much water to
    apply to their crops based on weather conditions, soil moisture levels, and other
    factors (harvest date, fertiliser plans). It can also help farmers identify potential
    issues with the irrigation system, such as leaks or malfunctions, and take required
    action before they impact crop yield. Farmers who do not have access to DT technology
    must rely on traditional methods such as visual inspection and manual measurement
    to make irrigation decisions. These methods are often based on intuition and experience
    rather than hard data, which could lead to inefficient and suboptimal irrigation
    practices. While there are modern irrigation systems that use technologies such
    as soil moisture sensors and temperature gauges to inform decision-making [42],
    these systems may not take into account other important factors such as crop growth
    stage, nutrient levels, and fertiliser use. Digital twin technology, on the other
    hand, can integrate and analyse a wide range of data points, making it a more
    advanced tool for decision-making in agriculture. A DT for an irrigation system
    of crop fields can provide farmers with a valuable tool to improve their irrigation
    practices and ultimately achieve more sustainable and efficient crop production.
    Additionally, the fog processing feature outlined in this paper’s architecture,
    as illustrated in Figure 1, allows for the utilisation of weather forecasts in
    conjunction with simple sensor data. This integration helps to reduce water usage
    further. Reducing water consumption is crucial for countries experiencing water
    scarcity. Due to climate change-induced water shortages, agricultural security
    concerns are increasing [43]. Therefore, utilising DT in irrigation systems presents
    an effective solution for this issue. 5.3. Scenario 2: Early Alerts on Fields
    Vegetation indexes used in earth observations are related to crop stress, such
    as drought or disease [44,45]. The field management system in the outlined architecture
    would prioritise an inspection made in a specific area in response to earth observations
    processed through the cloud. This guidance-based approach would rapidly reduce
    the time spent inspecting the field for stress symptoms, increasing efficiency
    and helping maintain crop health. This is illustrated in Figure 6, where the traditional
    approach of crop inspection requires walking through each field as highlighted
    on the left image with red lines; the guidance-based system reduces this need
    and can direct a farmer straight to the areas of risk. Whilst in the field, any
    map-based information could be updated through the static fog, and the farmer
    could record a diagnostic for the stress (e.g., the presence of a disease). In
    addition, whilst in areas of poor connectivity, sensors would benefit from the
    presence of a passing smartphone to create an ad-hoc connection to upload data.
    At the point of updating the system to diagnose a crop disease, the architecture
    will be able to respond to this new information, check the weather forecast, and,
    if weather conditions are favourable could prioritise new actions of fungicide
    applications (part of the recommendation system of the architecture). Figure 6.
    Crop Inspection Traditional Approach (left) vs. Modern Approach (right). Additionally,
    the system could automate the shutoff of irrigation of the field/neighbouring
    fields of the same crop. This automation will (1) help reduce the spread of disease
    from water droplets and (2) provide the most time for the area to dry, which is
    necessary for fungicide applications. The dynamic nature of the architecture will
    provide the best outcome for a rapid response. In this scenario, the system minimises
    the time spent by the farmer inspecting fields, collecting relevant information
    (i.e., weather forecast), deciding on the best course of action and allowing more
    time for the farmer to respond to the crop disease threat, preventing potential
    yield reduction from crop disease spread. Without the system, most of the day
    could have been spent inspecting each field for symptoms of stress. When there
    is a deviation from the farm management plan, the DT field feature will be able
    to simulate the impacts of the change and provide advice on future management
    decisions. If an event occurs in a field or management deviates from the management
    plan, the digital twin field will be able to simulate the impacts of the changes
    and advise alternative management decisions. For example, if the drilling of a
    field is delayed due to adverse weather events, the DT will recommend increasing
    the seed rate, helping to negate any reduced tillering. Furthermore, the DT model
    will be able to apply these variations, along with growth modelling and external
    data such as weather forecasting, to adapt the expected timing of future management
    actions, e.g., nitrogen applications. The DT will be able to suggest amendments
    to agrochemical applications in response to events occurring in the field/farm
    while also helping to automate certain processes. In addition to this, if yield
    reduction is predicted for a field in the DT, the system may suggest reducing
    future nitrogen applications in that field, which will help improve nitrogen use
    efficiency, reduce environmental damage, and maximise profits. 5.4. Scenario 3:
    Nutrient Management Recommendations Nutrient management is crucial in crop farming
    for several reasons. It ensures the optimal growth of crops by providing them
    with the right balance of nutrients [46]. Effective nutrient management not only
    boosts crop yield [47] and quality but also minimises the environmental impact
    by reducing fertiliser overuse and runoff, which can lead to soil degradation
    and water pollution [46]. Various factors are considered in nutrient management
    for crops, including soil conditions, crop nutrient requirements, deficiency symptoms,
    previous crop information, and environmental conditions [48]. Conventional smart
    agriculture [49] employs technologies such as IoT sensors, drones, and satellite
    imagery to gather data for informed fertiliser application, improving crop growth,
    and minimising waste. However, these systems face challenges in terms of connectivity
    and internet access in remote agricultural areas, impacting the real-time monitoring
    capabilities of these technologies. Another problem is scalability when new services
    need to be introduced to the systems. Generally, the conventional smart agriculture
    method of nutrient application involves uniform practices across fields. In contrast,
    the proposed architecture customises nutrient guidance based on the unique needs
    of each field or zone level, as identified through real-time data processing.
    This is because the DT supports farm level, field level, and zone level granularity.
    The adaptability of the DT is evident in its responsiveness to dynamic environmental
    factors. In instances of adverse weather conditions or changes in soil composition,
    the system can promptly adjust nutrient recommendations to accommodate the evolving
    needs of the crops. This agility ensures that nutrient applications are modified
    with the current state of the field, maximising the effectiveness of the entire
    nutrient management process. Additionally, the system facilitates seamless communication
    between various stakeholders involved in nutrient management. Farmers receive
    clear and actionable recommendations through user-friendly interfaces, improving
    their ability to implement precise nutrient applications. The recommendation system
    also integrates with other components of the agricultural architecture, such as
    weather forecasting, to provide comprehensive insights for decision-making. Another
    key feature of the nutrient management recommendation system using DT architecture
    is its continuous learning capability. Over time, the system refines its recommendations
    based on historical data, crop responses, and evolving soil conditions. This iterative
    process ensures that nutrient management strategies are continually optimised,
    leading to improved crop health and overall agricultural productivity. Furthermore,
    integrating cloud, fog, edge computing, agents, and microservices transforms nutrient
    management to the next level. The fog layer instantly analyses real-time data
    collected by edge devices, overcoming connectivity limitations. Microservices
    provide flexible and scalable solutions, while the cloud layer enhances computational
    capabilities with machine learning. Autonomous agents streamline decision-making,
    making nutrient management more efficient and reducing the need for continuous
    human intervention. The whole approach of the DT architecture ensures a seamless
    and optimised nutrient management process in agriculture. 5.5. Scenario 4: Nutrient
    Deficiency Risk Identification Nutrient deficiency risk identification is a traditionally
    onerous task in which farmers may heavily rely on experience and generational
    knowledge [4]. Identifying a nutrient deficiency is often done through visual
    inspection of crops, as nutrient deficiencies result in symptoms appearing on
    the plant [4]. If visual symptoms are missed, a farmer may only realise the potential
    for nutrient deficiencies when observing a reduced yield and/or poor plant quality.
    Problematic crops may prompt a soil test, which serves as the most accurate representation
    of soil pH and key nutrient levels. However, when a deficiency has manifested,
    it is often too late to treat it effectively. Therefore, due to the variable nutrient
    requirements of different crops, farmers often utilise strategies such as crop
    rotation and intercropping to maintain a balanced soil nutrient profile. Conventional
    smart agriculture techniques have been developed to identify nutrient deficiencies
    in soils and crops. This is primarily achieved through satellite imagery [50],
    machine learning [51], and IoT sensors [52]. Some techniques relying on imagery
    may prove insufficient in some scenarios, as treating nutrient deficiencies can
    be ineffective by the time it is visually present. IoT sensor solutions facilitate
    rapid data collection, thereby enhancing decision-making efficiency [52]. The
    adoption of IoT sensors has proven to improve the quantity and quality of yield
    [52]. An implemented DT architecture offers a basis to integrate heterogeneous,
    dynamic, and disparate data sources into a homogenous system. This uniform system
    can underpin mechanisms that proactively monitor for coinciding and compounding
    risk factors for key nutrients, such as a field of a particular soil being waterlogged
    during the winter months. The result of this could be a notification to a farmer
    that a field is exposed to a greater risk of certain nutrient deficiencies. The
    use of edge services, as in the proposed DT, ensures the integration of real-time
    data into risk identification processes. The DT transforms the approach to nutrient
    deficiency, as the seamless integration of interoperable data enables holistic
    techniques for risk identification in real-time. Furthermore, this strategy is
    enhanced by being employed by a multi-agent system. The distributed nature of
    agents allows for simultaneous monitoring of multiple fields in parallel. The
    autonomous aspect of agents ensures a proactive risk identification process. This
    transitions a farm’s nutrient deficiency management strategy from being reactive
    to preventative, as actions can be taken to mitigate risk as the dynamic data
    is updated in the DT. 6. Discussion and Future Work In conclusion, the DT concept
    is a powerful innovation with promising applications in agriculture, particularly
    when integrated with other cutting-edge technologies such as multi-agent systems
    (MAS), cloud–fog–edge computing, and microservices. The rapid advancement in sensing,
    communication, and computing technologies has sped up the development of DT models.
    These models replicate real-world conditions with real-time data, improving farm
    operations and allowing for better planning by offering suggestions for different
    ’what-if’ scenarios. This paper introduces a DT architecture and explains its
    components. While this architecture holds potential for numerous applications
    in agriculture, our current focus is on practical implementations, such as developing
    irrigation systems for crops, early disease detection, nutrient management recommendations,
    and identifying nutrient deficiency risks. The proposed structure uses agents
    and microservices to create and develop a cloud–fog–edge infrastructure, establishing
    the foundation for promising research in sustainable smart crop farming. The possible
    expected challenge would be accessing all the required data in the field. This
    data can be collected from sensors and third-party APIs for weather and other
    data. Implementing DT in agriculture demands solid technological infrastructure,
    including sensors, IoT devices, and cloud–fog–edge infrastructure. In addition,
    to apply this in the real world, the initial cost to install the required devices
    and technologies must be higher if it is not a smart farm. However, the proposed
    architecture is most suitable for smart agriculture. Thus, most smart farms already
    use smart agricultural devices such as drones, sprayers, sensors, etc. Regarding
    this architecture, cloud hosting and accessing accurate data from third-party
    APIs such as satellite data may also be expensive. Agriculture is generally a
    highly complex domain influenced by various unpredictable variables such as weather
    conditions and patterns, soil conditions, and other environmental factors. Although
    we get these predicted data from sensors and weather stations, it might still
    be unreliable. Nowadays, most farms are already using some level of technology
    and devices. Therefore, integrating with the existing systems in DT may be challenging.
    Implementing DTs involves collecting and analysing vast amounts of data, raising
    concerns about data privacy, ownership, and security. In addition to this, well-written
    documents and manuals should be prepared for use by agricultural stakeholders.
    From our perspective, the proposed architecture can be validated in several ways.
    For instance, it can be simulated with historical data, applied to a small-scale
    farm, and seen in the field without applying a digital twin. Additionally, it
    is possible to do qualitative testing based on farmers’ feedback based on the
    user experience. Another possible way would be to check how the DT reacts to the
    real-time data. However, further research is needed to analyse the real challenges
    and benefits of the proposed architecture. We are in the process of implementing
    the proposed use cases. For our future work, we plan to concentrate on several
    areas, investigating the design constraints involved in implementing DTs with
    cloud–fog–edge computing and identifying the challenges and potential solutions
    in the domain of agricultural DTs. In addition to this, we are also planning to
    propose a framework to implement a DT for agriculture domain. The future work
    will be also focusing on how these DT can be evaluated in the real world. Author

    Using thermal resources, a medical practice that originates in ancient customs
    allows the beneficial properties of mineral springs to be exploited to treat various
    medical conditions and diseases [1,2]. This therapy, incorrectly considered a
    mere variant of conventional therapeutic methods, instead plays a significant
    element in the therapeutic framework, requiring attention and reflection to maximize
    clinical benefits. As part of the modernization of community health care, it merges
    this tradition with new technological trends, e.g., telemedicine, offering an
    integrated and organic contribution to patient management [3,4]. The healing characteristics
    of thermal water have been appreciated in ancient times, and numerous cultures
    have appreciated and exploited its benefits for the quality of human health. The
    historical and scientific literature points out that these resources, whether
    of natural or artificial origin, contain vital mineral substances such as sodium,
    calcium, magnesium, and sulfur [5]. These mineral components, injected into the
    skin by immersion in a thermal bath or steam inhalation, stimulate the defense
    system, reduce inflammation, aid arterial circulation, and soothe pain. Modern
    territorial medicalization and telemedicine practices can complement traditional
    therapies through remote monitoring and online visits for a personalized and prolonged
    treatment program [6]. Thermal healing water treatment is useful for a wide variety
    of illnesses, including, but not limited to, respiratory conditions, such as asthma
    and bronchitis; dermatological conditions, such as dermatitis and psoriasis; musculoskeletal
    problems, including arthritis and chronic pain; and stress-related disorders,
    such as anxiety and insomnia [7]. In addition, the above waters are found to be
    effective in treating metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases, including
    diabetes and hypertension [8]. Several interventions in various experimental laboratories
    testify to how effective hydroponic treatments are under such conditions, with
    significant increases in participants’ quality of life spa treatment cycles [9].
    The deployment of telemedicine solutions, e.g., telediagnosis and remote monitoring
    of patients, amplify these benefits, allowing permanent check-ups and integrated,
    personalized management of spa services [10]. In addition, thermal waters are
    a means of preventive therapy. Studies have revealed that regular use of mineral
    water can play a preventive role against certain diseases and promote optimal
    overall health [11]. For example, calcium-rich waters can help counter osteoporosis,
    while those with high magnesium levels can benefit cardiovascular function [12,13].
    The evolution of community medicine and the development of new technologies in
    the medical field, such as advanced telemonitoring systems and remote diagnostics,
    make it possible to implement these preventive strategies more effectively and
    extensively. However, it is crucial to recognize that thermal waters have a different
    chemical composition depending on the source, necessitating careful analysis before
    their use for therapeutic purposes. Scientific research has shown that the specific
    chemical composition of thermal waters can significantly affect their therapeutic
    effects. Different waters may be more or less helpful in treating specific diseases
    [14]. In this area, technological developments in territorial medicine, such as
    data collection and analysis through advanced sensors and telemedicine platforms,
    can provide additional information on the waters’ composition and effectiveness,
    thus enabling more targeted and personalized treatments [15,16]. Integrating IoT
    into spa care services constitutes a quantum leap in the effectiveness and efficiency
    of these therapies [8,10,17,18,19]. The IoT, comprising an interconnected network
    of smart devices, sensors, and data processing systems, enables real-time data
    collection, analysis, and sharing, revolutionizing spa care and providing new
    opportunities to improve patient experience and treatment effectiveness [20,21].
    The spread of IoT in the context of community medicine and telemedicine opens
    up new avenues for local health monitoring and management, enabling more accessible
    and personalized health care [22,23]. One of the most significant aspects of IoT
    in spa care is the ability to monitor patients, both inside and outside spa facilities,
    in real-time through devices such as smartwatches, wristbands, or wearable sensors
    that collect data on heart rate, body temperature, blood oxygen levels and other
    vital indicators [24,25,26,27,28]. These data can be transmitted to a centralized
    monitoring system for accurate and timely analysis [29,30]. Telemedicine, using
    these technologies, enables timely intervention in case of abnormalities, improving
    the safety and effectiveness of spa treatment [31]. In addition, IoT enables the
    collection of environmental data, such as temperature and humidity in spa facilities,
    air quality, and lighting level, which can affect the effectiveness of treatment.
    This information can be used to improve the spa environment, thereby optimizing
    the overall patient experience. Community medicine can leverage this data to create
    ideal treatment environments, tailoring them to the specific needs of patients
    and integrating them with other forms of healthcare [32]. Another critical aspect
    of IoT in spa treatments is the customization of treatments to the specific needs
    of patients. The data obtained can be used to analyze treatment progress in detail,
    allowing treatment to be adjusted in real time based on individual patient responses.
    For example, if a patient responds positively to a particular therapy, it can
    be continued or modified based on the data collected. This personalization is
    even more relevant in telemedicine, where collected data can provide remote counseling
    and adapt therapies to the patient’s changing health condition [33,34]. IoT in
    spa care can also help improve communication between patients, healthcare providers,
    and spa managers, facilitating real-time information dissemination and increasing
    patient involvement in treatment decision-making. Telemedicine, in particular,
    can provide tools for communication and interaction between patients and healthcare
    providers, ensuring constant discussion and more effective sharing of treatment
    information. One of the main goals, in addition to those already highlighted,
    is to make the system suitable and accessible to the highest number of patients,
    regardless of their technical abilities or their possible sensory or cognitive
    disabilities. For this reason, by adopting some targeted strategies, treatments
    can become increasingly inclusive: inclusive system design means considering different
    users’ needs. It could be translated by implementing intuitive user interfaces,
    accessible multimedia supports, and ergonomic devices. Fundamental in this context
    is to offer customization options to adapt the devices to the specific preferences
    and needs of each patient: allowing settings to be adjusted through voice commands
    or the use of devices with tactile buttons and the Braille alphabet, for example,
    allows blind people to take advantage of the treatment and especially to be able
    to use the app. As part of the proposed system, it is also recommended to organize
    short training sessions aimed at users, prior to therapy, on the use of the devices
    in order to make them easier to use even for those with limited technological
    skills, as well as to increase the involvement of the patients themselves. It
    must be said that interdisciplinary collaboration is definitely at the heart of
    the proposed system: comparing and involving physicians, computer scientists,
    technicians, designers, and accessibility experts is necessary to ensure a holistic
    and inclusive approach. In addition, the impact of IoT and ML technologies in
    the medical and spa treatment fields, when viewed from a different perspective,
    can provide a more comprehensive, deep, and holistic view of the topic. Indeed,
    the fields of connection with other disciplines are many and vary from psychology
    to sociology via health policy [35]. The psychological aspect is one of those
    that most influence the course of treatment: the analysis of emotions, psychological
    well-being, and overall patient satisfaction are just some of the parameters to
    be considered, which are crucial in determining the treatments’ effectiveness.
    In addition to monitoring vital parameters, IoT and ML technologies can also effectively
    manage and reduce stress, for example, through collecting physiological data and
    implementing personalized relaxation programs, thus improving psychological and
    physical well-being [36]. New technologies also have a significant social impact:
    thanks to mobile applications, they can facilitate social connection by enabling
    patients to share their experiences and support each other during the course.
    Moreover, patients’ experiences, mainly positive, can influence other users and
    affect the dynamics of social inclusion. As already anticipated, health policy
    is also closely related and mainly involves issues already widely addressed, such
    as patient privacy, security of data provided by the system, and medical liability
    in using these data [37]. This paper explores the benefits of integrating IoT
    and telemedicine into spa therapies as a significant step forward in innovating
    these treatments, offering new opportunities to increase effectiveness, efficiency,
    and the overall patient experience. However, it is critical to address security
    and privacy issues to protect sensitive patient data in the digital age, particularly
    in territorial medicine and telemedicine, where health data management requires
    strict protection and confidentiality standards. 2. Related Works The IoT paradigm
    explicitly designed for the world of healthcare has still been little explored:
    there are still a limited number of publications on the subject; there are numerous
    studies on the application of IoT in the field of medicine in the general sense,
    healthcare and, above all, on medical devices, meaning also those that the patient
    could wear. Among the medical articles that have been published in this regard,
    we can refer to the study [38] in which a new comprehensive smartphone-based framework
    called PP-SPA is proposed, designed for human activity recognition (HAR), which
    pays special attention to privacy protection, or to the article [39] in which
    a new medical communication model called “Wireless Medical Sensor Networks Protocol
    for Healthcare Efficiency” (PWMSN4EoCH), abbreviated as PEH, is presented, which
    exploits a hasty strategy and random network coding (RNC). In the first case [38],
    the system devised supported real-time task execution by using a smartphone-based
    virtual personal assistant. PP-SPA uses a highly accurate ML model that receives
    data from smartphone sensors, such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer,
    and GPS, to recognize human activities accurately. Thus, the main goal of PP-SPA
    is to improve the daily routines of people with cognitive impairments. It also
    leverages a digital diary to provide real-time support, contributing to improving
    individual health. With algorithms such as Hoeffding Tree and Logistic Regression,
    PP-SPA achieves an accuracy level of 90%, developing models that account for variability
    and uncertainty in human activities. In the second case [39], the innovative concept
    aims to enhance the performance of healthcare networks by rapidly analyzing the
    configuration of medical networks and focusing on key parameters for narrowband
    Internet of [38] Things (NB-IoT) systems within wireless mesh networks (WMNs).
    PEH effectively fits the specific requirements of wireless telemedicine applications,
    in which medical sensors (MS) share downlink and uplink communication resources
    with surrounding entities, including wireless health hubs (WHHs) and wireless
    base stations (WBSs) for monitoring human health status. This scheme greatly accelerates
    the deployment of telemedicine devices, contributing to fulfilling patients’ needs:
    simulations conducted in the study show that PEH introduces a significant performance
    increase over the SoAT scheme, with an improvement of more than 64 percent. In
    comparison, the current state-of-the-art scheme (SoAT) does not fully embrace
    the principles proposed by PEH. The ‘comparative analysis between the proposed
    PEH and the SoAT scheme is based on message size (bytes), round trip time (RTT)
    (ms), overall network capacity (ONC) (bytes/s), and delivery delay (DD) in ms.
    The results indicate that the proposed PEH significantly outperforms the SoAT
    scheme, with improvements of 64% for RTT, 66% for ONC, and 71% for DD. Some other
    studies we can refer to onety and health monitoring are [40,41]. In the former
    [40], the authors present a hybrid wearable sensor network system to monitor workers’
    safety in outdoor workplaces. The wearable sensors have a dual purpose: on the
    one hand, to measure the environmental conditions around the worker, and on the
    other hand, to monitor the worker’s vital signs. The proposed system involves
    a wearable network (WBAN) to collect user data and a low-power vast area network
    (LPWAN) to connect the WBAN to the Internet. Then, to ensure constant monitoring,
    an autonomous local server is designed within the network that processes raw sensor
    signals, displays environmental and physiological data, and triggers an alert
    if an emergency circumstance is detected. In the other paper [41], a medical device
    (MD) for narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is implemented, and a wireless communication
    system is developed for the control and monitoring of hospital physicians. In
    summary, the proposed approach aims to improve the efficiency and performance
    of the polling cycle of NB-IoT MDs by reducing the response time and increasing
    the reliability of communications in the medical network: the polling cycle of
    MDs between the main station and terminal units in medical rooms is evaluated,
    and an end-to-end (E2E) polling protocol is introduced to reduce the polling cycle
    of medical devices. The proposed protocol aims to minimize the number of retransmissions,
    recover lost packets, and provide an overview of the medical network. Then, in
    the article [42], the applicability of the IoT paradigm in the health and medical
    sector is discussed by presenting a holistic architecture of the IoT eHealth ecosystem.
    As healthcare management is becoming increasingly complex due to the shortage
    and ineffectiveness of healthcare services in meeting the growing demand of an
    ever-growing population, especially those with chronic diseases, the authors suggest
    the need for a shift from the clinic-centered model of treatment to a patient-centered
    approach, where each element, such as hospitals, patients, and services, is closely
    interconnected. To realize the referenced patient-centered eHealth IoT ecosystem,
    adopting a layered architecture, including devices, fog computing, and cloud,
    to manage complex data regarding variety, speed, and latency is essential. The
    fog-based IoT architecture is illustrated through several examples of services
    and applications implemented on these layers, including mobile health, assisted
    living, e-medicine, facilities, early warning systems, and population monitoring
    in smart cities. Finally, eHealth IoT challenges such as data management, scalability,
    regulations, interoperability, device-network-human interfaces, security, and
    privacy are addressed. Therefore, this paper highlights the efficiency of intelligent
    data analysis in different cloud and fog computing paradigms, mainly geared toward
    managing mobile medical devices. Cloud analysis of information from medical devices
    is also highlighted in [43] as an effective element for improving medical treatments.
    The article develops from the idea that networked sensors, which can be worn on
    the body or integrated into our living environments, enable the collection of
    detailed information about our physical and mental health. This data, then captured
    continuously, aggregated, and extracted effectively, has the potential to bring
    about positive and transformative change in the field of health. In detail, according
    to the authors, the availability of data on previously unimaginable time and longitudinal
    scales, combined with a new generation of intelligent processing algorithms, can
    first foster an evolution in medical practice from the current reactive paradigm
    of post-facto diagnosis and treatment to a proactive approach to early-stage disease
    prognosis, integrated with prevention, care and overall health management rather
    than disease management; it can then enable personalization of treatment and management
    options targeted to the individual’s specific circumstances and needs; and, finally,
    it can help reduce health care costs while simultaneously improving outcomes.
    So, with this article, the authors want to highlight the opportunities and challenges
    IoT faces in realizing this vision of the future of health care. One of the major
    critical issues generally affecting the medical sector, particularly the application
    of the IoT paradigm to the medical field, is general patient and user data management.
    Since this is sensitive content, proper management of the collected big data is
    crucial. “Big data” represents vast amounts of information with revolutionary
    potential, including medical records, patient records, medical examination results,
    and IoT devices. In the article [44], an effective architecture for managing big
    data in the medical field is presented, given this background. The management
    and analysis of these data require advanced approaches to extract meaningful information.
    The challenges associated with each stage of extensive data management can only
    be overcome through high-quality computing solutions for analysis. Therefore,
    healthcare providers must have adequate infrastructure to generate and analyze
    big data systematically to propose solutions to improve public health. Efficient
    management, analysis, and interpretation of big data can change the landscape
    of modern healthcare. This is why several sectors, including healthcare, are taking
    decisive steps to transform this potential into improved services and financial
    benefits. Modern healthcare organizations can revolutionize medical therapies
    and personalized medicine with robust biomedical and healthcare data integration.
    As mentioned above, numerous studies have also been conducted in the medical field
    regarding wearable devices: wearable health sensors can monitor the wearer’s health
    and surroundings in real time. As sensor hardware technologies and operating systems
    have advanced, the capabilities of wearable devices have gradually expanded to
    include more diverse forms and more precise physiological indicators. These sensors
    are evolving toward high accuracy, continuity, and comfort, contributing significantly
    to the advancement of personalized health care. In this context, we can refer
    to the article [45] that studies just how flexible medical devices designed to
    monitor human vital signs, such as body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate,
    blood pressure, pulse oxygenation, and blood glucose find applications in both
    fitness monitoring and medical diagnostics; or the article [46] that focuses on
    wearable biosensors used for health monitoring in different situations, exploring
    the technological development, commercial, ethical aspects, and future of wearable
    sensors for health monitoring. Specifically, the article [45] reviews the most
    recent developments in flexible, wearable human life sensors, outlining and discussing
    the essential components needed for such sensors. This includes the sensor systems
    used, sensing mechanisms, sensor fabrication processes, energy requirements, and
    data processing requirements. On the other hand, in the article [46], the authors
    focus on using wearable health sensors in the medical field, which can monitor
    both the user’s health and surroundings in real-time. In fact, under the rapid
    development of IoT, some sensor chips are equipped with circuits for data reading,
    signal conditioning, and wireless communication modules for data transmission
    to computing equipment, and concurrently, for the analysis of data from wearable
    health sensors, most companies make use of artificial neural networks (ANNs),
    which enable them to effectively provide users with relevant health feedback by
    exploiting the physiological response of the human body. Specifically, wearable
    sensors can transmit data to the control unit, which analyzes it and returns health
    status feedback to the user through the computer. This mechanism represents the
    working principle of wearable health sensors. Finally, the article [31] discusses
    how innovations such as big data, ambient intelligence, and wearable devices can
    be leveraged in healthcare. The IoT revolution significantly shapes modern healthcare,
    offering promising technological, economic, and social prospects. This paper examines
    advances in IoT-based healthcare technologies on the one hand, exploring modern
    network architectures and platforms, applications, and industry trends within
    IoT-based healthcare solutions, and on the other hand, analyzes the distinctive
    security and privacy features of IoT, understanding security requirements, threat
    models, and attack taxonomies from a healthcare perspective. In particular, the
    authors propose an intelligent collaborative security model to mitigate security
    risks. In addition, the paper addresses various policies and regulations related
    to IoT and eHealth in different parts of the world, examining how they can facilitate
    sustainable development in economies and societies. Finally, some directions for
    future research in IoT-based healthcare are outlined based on several open questions
    and challenges. 3. Proposed Approach The development of modern medical discipline
    is closely influenced by the integration of IoT with telemedicine, especially
    regarding spa facilities. Such merging of technologies allows for a new vision
    to enhance therapeutic treatments’ effectiveness, reliability, and individualization,
    enabling a revolution in monitoring treatment experiences and the quality of patient
    care. The so-called IoT devices, namely smartwatches, wearable bracelets, and
    advanced sensors, allow remote consultations and patient monitoring. Such devices
    enable real-time collection of essential data, such as heart rate, body temperature,
    and blood oxygen levels, which can be transmitted to centralized monitoring systems
    for accurate analysis. This approach facilitates more accurate diagnoses and consultations
    based on up-to-date data and decreases periodic hospital visits, improving chronic
    disease management, as evidenced by several studies [30,47,48]. Mobile applications
    connected to IoT devices are essential in integrated health management. They function
    as interfaces for patients, allowing them to access their health data, manage
    prescriptions, and interact directly with physicians. These apps encourage a proactive
    approach to health and help patients become more involved in their treatment,
    as outlined in [27,28,49]. Using IoT in healthcare, communication between patients
    and physicians improves significantly. Devices with real-time notification capabilities
    enable timely intervention in case of anomalies in patient data, while telemedicine
    platforms integrated with messaging and video-consulting capabilities offer direct
    and personalized communication. This improved interactivity allows treatments
    to be tailored to the specific needs of patients, adapting therapies promptly
    based on their responses, as noted in [23,28]. Despite its innumerable benefits,
    integrating IoT into telemedicine poses significant challenges regarding data
    security and privacy. Safeguarding sensitive patient data is paramount and requires
    the adoption of advanced encryption protocols and compliance with privacy regulations.
    These critical issues are the focus of debates and research in this area, as reported
    in [21,23,27]. The methodological proposal described is situated in the field
    of innovation and technological advancement in health and wellness. This approach
    is characterized by its articulation in two phases, which is essential to enabling
    accurate and constant monitoring of the health status of patients in the spa context.
    The goal of the approach, depicted in Figure 1, involves comprehensive monitoring
    of patients during their visit to the spa facilities and during their return to
    daily life. The proposed general framework is developed through a software architecture
    that integrates IoT objects serving both patients and expert users and can monitor
    patients. Figure 1. General framework. The proposed architecture, represented
    in Figure 2, includes several layers through which the monitoring and services
    offered by the system are developed. In the acquisition layer are the hardware
    devices, which are functional for monitoring and managing patients and the facility.
    The devices can be wearables, such as smartwatches capable of monitoring health-related
    parameters during and after treatment, or passive presence sensors to monitor
    actual utilization and the right timing of treatments. In addition, in this context,
    IoT nodes include devices capable of collecting information on patients’ conditions,
    environmental and micro-environmental conditions in the spa facility, and material
    and structural alterations relevant to patients’ well-being. IoT nodes may also
    include actuators dedicated, for example, to regulating indoor climate. In addition
    to these data, other helpful information for the system can be integrated using
    external services such as repositories of medical records that can describe patients’
    health conditions. The second module represents the core of the architecture.
    This module checks, validates, and pre-processes data, making them homogeneous
    and available for storage. Pre-processing helps extract the information needed
    to preserve patient well-being, feeding the IoT platform responsible for storing
    the data and making it available remotely. Next, the data can be shared with the
    inference block, which leverages machine learning-based approaches to process
    the data. In the inference engine, learning models are selected and used to exploit
    the entire flow from the data, based on which the monitoring and decision-making
    applications are based. Through the services module, the knowledge and models
    obtained in the core architecture are made available to the application module,
    which deals with patient monitoring to support expert users. The implemented applications
    aim at patients and expert users, such as physicians and health care providers.
    In particular, expert users are able to access the information provided, including
    data and statistics on the trend of the health conditions of patients and the
    spa facility, capable of suggesting diagnoses and decisions to support patients
    and the spa facility itself (treatments to be delivered, temperature and humidity
    regulation, air quality control, energy optimization, etc.). Simple users, i.e.,
    patients, can also benefit, even in real-time, by applying the treatment information
    to be followed. In addition, through the services module, simple users can make
    judgments toward the application and treatments; on the other hand, expert users
    can access more detailed information for monitoring patients, treatment status,
    and the facility, sending, if necessary, valuable notifications to patients. Figure
    2. Proposed architecture. For the initial development of the system, smartwatches
    and presence beacon sensors were relied upon, while device monitoring and management,
    data collection, processing, and visualization were made available with the support
    of the open-source IoT platform Thingsboard, from which data for the development
    of the first application prototypes could be derived. Thanks to the proposed architecture,
    the methodological framework is developed through two main phases that lead to
    the timely and continuous monitoring of patient’s health in spa facilities, both
    during the treatment period and after their departure. In the first phase, there
    is a focus on using devices specifically developed for monitoring patients within
    healthcare settings. These devices, equipped with state-of-the-art sensors and
    sophisticated sensing technologies, can capture various data regarding patients’
    physiological and clinical conditions, including heart rate, blood pressure, body
    temperature, motor activities, and other significant parameters. These data are
    captured in real-time and sent to a centralized data analysis system, which enables
    constant monitoring of the patient’s health status and early identification of
    any changes or irregularities. In the second phase of the methodology, we focus
    on the following monitoring of patients once they have finished their treatment
    at the spa facility. Upon returning to their daily activities, patients can continue
    to be monitored through the technology of mobile devices in their possession,
    such as smartphones, smartwatches, or other wearable devices. With this strategy,
    the patient’s health monitoring continues beyond their stay in the spa facility.
    The remote follow-up approach ensures continuous supervision of patients’ health
    status, even after they leave the spa, so that the long-term validity of the treatment
    program can be assessed and any relapses or complications can be recognized early.
    This system also allows patients to actively monitor their health, providing up-to-date
    data on medical parameters and suggestions and guidance to encourage a proper
    lifestyle. 3.1. On-Site Monitoring The monitoring process during spa therapy (Figure
    3) is implemented through wearable devices, distributed to patients when the therapy
    cycle begins and returned at the end of the therapy cycle. These devices are crucial
    to achieving continuous, transparent, and non-invasive monitoring of vital values,
    including heart rate, blood oxygenation levels, body movements, and other parameters
    relevant to the therapy cycle. The key to these devices is their ability to operate
    autonomously: patients are not required to relate directly to them or other devices,
    as monitoring occurs fully automatically without any external intervention. Data
    recorded by the wearable devices are collected and conveyed through a network
    of Beacon devices strategically placed within the spa facilities. These Beacon
    devices are designed for efficient and secure data collection, thus ensuring maximum
    privacy and protection of users’ personal information. Through this network, continuous,
    real-time data collection can be performed, thus providing a timely and up-to-date
    picture of the results and progress of the spa treatment. One of the main benefits
    of this approach is total clarity for the user: patients do not have to deal with
    handling or interfacing with the wearable or other devices during therapy. This
    allows them to devote themselves exclusively to treatment without distractions
    or difficulties related to the use of technological equipment. Monitoring through
    wearable devices also provides more accurate and detailed data collection than
    traditional methods, allowing a wide variety of parameters to be recorded continuously
    and in real time. This aspect is essential for comprehensive evaluation of therapy
    results and confirmation of the effectiveness of the treatment itself. Finally,
    the collected data are automatically sent to a confidential IoT cloud platform,
    which takes care of its storage for subsequent analysis and processing. This step
    is crucial to ensure that the collected information is available for in-depth
    analysis and to support evidence-based and reliable medical choices. In this way,
    thermal monitoring becomes not only a means of assessing the immediate effects
    of therapy but also a tool for understanding the long-term impact on patients’
    comfort and health. Figure 3. On-site monitoring architecture. 3.2. Data Collection
    The management and organization of medically acquired data, particularly in spa
    facilities, is a complex and delicate challenge that requires specific attention
    to the safeguarding and secrecy of patients’ personal and sensitive information.
    This issue assumes paramount importance given the need to comply with strict privacy
    regulations and protect patients’ rights by ensuring their privacy is protected
    throughout data collection and management. One of the most significant issues
    in this area is the association of collected data with the identity of individual
    patients while ensuring the confidentiality of private information. To ensure
    that the data collected during therapeutic monitoring comply with privacy regulations,
    avoiding any direct connection between the collected data and the patient’s identity
    is crucial. This requirement implies the need to find an effective way to track
    the origin of data collected during treatment without using personal identifiers.
    Within this framework, one standard method is to produce a unique, random code
    for each patient upon check-in at the spa facility. Typically presented as a bar
    code, this code simplifies re-registration and monitoring of treatment anonymously
    on subsequent days without the need to match identifying data to the patient.
    As a result, the collected data remain anonymous, preventing the patient’s identity
    from being traced through the monitored information. Management of this barcode
    system involves careful organization and tracking. It is essential to ensure that
    bar codes are correctly associated with the corresponding patients and recorded
    accurately in the computer systems. In addition, it is essential to keep detailed
    records of the codes associated with each patient and the treatments performed
    to ensure that the data are recorded correctly and can be traced back to the right
    patient when needed. The parameters tracked by the wearable devices were selected
    to monitor and evaluate critical aspects of the care pathway. These parameters
    include, but are not limited to, cardiac activity, blood oxygenation, movement
    and physical activity, and other factors relevant to the therapeutic setting.
    The choice of these parameters is based on the desire to obtain a comprehensive,
    decontextualized view of the effectiveness of the therapeutic process, thus enabling
    accurate assessment of the patient’s progress and the overall effectiveness of
    the spa therapy. 3.3. Follow-Up Monitoring Follow-up monitoring, the second key
    component of our methodological approach, aims to capture a comprehensive set
    of clinical and behavioral parameters to concretely assess the effectiveness of
    spa therapy, even after patients have left the facility (Figure 4). This extended
    monitoring phase is crucial for understanding treatment’s long-term benefits and
    detecting early signs of relapse or post-therapy complications. In daily life,
    where patients may not have access to precision hardware instrumentation or complex
    monitoring systems, the method leverages the use of health services embedded in
    popular mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS. These services serve
    as interface platforms with a wide range of health monitoring applications, making
    it possible to aggregate and analyze various health status data provided by users’
    mobile devices. The type and volume of data collected vary greatly depending on
    the user’s specific hardware and software capabilities. For example, a user wearing
    a smartwatch or fitness tracker can produce physical activity data such as steps,
    distance traveled, calories burned, and even heart rate information and an initial
    analysis of stress levels based on fluctuations in heart rate variability. Figure
    4. Follow-up monitoring architecture. Moreover, suppose the device is equipped
    with suitable sensors. In that case, it can keep track of aspects such as sleep
    quality, noting its duration, stages, and interruptions, thus contributing to
    a detailed analysis of the user’s overall level of well-being. In this technological
    scenario, one of the main challenges is ensuring the privacy and security of user
    data. To overcome this obstacle, we propose to adopt a specially dedicated mobile
    application that users can download to their smartphones. This application interfaces
    with the device’s health services in a way that complies with privacy and security
    requirements. Access to the app is via a unique code generated at the time of
    patient registration to ensure that the data collected is securely and anonymously
    associated with the user’s identity. Monitoring through the app is fully automated
    and continues throughout the treatment period, capturing daily data from the device’s
    health services, such as heart rate, step count, sleep data, and more. This information
    is then coded and transferred to a centralized cloud platform. This cloud platform
    acts as a data collection, storage, and analysis hub, allowing healthcare providers
    and researchers to access the data in a secure and privacy-friendly manner. This
    integrated mobile health services system and a dedicated app provide a convenient,
    intuitive, and secure method for extensive health monitoring, which is essential
    in this context. It enables the smooth integration of technology into a patient’s
    daily life while ensuring consistent and reliable data collection, improving therapeutic
    interventions’ effectiveness, and promoting personalized health care. Integrating
    our innovative thermal monitoring system with existing electronic healthcare systems
    is a crucial step in optimizing the effectiveness and performance of the care
    process. This synergy ensures the smooth sharing of clinical information, which
    enhances the holistic and coordinated management of patient health. The aim is
    to facilitate the exchange of vital data, such as medical history and test results,
    between our system and health systems to give professionals a comprehensive view
    of the patient’s health status. 3.4. Interoperability with Electronic Health Systems
    in the Context of the Framework for Thermal Monitoring Interoperability reaffirms
    the essential role of continuous care, allowing interested specialists to consult
    the results obtained by a patient at a therapeutic center, especially for people
    undergoing treatment for chronic diseases. Moreover, we can ensure a continuous
    update of patient information, which makes timely interventions possible in case
    of need. To this end, we use standardized data exchange protocols, such as HL7
    or FHIR, ensuring the security of exchanges without risk of misunderstanding.
    The presence of robust APIs facilitates the perfect integration of the system
    with the various types of platforms present in the field of health safety. Furthermore,
    we do not disregard transparency and security issues, introducing strict personal
    data security processes at the time of data reception and consultation. Intense
    verification activity ensures that this synergy is free of compromises in functionality
    or reliability, just as targeted update activity makes management procedures effective.
    The benefits deriving from this type of integration are evident: improving the
    health treatment of the individual patient by guaranteeing healthcare professionals
    the possibility to have a comprehensive view of their health level, enhancing
    performance through the saving of tests and treatments, and keeping the patient
    at the forefront within their care pathway, providing them with a safe and accessible
    approach to various clinical data. In practice, it not only increases the reliability
    of the treatment but also facilitates the connection of the healthcare system
    with that of the patient. It also contributes to creating a treatment model more
    suited to their characteristics, promoting greater interdisciplinarity and a greater
    awareness of the patient’s needs. 3.5. Machine Learning Developing an ML algorithm
    within the thermal treatment framework allows for exploring new potentials in
    the predictive analysis of health parameters. These algorithms can process historical
    and current information to understand dynamics and forecast potential health risks,
    such as heart conditions identified through heart rate monitoring or physical
    activity. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally valuable
    for customizing thermal treatment paths, as it suggests adjustments based on patient
    characteristics to optimize therapeutic effects. By analyzing parameters related
    to physical activity and rest, AI can recognize early symptoms of new diseases,
    such as neurological or musculoskeletal issues. This capability is indispensable
    for preventive intervention and addressing potential adverse complications. Thanks
    to its integration into our system, this functionality can assist healthcare providers
    in their operations, suggesting optimal patient management and identifying patient
    categories that require further medical treatment. The ability of AI and ML to
    adapt and continuously improve their performance based on received data outcomes
    is an essential factor. This technology, used to enhance the communication of
    our solution within telemedicine infrastructures, facilitates collaboration between
    patient and doctor and eases the home delivery of thermal services. Security and
    privacy guarantees are priority aspects, and AI helps to reinforce them by detecting
    and countering unauthorized access or anomalous data consultation pathways. The
    capacity of AI systems to respond in a personalized manner to patient needs through
    their mobile applications, offering advice on healthy lifestyle behaviors and
    autonomous management of health issues based on detected data, represents an additional
    benefit. In summary, integrating AI and ML into therapeutic disciplines improves
    the quality of therapeutic processes. It helps expand the patient’s perception
    and support from healthcare providers, making the healthcare system even more
    integrated, organized, and attentive to the needs of each patient. 3.6. Mobile
    APP Integration Developing a mobile app integrated into the advanced thermal monitoring
    system has been a significant advantage in realizing more efficient and pleasant
    patient care. Designed as a logical extension of our diagnostic tools, this new
    app also features an interactive and user-friendly interface that allows patients
    to exercise active and conscious control over their health management. Through
    the app, our patients have the opportunity to benefit from specific consultations,
    elaborated based on their data collected through the various sensors and specific
    interactions and lifestyle habits. Therefore, for example, if the patient has
    identified an increased state of stress, they can offer specific wellness or relaxation
    guidance to mitigate the state of stress. In addition, the program also offers
    its users the opportunity to achieve and control individual wellness goals, such
    as improving rest conditions or limiting stressors. These goals can be supported
    through a system-based feedback process encouraging patients to follow or correct
    their programs effectively. The app can be used for additional data, such as daily
    mood, pain-related complaints, nutritional preferences, and hydration conditions.
    This provides a much better and more in-depth view of the subject’s health level,
    going beyond the simple parameters acquired independently by the sensing devices.
    An essential role is also played by the app’s notification and reporting technology,
    thanks to which timely alerts can be sent following the monitoring of any abnormalities
    in the patient’s safety parameters or the reminder of any therapies and medical
    examinations that need to be performed. The interface design has been carefully
    crafted to ensure ease of use by different users, providing graphical and grammatical
    explanations such that navigation and use of the app are straightforward and intuitive
    (Figure 5). The app’s various screens allow for the integration of the subject’s
    data with information on the medical course to be taken; a section linked to the
    therapy program schedule provides a view of the day’s schedule and upcoming treatments
    that will take place in the same month. The thermal control system, fully coordinated
    with this app, ensures a continuous and direct passage of data through the wearable
    devices and the app itself. It makes the information collected easily accessible
    in a special section of the app to allow for real-time insights and feedback.
    In that section, not only are all the parameters of the monitoring system reported
    and represented in real-time and day by day but it is also possible to view the
    trend detected in previous weeks in terms of frequency or past months. Figure
    5. Example of app’s interface design. In terms of protection and confidentiality,
    the app uses very effective encryption protocols that ensure the security of one’s
    health data during data transmission and storage. In addition, the role it plays
    in providing ongoing support to patients, even after the end of the spa treatment
    cycle, is crucial. In this way, subjects can follow up on their well-being and
    retain the correct practices adopted during their spa stay, promoting more effective
    management of their quality of life in the long run. Therefore, incorporating
    a mobile application into the spa’s control device allows it to elevate the services
    offered further and contribute to better patient participation and awareness in
    managing their health condition. An ad hoc platform, on the other hand, would
    allow the physician to monitor the patient’s levels in constant time during the
    spa treatment and in the weeks and months following (Figure 6). After logging
    in, he or she would identify the subject among those in treatment, select the
    therapeutic method, and monitor the parameters through an interactive dashboard,
    which can also be shared with the client himself or herself, if required. Finally,
    through such a platform, the physician can also decide to forward personalized
    and direct alerts to the patient when abnormal situations occur during treatment
    or at the end of therapy to correct erroneous behavior on the part of the patient.
    Such a significant approach constitutes a major advancement in the field of spa
    care, as it puts technology at the center of the patient’s healing and wellness
    journey. Figure 6. Example of medical platform interface. As mentioned in the
    proposed system, user experience plays a key role, so it must be considered in
    many aspects. First and foremost is security: because the system collects sensitive
    patient data, it is necessary to ensure data confidentiality and include protocols
    for managing access permissions and respecting privacy, among which, for example,
    anonymization of sensitive data so that it cannot be directly linked to specific
    individuals, or encryption of data to protect it from unauthorized access during
    transmission and storage may be helpful. In addition to the issue of security,
    user acceptance is significant. Before treatment begins, patients are appropriately
    informed and trained concerning how data are acquired and used so that they are
    fully aware of the journey they are facing, not only medically but also informatically.
    Ensuring an optimal user experience balances several factors that precise rules
    cannot establish because they change according to the type of experience one wants
    to provide and the type of system created. That is why it makes sense to involve
    professionals from different fields who can improve the user experience from multiple
    perspectives. The protection of personal health data against unauthorized and
    unlawful attacks plays a central role today, particularly given the consequences
    that could result. A multifaceted encryption strategy must be employed in the
    sensitive area of clinical file management within IoT and ML systems. The combination
    of asymmetric and symmetric encryption is undoubtedly an effective solution. Asymmetric
    encryption, such as RSA, can be used in cases where it is essential to exchange
    keys securely, and symmetric encryption, such as AES, is preferred in cases of
    data encryption itself, given its validity in large data sets. Encryption of deposited
    data must adhere to strict encryption standards, among which AES-256 is the basic
    standard for data protection in storage devices. Regarding data transfers, procedures
    such as the TLS protocol accompanied by the issuance by trusted certification
    bodies must be used to guarantee the passage of data over networks. End-to-end
    encryption is essential in situations where sensitive data are exchanged between
    patients and healthcare personnel to ensure that only the relevant parties can
    access this information. In addition to this, certain innovative features of encryption,
    such as homomorphic encryption, ensure, for instance, that ML applications process
    their data without decrypting it, preserving privacy at all times. Again, thanks
    to attribute-based cryptography, sophisticated access control mechanisms can be
    applied to medical facilities, which must strictly manage data access according
    to specific roles and competencies. The use of blockchain technologies in decentralized
    cryptography also makes it possible, for instance, to create a protected and immutable
    ledger that can ensure the integrity and traceability of data movements. Implementing
    such techniques at the cryptographic level requires a comprehensive architecture
    and strict adherence to standard key-handling practices, including periodic key
    rotation, secure storage via hardware security devices, and the choice of a zero-trust
    architecture to ensure controlled and authorized data entry. As mentioned, this
    structure must also establish stringent data management and storage procedures,
    anonymization techniques, and secure data exchange protocols following the General
    Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
    Act (HIPAA), if applicable. Privacy is a concern that goes beyond the technical
    elements of data security, as it relates to the right of individuals to exercise
    control over personal information. This is why we intend to explore the balance
    between using cryptography and using IoT and ML applications in healthcare. Implementing
    techniques such as data anonymization and pseudonymization are to be considered.
    As is the issue of consent. Indeed, patients must be informed about the processing
    of their data. This implies the collection of informed opinions in transparent
    and understandable language to ensure that the patient knows his or her rights
    and the destination of the health data concerning him or her. Embedding such ethical
    considerations within will align the practice with best practices and promote
    IoT and ML applications in healthcare responsibly, fostering acceptance and ensuring
    that consumers and the healthcare community embrace them. Furthermore, it should
    be emphasized that obtaining informed consent in IoT and ML healthcare applications
    goes beyond traditional methods. Finally, creating a supervisory body to verify
    compliance with the ethical use of individual health data and enforce compliance
    would also be beneficial. 4. Validation and Results In order to effectively begin
    the search for an evaluation of an application realized within the framework of
    modern medicine, a methodical principle has been adopted, which consists of using
    a particular test; in this case, the verification criteria include a range of
    well-designed actions and questions directed at both patients and doctors, each
    of which aims to evaluate specific elements peculiar to the app. The validation
    of an application in modern medicine is a crucial process involving patients and
    healthcare professionals. This process aims to verify the app’s effectiveness,
    usability, and security, ensuring that it meets the needs and expectations of
    both parties. In the introductory phase, the main objective is to determine how
    the app can improve health management, doctor-patient communication, and access
    to health information. In addition, the validation process includes extensive
    testing to ensure compliance with health regulations and the protection of patient
    data. The app’s impact on the efficiency of clinical processes and its ability
    to integrate with existing health information systems are also assessed. The participation
    of the patient and healthcare personnel in the testing and feedback phase is indispensable
    to verify that the application meets the requirements of the end users and contributes
    to a concrete increase in the quality of the service and services provided. Key
    elements of this evaluation process include usability and ease of navigating the
    app, which is crucial to ensure that users, both patients and health professionals,
    can effortlessly find the information they need, e.g., data on various therapies,
    tips on treatment management, and more general guidance on their well-being. The
    app’s contents’ accuracy, efficiency, and transparency are also assessed, as these
    are decisive criteria for ensuring the availability of up-to-date and reliable
    elements necessary for understanding and safely dealing with the prescribed treatment.
    The app’s clarification of therapeutic prescriptions, intake times, and management
    of possible unwanted reactions are also examined. Another critical point analyzed
    is ensuring the protection and confidentiality of health information collected
    with the app. This aspect of the analysis, in which privacy and data protection
    are paramount, aims to ensure that the app adopts precise protocols for protecting
    sensitive patient information. Users are asked to express their perceptions about
    protecting their health information while using the app, with questions about
    data security and concerns about confidentiality or loss of information. Finally,
    special attention is paid to the intuitiveness of the graphical interface. This
    includes assessing how easy it is for a newcomer to understand and use the program
    without extensive assistance, which can strongly affect its overall adoption and
    effectiveness in the medical context. The experimentation part was developed in
    the field, making the system available in the evaluation phase to several spa
    facilities that had the entire cycle of the spa experience itself, thus including
    the medical part. The experimentation was strongly desired concerning both types
    of development and, thus, types of users, as regards both the users of spa services
    and the health professionals who follow the patients. For this reason, it was
    decided to keep the two evaluations separate to be able to have more detail concerning
    the parameters taken into account by the data provided by the sensors. The accurate
    evaluation makes it possible to establish transparently that the product meets
    the requirements for proper use in wellness and health. The survey covered 128
    users who had undergone a course of spa treatments during the past six months.
    In the context of the survey conducted among patients who used the health service
    with the support of the application, several questions were asked to evaluate
    various elements of the application, such as the usability and intuitiveness of
    the user interface, the accuracy of the health information reported by the application,
    and the ability of the application itself to contribute to the improvement of
    the patient’s health quality. The responses were evaluated based on a satisfaction
    scale. In particular, a rating scale from 1 to 5 was used, where 1 indicated minimum
    satisfaction, and 5 indicated maximum satisfaction on the part of the patients.
    From the analysis of the collected results (Figure 7), the app’s user interface
    was perceived as highly intuitive, with an average rating of 4.4. Regarding the
    accuracy of the health information provided by the app, patients gave a generally
    positive rating, with an average of 4.0. Ultimately, the survey revealed that
    the app significantly improved patient health management, with an average rating
    of 4.2. These results indicate a general appreciation and perceived application
    effectiveness among its users. Figure 7. Results of a questionnaire submitted
    to patients. As mentioned above, the experimental phase also consisted of a validation
    of the experimental system by healthcare professionals; in this case, the objective
    was to take into account the parameters of the sensors and how the patient’s profile
    was described within the application to improve the patient-doctor relationship
    and the effectiveness of the proposed treatment in real-time. Using the same methods
    and criteria, it was also possible to evaluate the functioning of the mobile application
    designed for healthcare professionals. A group of 26 doctors was interviewed through
    the administration of the specially prepared questionnaire to assess its validity
    for monitoring clinical factors, both in terms of the accuracy and punctuality
    of the medical information provided and the ease of consulting the information
    relating to patients, and, above all, to verify how practical the application
    was in reducing the work performed, by decreasing the amount of time spent on
    collecting and comparing patient data. Also, in this case, the responses (Figure
    8) were collected on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 indicated the lowest degree of
    satisfaction/effectiveness and five the highest. The results highlighted a significant
    level of perceived effectiveness in using the application for patient monitoring,
    with an average rating of 4.4. Ease of access to patient data was rated an average
    of 4.2, indicating a well-designed user interface and efficient navigation. Furthermore,
    the application was rated positively regarding its contribution to doctors’ work
    efficiency, with an average of 4.5, suggesting that the app facilitates more efficient
    time management and better organization of health information. Figure 8. Results
    of a questionnaire submitted to healthcare staff. These findings highlight the
    importance of well-designed applications in the context of digital medicine, offering
    healthcare professionals practical tools for patient monitoring and health data
    management with a positive impact on the efficiency of their work. Furthermore,
    feedback provided by patients and healthcare professionals is essential to continuously
    improve the application, ensuring that it meets user needs and expectations in
    terms of functionality, ease of use, information effectiveness, and data security.
    Therefore, from the in-depth and analytical review of the responses collected,
    a significant dichotomy emerges in the priorities and perceptions between the
    two main groups of users interviewed. From the patient’s perspective, the predominant
    factors determining the medical application’s value and usefulness are accessibility
    and ease of use. This group of users emphasizes the application’s ability to be
    intuitive, easily navigable, and without complex access barriers, making the user
    experience seamless and frustration-free. To meet this need, a voice assistance
    functionality is proposed. This solution should allow users to interact with the
    application through voice commands, thus facilitating access even for those who
    may find it challenging to use touchscreen interfaces, such as old age or individuals
    with physical limitations. On the other hand, the user segment, which consists
    of healthcare professionals, such as doctors, emphasizes crucial aspects such
    as the accuracy and reliability of the data provided by the application. This
    group places great importance on the correctness, accuracy, and timeliness of
    the app’s clinical information collected and managed. In addition, there is a
    strong demand for application integration with other clinical tools and systems,
    emphasizing the need for a cohesive and interconnected digital ecosystem that
    supports efficient healthcare workflow and optimal patient management. Therefore,
    the main objective is to create seamless interoperability between the application
    and patient management systems commonly used in clinical environments. This could
    involve the development of advanced application programming interfaces (APIs)
    that enable secure and efficient data exchange between the app and healthcare
    databases, thus ensuring timely and accurate updating of patient information.
    Furthermore, the improved integration should make it easier for doctors to access
    vital data directly from the application, enabling faster and more informed clinical
    decision-making. This divergence in priorities and needs between patients and
    doctors highlights the essentiality of a holistic, balanced, and multi-perspective
    approach in designing and developing medical applications. It is imperative that
    such applications not only meet the requirements of ease of use and accessibility
    required by patients but also integrate elements of high precision, data reliability,
    and interoperability with other systems, as required by medical personnel. This
    balance between usability and technical integration is critical to ensuring that
    the application is practical and positively impacts both individual health management
    and the efficiency of the overall healthcare system. Based, therefore, on the
    conclusions reached during the validation phase of the application, a user-centered
    approach was adopted, which ensures that the application not only fulfills the
    essential technical criteria but also responds effectively and directly to the
    needs specific to both patients and healthcare professionals. This orientation
    towards the needs of end users promotes more informative and connected healthcare
    management, characterized by a more fluid interaction between the different actors
    involved, effectively optimizing the app’s functionality and ease of use. The
    application validation process, therefore, turns out to be a crucial element in
    the life cycle of a technological solution in the medical field. Through validation,
    we ensure that the application is not only up to date with the latest technological
    innovations but also deeply integrated and responsive to the real needs of the
    healthcare sector. Validation, therefore, acts as a bridge between technological
    development and practical application, ensuring that innovations are both technologically
    advanced and meaningful and valuable for improving healthcare. In summary, the
    validation process allows the app to be refined regarding functionality, usability,
    and relevance, making it an indispensable tool in digital health. Despite the
    positive results achieved during operational trials, several crucial points and
    challenges emerged while developing the IoT system prototypes for SPA and wellness
    applications. One of the most critical difficulties in evaluating and protecting
    users’ data is a growing concern in an era in which data protection is highly
    topical. The realization of the prototype underlined the need to adopt new protection
    techniques to protect and safeguard personal data. New encryption and operator
    authentication technologies had to be implemented in compliance with current privacy
    protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    [22,23]. Such measures are indispensable for preserving valuable patient health
    resources that IoT devices detect. A further significant need was integrating
    the IoT device into the existing hardware infrastructure at the spa clinics. This
    integration entailed a modular and versatile design to achieve a reliable and
    comprehensive data collection capable of responding to the different hardware
    configurations at the spas. Despite the difficulties, the device integrated smoothly
    with standard services and equipment, ensuring the system’s viability. A further
    period of field testing has been scheduled for a complete evaluation of all aspects
    of the system and the collection of direct information from the leading figures
    involved, allowing for a more precise definition of the system’s configuration
    parameters. This test will improve the product’s characteristics, particularly
    regarding the data visualization part, and introduce further innovations based
    on what has been learned from users and operators in the field. Therefore, in
    conclusion, the prototype system for IoT applications in the spa and wellness
    sector showed considerable potential despite some challenges encountered during
    the handling of personal information and integration with existing hardware. The
    planned extended field-testing phase will provide more information to optimize
    the system and make it a valuable tool in the wellness and spa sector. At this
    point in the analysis of the results obtained, considerations can be made regarding
    the benefits and advantages of the proposed system compared with classical therapeutic
    spa treatments. For a proper comparative analysis, we evaluate several factors
    and indicators of effectiveness. Among these, the most important ones to consider
    are certainly treatment efficiency and clinical effectiveness, which most of all
    determine the success of the treatment. Treatment efficiency, for example, translates
    to better patient management for healthcare professionals while reducing user
    waiting times. This is possible thanks to new technologies and, in particular,
    thanks to the utilization of the mobile application that allows the optimization
    of treatment planning and, consequently, increases the number of patients who
    can be treated simultaneously due to the possibility of keeping their medical
    records always available and retrievable online. Clinical efficacy, on the other
    hand, is precisely mirrored by successful treatment, which means producing measurable
    and meaningful benefits for patients. With the application of the IoT paradigm,
    it is possible to personalize treatment to make it more effective. In contrast,
    ML techniques make it possible to develop predictive models, which are crucial
    in managing complications. Unlike traditional methodologies, possible complications
    or risks associated with certain medical conditions can be detected early, allowing
    healthcare professionals to intervene and manage them in a suitable timeframe.
    Implementing IoT technologies in spa treatments can enable better resource management,
    such as optimizing treatment schedules based on equipment or staff availability,
    and allows for improvement in aspects such as real-time monitoring and feedback,
    which are benefits closely linked to new technologies. In real-time, healthcare
    providers can intervene in treatment and interact with patients, even after the
    course has ended and outside of the spa facilities; this does not apply to traditional
    treatment, making the proposed method much more efficient. Overall, the use of
    new technologies in medical spa treatment, as opposed to traditional care, certainly
    allows for an improved experience for both healthcare professionals and patients.
    Although promising benefits for personalized treatment, current research in the
    area of IoT and ML is confronted with implicit limitations and associated risks
    that require in-depth reasoning that takes several aspects into account. One of
    the most relevant limitations lies in the fact that research in this particular
    application area is still at a preliminary stage. This scarcity of extensive and
    comparative studies means that the datasets on which ML algorithms are trained
    may no longer be representative of the entire community or of different conditions,
    which may lead to biased and non-heterogeneous results. As commented above, IoT
    devices in healthcare services present the concrete possibility of cyber-physical
    system breaches, whereby network weaknesses could be exploited to obtain sensitive
    health data or interfere with the devices’ operations. In this context, ML applications
    that require continuous processing need not only robust solutions in terms of
    data storage but also sophisticated tools for recognizing risk situations so as
    to identify and mitigate possible causes promptly. The proposed integration of
    these technologies also poses the scenario of limited human intervention, where
    reliance on IT devices may reduce the contribution of professionals in the delivery
    of care. This change runs the risk of affecting the existing therapeutic trust
    relationship with the patient, a founding element of traditional healthcare treatment
    and one that, through a path of awareness, must also be initiated concerning innovative
    technological systems, as is already the case in other fields and disciplines.
    5. Conclusions As in many other healthcare sectors, spa therapies are developing
    and taking advantage of new technologies, especially IoT. This promising paradigm
    represents a valuable tool for optimizing spa treatments by actively monitoring
    patients both inside and outside spa facilities. Such monitoring allows for accurate
    and precise measurement of essential parameters such as heart rate and blood oxygenation,
    which are essential for tracking therapy progress. The analysis of data collected
    through IoT offers new possibilities for improving the quality and effectiveness
    of spa therapies. By identifying any problems or unforeseen events in time, treatment
    can be more targeted for different types of patients. In this context, integrating
    ML techniques into the framework has enabled more sophisticated data management
    and analysis, providing a more detailed and personalized view of patients’ health
    status and their responses to treatments. In closing, it can be said that the
    use of IoT and ML in healthcare has proven valuable and in line with the goals
    of improving the management of users’ personal data and personalizing care. Regarding
    future developments, the prototype will be applied to a comprehensive case study
    to gather data and feedback from key stakeholders involved in the system. This
    will make a more in-depth evaluation of the method’s impact on spa treatments
    possible and identify further areas for refinement. Ultimately, the integration
    of advanced technologies such as IoT and ML into the spa treatment sector has
    shown significant innovation power, demonstrating significant potential in facilitating
    the management of users’ personal data and improving the personalization of spa
    treatments. Integrating these cutting-edge technologies offers a more specific
    and effective approach to therapy management, enabling more accurate and personalized
    care for each patient. Future Developments In future projections, it is expected
    that the application of the prototype can be expanded significantly with more
    extensive and more detailed studies. This implies collecting more data and feedback
    from a broad group of stakeholders involved in the care cycle. Such in-depth analysis
    will allow a more precise assessment of the real impact of the system on spa services,
    providing a clear view of the potential and areas that need further improvement.
    Expanding the prototype’s integration with a wide range of health services is
    among the most interesting future avenues. This expansion aims to create a more
    interconnected and responsive care ecosystem in which different healthcare facilities
    can interact in a more seamless and coordinated way. In addition, developing dedicated
    mobile applications for patients is another high-growth area. These applications
    will enable patients to actively monitor their health and receive personalized
    treatment advice in real-time, directly on their mobile devices. Another significant
    planned development is implementing artificial intelligence algorithms for more
    sophisticated and accurate data analysis. These algorithms could significantly
    improve the ability to predict treatment outcomes, tailor them to individual needs,
    and more effectively identify health patterns. Testing the system in a wide range
    of spa environments will allow its effectiveness to be evaluated in different
    treatment settings and health conditions, ensuring that the proposed solutions
    are versatile and adaptable to different therapeutic demands. Finally, it is critical
    to conduct long-term studies to understand the prolonged effects of using IoT
    monitoring and ML analytics on spa treatment outcomes. These studies will provide
    valuable information on the long-term effectiveness of these technologies in spa
    treatment management, contributing to a deeper understanding of how technological
    innovation can improve patients’ health and well-being. In sum, these future developments
    may lead to significant improvements in the patient experience and overall effectiveness
    of spa care, confirming the role of new technologies as crucial tools for improving
    health and well-being. Author Contributions Conceptualization, F.C. and D.S.;

  description: Scales are widely used in many agricultural applications, ranging from
    weighing crops at harvest to determine crop yields to regularly weighing animals
    to determine growth rate. In agricultural research applications, there is a long
    history of measuring crop water use (evapotranspiration [ET]) using a particular
    type of scale called weighing lysimeters. Typically, weighing lysimeters require
    very accurate data logging systems that tend to be expensive. Recent developments
    in open-source technologies, such as micro-controllers and Internet of Things
    (IoT) platforms, have created opportunities for developing effective and affordable
    ways to monitor crop water use and transmit the data to the Internet in near real-time.
    Therefore, this study aimed to create an affordable Internet of Things (IoT) scale
    system to measure crop ET. A scale system to monitor crop ET was developed using
    an Arduino-compatible microcontroller with cell phone communication, electronic
    load cells, an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) multiplexer, and analog-to-digital
    converters (ADCs). The system was powered by a LiPo battery, charged by a small
    (6 W) solar panel. The IoT scale system was programmed to collect data from the
    load cells at regular time intervals and send the data to the ThingSpeak IoT platform.
    The system performed successfully during indoor and outdoor experiments conducted
    in 2023 at the Clemson University Edisto Research and Education Center, Blackville,
    SC. Calibrations relating the measured output of the scale load cells to changes
    in mass resulted in excellent linear relationships during the indoor (r2 = 1.0)
    and outdoor experiments (r2 = 0.9994). The results of the outdoor experiments
    showed that the IoT scale system could accurately measure changes in lysimeter
    mass during several months (Feb to Jun) without failure in data collection or
    transmission. The changes in lysimeter mass measured during that period reflected
    the same trend as concurrent soil moisture data measured at a nearby weather station.
    The changes in lysimeter mass measured with the IoT scale system during the outdoor
    experiment were accurate enough to derive daily and hourly crop ET and even detect
    what appeared to be dew formation during the morning hours. The IoT scale system
    can be built using open-source, off-the-shelf electronic components which can
    be purchased online and easily replaced or substituted. The system can also be
    developed at a fraction of the cost of data logging, communication, and visualization
    systems typically used for lysimeter and scale applications.

    scales are used in agricultural applications for measuring crop yield, animal
    weight gain, crop inputs (i.e., fertilizer applications), etc. Weighing lysimeters,
    a particular type of scale system, are widely used in agricultural and hydrological
    research to measure crop evapotranspiration (ET). ET is the combined process of
    water evaporation from the soil surface and transpiration from plants, which is
    an essential component of the water cycle and plays a crucial role in the overall
    water balance of an ecosystem. There are many other ways to measure or estimate
    ET [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], but weighing lysimeters has long been considered the most
    accurate method [10] since lysimeters can accurately measure the changes in the
    total water mass of a fixed soil volume during a given time. A weighing lysimeter
    typically consists of a container with a known area equipped with electronic load
    cells or other weighing devices to measure changes in the lysimeter mass over
    time [11]. The container is typically buried in the ground, maintaining the soil
    and vegetation inside the container to simulate natural conditions as closely
    as possible. Weighing lysimeters are utilized under the working principle that
    changes in the lysimeter mass predominantly reflect the amount of water lost through
    ET. The water loss and ET rate during a given time can be obtained by continuously
    monitoring the total lysimeter mass. This method provides a direct and accurate
    measurement of ET, considering both the soil evaporation and plant transpiration
    processes. Over the years, many lysimeters have been installed worldwide using
    various designs and installation systems [12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23].
    ET data derived from lysimeter experiments have been used for many applications,
    such as studying the water requirements of different crops, evaluating the effectiveness
    of irrigation strategies, assessing the impact of climate change on ET patterns,
    and calibrating other methods and techniques for measuring and estimating ET [10,24].
    However, one of the primary purposes of utilizing weighing lysimeters in agriculture
    has been to derive the crop coefficient (Kc) curves needed to estimate daily ET
    from weather data [2,25,26]. Although there is a long history of using weighing
    lysimeters for measuring ET, typically, the electronics for reading the lysimeter
    load cells include a data logger [21] that collects and stores the data onsite,
    requiring researchers to visit the site regularly to download and visualize the
    data stored in the data logger. However, data loggers that are accurate enough
    to collect lysimeter data tend to be expensive, and equipping them with data communication
    capabilities adds additional initial and ongoing costs. New developments in open-source
    microelectronics (i.e., Arduino, Raspberry Pi) and data communication systems
    (i.e., radio, cellular, Wi-Fi) provide new opportunities for enhancing data collection
    and data communication for lysimeters and other scale systems used in agricultural
    applications [27,28]. The availability of Internet-connected devices via developing
    and applying Internet of Things (IoT) systems can make weighing lysimeters more
    affordable and convenient [29,30]. IoT systems enable the collection and transmission
    of real-time information accessible from anywhere in the world via the Internet
    using a computer or smartphone. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
    [31] regarded the IoT as a global infrastructure for the information society,
    enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things based
    on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies.
    The ITU also defined a device as a piece of equipment with the mandatory capabilities
    of communication and the optional capabilities of sensing, actuation, data capture,
    data storage, and data processing. In addition, other researchers [32] have suggested
    that in its simplest form, an IoT device is built around a microcontroller, a
    radio transceiver located above ground and with a more or less high communication
    range, a power source eventually recharged by a solar panel, and one or several
    connected sensors. Also, an additional component of an IoT system is the need
    for an Internet service to receive, store, organize, and display collected data.
    Initially, the IoT concept referred to devices and data transmission occurring
    above ground. The idea, however, has been expanded, and many researchers have
    been investigating applications with buried devices, giving rise to the Internet
    of Underground Things (IoUT) and wireless underground sensor network (WUSN) applications
    [32,33,34]. Interest is growing in technologies based on the Internet of Things
    (IoT) that provide means for researchers and farmers to find solutions for the
    better management of crop inputs (e.g., reducing the quantity and rate of fertilizers
    without sacrificing food production) [35]. A bibliometric review of the number
    of scientific publications relating IoT technologies and irrigation [36] found
    a steady increase in the number of publications on this subject from 2010 to 2016.
    This steady increase was followed by a rapid (i.e., exponential) increase in publications
    from 2016 to 2020. For example, a group of researchers in Portugal [35] developed
    an IoT system to monitor soil nutrients in horticulture, and another group [37]
    developed an IoT system to combine digital phenotyping with crop growth models.
    Their digital phenotyping included collecting data from a small lysimeter using
    an IoT system. Researchers in Brazil [38] developed an IoT system to monitor reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) using a weighing lysimeter. Researchers in Pakistan [39]
    used derived reference evapotranspiration (ETo), combining machine learning with
    weather data collected with an IoT system. Researchers in India [30] developed
    an IoT system for monitoring a micro-lysimeter for a greenhouse application. Similarly,
    a group of researchers in Australia [40] developed an IoT system for monitoring
    Nitrate in water, and another group [41] developed an IoT system for automating
    irrigation using real-time weather and soil moisture data. Although many researchers
    worldwide have used open-source electronics and the IoT for various applications
    in agriculture, including lysimetry, most of these applications have been developed
    utilizing Wi-Fi communication. However, the lack of Wi-Fi communication is an
    essential problem in many rural agricultural areas, which would limit the widespread
    application of IoT technologies in agriculture. In previous studies, our research
    team in the USA used open-source electronics to develop IoT systems for monitoring
    properties relevant to agricultural soil and water management and making the data
    available online in real-time using cell phone communication. For example, we
    designed three IoT systems for soil moisture monitoring [42,43,44] to assist growers
    in making more accurate and timely irrigation scheduling decisions based on real-time
    sensor data. Similarly, our team developed another IoT system to monitor agricultural
    runoff and collect water-quality samples from an agricultural field [45]. Therefore,
    building on our previous experience, this study aimed to create an affordable
    Internet of Things (IoT) scale system to measure crop ET. This study focused on
    building, testing, and describing the electronics needed for data collection and
    transmission. Although the IoT system was developed to measure crop ET in agriculture,
    the system could also be used for other types of scales used in domestic, agriculture,
    industry, and many other applications. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Design Requirements
    and General Functionality of the IoT Scale System The basic design requirements
    for the IoT scale system were defined to (a) be relatively low cost (i.e., <USD
    500); (b) be accurate (i.e., 24-bit resolution); (c) have low power requirements
    to continuously operate with a small LiPo battery (i.e., ≤2500 mAh), recharged
    by a small (i.e., ≤6 Watts) solar panel; (d) use cell-phone communication that
    could transmit data to the Internet even when deployed in remote locations; (e)
    use open-source electronics and off-the-shelf components that would be easy to
    obtain and substitute; (f) use an existing open-source IoT Internet platform to
    receive, store, and display the data in real time; and (g) be robust and reliable
    for long-term operation in outdoor applications. The general functionality of
    the IoT scale system is outlined in the diagram illustrated in Figure 1. It shows
    that the IoT scale system consisted of (A) an electronic scale, (B) a datalogger
    with cell phone communication, (C) an IoT Cloud server, and (D) user data access
    and visualization. The electronic scale was used to measure the mass of interest
    automatically. In the case of a lysimeter system, the scale would measure the
    changes in soil mass at regular time intervals. Changes in soil mass predominantly
    represented changes in soil water content, which could be used to calculate crop
    water use. Electronic scales typically use electronic load cells to measure mass.
    Electronic load cells produce a voltage output proportional to changes in the
    force or mass supported by the load cells, either in tension or compression. The
    datalogger was used to read the electronic scale at regular intervals (i.e., every
    10 min), analyze and process the data, and send the data to an IoT Cloud server
    using cell phone communication. The IoT Cloud server was needed to receive, organize,
    timestamp, and store the data in a database. The user can access the data stored
    in the IoT server, which can be downloaded in “.CSV” format and visualized in
    graphical format. Figure 1. General diagram of the IoT scale system, which includes
    (A) an electronic scale, (B) a datalogger with cell phone communication, (C) an
    IoT Cloud server, and (D) user data access and visualization. 2.2. Electronic
    Components An IoT scale system was designed, constructed, and tested to meet the
    above requirements. The essential components for the IoT scale system consisted
    of four electronic load cells, a microcontroller, an Inter-Integrated Circuit
    (I2C) multiplexer, four analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), a terminal block
    breakout, a solar panel, a LiPo battery, and an instrument enclosure (Figure 2).
    Figure 2. Diagram showing the layout of the different components of the IoT scale
    system. A Particle Boron LTE CAT-M1 (BRN404X) (Particle, San Francisco, CA, USA)
    device was used as the microcontroller to collect and transmit the data from the
    load cells to the Internet. The Particle Boron device combines a microcontroller
    (ARM Cortex-M4F 32-bit processor @ 64 MHz) with embedded cellular (LTE) and Bluetooth
    communication capabilities. The Particle Boron device also features, among other
    specifications, 20 mixed-signal GPIO pins (6 x Analog, 8 x PWM), UART, I2C, SPI,
    and an integrated LiPo battery charging circuity and connector. The Particle Boron
    device was mounted on an Adafruit terminal block breakout (Adafruit.com, Assembled
    Terminal Block Breakout FeatherWing for all Feathers, accessed on 20 October 2023)
    to facilitate connection to the GPIO, power, and data communication pins. Four
    100 kg capacity S-type load cells (Phidgets.com, accessed on 15 August 2023) with
    the technical specifications shown in Table 1 were used to measure changes in
    the mass of the scale system. Load cells convert changes in the mass of the scale
    into an analog voltage signal using a bridge circuit. There is usually an excellent
    linear relationship between the mass and the combined voltage output of the load
    cells [17]. Free-standing scale systems are typically designed using several load
    cells to account for imbalances and differences in load cell outputs resulting
    from differences in mass placement within the scale system. Table 1. Technical
    specifications for the load cells. An Adafruit NAU7802 24-Bit ADC-STEMMA QT/Qwiic
    was used for each load cell (www.adafruit.com, accessed on 10 January 2024) to
    provide regulated voltage excitation to the load cell and accurately convert the
    analog voltage output of the load cell into a digital output. STEMMA QT/Qwiic
    refers to a particular type of connector the ADC and other electronics use to
    facilitate connecting to external devices, like a microcontroller. The accuracy
    of conversion from the analog to digital signal is greatly affected by the number
    of bits of the ADC; the higher the number of bits, the higher the accuracy. The
    24-bit ADC used here can divide the analog signal into 224 = 16,777,216 divisions.
    The digital output is transmitted to the microcontroller using an I2C serial communication
    protocol. The I2C protocol allows multiple slave devices (i.e., the NAU7802 24-Bit
    ADC) to be connected to a single master device (i.e., a microcontroller), and
    multiple masters can control a single or multiple slave devices. Connecting multiple
    slaves to a single master depends on each slave having a unique address. However,
    all the NAU7802 ADCs were manufactured with the same default I2C address (0x2A),
    which could not be changed, and the Boron device had only one I2C channel. This
    setup would only allow one NAU7802 ADC to be connected to the single I2C channel
    of the Particle Boron device. Therefore, an I2C multiplexer was used to expand
    the number of I2C channels on the Particle Boron device from one to eight (Adafruit
    PCA9548 8-Channel STEMMA QT/Qwiic I2C Multiplexer–TCA9548A Compatible). This arrangement
    allowed up to eight ADCs to be read sequentially with the same I2C address. Power
    to the electronic components was supplied using a 3.7 V and 2500 mAh Lithium-ion
    polymer (LiPo) battery (Adafruit.com, accessed on 10 January 2024). The battery
    was charged using a monocrystalline mini solar panel (5 volts, 6 Watts). All the
    electronic components, except for the load cells and the solar panel, were housed
    in a plastic IP65 waterproof enclosure with dimensions of 200 × 100 × 70 mm (LMioEtool
    ABS). Images of the different components of the IoT scale system are shown in
    Figure 3. Figure 3. Electronic components for IoT scale system. Figure 4 and Figure
    5 show the connections of the various electronic components and a view of the
    field installation of the IoT scale system, respectively. The I2C multiplexer
    was connected to the Particle Boron device via the terminal block breakout using
    a STEMMA cable. The STEMMA cable had a 4-pin connector at one end connected to
    the I2C multiplexer. The other end of the STEMMA cable had four wires with male
    headers connected to the Particle Boron device. Two wires were connected to the
    power supply (3V and GND) of the Particle Boron, and the other two were connected
    to the I2C pins (SCL and SDA). STEMMA cables with 4-pin connectors at both ends
    connected the four ADCs to channels 0 to 4 of the I2C multiplexer. Each of the
    load cells was connected directly to one of the ADCs. The LiPo battery was connected
    to the battery port, and the solar panel was connected to the micro-USB port of
    the Particle Boron (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Figure 4. Connections of the different
    electronic components of the IoT scale system. Figure 5. View of field installation
    of the IoT scale system. Web links to additional information and details regarding
    each element of the IoT scale system are shown in Table 2. The quantities required
    and the cost of the components, based on the current list prices and excluding
    taxes and shipping and handling, are shown in Table 3. Table 2. Web link to information
    about each component. Table 3. Cost of components for the IoT scale system. 2.3.
    Internet of Things (IoT) System The Particle Boron device was programmed to sample
    the four load cells at regular time intervals, make a few calculations, and send
    the data to the Cloud. The data were sent to the IoT Cloud server, ThingSpeak.com.
    ThingSpeak.com is an IoT analytics platform service that allows users to aggregate,
    visualize, and analyze live data streams in the Cloud. We selected ThingSpeak.com
    because we had already used this service for previous applications [42,43,44,45],
    we were familiar with it, and it offered all the needed features. Other researchers,
    such as [30,40], also used ThingsSpeak.com. However, other IoT services are available,
    and other researchers have used other services for similar projects. For example,
    ref. [38] used Google-sheet as the IoT Cloud service. Similarly, ref. [35] reported
    using the Kotlin Multiplatform Framework (KMM) and refs. [37,41] reported using
    the IoT application Node-RED. The Particle Boron device was programmed using Particle
    Workbench, a professional tool built into Visual Studio Code to facilitate IoT
    development (https://www.particle.io/blog/particle-workbench-ga/, accessed on
    15 October 2023). The code for the Particle Boron device included several external
    library files such as “Particle.h”, “Wire.h”, “Adafruit_NAU7802.h”, and “ThingSpeak.h.”
    The first three library files were needed for the Particle Boron device to communicate
    with and control the I2C multiplexer and the ADCs. The “ThingSpeak.h” library
    was needed to send the data to ThingSpeak™ (ThingSpeak.com). The Particle Boron
    was programmed to sample the four load cells and send the data to ThingSpeak.com
    every minute during the indoor part of the experiment and every 10 min during
    the outdoor experiment. 2.4. Indoor and Outdoor Experiments The performance of
    the IoT scale system was initially tested during an indoor experiment by placing
    the four load cells in each corner underneath a flowerpot (Figure 6A). The IoT
    system was used to measure the mass of the flowerpot every minute for two days.
    The indoor experiment was conducted to test the hardware, software, and data communication.
    Another purpose of this experiment was to evaluate if the scale system responded
    adequately to changes in mass by performing a calibration experiment and collecting
    data from the flowerpot. Figure 6. Experimental setup for the indoor and outdoor
    experiments. (A) Flowerpot with four load cells underneath. (B) Soil container
    with four load cells underneath. (C) Soil container with weeds. Once the indoor
    experiment proved successful, a scale system was built to be deployed outdoors
    (Figure 6B) to continuously monitor soil water evaporation, simulating a weighing
    lysimeter’s operation. The system consisted of a steel frame supported by four
    load cells (one underneath each corner) containing a soil-filled plastic storage
    bin. The outdoor experiment was installed on 21 January 2023 in a grassy area
    at the edge of an agricultural field at the Clemson University Edisto Research
    and Education Center, Blackville, South Carolina. The IoT scale system was programmed
    to collect data every 10 min and send the data to ThingSpeak.com. The collected
    data included the output of each load cell, the total output (summing the output
    of the four load cells), and the total mass of the soil container (kg). The soil
    in the container was initially bare (Figure 6B), but weeds were allowed to grow
    inside the container (Figure 6C). 2.5. System Calibration Load cells produce a
    very small voltage output that the ADC converts into an integer value. In this
    application, this integer had no intrinsic meaning and needed to be converted
    into mass (kg) to be useful. A calibration was conducted to convert the output
    of the ADC to mass (kg). The calibration consisted of sequentially adding objects
    of known mass (kg) to the scale system and recording the corresponding ADC output.
    The aim was to empirically develop an equation to convert the output into mass
    (kg). The initial calibration was conducted during the indoor experiment phase
    on 15 January 2023. A similar calibration was also performed during the outdoor
    experiment on 24 February 2023 (Figure 7). For the indoor calibration, the objects
    of known mass were books previously weighed using an electronic kitchen scale
    (Model EK9710, 5 kg capacity). For the outdoor calibration, sealed plastic containers
    were filled with dry sand and weighed using an electronic compact bench scale
    (Ohaus, Model Ranger 3000, 30 kg capacity). Each container was filled to weigh
    around 5 kg. The linear regression equation resulting from the calibration was
    used to convert the load cell output to mass (kg). The lysimeter mass was converted
    into its equivalent depth of evapotranspiration water (mm) based on the surface
    area of the lysimeter container (Figure 7) (mm of water = kg of water/m2). Figure
    7. Calibration during the outdoor experiment (24 February 2023). 2.6. Weather
    and Soil Moisture Data Daily weather and soil moisture data for the research site
    were obtained from a weather station at the Edisto Research and Education Center.
    The station is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
    National Weather Service. It is located at a linear distance of around 800 m from
    where the outdoor experiment was conducted. The data obtained from the weather
    station for this study included precipitation, air temperature (maximum and minimum),
    mean relative humidity, solar radiation, and soil moisture at three soil depths
    (5, 10, and 20 cm). 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Calibration Results The results
    of the indoor calibration are shown in Figure 8. Figure 8A shows the changes in
    the total load cell output over time resulting from adding three masses to the
    scale system. The output collected every minute for each mass indicates that the
    signal was very stable, with no noticeable noise. The regression analysis (Figure
    8B) yielded a perfect correlation (r2 = 1.0) between the total load cell output
    and the mass. Figure 8B shows a negative relationship, which could result from
    the type of load cell used in this study, which can operate in tension or compression
    modes. The negative relationship also depends on how the two signal wires of the
    load cell are connected to the ADC positive and negative pins, which will result
    in either a positive or negative output. Similarly, the outdoor calibration (Figure
    9) resulted in an excellent negative linear correlation (r2 = 0.9994). Figure
    8. Time series (A) and regression (B) results of load cell calibration conducted
    on 15 January 2023 (y = −0.01505x − 0.216; r2 = 1.0). Figure 9. Time series (A)
    and regression (B) results of lysimeter load cell calibration conducted in the
    field on 24 February 2023 (y = −0.01785x − 0.01384; r2 = 0.9994). 3.2. Weather
    and Soil Moisture Information on daily precipitation, maximum (Max) and minimum
    (Min) air temperature, soil moisture at three soil depths, solar radiation, and
    relative humidity from February to June 2023 at the study site are shown in Figure
    10. The daily precipitation data (Figure 10A) show frequent precipitation events
    typical of the study area during spring. The soil moisture data in Figure 10E
    reflect various wetting and drying cycles in response to the recurring rainfall
    events. Figure 10. Daily (A) precipitation, (B) maximum (Max) and minimum (Min)
    air temperature, (C) solar radiation, (D) relative humidity, and (E) soil moisture
    at three soil depths (5, 10, and 20 cm) from February to June 2023 at the study
    site. 3.3. Results of the Outdoor Experiment Figure 11 shows an example of the
    output of one of the load cells displayed in ThingSpeak.com from 22 May to 19
    June 2023 during the outdoor experiment. The ThingSpeak.com tool allows one to
    display up to eight charts per channel, and the data can be visualized using a
    computer. The data on ThinkSpeak.com can be private, shared with specific people,
    or made public for anyone to see. The data sent to ThingSpeak.com is given a timestamp
    when received, is stored in a database, and can be downloaded as a CSV file. Although
    the data in ThingSpeak.com is meant to be visualized using a computer, several
    cell phone Apps (i.e., ThingView, ThingShow for ThingSpeak) are available for
    iOS and Android that can be used to visualize ThingSpeak data using a cell phone
    and other mobile devices. Figure 11. Data from one of the load cells as shown
    in ThingSpeak between 22 May and 19 June 2023. The data collected every 10 min
    during the outdoor experiment are shown in Figure 12 for the entire study period
    from February to June 2023. The data collection and communication system did not
    fail during this period, indicating that the IoT scale system was reliable. However,
    the reliability of the communication system depends on cell phone coverage and
    quality of coverage, which vary by site and local conditions. It should be noted
    that the lysimeter mass data shown in Figure 12 followed the same pattern as the
    soil moisture data previously shown in Figure 10E, indicating that the IoT scale
    system accurately responded to the local changes in soil wetting and drying cycles.
    Figure 12. Lysimeter field data measured every ten minutes from February to June
    2023. The 10 min data in Figure 12 were filtered to retain only the values measured
    at midnight each day. The midnight lysimeter mass values were used to calculate
    the daily evapotranspiration by subtracting the midnight value for the current
    day from that of the previous day. Since rainy days would result in negative ET
    values, the negative values were removed. The resulting daily and cumulative ET
    values for the study period are shown in Figure 13. As expected, the daily ET
    values were variable, reflecting the normal day-to-day variability in weather
    and soil moisture conditions. The daily ET rate depends on several weather variables,
    such as solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. For a
    cropped surface, crop type, crop development stage, percent crop cover, and level
    of water stress also play an essential role. Despite the variability in daily
    ET, the tendency was for the daily ET values to increase with time as the weather
    got warmer as spring moved towards summer. Figure 13. Daily and cumulative evapotranspiration
    (ET) derived from lysimeter measurements from February to June 2023. The bars
    represent daily ET, and the solid line represents cumulative ET. Figure 14 shows
    the lysimeter mass and ET measured every 10 min during 2–3 June and 8–10 June
    2023, which provides a closer look to appreciate the accuracy of the IoT scale
    system. It shows the daily pattern of crop water use, with the rate of water use
    increasing during the daytime compared to nighttime hours. In general, more noise
    in the signal is observed during the day compared to nighttime. During the daytime,
    more noise could result from the effect of clouds on solar radiation and the usual
    tendency of wind speed to increase during the day [46]. It is possible that our
    field experiment setup, with the soil container above ground, could have been
    more severely impacted by changes in wind speed than a normal lysimeter, which
    is typically buried. Figure 14. Lysimeter mass (A,C) measured every ten minutes
    during 2–3 June and 8–10 June 2023, and calculated hourly evapotranspiration rate
    (B,D). The vertical lines indicate the end of each day. An interesting observation
    from Figure 14A is that there was a mass increase during the morning hours for
    June 2 and 3 instead of the expected decrease, since no rain occurred during those
    days. Natural water inputs to the soil coming from sources other than rain (such
    as dew) are often not considered in ecohydrological studies since they are typically
    believed to be small and, therefore, difficult to measure. However, some researchers
    have recognized that these water inputs could form under different environmental
    conditions and be a relevant source for plants and ecosystems, especially during
    summer drought. For example, ref. [11] reported that non-rainfall water inputs
    occurred frequently in Switzerland, and they measured 127 non-rainfall water input
    events over 12 months using micro lysimeters. Similarly, researchers in Spain
    [47] used a precision weighing lysimeter to measure ET from a dune belt in a coastal
    environment. They found that during periods without rainfall, the daily pattern
    of the lysimeter readings showed increasing mass from sunset to morning hours
    and a subsequent decrease. However, they observed that the increasing mass concurred
    with hours of zero or only minor temperature differences to the dewpoint, which
    led them to attribute the increase in mass to vapor adsorption rather than dew.
    At our study site, dew accumulation during the early morning hours is a common
    occurrence based on visual observations of wet plant leaves during non-rainy periods.
    Therefore, we speculate that the increase observed in the lysimeter mass during
    the daytime could be due to dew accumulation. Figure 14C shows that considerable
    nighttime ET occurred from June 8 to June 9, but ET was minimal during the night
    from June 9 to June 10. These results show that the IoT scale system was accurate
    enough to detect the daily ET and even ET rates during shorter periods (i.e.,
    10 min). However, it would be advisable to remove noise for periods shorter than
    daily by smoothing the data before calculating ET. Other researchers have observed
    that the noise visible in lysimeter data originated mainly from fluctuations in
    electrical noise, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure [11]. Some of the short-term
    noise could be removed by programming the microcontroller to oversample and time-average
    during data collection. Additional smoothing can be applied in post-processing
    using various data-smoothing techniques that can be applied to time series (i.e.,
    moving average, lowess). Researchers in Switzerland [11] described a procedure
    to remove noise from load cell data using low-pass filtering. The data in Figure
    14A,C were first smoothed using the lowess () function in R (using f = 0.05) before
    the ET values in Figure 14B,D were calculated. As indicated earlier, Figure 14B,D
    show that negative ET values resulted during the morning hours in most of the
    five days shown, probably due to dew formation. 3.4. Cost of the IoT Scale System
    Electronic supplies to build the IoT scale system (Table 3) cost USD 343.32, excluding
    taxes and shipping and handling. But the four load cells represented 52.4% (USD
    180.00) of the total cost, and all the other supplies were purchased for USD 163.32.
    However, this work focused on building and testing the electronics for the scale
    or lysimeter system. The cost of building a field lysimeter for actual evapotranspiration
    monitoring can be significant. Under their current pricing policy, non-commercial
    users have no ongoing monthly cost or data plan for using the Particle Boron to
    transmit data using the cellular network. Also, there is no cost for non-commercial
    users to use the ThingSpeak.com IoT platform. 3.5. Advantages and Disadvantages
    of the IoT Scale System The IoT scale system has many advantages. For example,
    it can be built using open-source electronics and an existing IoT platform. The
    system has low power requirements and can operate with a small battery and solar
    panel, which is especially important in remote agricultural locations. Lysimeters
    are typically installed in the middle of an agricultural field; therefore, a bulky
    solar panel and battery system often obstruct farming operations. The system offers
    connectivity to the Internet, allowing users to see the data in real time. Internet
    connectivity enables users to monitor the system remotely to ensure that the lysimeter
    is working correctly without needing to visit the site to download and visualize
    the data manually. The system has a 24-bit ADC, which is the same accuracy as
    the flagship Campbell Scientific data loggers (i.e., models CR1000X or CR6), commonly
    used for lysimeter applications in agriculture, but at a small fraction of the
    cost. On the other hand, one of the main disadvantages of the IoT scale system
    is that it is not equipped to timestamp and save the data locally. It relies on
    timestamping and saving the data in the Cloud, which depends on the availability
    and reliability of the cellular network. Our field experiment did not have problems
    with the cellular network. Still, our experience with other applications is that
    cellular communication could fail, depending on the site and weather conditions.
    Therefore, the IoT system presented here could still be improved by adding the
    capability of saving the collected data locally, such as using a micro-SD card,
    which can be accomplished in various ways. 4. Conclusions The IoT scale system
    was designed and constructed to be relatively low cost; be accurate; have low
    power requirements to continuously operate with a small battery; be recharged
    by a small solar panel; use cell phone communication that could be deployed in
    remote locations; use open-source electronics and off-the-shelf components that
    would be easy to obtain and substitute; use an existing open-source IoT Internet
    platform to receive, store, and display the data in real time; and be robust and
    reliable for long-term operation in outdoor applications. Although the IoT system
    was explicitly designed for a scale application by measuring the output of four
    load cells, the Particle Boron device also has 20 mixed-signal GPIO pins (6 x
    Analog, 8 x PWM), UART, I2C, and SPI. Only the I2C connection to the Particle
    Boron was utilized in this application, and all its other connections and capabilities
    were still available for other applications. Other applications could include
    reading other analog sensors (i.e., temperature sensors, soil moisture sensors),
    activating relays, powering devices (i.e., turning LEDs on and off), communicating
    with other digital devices (i.e., Arduino, micro-SD card breakout, GPS, radio
    transceiver), etc. A logical next application would be to utilize the available
    resources in the microcontroller to integrate sensors to measure soil moisture
    and the weather variables needed to determine reference evapotranspiration (ETo).
    Concurrent soil moisture, ETo, and ETc data would enable the calculation of crop
    coefficients to understand the soil–plant–atmosphere dynamic processes in real
    time. Also, in this application, the system was designed to measure one scale
    or lysimeter, which requires only four load cells to be read. However, the I2C
    multiplexer has eight channels for four additional ADCs and four additional load
    cells. The availability of four additional channels means this IoT scale system
    can easily be expanded to read two scales or two lysimeters if they are not too
    far apart. The technical specifications of the I2C multiplexer indicate that the
    multiplexer comes with an address of 0x70. Still, this address can be adjusted
    from 0x70 to 0x77 (using jumpers on the back of the device), which, in theory,
    would enable having eight of these multiplexers on each of the 0x70 to 0x77 addresses.
    This arrangement would allow 64 ADCs (or other I2C devices) to be controlled,
    which could be used to read 64 load cells. Once constructed, the IoT scale system
    was tested during indoor and outdoor experiments, showing excellent results. Although
    the indoor experiment lasted only a few days, the outdoor experiment lasted for
    around five months (from February to June). The field experiment to measure ET
    using an aboveground lysimeter exposed the IoT scale system to the changes in
    environmental conditions prevalent in the humid Southeast USA. The system proved
    to be robust and dependable for data collection and data communication under the
    conditions of the study. It also accurately measured changes in the lysimeter
    mass at a 24-bit ADC resolution, which enabled the determination of ET during
    daily and shorter periods. The results of the outdoor experiment showed that the
    changes in the lysimeter mass during five months (Feb to Jun) had the same tendency
    as the changes in soil moisture measured concurrently at a nearby weather station.
    Both the lysimeter and soil moisture measurements reflected the expected changes
    in soil conditions due to wetting and drying soil cycles driven by local weather
    conditions. The results of the outdoor experiment also showed that the system
    could detect a considerable gain in lysimeter mass, rather than the expected loss
    in mass, during the morning hours. We speculated that this gain in mass could
    be due to dew formation. However, the process of dew formation, its magnitude,
    and its importance in agricultural water management still need further investigation.
    Although the IoT scale system performed without fail in data collection and transmission
    during the field experiment, it is recognized that it would be important to improve
    the system by adding the capability of recording the collected data locally before
    sending them to the Internet. In future work, a new version of the system will
    be created to address this shortcoming, making the system more reliable and valuable,
    especially in places without stable cellular service. One of the main advantages
    of the IoT scale system is that it can be built for a fraction of the cost of
    popular data logging systems commonly used for lysimeter and scale applications
    in agriculture, which typically require an investment of several thousand USD
    for data logging and data communication. Also, the IoT scale system can be built
    using open-source, off-the-shelf components that are easy to purchase online and
    can be easily replaced or substituted, providing freedom from proprietary systems.
    In fact, most, if not all, of the components of the IoT scale system described
    here could be replaced or substituted. The possibility of replacing or substituting
    components applies to the electronic components, enclosure, battery, solar panel,
    and even the ThingSpeak.com IoT platform. Also, the fact that the system is connected
    to the Internet via the cellular network not only enables users to download and
    visualize the data using the ThingSpeak.com IoT platform, but the user can also
    remotely change the program in the microcontroller by flashing code via the Cloud
    Flash option provided by the Particle Workbench tool. Funding Technical Contribution

    Abstract Harmful Algal and Cyanobacterial Bloom (HACB) threaten aquatic ecosystems,
    human health, and the economy. Many factors influence these dynamic events, which
    are often difficult to detect until the late stages of growth. The inclusion of
    an Early Warning System (EWS) can be instrumental in identifying hazards and preventing
    or at least minimizing their impact. Traditional monitoring approaches often fail
    to provide the real-time, high-resolution data needed for effective early warnings.
    The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies offers a promising avenue
    to address these limitations by creating a network of interconnected sensors capable
    of continuously collecting and transmitting data from various aquatic environments.
    In this paper, we present DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI, an advanced web application that extends
    the capabilities of the DEVS-BLOOM framework, providing a user-friendly interface
    that supports different user roles. The application includes an interface to manage

    EWS, discussing design considerations, sensor technologies, and communication
    protocols essential for seamless data integration and effective operation of the
    EWS. Keywords: web application; Internet of Things; Harmful Algal and Cyanobacterial
    Bloom; automated measurement; early warning system 1. Introduction Harmful Algal
    and Cyanobacterial Blooms (HACBs) have emerged as a global environmental concern
    [1,2], posing substantial threats to aquatic ecosystems, human health, and the
    economy. These blooms, primarily fueled by nutrient-rich waters and exacerbated
    by climate change, have become increasingly prevalent, manifesting as dense accumulations
    of cyanobacteria that produce harmful toxins. The toxins released by these organisms,
    such as microcystins and cyanotoxins, can have severe implications for aquatic
    life and human well-being, ranging from fish kills to the contamination of drinking
    water sources. Cyanobacterial blooms are dynamic events influenced by many factors,
    including nutrient concentrations, temperature variations, and hydrological conditions.
    An Early Warning System (EWS) can be helpful to identify hazards and prevent or
    at least minimize the impact of the HACB [3,4]. Traditional monitoring approaches
    often fail to provide real-time, high-resolution data for effective early warnings.
    The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies offers a promising avenue
    to address these limitations by creating a network of interconnected sensors capable
    of continuously collecting and transmitting data from various aquatic environments.
    In previous works, the authors presented an EWS for early detection of HACB. This
    advanced framework (DEVS-BLOOM) [5] is based, on the one hand, on the use of Discrete
    Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism to model the systems and their interconnections
    and, on the other hand, an IoT-oriented approach that benefits from the ability
    of IoT devices to transmit data to centralized monitoring systems in real time,
    enabling effective decision-making and intervention strategies. In this paper,
    we present an advanced web application that extends the capabilities of DEVS-BLOOM,
    providing a user-friendly interface that supports different user roles. The application
    includes, but is not limited to, an interface to manage users and permissions,
    dashboards to inspect data (from sensors, Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), weather
    stations, and so on), train AI models and explore their predictions, and notification
    of early warning and decision making. Moreover, the paper investigates the practical
    implementation of the IoT-based EWS, discussing the design considerations, sensor
    technologies, and communication protocols essential for seamless data integration.
    Besides the simulations, the web application allows for the user to design, monitor
    and control the deployment [6] of UAVs in real environments. Moreover, the architecture
    allows transparent and progressive integration of real sensors and hardware, which
    facilitates development and makes the platform more flexible and robust. We think
    these features are innovative and take the app a step forward. The organization
    of the paper is as follows. Section 2 analyzes some EWSs that are currently under
    operation and are representative of their application areas. Section 3 discusses
    the architecture and design of the web application, and Section 4 illustrates
    the application’s results from the user’s point of view. Finally, Section 5 offers
    some conclusions and future lines of work. 2. Related Work Due to the report by
    the United Nations Environment Programme, an analysis of a state-of-art of EWSs
    can be found [7]. The existence of monitoring/early warning allows individuals
    exposed to any hazard taking action to avoid or reduce, as much as possible, their
    risk and prepare for effective response. The main elements of an EWS are: Risk
    Knowledge: It is based on systematic data collection and assessments of vulnerabilities
    and capacities of communities and systems to cope with risks. This knowledge enables
    decision-makers to understand risk better, change their attitude towards it, guide
    investments in resilience, improve EWS coverage, and reduce the number of disasters.
    Monitoring and Predicting: The fundamental principle of EWSs is based on the premise
    that accurate and early prediction of potential short- and long-term risks associated
    with both natural and human-induced hazards increases the likelihood of mitigating
    the impact of disasters on society, the economy, and the environment. A system
    with monitoring and forecasting capabilities allows for estimates of the potential
    risk to communities. Disseminating Information: Communication systems must send
    warning messages to potentially affected locations to alert local and regional
    government agencies. An effective EWS requires an effective communication system.
    There are two critical components to EWS communication: a hardware infrastructure,
    which must be reliable and robust, and appropriate interaction between the key
    players in the early warning process. Messages must be reliable, synthetic, and
    simple for the authorities and the public to understand. Response: Coordination,
    good governance, and appropriate action plans are critical to adequate early warning.
    Similarly, public awareness and education are essential aspects of disaster mitigation.
    To determine the common (and lack of) features of EWS, below, we provide a brief
    review of different EWSs that are, at present, under operation. We choose some
    representative examples of other areas of application that are of public interest,
    including meteorological, environmental, or infectious disease alerts. 2.1. Earthquake
    Early Warning (EEW) Systems ShakeAlert is an EEW developed for the West Coast
    of the United States. The system is designed to provide advance notice of potentially
    damaging shaking from an earthquake, allowing for individuals and automated systems
    to take protective actions before the shaking begins [8]. The system relies on
    a network of seismometers to detect initial, less damaging seismic waves (P-waves)
    that precede an earthquake’s more damaging waves (S-waves). When the P-waves are
    detected, the system rapidly assesses the earthquake’s location, magnitude, and
    the expected ground shaking. Once the analysis is complete, alerts are sent to
    various users and systems, providing seconds to tens of seconds of warning before
    the shaking starts. Alerts are distributed through various channels, including
    smartphone apps, emergency alert systems, and other communication methods. The
    Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) operates one of the world’s most advanced and
    widely recognized EEW systems. The system relies on a dense network of seismometers
    and other sensors placed throughout Japan to detect the initial, less damaging
    seismic waves (P-waves) generated by an earthquake. Sophisticated algorithms analyze
    the seismic data to estimate the earthquake’s location, magnitude, and expected
    intensity [9]. Upon detecting the P-waves, the JMA’s system rapidly calculates
    and evaluates the earthquake parameters. If the earthquake is determined to have
    the potential for strong shaking, an alert is generated within seconds. The EEW
    is disseminated through various communication channels, including television and
    radio broadcasts, mobile phone alerts, and other public alert systems. The public
    is advised to take immediate protective actions, such as dropping to the ground,
    taking cover, and holding on. Automated systems in critical infrastructure, such
    as transportation and utilities, can also take preventive measures. The JMA’s
    EEW system covers the entire country of Japan, reflecting the seismic risk faced
    by this seismically active region. 2.2. EWS for Tropical Cyclones The National
    Hurricane Center (NHC) EWS is a critical component of the United States’ efforts
    to monitor, predict, and communicate information about tropical weather systems,
    particularly hurricanes [10]. As part of the National Weather Service (NWS), under
    the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the NHC provides timely
    and accurate forecasts, warnings, and alerts about hurricanes in the Atlantic
    and eastern North Pacific regions. Leveraging advanced technologies such as satellite
    imagery, hurricane reconnaissance flights, and sophisticated computer models,
    the NHC continuously monitors weather patterns to predict the development of hurricanes,
    their path and intensity. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) EWS is a comprehensive
    initiative aimed at forecasting and providing timely alerts for various meteorological
    phenomena to safeguard lives, property, and infrastructure across India. As the
    primary meteorological agency in the country, the IMD is responsible for monitoring
    and predicting a range of weather events, including cyclones, heavy rainfall,
    floods, and extreme temperatures [11]. The EWS encompasses advanced technology,
    observational networks, and forecasting models to detect and anticipate weather-related
    hazards, enabling the issuance of warnings and advisories well in advance. 2.3.
    Flood EWSs The European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) EWS is a sophisticated initiative
    developed by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre to enhance flood
    preparedness and response across Europe [12]. EFAS employs advanced hydrological
    models, real-time meteorological data, and satellite observations to provide accurate
    and timely flood forecasts for different regions. This early warning system enables
    flood alerts, providing authorities and communities valuable time to implement
    preventive measures and coordinate emergency responses. EFAS serves as a crucial
    tool for improving the resilience of European nations against the impacts of flooding,
    facilitating collaboration and information sharing to enhance overall flood awareness
    and preparedness on a continental scale. The National Flood Warning Centre (NFCC)
    EWS is a critical component of flood management in the United Kingdom. Operated
    by the Environment Agency, the NFCC utilizes a combination of real-time river
    and rainfall data, weather forecasts, and hydrological models to monitor and predict
    river and coastal flooding across England and Wales [13]. The EWS issues flood
    alerts and warnings to the public through various communication channels, providing
    timely information to individuals, emergency services, and local authorities.
    By leveraging advanced technology and data analysis, the NFCC EWS plays a crucial
    role in enhancing public safety, enabling proactive measures to respond to potential
    flooding events, and minimizing the impact on communities and infrastructure.
    2.4. Wildfire EWS The Australian Wildfire Alert System (AWAS) is designed to provide
    timely and accurate information to the public and emergency responders during
    bushfire events [14]. This EWS encompasses various tools and communication channels,
    including emergency alerts delivered to mobile phones, warnings broadcast on television
    and radio, and updates on official websites and social media platforms. The system
    aims to inform residents about the location, intensity, and potential trajectory
    of wildfires, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding evacuation and
    other protective measures. The AWAS is crucial in enhancing community safety and
    preparedness in the face of the country’s recurrent and challenging wildfire conditions.
    For the latest and most accurate information, individuals should refer to updates
    from relevant Australian authorities. The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a comprehensive
    system used to assess the potential for wildfires by combining various meteorological
    and environmental factors. Developed by the Canadian Forest Service, the FWI integrates
    indices such as the Fine Fuel Moisture Code, the Duff Moisture Code, and the FWI
    itself [15]. These components consider factors like temperature, humidity, wind
    speed, and precipitation, quantitatively measuring the fire danger level. The
    FWI system is widely used globally for assessing fire risk and guiding fire management
    and suppression decisions. It is particularly valuable for land management agencies,
    firefighting organizations, and communities to anticipate and respond to conditions
    conducive to wildfires. 2.5. EWS for Infectious Diseases The Global Outbreak Alert
    and Response Network (GOARN), established by the World Health Organization (WHO),
    provides international public health resources to control outbreaks and public
    health emergencies worldwide [16]. GOARN is a network of technical partners and
    other surveillance networks coordinated by the WHO. It has a Steering Committee
    reflecting the composition of technical institutions and disciplines needed to
    comprehensively respond to outbreaks. The Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases
    (ProMED) is the world’s most extensive public notification system for infectious
    disease outbreaks [17]. It is an essential source of information used daily by
    international public health leaders, government officials, physicians, veterinarians,
    researchers, private companies, journalists, and the general public, providing
    timely information on important emerging pathogens and their vectors using a “One
    Health” approach. The reports are prepared and commented on by a global multidisciplinary
    team of moderators with expertise in various fields, including virology, parasitology,
    epidemiology, entomology, veterinary medicine, and plant diseases. 2.6. Industrial
    and Environmental EWS In partnership with the U.S. Environment Protection Agency
    (EPA), the Air Quality Program provides information used in protecting human health
    from wildfire smoke [18]. The maps provided are used to visualize current information
    on particulate pollution in U.S. localities, locations of fires and smoke, and
    smoke forecasts, and to learn about measures that can be taken to reduce the amount
    of smoke inhaled. Thus, the U.S. Air Quality Index (AQI) is used by the EPA to
    report air quality. Each day, the AQI indicates how clean or polluted the outdoor
    air is, along with associated health effects that may be of concern. ChemAlert
    (Australia) by Risk Management Technologies (RMT) provides software solutions
    and services for chemical safety management and enterprise risk management. RMT
    is dedicated to helping organizations by providing risk management systems to
    ensure safety in every workplace, every time [19]. It provides tools for chemical
    identification, risk assessment, safety data sheet management, and critical chemical
    safety information communication. In addition, the software can include functions
    related to regulatory compliance and reporting. To conclude this section, Table
    1 summarizes and compares the EWS features that were analyzed. It shows the similarities
    and differences in the services provided by the different systems. Table 1. Services
    provided by the previous EWS examples. 3. Architecture and Implementation Cyanobacterial
    blooms pose a serious threat to the health of the aquatic ecosystem and human
    health, so early detection of HACBs is essential to mitigate their negative impacts.
    Unfortunately, the problem is far from trivial due to the complex nature of the
    phenomena that involve biological entities and ecosystems. For the EWS to be practical,
    the system must be able to measure and monitor the state of water bodies and environmental
    factors such as temperature, pH, and nutrients. To unravel the behavior of such
    systems, it is necessary to appeal to models and simulations. Designing such an
    EWS is a multifaceted problem where biology and engineering must cooperate, developing
    models and simulations, investigating new sensors and measuring technologies,
    or automating measurements and sampling of the water bodies. Due to this complexity,
    we proposed and developed DEVS-BLOOM, an EWS based on DEVS, which allows simulating
    and analyzing the behavior of water bodies in the face of various environmental
    conditions. The EWS for monitoring HACB development must integrate automated data
    acquisition with parameterized model simulation. The used approach is oriented
    towards a system architecture, a more holistic and integrative model that includes
    the use of the mathematical models mentioned above and a modern model of the automated
    infrastructure of EWSs. Consistent with the IoT paradigm, the approach was segmented
    into three distinct layers, depicted in Figure 1, each encompassing the various
    subsystems necessary for addressing the challenge. Figure 1. Conceptual design
    of the IoT layered structure to facilitate future real-world implementation. The
    Edge layer represents the devices and systems closest to the physical world, typically
    at the network’s periphery, such as the USVs that carry out surveillance/measurement
    missions, weather stations, or cameras. The Fog layer is an intermediate layer
    between the Edge and Cloud layers, providing computational resources closer to
    the data source. The Ground Control Station (GCS) sits in this layer, as well
    as local database and file storing services, the USV planner, etc. The Cloud layer
    involves centralized processing and storage capabilities, including the web interface,
    web report generators, cloud storage, data analysis, etc. The EWS is based on
    continuous observation of environmental parameters modeled by DEVS. With AI-pretrained
    models, the inference service makes predictions that activate alerts to indicate
    the possible occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms. The GCS considers these alerts
    to monitor the zones where the bloom is expected to appear. It sends USV to monitor
    the area, taking measures and confirming or rejecting the alert. The efficiency
    of this system lies in its ability to prevent critical situations before they
    occur. In adherence to the Model-Based System Engineering (MBSE) methodology,
    a deliberate architectural design decision was made to completely isolate User
    Interface (UI) implementation within a dedicated layer known as the Front-End.
    This separation of concerns not only enhances the modularity of the system, but
    also ensures a clear distinction between the presentation layer and the underlying
    functionality. Conversely, all the intricate logic, algorithms, and overall system
    functionality are intricately woven into a distinct layer identified as the Back-End.
    This compartmentalization of the Back-End enhances maintainability and allows
    for a more streamlined development process. Developers can focus on the intricacies
    of system functionality without the complexities associated with UI design, fostering
    a more efficient and organized development workflow. Following this approach,
    the UI integrates with the inference service of DEVS-BLOOM [6] that implements
    different AI models. These models are completely transparent to the web application
    and thus to the final user. The inference service supports different models, such
    as the predictive model that is described in [6] based on differential equations,
    or a particle transport model presented in [20,21] that determines Cyanobacterial
    Bloom (CB) distribution from the water currents and the inherent CB behavior (in
    particular, its biological growth and vertical displacements). In addition, the
    research group of the authors is currently focused on the implementation of a
    deep-learning model that is expected to provide more accuracy in the predictions
    of blooms. The model is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which
    are suitable for forecasting in other fields of application [22,23,24]. Due to
    MBSE methodology, a model-based database is generated from the initial design
    phases. This early availability of a data foundation has proven to be instrumental
    in the development life cycle. It has enabled the parallel development of both
    the Front-End and Back-End, with developers working concurrently on their respective
    layers. This parallelism accelerates the overall development timeline and allows
    for early feedback and testing of system components. The foresighted integration
    of a database aligns with the core tenets of MBSE, where a holistic view of the
    system, encompassing data and functionality, is essential. Because of the presence
    of a database available early on, potential challenges related to data handling
    and storage are identified and addressed proactively, contributing to the overall
    robustness of the system. As development progresses, the convergence of the Front-End
    and Back-End layers requires a minimal integration effort during the final stages.
    The well-defined interfaces between these layers, coupled with the continuous
    collaboration between UI designers and system developers, ensures a seamless integration
    process. This approach not only minimizes the risk of integration-related issues,
    but also allows for a more efficient and reliable deployment of the complete system.
    As a result, our framework collectively contributes to a robust, modular, and
    efficiently developed system. This holistic approach sets the foundation for a
    scalable and maintainable solution, with the flexibility to adapt to evolving
    requirements in the future. 3.1. Back-End The DEVS formalism offers an accurate
    mathematical representation of discrete dynamical systems. The DEVS-BLOOM framework
    uses DEVS to model the components of the EWS, including dynamics of water bodies
    (considering factors such as temperature, nutrient levels, and solar radiation
    that are crucial to understanding and preventing the proliferation of cyanobacteria),
    USVs, weathers stations, inference services or data logging and storing. Apart
    from the expressivity and accuracy of DEVS for modeling the different components,
    it enforces a formal definition of the interfaces between other components. This
    is a feature that DEVS-BLOOM leverages to integrate both simulated models and
    real devices seamlessly. The coupled DEVS model in Figure 2 is constructed for
    the purpose of monitoring a bloom using an inference service that guides an USV.
    Figure 2. Coupled model of the architecture of the bloom monitoring using an inference
    service. In this model, the USV dynamic and control are simulated according to
    differential equations, the sensor measurements are real or emulated using a SimulatedBody
    service, the inference service is used in the Fog layer, and it is trained on
    the Cloud layer. In this simple case, the planner sends the inferred 𝑏𝑙 𝑚 𝑝𝑜𝑠
    to the USV as a reference. The USV has to finish reaching the marked reference
    point, forced to adjust its trajectory as its dynamics are altered by the influence
    of water currents and wind speed. In addition, an atomic model called Generator
    is included, which emulates the water technician manipulating the GCS. This has
    a significant added value because it allows the system generating orders during
    the simulation. Our Back-End follows the IoT architecture described above. It
    is worth to mention that the exchange of information, execution of control logic,
    and training loops among the IoT layers are realized in a closed-loop configuration.
    All the information generated by the simulation models or taken by real sensors
    is registered in a global database that resides in the cloud layer; Figure 3.
    There is a database for each of the directories corresponding to each lake model.
    The data are organized in sub-folders according to the date on which the information
    was collected. In this way, it is possible to have multiple simulated and real
    models registered for the same water body. The stored data are categorized into
    system sensor data (Sensor*), bloom data (Bloom*), USV data (USV*) and others.
    Figure 3. Relational diagram of DEVS-BLOOM Cloud Model. While the data share common
    fields such as identifier, source, timestamp, latitude and longitude, as can be
    seen, there are differences between the different types of data. This, combined
    with the large amount of information to be handled, makes it impossible for the
    manager to make an effective assessment of cyanobacterial blooms from the use
    of raw data. For this reason, the web interface represents a considerable advantage
    for the efficient visualization of the behavior of HACB and monitoring devices.
    This global database is the source of information that feeds the UI, which is
    also implemented on the cloud layer. Based on this information, the Web Report
    service provides all necessary services for monitoring and visualization of the
    data in a user-friendly way in different tabs. These tabs perform the main functions
    of visualization and monitoring of the simulation results, which is explained
    in detail later, including the Scenario Configuration Tab, where the manager is
    able to configure an initial state of the simulation and generate new data from
    it. 3.2. Front-End As a general guiding principle, the application we present
    in this work is based on well-known libraries and components to guarantee that
    it is robust and easy to maintain. The web application’s architecture is based
    on Django, a prevalent web development framework. In addition to many valuable
    capabilities that facilitate the creation of the application, a decisive factor
    in choosing Django is that it is written in Python, which is also the programming
    language that supports DEVS-BLOOM, mainly because it is pervasively used in applications
    of data analysis and machine learning. Since DEVS-BLOOM is also based on this
    programming language, that election simplifies the integration between the two
    components. The web application is an interface to the capabilities that DEVS-BLOOM
    provides, adapting and customizing the interface according to the type of user.
    In this way, different roles are defined, which encapsulate a different and partial
    vision of the system that best suits the needs of each user. In addition, security
    is a prevalent issue in web applications. The Django web framework, particularly
    its built-in user management system, facilitates the development of correct access
    control, including user authentication (whether the user is who they say they
    are) and authorization (whether the user is allowed to act as the system). DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI
    is primarily focused on data access, visualization, and management. Data can originate
    from different sources (simulation models, real hardware), have others, and be
    separate (alerts, USV monitoring, water body state, etc.). Depending on the case
    of use, different technologies, protocols and data formats fit better with the
    specific needs, i.e., to exchange information safely and efficiently between DEVS-BLOOM
    and DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI. JSON is the preferred data format for general-purpose information
    since it is simple and human readable, in some cases (in particular, due to the
    large size of the data, JSON may not be the most appropriate form), therefore,
    appealing to other solutions such as the direct exchange of files in the CSV format
    (Comma Separated Values) or a more sophisticated format such as NetCDF4. In the
    following paragraphs, we briefly describe the properties of each data format.
    JSON  (JavaScript Object Notation) is a simple text-based data exchange format
    pervasive in web applications. Initially, JSON was created for JavaScript applications
    as it allows (de)serialization of data with a subset of Javascript data types.
    However, many applications soon adopted it as a simpler, easier to process and
    more compact alternative to XML (Extensible Markup Language). Below is an example
    of a JSON data object:     {        “name”:“WaterBody”,        “date”:“19 May,
    2021”,        “10:10 AM”,        “type”:“Bloom”,        “level”:“Alto”     } CSV  (Comma
    Separated Values) is also a text-based data format that unsurprisingly uses commas
    to separate values (though the delimiter could also be a semicolon, spaces, or
    any other symbol). It is used to store tabular data in plain files. CSV is a veteran
    data format that is still very popular due to its simplicity of process and human
    readability. In summary, CSV is easy to create, human readable, compact, easy
    to parse, fast to manipulate, and can be read using almost any text editor. Below
    is an example of a CSV file:     id,source,timestamp,lat,lon,power     USV,RedLeader,2008-08-23
    00:00:06,47.5064888000488,         -122.216850280762,0.497     USV,RedLeader,2008-08-23

    01:00:06,47.50666680751364,         -122.2167099159214,0.491     USV,RedLeader,2008-08-23
    01:30:06,47.50676240194273,         -122.2168043398511,0.481199260965549 NetCDF4  (Network
    Common Data Form version 4) is implemented on top of HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format
    version 5), a data format that can represent very complex and heterogeneous data
    objects. Thus, NetCDF4 inherits many features from HDF5, including self-describing
    capabilities, high performance, scalability, a robust software ecosystem of open-source
    tools, and a long-term data archiving solution. Since NetCDF4 is a binary format,
    showing an excerpt of the data file would be useless. However, it may be helpful
    to think of a hierarchical structure where there are datasets, which contain the
    actual data, and groups, which organize the datasets. A web application in Django
    follows the Model–View–Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, often referred
    to as Model–View–Template (MVT), since nowadays, most web development frameworks
    strongly rely on template rendering engines. These engines provide an easy method
    to generate dynamic web pages using a template with placeholders for data and
    other customizations. Though there are many popular template rendering engines,
    such as Django Template Language (DLT), Jinja2, Angular, or Mustache, they are
    very similar in their conception, syntax, and features, differentiated in other
    aspects, such as the integration with specific frameworks or whether they are
    designed for client-side or server-side rendering. The core components of a Django
    web application include models, views, templates, and URLs. The models represent
    the application’s data structure and allow developers to interact with the database
    using an object-oriented approach. To that end, an essential component is the
    Object–Relational Mapping (ORM) that takes the classes defined in the model as
    inputs and generates a representation as tables in the relational database. Thus,
    ORMs abstract the underlying relational model and dbms, generating a mapping between
    both models and encapsulating the queries and operations with the database. Views
    handle the logic for processing user requests and generating responses. Views
    receive input from the user, interact with the model to retrieve or manipulate
    data, and then pass the data to templates for rendering, defining how data are
    presented to the user or application. Templates are responsible for rendering
    the HTML5 to the user’s browser. Django has built-in support for templates in
    DTL. This simple yet powerful language includes features such as loops, conditional,
    and filters and even allows the embedding of Python-like expressions. Finally,
    the URLs define the web application’s routing logic, i.e., how URL or URL patterns
    map to a specific view that should handle the request to that URL. Apart from
    a straightforward way of structuring the application, it helps maintain readability
    and modularity since each project can define URLs. As mentioned before, the application
    has to support different roles that determine what the user should be presented
    with. This is handled with different views that provide an adapted interface depending
    on the user’s necessities and permissions on the system. The more prominent roles
    are admin, manager, water technician, biologist, engineer. Combining data with
    a web-based interactive visualization is a fundamental pillar of the web application.
    Data visualization clarifies complex datasets, making them easier to examine,
    identify patterns and trends, and facilitate information communication to non-expert
    audiences. Data visualization in our application is empowered by Django-Dash and
    Plotly. Django-Dash is a modular application framework allowing users to create
    custom dashboards seamlessly integrated with Django, supporting theming (in Dash
    themes are called layouts) and multiple workspaces. Plotly, on the other hand,
    is a top-rated open-source graphing library compatible with many programming languages
    such as R, Python, MATLAB, Perl, Julia, and Arduino. We considered it in favor
    of other popular solutions such as Bokeh, Matplotlib, or Seaborn. Plotly is powerful
    and versatile, with many features that make it fit like a glove in DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI.
    It provides interactive visualizations allowing for users to zoom, pan, hover
    over data points, and dynamically update chars. The Figure 4 shows a map view
    generated with Plotly where the trajectories commanded and followed by two USVs
    working in parallel can be analyzed. Figure 4. Application of USV monitoring.
    Among Plotly’s many advantages is its ability to create animations with the map
    view, as can be observed. The UI organizes all the data related to the USVs and
    displays their routes throughout the same day. The slider below the map allows
    the user easy visualization of the trajectories of the ships for each available
    simulation day. Also, play and pause buttons are included so that the dynamics
    of the ships in their bloom monitoring function are automatically observed throughout
    the days. Due to its versatility, the graphic library also enables the representation
    of heat maps and facilitates a point-to-point analysis of the depicted values.
    This functionality proves highly beneficial for other perspectives, such as illustrating
    the HACB densities recorded by the USVs sensors, as depicted in Figure 5. Figure
    5. Application of HACB monitoring. As can be seen, the Plotly tool enables the
    inclusion of interactive features with the user, such as the buttons placed on
    the right of the map. They are programmed in such a way that the information they
    provide adjusts to the signals displayed on the map, showing the maximum, minimum,
    and average values of algae density along with their corresponding timestamps.
    Furthermore, depending on which button is pressed, the color scheme of the heat
    map changes and the displayed values are automatically filtered so that algae
    values that are above or below the average can be conveniently displayed. Signals
    can be dynamically selected and deselected, as can the water body, as desired
    by the user to recognize similarities or patterns among the displayed data. Using
    the mouse, detailed information such as latitude, longitude, algal density and
    the exact timestamp at which the data were recorded by the USV algae sensor is
    revealed. This interactively accurate approach provides a more complete and detailed
    user experience, facilitating the understanding and analysis of HACB. Though similar
    results can be achieved with Matplotlib and Bokeh, they often require more code.
    Plotly’s syntax is concise and expressive, making it easier to create complex
    visualizations with less code compared to the more verbose syntax of Matplotlib
    and Bokeh. In addition, Plotly can be seamlessly integrated into web applications
    to create interactive dashboards, a feature not native to Matplotlib or Seaborn.
    Table 2 compares popular data visualization libraries available in Python. Table
    2. Comparison of features of popular graphing libraries. To further enhance the
    practicality and user engagement with the DEVS-BLOOM framework, we introduce an
    innovative component within the DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI: the Scenario Configuration Editor
    (SCE). This interactive tool empowers users to intuitively design and configure
    the deployment of monitoring infrastructure within a selected water body. The
    SCE provides a graphical interface where users can choose the type of water body
    and strategically place various components such as USVs, sensors, weather stations,
    and drones. This visual editor simplifies the complex task of setting up a simulation
    environment and ensures that users from diverse backgrounds can effectively participate
    in the early detection and monitoring process. By allowing for the manual configuration
    of the simulation scenario, followed by the generation of a .json file that serves
    as input for the Python-based simulation, the SCE bridges the gap between user
    input and simulation execution. This seamless integration of user-defined scenarios
    into the DEVS-BLOOM simulation framework ensures the system’s flexibility and
    user-centered design. 4. User Interface Use Case The web application is currently
    in an alpha stage. Though it is still under development [25], it is mostly functional.
    Simulation output data are needed to access and manage the system from the point
    of view of a user, administrator or operator. Due to the large size of the data
    and the simplicity of its manipulation, source files in CVS format are used. As
    mentioned above, the editor service allows for the initial conditions of the simulation
    to be configured, thus obtaining results based on the user’s indications. The
    data acquired are within the established locations, and the alerts are produced
    according to the limits set for the sensors. The web interface has a user-friendly
    design that allows for the information to be obtained more visually and interactively,
    allowing the user checking the user’s estimates. A typical use case and scenario
    is presented below, showing the interaction steps between the users and the system.
    In this scenario, the Santillana reservoir, located near Madrid in Spain, is simulated.
    An area close to the dam, where water intakes for human supply are located, is
    analyzed. The study area is really small, so that it can be monitored with only
    one single USV. On a weekly basis, the Bloom Prediction service is run to predict
    the appearance of possible Blooms, and the results are shown in the Bloom Prediction
    tab. In the event that Blooms occur, the water technician configures and activates
    the monitoring system in the Scenario Editor tab. While the monitoring system
    is active, the water technician can check the status of the USVs using the USV
    Monitor tab. When the USVs have a communication line, data are uploaded to the
    system and the Data Analysis service is launched. The analysis can be relevant
    for both water managers and water technicians and may be visualized in Data Analysis
    tab. The Data Analysis service also generates alerts in the system, which can
    be consulted in Warnings Analysis tab. In addition, these alerts can be redirected
    to the water technician and water manager. As has been shown, different roles
    must be allowed access to different types of information and interface views.
    The role may be configured in the Administration tab. Each of the different actors
    involved in the project can access the information provided by the Web UI system
    according to the use of case. As can be seen in the Use of Case Diagram, Figure
    6, for each actor involved, there is a different use case. Figure 6. Use Case
    Diagram of Web UI System. The biologist is engaged in the analysis of the measures
    taken by sensors, having access to the map and the readout signals. The System
    Administrator does not enter into a rigorously evaluate the results obtained,
    as this is not his main task. However, this actor has the duty to support the
    services deployment (such as the inference and forecast service); organise, update
    and optimize the Database information on USVs, water bodies, sensors and bloom
    models; configure the web views and interactive graphics to display information
    in an efficient way for other actors; perform user administration in which the
    permissions and the role of each of the different users are configured. The Water
    Authority is able to make decisions on the management of water bodies. For this
    reason, the The Water Authority may make decisions on the management of water
    bodies. Therefore, the authorities are only interested in access to the management
    of alerts and the visualisation of maps. In this way, the necessary actions can
    be taken to deal with high levels of blooms. On the other hand, Water Operators
    should have access to alarm management, map display, signal reading, service deployment
    and database updating in order to monitor waterbodies in real or simulated time.
    Together with the System Administrator, they are the only one able to modify the
    database that provides information and services to the other actors involved.
    The use of each UI view for the described use case is analyzed below. 4.1. Bloom
    Prediction In the Back-End, the Bloom prediction service runs daily, which uses
    the latest available weather forecast to predict the hydrodynamics of the water
    body, and from this to predict the evolution of Bloom over the next few days.
    This service is a suitable way to observe the evolution of Bloom beyond the available
    measurements. Thus, this information is beneficial for water technicians, water
    managers, biologists, and the corresponding authorities. Also, future alerts can
    be generated in the Warnings application according to the selected Bloom level
    limits if the user wishes. The water technician uses this tab to analyze the possible
    occurrence of Bloom, as shown in Figure 7. Figure 7. Application of Bloom’s level
    forecast. In this tab, the user can select the water body, the predicted signals
    and the time interval. It is not feasible to analyse more than one week worth
    of data due to lack of confidence in the meteorological forecasts. In the prediction
    map shown, it can be seen that during that week, some days display high densities
    of algae, which also move to other areas. Therefore, the water technician must
    activate the monitoring system. 4.2. Scenario Editor If the monitoring system
    has already been deployed, it is not necessary to configure it, but if not, the
    water technician can use an SCE to configure the monitoring scenario. The SCE
    is a pivotal addition to the DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI, enabling users to meticulously
    craft and tailor the deployment of monitoring infrastructure within a water body.
    This tool is instrumental in setting up the initial conditions for the simulation
    which influence the results and the effectiveness of the EWS. The SCE provides
    a user-friendly graphical interface that allows for the intuitive placement and
    configuration of components such as USVs, sensors, weather stations, and drones
    on a virtual map of the selected water body. Through the SCE, users can set the
    strategic deployment of monitoring equipment, ensuring comprehensive coverage
    and optimal data collection. The editor facilitates the creation of complex scenarios
    by allowing for users to define the working areas for USVs, establish links between
    USVs and blooms, and set parameters for each component. Once the scenario is configured,
    the SCE generates a .json file that encapsulates the user-defined setup, which
    DEVS-BLOOM then utilizes to execute the scenario. The SCE’s integration into the
    DEVS-BLOOM framework exemplifies the seamless fusion of user input with the EWS,
    making it an indispensable tool for researchers and practitioners in aquatic ecosystem
    monitoring. The SCE’s capabilities are not limited to the initial setup; it also
    allows for dynamic adjustments during the monitoring process. This flexibility
    is crucial for adapting to changing environmental conditions or incorporating
    new elements into the escenario. As a result, the SCE enhances the adaptability
    and responsiveness of the EWS, providing a robust platform for proactively managing
    cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. Figure 8 illustrates the SCE interface, showcasing
    how users interact with the system to define the scenario. In the figure, it can
    be seen that a USV is configured to monitor a possible bloom in an area close
    to the dam, where the water intake for human supply is located. Figure 8. The
    Scenario Configuration Editor interface within the DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI. 4.3. USV
    Monitor Upon activation of the system, the USV pursues Bloom, capturing essential
    signals for reconstructing its status. Once a communication line is established,
    the USV transmits the collected data to the central database. The water technician
    can then oversee the information stored in the database, with a specific focus
    on monitoring the USVs status for any potential uncontrolled events. This monitoring
    process is facilitated through the dedicated USV Monitoring tab. This tab provides
    all the information related to the trajectories of the USVs. The Application collects
    all the trajectories described by the USV objects, showing the variation between
    the actual and reference trajectories supplied by the planner. Ships’ trajectories
    are dynamically represented, showing their route and route planning for each simulation
    day. A slider control is incorporated to allow for the user to observe the trajectories
    described by the USVs. Figure 9 illustrates the trajectory followed by the USV
    in the Santillana water body. It can be seen that the USV is limited to the operational
    area that is restricted in the scenario editing to avoid possible collisions or
    obstructions along the banks of the water body. The USV effectively covers the
    region of interest, starting monitoring that day at the initial point of Bloom.
    During the day, it follows Bloom according to the references generated by the
    inference model and returns to the initial point of Bloom at the end of the monitoring
    day. The base is near, where broadband communication is available to upload to
    the cloud all data recorded during the session, in case it could not be uploaded
    earlier. Figure 9. Application of the USV monitoring. 4.4. Data Analysis After
    the close of the monitoring day, the data are available in the database for analysis.
    Then, data Analysis Services trigger alerts that are analyzed in the following
    section. The visual tab associated to data analysis is designed to provide managers
    with a detailed examination of the signals captured by the system’s sensors. This
    functionality allows the analysis of patterns, the identification of possible
    events, and the evaluation of the quality of actions taken by authorities. The
    data obtained are presented graphically and interactively for a more efficient
    interpretation, showing their value according to the date recorded. For each water
    body, the signals recorded during the entire monitoring are available, and signals
    from actual sensors, simulated sensors, and even the forecast service can be compared.
    The user can zoom in to examine a specific period in detail, scroll through time
    to identify patterns, or even select and highlight areas of interest. The tool
    enables the selection of signals desired for visualization, subsequently represented
    as a set of subplots. Figure 10 shows an example of this, illustrating the temporal
    oxygen signals from a real USV sensor and the north component of the wind speed
    from a virtual sensor. 4.5. Warnings Once the simulation/monitoring is executed,
    within the Alarm and Water Body Management view, the Warning Service aims to alert
    when a predefined maximum value is exceeded in any of the sensors or analysis
    results. The simulator uses the marked restrictions, and once the simulator values
    reach or exceed the initially established threshold, the user is provided with
    an instant notification about critical situations. Figure 10. View of the data
    analysis application. Simulated Oxygen sensor signal (blue) and north wind speed
    component signal (orange) are displayed. The Application allows the selection
    of the water body on which the user wants to carry out the alert study, the date,
    and the alert file (if there is more than one). As shown in Figure 11, a table
    is generated indicating in which situations and locations the set limits are exceeded.
    To improve the clarity of the information presented, an alert service is designed
    that compiles only the maximum values reached daily. Each sensor has a color assigned
    to it in the table display, which makes it easy to visualize the data extracted
    from the alarm service. In the first instance, the values obtained by the oxygen
    sensor (BloomMesOS) and the algae level (BloomMesS) incorporated in the ship are
    selected as the values to be monitored. Figure 11. Application of the warnings
    for Bloom and Oxygen levels. The table presents a variety of parameters detailing
    the measurements made. Each column plays a vital role in the presentation of this
    information. The ’Source’ column provides details on the source or origin of the
    recorded data. The ’Date’ column highlights the time the maximum value was reached
    during the day; this temporal information is essential for understanding the variability
    of the measurements over time. The ’Latitude’ and ’Longitude’ columns provide
    precise geospatial data revealing the exact location of the measurements; the
    combination of these coordinates provides a crucial geographical reference for
    the analysis and interpretation of the results. Finally, the ’Value’ column represents
    the numerical measurements or estimates that reflect the monitored magnitude,
    forming the core of the quantitative information to be reported. If any other
    type of warning report is required, the administrator can modify the alarm service
    in the simulator. This view also includes a map view for the analysis of Bloom
    levels. As in the previous table, the interface allows for the user to choose
    the water body to be observed, along with the option to select the visible Bloom
    signals and the available dates corresponding to the simulation. In Figure 12,
    Bloom’s map obtained for the Santillana water body can be observed. The map shows
    several Bloom signals superimposed on the same geolocation: the measured and inferred
    algae sensor signal. In this way, the interactive interface makes it easy to select
    any point on the map, providing instant information on latitude, longitude, algae
    level, and the date the value was recorded. Figure 12. Application of water body
    analysis for measured Bloom levels (BloomMesS) and inferred Bloom levels (BloomInS).
    Buttons are included to the map’s right, allowing the filtering of the entire
    signal between above- and below-average algae level values based on selected dates.
    Similarly, each button displays information on the dates on which the maximum
    and minimum algae levels are reached and the total duration in hours of the data
    display. The map automatically adjusts according to the range of values selected,
    thus enriching the user experience by providing the ability to explore specific
    data within a defined time interval, offering a more detailed analysis of Bloom
    signals. This view is primarily intended for water managers and biologists who
    need to know the behavior of algal blooms visually and straightforwardly. 4.6.
    Administration The following Figure 13 shows a view of a prototype user administration
    service. With administrator permissions, users’ roles and editing capabilities
    can be modified within the interface. At the same time, new users can be registered
    by providing relevant contact information, degree, or additional information in
    each case. Figure 13. View of the user administration application. 5. Conclusions
    In this paper, we presented DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI. This advanced web application acts
    as the Front-End of DEVS-BLOOM, a framework based on the DEVS oriented towards
    the IoT. This framework includes powerful capabilities such as data logging and
    storage, inference services, AI model training, and seamless integration of simulated
    and real components. The WebUI leverages the features of DEVS-BLOOM, providing
    accessible and adaptable interfaces for users from diverse backgrounds. The web
    application’s architecture is grounded in the use of Django, a robust and popular
    web development framework written in Python, which is also the programming language
    supporting DEVS-BLOOM. This choice ensures ease of maintenance and robustness
    given Python’s widespread use in data analysis and machine learning applications.
    The application encompasses a comprehensive suite of tools, including user and
    permissions management, data inspection dashboards, AI model training, prediction
    exploration, early warning notifications, and decision support systems. A notable
    addition to DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI is the SCE, which provides users with an intuitive
    means of designing and configuring the deployment of monitoring infrastructure
    within a water body. This interactive tool complements the existing features of
    the WebUI by enabling the creation of detailed simulation scenarios, which are
    crucial for the effective operation of the EWS. The practical implementation of
    the IoT-based EWS, as discussed in this paper, highlights the importance of design
    considerations, sensor technologies, and communication protocols that are essential
    for the system’s seamless data integration and real-time operation. DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI,
    with its integrated suite of tools and the SCE, represents a significant advancement
    in the field of aquatic ecosystem monitoring, offering a comprehensive solution
    for the early detection and management of HACB. DEVS-BLOOM-WebUI reflects the
    synergy between advanced simulation frameworks and user-centered design, providing
    a robust and flexible platform that can adapt to the evolving needs of researchers,
    water managers, and decision-makers in the pursuit of preserving aquatic ecosystems
    and public health. As future lines of work, it is still needed to define formal
    metrics and experimental protocols that will be used to assess the performance
    and usefulness of the application. Given the complexity of the system and the
    heterogeneity of potential users, the definition of these protocols has to be
    consensuated with experts from the different fields that are involved, such as
    biologists, water authorities and engineers. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: The current era witnesses the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT),
    a transformative force giving rise to various technological innovations, most
    notably connected objects. This paradigm shift catalyzes the widespread adoption
    of autonomous decision-making systems, particularly in sectors like agriculture,
    where the aim is to amplify productivity. As a result of the agricultural domain,
    mushrooms have concurrently emerged as a significant component of daily diets,
    offering additional vitamins and flavor. Despite their popularity, cultivating
    mushrooms in open environments poses challenges in maintaining optimal environmental
    conditions, prompting numerous research efforts. Recognizing the inconsistencies
    in existing approaches to safeguard vital parameters in mushroom farms, this paper
    introduces an innovative system utilizing intelligent sensors whose real-time
    records are managed based on the fuzzy sets concept. These sensors, encompassing
    the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2, DHT22 Sensor, Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR sensor), and Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR sensor), collectively capture
    essential data for decision-making in mushroom farming. Employing fuzzy logic,
    the system addresses pivotal aspects such as substrate watering, environmental
    control, light management, and pest detection. Through experimental results, it
    becomes evident that the proposed system not only exemplifies the potential of
    IoT technologies in agriculture but also offers a comprehensive and efficient
    approach to real-time decision-making. By aggregating sensor data, the system
    proves instrumental in enhancing the quality and yield of mushroom crops, showcasing
    a promising trajectory for sustainable and technologically driven agricultural
    practices.

    current era witnesses the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), a transformative
    force giving rise to various technological innovations, most notably connected
    objects. This paradigm shift catalyzes the widespread adoption of autonomous decision-making
    systems, particularly in sectors like agriculture, where the aim is to amplify
    productivity. As a result of the agricultural domain, mushrooms have concurrently
    emerged as a significant component of daily diets, offering additional vitamins
    and flavor. Despite their popularity, cultivating mushrooms in open environments
    poses challenges in maintaining optimal environmental conditions, prompting numerous
    research efforts. Recognizing the inconsistencies in existing approaches to safeguard
    vital parameters in mushroom farms, this paper introduces an innovative system
    utilizing intelligent sensors whose real-time records are managed based on the
    fuzzy sets concept. These sensors, encompassing the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor
    v1.2, DHT22 Sensor, Light Dependent Resistor (LDR sensor), and Passive Infrared
    Receiver (PIR sensor), collectively capture essential data for decision-making
    in mushroom farming. Employing fuzzy logic, the system addresses pivotal aspects
    such as substrate watering, environmental control, light management, and pest
    detection. Through experimental results, it becomes evident that the proposed
    system not only exemplifies the potential of IoT technologies in agriculture but
    also offers a comprehensive and efficient approach to real-time decision-making.
    By aggregating sensor data, the system proves instrumental in enhancing the quality
    and yield of mushroom crops, showcasing a promising trajectory for sustainable
    and technologically driven agricultural practices. Previous article in issue Next

    farmingFuzzy logicNational food security 1. Introduction Agriculture poses a significant
    concern for humanity, as it is the primary source of food production. Many individuals
    suffer from hunger due to food scarcity, particularly in Third-world countries
    [22]. Food scarcity has been associated with socioeconomic elements like the expanding
    population [48]. Over the last five decades, the global population has risen by
    3–6 billion, intensifying the demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger
    led to the chronic malnourishment of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016.
    Furthermore, more than 10 million individuals perish annually due to starvation
    [14]. Therefore, increasing food production is crucial in eradicating hunger and
    poverty. However, the reality is far from simple; agriculture remains largely
    unmodernized in many countries, leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity,
    there is a requirement for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing
    farming methods beyond conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production
    yields qualitatively. This necessitates integrating constantly evolving technological
    innovations [49]. Its purpose is to empower farming methods to match agricultural
    production with the increasing population, thereby reducing prevalent hunger [2].
    The global rise in mushroom cultivation can be attributed to the nutritional richness
    and distinctive culinary characteristics of mushrooms [50]. There is a forecast
    that the worldwide mushroom market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons
    by 2028 [21]. Regrettably, mushrooms have not garnered significant interest among
    farmers due to the high labor requirement during the practice. Additionally, cultivating
    specific mushroom varieties poses challenges, especially in regions where wild
    mushroom cultivation is prevalent [17]. Unlike most agricultural species, mushrooms
    must be cultivated in a specific environment, avoiding high temperatures and low
    humidity to achieve the most favorable harvest [[18], [19]]. Historically, mushrooms
    have been naturally grown in the wild and harvested from their natural habitats
    [36], affecting the harvest of this crucial agricultural product. Over the past
    ten years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a crucial tool across various
    domains [53]. Specifically in agriculture, IoT is employed to create interconnected
    farming systems that optimize productivity while conserving resources [26]. This
    advanced technology enables farmers to enhance agricultural productivity sustainably
    with reduced environmental risks [31,47]. Through the deep integration of state-of-the-art
    technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing,
    smart agriculture represents a strategic approach for the agricultural sector
    to autonomously monitor, control, and make informed decisions with the assistance
    of information and knowledge [1,4,39]. This integration is achieved through the
    deployment of IoT sensors in agricultural practices. This proves particularly
    beneficial in agricultural activities, especially for crops that demand extra
    care during cultivation, such as mushrooms. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    mushroom cultivation by incorporating various intelligent systems, primarily concentrating
    on regulating temperature and air humidity through automated watering systems
    [32]. Nevertheless, other crucial factors remain overlooked in mushroom plant
    cultivation, such as managing light exposure [23], addressing insect disruptions
    [9] and utilizing natural or artificial lights a crucial environmental factor
    that significantly enhances the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest
    [24,27,33,54]. These factors play a vital role in the growth and metabolism of
    mushrooms, influencing mycelium characteristics (growth rate, density, and color)
    and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies (stalk, cap, and color formation)
    [23]. It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent''s presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm. To alleviate the challenges
    with the current mushroom production, this study aims to provide an IoT-based
    system that integrates various modules to intelligently control vital parameters:
    temperature, humidity, substrate moisture, light intensity, and pest management.
    The proposed method integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) in the IoT module to enable the
    sensor-recorded data use as enablers of the system functionality based on their
    comparison with the pre-recorded standard data, specifying optimal ranges for
    each vital parameter. The system triggers actuators when sensor data falls outside
    the desired range to keep the environmental parameters of the farm in the desired
    range, effective for mushroom cultivation. It is important to note that the proposed
    method incorporates self-decision-making through FL, a mathematical modeling technique
    mimicking human decision-making. To achieve our objectives, the contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows: 1. Monitoring the sensors'' recorded
    data for an intelligent and adaptive environment, ensuring optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation, and automating the farm''s vital environmental parameters.
    2. Optimizing agricultural resources, namely, water and pesticide, by introducing
    the sensors not used in the previous works. Keeping the objective of this work
    under the mushroom cultivation field, the diversification of our method leads
    to a more nuanced understanding of the environmental factors that can be applied
    to several types of mushrooms. The structure of this paper is outlined as follows:
    In Section 2, the literature review and the current state of the art about the
    focal point of this study are presented. Section 3 outlines the design and methodology
    employed in this work. The results are deliberated in Section 4, with concluding
    remarks provided in the last Section 5. 2. Literature review and materials 2.1.
    Existing literature Intelligent environmental control applications have successfully
    enhanced agricultural applications, particularly in mushroom farming research.
    The research works in Jararweh et al. [28] employed FL connected to various actuators,
    which have been adjusted based on the data gathered during the process. The results
    obtained by Jararweh et al. [28] showed significant improvement over the existing
    works. However, optimal farm control has not been achieved. The study by Chandrappa
    et al. [12] focused on using sensor automation technology to aid farmers in making
    manual and automatic agricultural decisions. However, these efforts mainly concentrated
    on monitoring moisture content in the substrate, air temperature, and humidity
    in the mushroom field, ignoring other crucial parameters that may impact the quality
    and quantity of the mushroom yield. Factors such as cultivation techniques, mechanical
    damage, storage conditions, and post-harvest manipulation also play a significant
    role [11,40]. It is worth noting that the integration of FL in agricultural applications
    [13,29,30,42] has been proven to be one of the most efficient techniques to control
    the variation of the farms’ parameters based on the classification of the data
    in place classification in various sets. The introduction of IoT in agricultural
    applications has also shown promising improvement in crop production, such as
    in Marzuk and Ying [34] and Thong-u and Wongsaroj [45]. Specifically, the work
    by Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45] conducted across three mushroom fields and one
    adjacent sample area, employing wireless communication to merge the data from
    these fields utilized the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
    to centralize information from each field, which was then uploaded to an online
    platform. Similarly, Marzuki and Ying [34] utilized an online interface for real-time
    monitoring. However, their approach involved a more comprehensive array of sensors,
    measuring additional parameters such as air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide
    levels, and light quality. They used ThingSpeak as a cloud platform connected
    to the web-based visualization window. Moreover, the work of Rahman et al. [38]
    automated agricultural decisions and executed the process according to fixed time
    interval-based schedules. 2.2. The state-of-the-art Edible mushrooms are highly
    prized for their nutritional and medicinal properties, thanks to the presence
    of diverse bioactive elements, including proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
    polysaccharides, dietary fibres, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, making them
    a valuable food resource [3]. Due to their nutritional and medicinal advantages,
    mushrooms have gained widespread popularity worldwide in recent years. Global
    mushroom production has jumped 21.3 times since 1990, reaching 44 million tons
    in 2021 [7]. Various research works have predicted that the worldwide mushroom
    market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons by 2028 [21]. These statistics
    demonstrate that mushrooms are a natural resource experiencing growing demand
    annually. Considering this information, various cultivation methods have been
    created by preserving traditional practices or incorporating technological advancements.
    Some research has shown that implementing innovative cultivation techniques in
    mushroom farming can boost production to meet the annual demand figures. The significance
    of mushrooms in sustaining human life is underscored in earlier sections, emphasizing
    the role of technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and highlighting
    the importance of technology, particularly the IoT, as a solution to enhance efficiency
    in agriculture, leading to the development of intelligent crop production systems.
    This study applies IoT to intelligently monitor the substrate for mushroom cultivation
    based on the features of existing works, such as sensor integration, digital data
    transmission, and wireless sensor networks. These technologies enable diverse
    devices, fostering IoT implementation in agriculture. Intelligent irrigation,
    optimized fertilizer usage, pest control, and water and soil quality monitoring
    are among the practices benefiting from IoT applications [41]. Wireless Sensor
    Networks facilitate crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural applications
    by enabling long-distance communication and enhancing energy efficiency [51].
    Monitoring technologies within IoT solutions play a crucial role in ensuring food
    safety and quality. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions establish information networks
    for effective decision-making and product management for crops and the entire
    agricultural supply chain. Integrating networks, sensors, and data processing
    offers water-use solutions, especially in regions with limited water resources.
    This leads to water conservation and food security. IoT technology also provides
    real-time information, reduces labor, enhances productivity in planting activities,
    and promotes efficient water usage. Furthermore, the impact of this information
    extends to the utilization of lighting, pumps, and agricultural machinery [41].
    FL is an approach to reasoning that relies on approximations and assumptions,
    mirroring human thought processes. FL-based algorithms have extensive applications
    in areas like data hiding based on adaptability [17,46], automation of production
    lines [37], and digital images forensics with steganalysis [15,16]. FL represents
    an improvement over Boolean logic by introducing the concept of partial truth
    [45]. FL, on the other hand, incorporates the highest Boolean logic value with
    a degree of truth ranging between 0 and 1. One of the critical advantages of FL
    is its departure from classical logic, enabling the direct utilization of expert
    knowledge without the need for extensive training. It also integrates seamlessly
    with conventional control methods rooted in natural language [10]. It is crucial
    to note that FL is known for its superior energy efficiency compared to classical
    logic [6]. Applying FL, which involves setting a threshold value for the desired
    parameter unit to regulate the environmental factors in agricultural crop cultivation,
    specific parameters are defined as reference points for the implementation and
    tailored to the individual sensors utilized in the test area. Typically, FL is
    integrated into agricultural machinery automation systems to administer treatments
    based on the derived decisions. Based on the in-depth analysis, this research
    proposes a new IoT-based smart system using FL to manage the environmental parameters
    of the mushroom cultivation substrate. The proposed system incorporates sensors
    such as light intensity and infrared sensors to gather more comprehensive information
    aligning with the specific needs of mushroom plants to regulate parameters like
    lighting levels and manage the presence of insects, which significantly affect
    mushroom production. 3. Methodology This section outlines the overall approach
    and fundamental principles of the model under consideration. It comprises five
    crucial subsections that detail the proposed system''s important features. In
    this article, we employ FL to self-regulate the vital parameters within the mushroom
    substrate to improve the existing methods based on traditional human-controlled
    methods. 3.1. Workflow overview of the proposed model This subsection provides
    comprehensive details of the proposed model''s workflow in Fig. 1. The proposed
    model mainly comprises sensors, actuators, and cloud components. It is worth noting
    that the proposed model delves into a detailed examination of the various modules
    employed, elucidating their contributions to the overall functionality of the
    proposed method. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Comprehensive architecture of the proposed method. The
    system is crafted using two microcontrollers, with the primary microcontroller,
    NodeMCU ESP8266, serving as the central hub for data acquisition and embedded
    FL control. Simultaneously, the secondary microcontroller, Arduino UNO, is dedicated
    to disseminating information to farmers through a web-based platform. Additionally,
    specific sensors tailored to the environmental control needs of mushroom plants
    have been chosen. These sensors are connected to the main microcontroller, which
    reads and processes data. The gathered data are compiled into data packets before
    being transmitted and then uploaded to a digital platform. The schematic circuit
    for the designed system is illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described, the
    main microcontroller incorporates FL to autonomously determine the treatment and
    decision-making in managing the environmental control process. The user can control
    all these parameters based on the real-time data recorded concerning the soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity. Download : Download high-res

    proposed method. 3.2. Data collection To collect the data, this work uses the
    sensor unit. The sensors unit comprises dedicated sensors designed to focus on
    specific parameters established as references in this work. These sensors encompass
    a soil moisture meter, a light sensor for measuring light intensity levels, a
    temperature and humidity measuring sensor for recording ambient temperature and
    humidity, and a motion detection sensor. Calibration has been conducted on all
    sensors to avoid acquiring irrelevant data values that could result in irregularities
    during the operational process. 3.2.1. Soil moisture sensing The chosen sensor
    for measuring soil moisture content is the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.
    This selection is based on its capability to measure soil moisture levels using
    capacitive sensing. Constructed with corrosion-resistant materials and coated
    with a layer of PCB paint, this sensor offers an extended service life and an
    aesthetically pleasing appearance. Its operation involves measuring changes in
    capacitance resulting from variations in soil electrolyte content. With an operating
    voltage range of approximately 3.3 to 5.5 V, the sensor is well-suited for application
    with microcontrollers that typically output low voltages, such as 3.3 V or 5 V,
    as used in this work. 3.2.2. Light intensity sensing This work employs a module-based
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity levels. The rationale
    behind selecting this module is the work''s preference for output in the form
    of an analog value regarding light intensity levels, and this module is more straightforward
    to implement. As its name implies, this sensor relies on a resistor whose resistance
    value can vary based on the received light levels. This module operates at a compatible
    voltage, making it suitable for integration into this project. The module can
    capture light intensity levels ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 lux. On the other hand,
    this sensor''s resistance value spans 0.1 to 1000 kΩ. Additionally, it can function
    within a temperature range of −60 to 75 Celsius, aligning with the optimal temperature
    and humidity conditions for mushrooms, maintaining elevated humidity levels and
    lower temperature levels. 3.2.3. Temperature and humidity sensing The optimal
    temperature required for mushroom cultivation ranges from 22 to 28 Celsius, while
    the optimal air humidity ranges from 80 % to 90 % [38]. Therefore, the DHT22 sensor
    is employed to measure the air temperature and humidity levels. Its use of a calibrated
    digital signal output enhances its effectiveness. Moreover, its low voltage requirement
    underscores the sensor''s suitability, operating within the 3.3 to 6 V DC range.
    The sensor exhibits a measurement range of 0–100 % for air humidity, with an accuracy
    of +-2 %, and −40 to 80 Celsius for temperature, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees
    Celsius difference. Notably, the sensor demonstrates responsive performance, boasting
    an average sensing period of 2 s. These attributes make the DHT22 sensor a promising
    choice for implementing intelligent agricultural environmental control processes.
    3.2.4. Motion detection sensing Detecting the presence of insects is a crucial
    consideration in all stages of crop cultivation. Farmers can identify the presence
    of insects using a sensor known as the Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR), with the
    HC-SR501 PIR sensor specifically employed in this work. This module detects the
    levels of infrared radiation the embedded pyroelectric module receives. The sensor
    exhibits noteworthy sensitivity, featuring an adjustable sensitivity range and
    a detection area angle of approximately 110 degrees from the sensor knob. Moreover,
    it can detect movement between 3 and 7 m perpendicularly. Despite its capabilities,
    the sensor is power-efficient, requiring only a low power supply within the range
    of 5 to 12 V and accommodating temperatures from −15 to 70 Celsius. These attributes
    make the sensor highly suitable for the requirements of this work. 3.3. Data processing
    The data processing is mainly based on the controlling unit. For the controller
    unit of this study, two microcontrollers are employed, each with distinct roles.
    Both microcontrollers are supplied with a working voltage of 9 V using a power
    supply. This facilitates the implementation of the designed tool, allowing direct
    connection to electricity with a higher voltage range of 220–240 V. The primary
    microcontroller reads and processes data from each sensor, enabling automatic
    decision-making to maintain optimal farm environmental conditions based on the
    implemented FL. The Arduino UNO R3 is the chosen controller for this processing
    task. The selection is based on the specific pin requirements for this project,
    where two analog pins and ten digital pins are necessary. The two analog pins
    are utilized to interface with the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and LDR Sensor,
    as the data processing for these sensors rely on acquiring analog values. Additionally,
    the ten digital pins serve various purposes. Two are allocated for connecting
    the DHT22 and PIR sensors, two receivers (RX) and a Transmitter (TX) establish
    communication with other microcontrollers, and the remaining six are designated
    for connecting relays with six channels. Given the inherent incapacity of the
    main microcontroller, Arduino UNO R3, to establish an internet connection, an
    additional microcontroller is employed to facilitate data upload to the internet
    in this work. This component is called NodeMCU ESP8266, featuring an embedded
    ESP8266 WiFi Module chip that enables seamless internet connectivity. By utilizing
    this embedded chip, this module assumes the role of an agent responsible for executing
    the data upload process to the chosen web-based digital platform. Consequently,
    it facilitates the real-time presentation of agricultural land data to farmers.
    3.4. Cloud platform As previously mentioned, using two microcontrollers accommodates
    all acquired sensor data. It facilitates its upload to a web-based digital platform
    named ThingerIO. The data obtained by Arduino UNO R3 is transmitted to NodeMCU
    ESP8266 through serial communication. This communication is established by reverse
    interconnecting each module''s RX and TX pins. On the Arduino UNO microcontroller,
    pin D0 is the RX, and pin D1 is the TX. In contrast, on the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller,
    pin D6 is designated as the RX and D7 as the TX. The data transmission initiates
    with NodeMCU ESP8266 initializing a data request through the serial transmission
    of a specific character to Arduino UNO R3. Subsequently, Arduino UNO R3 continually
    checks for requests at intervals of 2 s. Upon detecting a data request, Arduino
    UNO R3 consolidates the sensor data into a single packet. Then, it transmits it
    to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial communication. 3.5. System functionality This section
    provides a comprehensive overview of the design and functionality of the proposed
    system. It delves into the intricacies of the system''s architecture, elucidating
    the operation of FL within specified parameter boundaries established in this
    study. Fig. 3 illustrates the system''s overall workflow, outlining the specifics
    of input segmentation derived from various sensors. The process includes a detailed
    examination of microcontrollers and the integration of FL, ultimately resulting
    in automated and intelligent monitoring control. Download : Download high-res
    image (244KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Workflow of the smart
    farming unit. 3.5.1. Data acquisition The Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor is linked
    to pin A0 on the Arduino UNO R3 using analog pins. Consequently, the data displayed
    on the Arduino is initially in the form of raw analog data, which is then transformed
    into a percentage format using the map() function, designating 0 as the lower
    limit and 100 as the upper limit. This conversion results in a final percentage
    value for the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor within the 0–100 per cent range.
    Similarly, the LDR sensor is connected to pin A2 on the Arduino UNO R3, and its
    initial output is raw analog data. A formula derived from the calibration process
    is applied to convert this value into lux, utilizing the coefficient values obtained
    from a previously conducted linear regression. The × value represents this equation''s
    analog data obtained from the LDR. The DHT22 is linked to pin D4 on the Arduino
    UNO R3 for digital pins. With the assistance of the available library, incorporating
    the DHT22 sensor into the system is a straightforward process. The acquired data
    from the DHT22 sensor provides direct outputs in degrees Celsius for temperature
    and percentage values for humidity. Moving on to the next sensor, PIR, is connected
    to pin D3 on the Arduino UNO R3. In the program, this sensor is designated as
    a digital input value. It is solely utilized to display acquisition data within
    the ``high'''' and ``low'''' value ranges. The other digital pin connects two
    relays, each comprising 4 and 2 channels, with each relay point linked to pins
    D6-D11 on the Arduino UNO R3. In addition, for the power requirements of all the
    modules, this work does not establish a direct connection between the sensors''
    two power pins (GND and VCC) and relays with the power pin on the Arduino UNO
    R3. Instead, these pins are directly linked to the primary 9 V power source obtained
    from the power supply, which has been reduced to a 5 V voltage using a 3296 step-down
    module. 3.5.2. Decision making The actuation decision in the mushroom farm depends
    on the output from the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The implementation of Fuzzy
    Logic (FL) is utilized to produce appropriate output based on the given input.
    This study involves five input parameters: soil moisture (Moist), light intensity
    (Light), temperature (Temp), humidity (Hum), and motion detection (Mot). Each
    parameter has a distinct number of memberships based on the specific characteristics
    of the variable it represents. Soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection,
    and humidity typically have three memberships (low, medium, and high) using a
    triangular membership function to capture the varying states relevant to the desired
    ranges. Light intensity is set to have four memberships (very low, low, medium,
    and high) utilizing a trapezoidal membership function, allowing for more nuanced
    categories that align with the specific illumination needs in the mushroom farm.
    For all parameters, the choice of memberships is tailored to the inherent complexities
    and variations of each parameter, enabling the fuzzy logic system to effectively
    model the intricacies of the monitored conditions in applications like smart farming
    or agriculture. In essence, the preference for triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions arises from their simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to
    accurately model the gradual and non-linear transitions inherent in agricultural
    and environmental parameters. While other membership functions like Gaussian,
    bell-shaped, or sigmoidal can be employed, their suitability depends on the specific
    characteristics of the parameters being modeled. Gaussian functions, for instance,
    are adept at representing symmetric and bell-shaped distributions but may not
    be as intuitive for the gradual transitions seen in agriculture. Similarly, bell-shaped
    functions may be suitable for certain parameters with a well-defined peak. However,
    they might not capture the asymmetry found in soil moisture or air temperature
    transitions. Sigmoidal functions, known for gradual transitions, may lack the
    flexibility needed to represent the specific ranges and categories vital in the
    mushroom cultivation context. The choice of triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions for soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, humidity, and
    light intensity in the context of mushroom cultivation proves advantageous due
    to their ability to accurately capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of environmental
    conditions. Triangular membership functions are well-suited for parameters like
    soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, and humidity, as they allow
    for a smooth and gradual transition between low, medium, and high levels. This
    is crucial in representing the continuous and variable characteristics of these
    parameters in mushroom cultivation. Trapezoidal membership functions, on the other
    hand, provide a more flexible and detailed representation, particularly suitable
    for light intensity. In mushroom farming, where lighting conditions are pivotal
    for different growth stages, the trapezoidal function''s additional category allows
    for a more refined categorization of illumination levels. Triangular and trapezoidal
    membership functions offer precision, flexibility, and adaptability, making them
    superior choices for modeling the intricacies of the monitored conditions in smart
    mushroom farming. Drawing on the insights presented in [43], this research introduces
    a three-membership model for soil moisture, aiming to categorize moisture content
    into low, medium, and high ranges. A low soil moisture level (0 % to 30 %) suggests
    drier conditions that may hinder optimal mushroom growth. The medium soil moisture
    category (25 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range conducive to various stages
    of mushroom development. Conversely, high soil moisture (60 % to 100 %) indicates
    excessive wetness, posing challenges such as waterlogging and heightened vulnerability
    to diseases. Extending this methodology to air temperature, a three-membership
    model is applied. Low air temperature (0 °C to 15 °C) signals cooler conditions
    that might slow down mushroom development. The medium air temperature category
    (10 °C to 25 °C) supports diverse growth stages, from mycelium colonization to
    fruiting body formation. Conversely, high air temperature (20 °C to 30 °C) requires
    careful management to avoid heat stress. Furthermore, based on insights from [25],
    a three-membership model is employed for humidity. Low humidity (0 % to 50 %)
    suggests that drier conditions are less favorable for optimal mushroom growth.
    The medium humidity category (40 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range supporting
    various mushroom development stages. Conversely, high humidity (60 % to 100 %)
    indicates excess moisture, posing challenges like increased susceptibility to
    diseases and issues related to waterlogged substrate. Aligning with motion detection
    and light intensity, referenced by Sun et al., low motion detection indicates
    minimal movement, the standard condition during cultivation. Medium motion detection
    suggests occasional disturbances, while high motion detection indicates undesirable
    continuous motion in a controlled mushroom cultivation environment. Finally, regarding
    light intensity, this research employs a four-membership model to define distinct
    illumination levels. Very low light intensity (0 to 500 lux) is suitable for specific
    phases like spore germination. Low light intensity (400 to 1000 lux) caters to
    mycelium growth. Medium-light intensity (800 to 2000 lux) is conducive to various
    growth stages, including fruiting body formation. High light intensity (1500 to
    5000 lux) supports intense lighting conditions beneficial for mushroom maturation.
    The implementation of FL entails connecting the input values gathered from all
    sensors, which are then employed to ascertain the output values following a predefined
    set of rules (see Table 1). To achieve this, a series of if-then rules are devised
    to work in conjunction with the membership function of each parameter. The Mamdani''s
    type is chosen in this work due to its suitability for the proposed approach.
    In this context, the fuzzy output translates into the automation of various paired
    actuators. Table 1. Proposed fuzzy logic rules. IF soil moisture AND air temperature

    humidity, Stop motion, Decrease light intensity Fig. 4 represents the design of
    this FL flow, focusing on how it is optimized. The optimization of fuzzy parameters
    in the proposed model involves a meticulous process tailored to each environmental
    parameter. Soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, motion detection, and light
    intensity are systematically categorized into appropriate membership functions
    and ranges. For soil moisture, a three-membership model is employed, with specific
    ranges such as low moisture (0 % to 30 %) hindering optimal growth and high moisture
    (60 % to 100 %) indicating excess wetness. Air temperature, humidity, and motion
    detection follow similar optimization, aligning temperature and humidity ranges
    with different growth stages. Download : Download high-res image (256KB) Download

    categories reflect the standard and undesirable movement during cultivation. Notably,
    light intensity is optimized with a four-membership model, allowing for precise
    categorization suited to the level of light needed in the mushroom farm. Following
    the data acquisition of these parameters, the subsequent step in the FL workflow
    involves fuzzification. Here, each parameter''s input value is adapted to conform
    with the established FL rules. This fuzzification process occurs within the rule
    evaluation segment, where several fuzzy membership rules are integrated. The outcome
    of this phase undergoes a defuzzification process, resulting in a fuzzy output
    value readable by the device and ready for further management to operate the connected
    actuator. 3.5.3. System monitoring This section details how sensor-acquired data
    becomes immediately accessible to farmers. The Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
    oversees the data acquisition, packaging the dataset for transmission to the data-uploading
    microcontroller. Following receiving data from the Arduino UNO R3, the NodeMCU
    ESP8266 executes the data upload process to the web-based digital platform. The
    NodeMCU ESP8266 is configured to receive a Service Set Identifier (SSID) connection
    exclusively from a specific access point, as it can only connect to the singular
    SSID designated in the program. An LED indicator signifies a successful internet
    connection for the module. Once the NodeMCU ESP8266 receives the data, the subsequent
    step involves breaking down the data based on the acquisition from each sensor.
    After this breakdown, the data upload process unfolds on the digital platform.
    A deliberate delay is incorporated between each data upload event to prevent the
    potential occurrence of a data upload process deemed spam. The digital platform
    interface uses numeric, gauge, and graphical representations. Numerical and gauge-based
    information is consolidated within one feature, while graphical displays are presented
    separately. Each graph''s x-label provides detailed time information, while the
    y-label indicates specific data acquisition details. The x-label on each graph
    is intentionally designed with varying time intervals. For instance, the graphs
    depicting soil moisture, light intensity, and air humidity display data every
    5 s, while the graph for air temperature is programmed to show data every 30 s.
    This adjustment is made considering the responsiveness of the temperature changes,
    which necessitate a longer time frame compared to other parameters. 4. Result
    and discussion In this section, we present the results obtained and their related
    discussions. It is important to note that the features of the proposed method
    are based on its ability to assess soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity,
    and light intensity and identify the presence of insects. In line with the validation
    of the results, calibration is essential to verify that each sensor employed as
    a data retrieval module adheres to established measurement standards. Moreover,
    to provide the proposed method''s context and validate the findings, the preliminaries
    of this section consist of comparing the proposed mushroom cultivation model with
    baseline models as reported by Sun et al. [43] and Dela Cruz and De Leon [20].
    Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of baseline models commonly employed in
    mushroom cultivation, including Open Field Cultivation, Automated Watering Systems,
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control. Each
    model is briefly characterized by its main features, outlining the strengths and
    limitations of these existing methodologies. The proposed new model, IoT and Fuzzy
    Logic-based Control is introduced as a comprehensive advancement. It integrates
    IoT for real-time data acquisition and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control.
    This integration aims to optimize environmental conditions for mushroom growth,
    addressing the shortcomings observed in the baseline models. Table 2. Comparison
    of the proposed model with benchmark algorithms. Model Main features Open field
    cultivation Traditional method with limited control over environmental parameters.
    Automated watering system Enhances water management but lacks adaptive control
    based on real-time conditions. Sensor network-based environment control Provides
    real-time data but may not adapt dynamically to varying cultivation needs. IoT-based
    environment control Offers remote monitoring and control but may require more
    sophisticated decision-making. Proposed IoT and fuzzy logic-based control Integrates
    IoT for real-time data and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control, optimizing
    environmental conditions for mushroom growth. The proposed IoT and Fuzzy Logic-based
    control model represents a significant advancement in mushroom cultivation methodologies,
    surpassing the capabilities of the baseline models in several key aspects. While
    traditional Open Field Cultivation and Automated Watering Systems offer basic
    approaches, they lack the adaptability and precision required for optimal growth.
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control models
    provide real-time data. However, the former may not dynamically adapt, and the
    latter may face challenges in sophisticated decision-making. In contrast, our
    proposed model combines the strengths of IoT for continuous, real-time data acquisition
    and fuzzy logic for adaptive, nuanced control. This integration enables the system
    to make precise, context-aware adjustments based on the complex interplay of environmental
    variables, fostering an optimized and responsive cultivation environment. By leveraging
    these modern technologies, the comprehensive and advanced nature of our approach
    positions it as a valuable and innovative contribution to the field, poised to
    elevate the standards of mushroom cultivation practices. 4.1. Results based on
    sensor precision The soil moisture sensor undergoes calibration by obtaining analog
    values at two humidity levels: very wet (immersing the sensor in water) and dry
    (placing the sensor in a dry location). Subsequently, the map function is employed
    to convert the analog values into percentage values. Following this, calibration
    is executed using the Gouevn Soil Moisture Meter, comparing values acquired at
    four water depth points: 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, and 100 ml. The outcomes of the
    soil moisture sensor calibration are detailed in Table 3. Post-calibration, the
    average error value is 4,79 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 95,21 %. Table

    error 4,79 Accuracy 95,21 In contrast to other sensors, the calibration procedure
    for this sensor involves comparing the reading from the reference sensor with
    the analog-to-analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value acquired. The Digital Lux
    Meter AS803 serves as the reference sensor in this process. The coefficient value
    is derived and then applied to the Arduino UNO R3 using the linear regression
    function. The x-value represents the ADC value from the sensor. At the same time,
    the y-value corresponds to the lux value determined through the comparative analysis.
    Like the previous step, the calibration is executed by re-evaluating and converting
    ADC values to lux values on the Light Dependent Resistor sensor against the digital
    readings on the reference measuring device. In this instance, the average error
    is 3,62 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 96,38 %. The outcomes of the light-dependent
    resistor sensor calibration are detailed in Table 4. The calibration of the DHT22
    involves comparing it with the Sanfix TH-308A. The data collection, performed
    nine times, includes air temperature measurements ranging from 16 to 40 degrees
    Celsius. Additionally, air humidity levels are measured using the Ultrasonic Humidifier
    Support Arduino module to manipulate humidity levels. Like the prior sensors,
    calibration is achieved by computing the average error value, resulting in a 97,33
    % accuracy for air temperature measurements and a 97,85 % accuracy for air humidity
    measurements, with an average error of 2,67 % for air temperature measurements
    and 2,15 % for air humidity measurements. The outcomes of the DHT22 sensor calibration

    overall system A crucial element in intelligent mushroom cultivation involves
    a real-time regulation of vital parameters in the farming space. This method benefits
    from the FL paradigm by optimizing the environmental parameters, ensuring favorable
    conditions for cultivation, and achieving high-quality productivity in mushroom
    farming. The FL program makes decisions to oversee multiple actuators, aiding
    in executing environmental control tasks for the mushroom farm. The evaluation
    process entails subjecting each measurement parameter to manipulated conditions
    and comparing it with sensor data. This work seeks to omit a timeframe for implementing
    FL to avoid excessive decision-making, significantly leading to potential overtreatment.
    The monitoring procedure is conducted using a web-based system with a sample interface
    illustrated in Fig. 5, which consists of a display accessible to farmers on a
    real-time basis. The interface gauge for soil moisture and air humidity depicts
    data in percentage units (%), ranging from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum value
    of 100. In contrast, the design of the interface gauge for light intensity differs.
    It presents data in lux units, with a minimum value of 58 lux (equivalent to a
    value of 1023 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor) for dark conditions and a maximum
    value of 500 lux (equivalent to a value of 6 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor)
    for bright conditions. The interface gauge for air temperature displays data in
    centigrade units, with a defined minimum value of 14 degrees Celsius and a maximum
    value of 40 degrees Celsius. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download

    information through an interface gauge, we have also incorporated information
    delivery to farmers through a graph, as depicted in Fig. 6. In this context, the
    graph serves as a data logger within a specified time frame. The x-axis of the
    graph represents time, while the y-axis displays data obtained from each sensor.
    We set one minute for soil moisture, air humidity, and light intensity graphs,
    with data appearing every five seconds. In the case of the air temperature graph,
    a period of three minutes is defined, with data appearing every thirty seconds.
    Graphs with one minute allow a precise observation of line level changes when
    the sensor registers data outside the reference range. In essence, FL can promptly
    provide information for decision-making on each actuator to execute environmental
    control in less than five seconds. Download : Download high-res image (664KB)

    techniques. Table 6 illustrates differences across various aspects of each study,
    including objectives and developed features. While all the studies in this section
    share the goal of enhancing environmental quality in mushroom crops, each focuses
    on distinct aspects. The detailed discussion on features is categorized into groups,
    such as the sensors used, the implemented technology communication model, and
    user-feedback applications on the job. Table 6. Features comparison between the

    wind and air. The diversity extends to the forms of technology communication and
    the availability of user-feedback applications. The proposed research employs
    various sensors for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and
    motion detection. To facilitate user feedback, we utilize two serially connected
    microcontrollers through a digital platform named ThingerIO. 4.3.2. Results comparison
    Besides the features comparison, it is worth noting that the number of monitored
    farm''s vital parameters consists of significant results to take care of to highlight
    the relevance and significance of the engineering findings, which emphasize the
    contribution of the proposed method in the current research landscape. Table 7
    offers a nuanced evaluation of the proposed method alongside existing state-of-the-art
    approaches. Beyond the conventional features comparison, the introduction underscores
    the significance of the number of monitored vital parameters as a pivotal metric
    for highlighting the engineering findings'' relevance and importance in the current
    research landscape. Based on the table data, it is evident that the proposed method
    stands out prominently. It excels in monitoring a comprehensive set of 5 vital
    parameters, surpassing the more limited scopes of the approaches outlined by Rahman
    et al. and Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45]. This expanded range implies a heightened
    capacity to capture diverse facets of the mushroom cultivation environment, enhancing
    the depth and richness of the data collected. Table 7. Comparison of the results.

    monitor in real-time basis [38] 2 3 Yes [12] 3 0 No [45] 2 3 Yes Proposed method
    5 6 Yes Furthermore, the proposed method distinguishes itself by employing a notable
    number of 6 actuating tools. This surpasses the comparatively lower tool count
    in the methods presented by Rahman et al. [38] and Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45].
    The greater number of actuating tools signifies a more sophisticated and versatile
    control mechanism, suggesting a higher degree of precision and adaptability in
    steering the farming of the mushroom environment. Crucially, the proposed method
    shares with Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45] the ability to monitor in real-time. This
    capability is recognized as essential for dynamic and responsive control, ensuring
    timely adjustments to changing conditions. In contrast, Rahman et al. [38] and
    Chandrappa et al. [12] lack this critical feature, potentially limiting their
    effectiveness in adapting to the rapidly evolving dynamics of the mushroom cultivation
    setting. The results prove that the proposed method emerges as a pioneering contribution
    to the current research landscape. Its prowess in monitoring an extensive array
    of vital parameters, utilizing a higher number of actuating tools, and facilitating
    real-time monitoring underscores its potential to revolutionize the field. 5.
    Conclusion Mushroom cultivation technology is a structured framework for overseeing
    and homogenizing the mushroom farm''s substrate environmental parameters. This
    study concentrates on the cultivation of mushrooms sharing a range of environmental
    parameters, where growth dynamics are contingent upon various physical factors,
    such as temperature, light, and humidity. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    intelligent systems in mushroom cultivation, particularly focusing on automating
    temperature and air humidity control through watering systems. Despite these efforts,
    there remains an oversight of other crucial factors in mushroom plant cultivation.
    For instance, managing light exposure, addressing insect disruptions, and utilizing
    natural or artificial lights are critical environmental considerations that significantly
    impact the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest. These factors
    are vital in influencing mycelium characteristics, such as growth rate, density,
    color, and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies, including stalk, cap, and
    color formation. It is crucial to emphasize light''s pivotal role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms. Additionally, research has identified the presence of insects,
    mites, crustaceans, and other arthropods feeding on mushrooms and decomposers
    on synthetic or wooden substrates as detrimental factors affecting the optimal
    growth of mushrooms. Consequently, there is a compelling need to advance agricultural
    technologies by considering all critical factors, enhancing both the quality and
    quantity of mushroom production. This study aims to address challenges in current
    mushroom production by developing an IoT-based system. The system integrates various
    modules to intelligently control crucial parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    substrate moisture, and light intensity. Moreover, the system incorporates a mechanism
    for pest control by automatically spraying pesticides when an external agent is
    detected in the mushroom farm. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated into the IoT module,
    allowing the recorded sensor data to enable system functionality based on comparisons
    with pre-recorded standard data, defining optimal ranges for each vital parameter.
    The system activates actuators when sensor data falls outside the desired range,
    effectively maintaining the environmental parameters within optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation. Importantly, this method introduces self-decision-making
    through FL, a mathematical modeling technique emulating human decision-making.
    The contributions of this work include intelligent and adaptive monitoring of
    sensor data for creating an optimal environment for mushroom cultivation, as well
    as the optimization of agricultural resources, such as water and pesticides, through
    the introduction of previously unused sensors. Diversifying this method allows
    for a nuanced understanding of environmental factors applicable to various types
    of mushrooms within the field of mushroom cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution

    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial
    revolution with the different technologies. Download : Download high-res image

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    Things in smart irrigation IoT refers to the network of devices, sensors, and
    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand
    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones
    can assess crop health and water use efficiency through multispectral and thermal
    imaging [109,108]. By analyzing vegetation indices and thermal patterns, drones
    can identify areas of stress, disease outbreaks, or water stress in crops. This
    data aids in targeted irrigation interventions, optimizing water use, and maximizing
    crop productivity. Drone technology enables precision irrigation by providing
    real-time and site-specific information for irrigation management [110]. With
    the collected data on soil moisture, crop health, and water use efficiency, farmers
    can determine the optimal irrigation needs of different areas within a field.
    This enables precise water application, minimizing water wastage and ensuring
    efficient water use. Constraints in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation
    in sub-saharan africa Infrastructure limitations and access to technology One
    of the significant constraints in leveraging Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies
    for smart irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa is the limited infrastructure and lack
    of access to technology [111,112]. Many rural areas in the region lack reliable
    electricity supply, internet connectivity, and adequate communication networks
    necessary for the seamless functioning of smart irrigation systems. The absence
    of basic infrastructure hampers the deployment and operation of advanced technologies
    such as sensors, IoT devices, and cloud computing platforms. Additionally, the
    high cost of technology acquisition and maintenance further restricts the access
    and adoption of 4IR solutions for smart irrigation in the region. Governance and
    policy challenges Governance and policy challenges pose significant obstacles
    to the effective utilization of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation in sub-Saharan
    Africa [111,113,114]. Fragmented regulatory frameworks, and a lack of coordination

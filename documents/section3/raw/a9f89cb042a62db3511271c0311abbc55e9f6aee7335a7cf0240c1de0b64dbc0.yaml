    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate
    \\({i}_{t}\\) is the input gate, tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
    \\({W}_{h}\\) and \\({U}_{x}\\) are the hidden-to-hidden and input-to-hidden weight
    matrices, respectively. At time step t, \\({b}_{c}\\) is the bias vector for the
    cell state, \\({x}_{t}\\) is the input, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: India's agricultural sector is dwindling, which has an impact on ecosystem
    output. Smart farming increases crop productivity by reducing waste and making
    effective use of fertiliser. Various Machine Learning techniques together with
    IoT enabled are developed for precision agriculture. However, the existing techniques
    face difficulties in forecasting weather and predicting disease accurately. In
    this work, a system is developed to automate weather forecasting and field monitoring
    using sensors. Wireless transmission is used to transfer sensor data to a web
    server database. In the first step, the collected data is pre-processed using
    normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data

    India''s agricultural sector is dwindling, which has an impact on ecosystem output.
    Smart farming increases crop productivity by reducing waste and making effective
    use of fertiliser. Various Machine Learning techniques together with IoT enabled
    are developed for precision agriculture. However, the existing techniques face
    difficulties in forecasting weather and predicting disease accurately. In this
    work, a system is developed to automate weather forecasting and field monitoring
    using sensors. Wireless transmission is used to transfer sensor data to a web
    server database. In the first step, the collected data is pre-processed using
    normalization and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data
    into meaningful data. Pre-processed data is then fed into Gated Recurrent Unit
    (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. In the second step, crop images acquired
    from sensors for disease prediction are pre-processed using Adaptive Gaussian
    Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization for contrast enhancement
    of image. Pre-processed images are then fed into ResNet50 for feature extraction
    and classification. Using these predicted data, in case of any horrible weather
    conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be automatically taken by
    the systems. On the other hand, regarding the information about horrible conditions
    and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message will be sent to the farmers.
    The proposed method is tested with several metrics which attain better performance
    like 94% accuracy for weather forecasting and 98% accuracy for field monitoring.
    Thus the proposed IoT and deep learning based model can support farmers to achieve
    a high quantity of crop production in lesser time. Previous article in issue Next

    monitoringGated Recurrent Unit (GRU) 1. Introduction India has agriculture as
    its primary occupation. IBEF (Indian Brand Enquiry Foundation) estimates that
    58 % of Indians who live in rural areas depend on agriculture. Not only in underdeveloped
    countries but also in many industrialised countries, farming and agriculture make
    up a significant component of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) (Karthick et al., 2018).
    As a result, it is urgent that existing farming methods be improved upon. It will
    help handle global catastrophes like climate change and epidemics like draught
    in addition to fostering the flourishing sustainable development of people, flora,
    and fauna (Lavanya et al., 2020). Farmers still use traditional methods such as
    manual field monitoring, which involves often watering crops and applying pesticides
    to manage pests, whether or not they are aware of the appropriate dosage. These
    old methods include disadvantages such as water logging in fields, excessive use
    of pesticides and fungicides, lack of knowledge about the kind of crops that need
    to be cultivated for a certain type of soil fertility, and lower yields than anticipated
    from the agricultural area (AshifuddinMondal & Rehena, 2018). Many farmers continue
    to cultivate using traditional techniques, which leads to low crop yields (Sushanth
    & Sujatha, 2018). Better technology will increase yield, hence reducing the likelihood
    of famine and malnutrition. The technology should be inexpensive enough that it
    can have an influence on billions of people worldwide (Ogunti, 2019; Karthick
    & Muthukumaran, 2023). Monitoring of the soil, plants, moisture, and temperature,
    as well as the management of the infrastructure and control systems, are all necessary
    for agricultural production. IoT is essential in the sector of agriculture (Thakur
    et al., 2020). Since they are utilised to offer information about agricultural
    areas, all Internet of Things sensors is quite effective. A smart agriculture
    stick advertises the novel smart agriculture programme based on IoT that enables
    farmers to have access to real-time data to track how the environment is operating,
    enabling them to engage in smart farming, increase their final yield, and ensure
    that their product meets quality standards (Phasinam et al., 2022). A wireless
    sensor network is used by this advanced agricultural monitoring system to gather
    data from a number of sensors placed at various junctions. A great amount of data
    can be analysed using such technology in precision farming after being collected
    by WSN (Khanna & Kaur, 2019). It enables farmers to boost yields while using fewer
    resources. In industrialised countries, smart framing is being carried out on
    a wide scale combining IoT, AI, and agriculture data analysis (Goel et al., 2021).
    The Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart agriculture system demonstrated that
    distant sensors are used to monitor inside settings and that micro-scale controllers
    are utilised to control and operate indoor and remote sensing systems, including
    those that take pictures and videos and even use cameras (Panda & Bhatnagar, 2020).
    Farmers may monitor and manage the microclimate in the greenhouse, as well as
    illnesses and pests that impact the plants, with the aid of precision farming
    (Arora et al., 2021). The status of the plants can be impacted by a variety of
    external elements and microclimatic interior occurrences (Gunjan et al., 2022).
    Plant development and the spread of some diseases are both impacted by temperature
    and relative humidity (Daya Sagar et al., 2023). In terms of the effectiveness
    of greenhouses, it is one of the most detrimental agricultural production illnesses
    (Cambra et al., 2018). When ambient and micro-indoor conditions are favourable,
    controlling the irrigation of water quality is easier. When growing crops in greenhouses,
    it is essential to apply the appropriate fertiliser treatments or drip system
    cleanser at the appropriate time and location (Siddiquee et al., 2022). Understanding
    the stage of the production cycle at which specific nutrient solutions should
    be used is essential (Sai Surya Teja et al., 2023). The purpose of this paper
    is to make automated and continuous field monitoring for smart agriculture using
    IoT and deep learning technologies (Karthick & Muthukumaran, 2023). The main contribution
    of the proposed work is given below: • Automated and efficient field monitoring
    model is designed through combining IoT and deep learning technology to support
    farmers in achieving higher crop production. • Sensors are assembled in an agricultural
    field to acquire data regarding agricultural factors and transmit it to cloud
    server for further analysis purposes. • Normalization and missing value imputation
    are used as data pre-processing techniques and GRU is used to forecast weather
    and soil conditions based on the acquired data. • Adaptive Gaussian filter and
    dynamic histogram equalization are used as image pre-processing techniques and
    CNN is used to detect the presence of disease using pre-processed crop image.
    • Alert SMS are sent to farmers regarding the horrible weather condition and diseases
    to render control action. Rest of the paper contains: Section 2 presents the literature
    review related to automated field monitoring. In Section 3 proposed methodology
    and architecture of the proposed methodology are given. Result and discussion
    part of the proposed methodology is given in Section 4. At last, Section 5 contains
    the conclusion part. 2. Literature review Several techniques for automatic forecasting
    of weather and field monitoring had been developed. The following section examines
    some of the current approaches utilized for weather forecasting and crop disease
    prediction in smart agriculture. (a) Weather and irrigation monitoring system
    An IoT-based smart irrigation management system combining machine learning and
    open source technology has been proposed by Goap et al. (2018). The proposed system''s
    intelligence is based on a smart algorithm that considers sensory data as well
    as elements of the short-term weather forecast, such as precipitation, air temperature,
    humidity, and UV. But the system cost of this suggested approach is high. Velmurugan
    (2020) have suggested a smart system that uses open-source technologies to forecast
    how much irrigation is needed for a given field. The entire system has been created
    and is currently being tested on a small-scale pilot project. Web-based information
    visualisation and decision support systems are used to wirelessly gather sensor
    node data via the cloud, and they deliver real-time information insights based
    on the analysis of sensor and weather forecast data. Singh et al. (2019) have
    suggested In an IoT-driven smart irrigation framework, machine learning techniques
    are used to maximise the irrigation water use by forecasting the future soil moisture
    of a field. The performance of various ML techniques is tested for predicting
    future soil moisture, and the GBRT outcomes are quite encouraging. Rani et al.
    (2020) have suggested a machine learning and neural networks-based flood monitoring
    system using IoT. This research outlines an efficient and adaptable technique
    for flood and system-altering system identification. The most cutting-edge technologies,
    including machine learning (ML), have a large positive impact on technology and
    are particularly effective at detecting both normal and pathological behaviour
    in any system. The most common, extensively used, and effective method for forecasting
    rainfall is neural networks. Real-time agricultural field monitoring utilising
    IoT-based sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles has been developed by Quach et
    al. (2021). A sensor network for gathering information on the ground is also incorporated,
    in addition to an unmanned aerial vehicle system for remote sensing. Numerous
    sensor nodes are used in the sensor network to measure various environmental and
    plant factors, including temperature, humidity, and nitrogen content. The sensor
    network transmits data using LoRa, a low-power wide-area network modulation method
    that enables a single receiver to receive signals from sensor nodes up to 450
    m away. (b) Crop disease prediction In order to predict apple disease in Kashmir
    Valley apple orchards, Akhter and Sofi (2022) suggested using data analytics and
    machine learning in an IoT system. This study reaches a pinnacle in demonstrating
    the power and promise of computing tools like the internet of things, wireless
    sensor networks, data analytics, and machine learning in agriculture. A local
    poll was also conducted to find out from the farmers how the most recent technological
    advancements affect precision farming. Khamparia et al. (2020) developed a hybrid
    deep learning model merging autoencoder with Convolutional neural network for
    crop leaf disease prediction. Obtained dataset contained 900 image samples of
    three different crops and five types of disease. From total samples 600 images
    were considered for training process and remaining 300 was considered for testing
    process. Different convolution filter size of and was used in this developed approach
    achieving 97.5 % accuracy. Krishnamoorthy et al. (2021) developed deep learning
    model along with transfer learning for prediction of disease in rice leaf. In
    traditional farming, farmers spend lot of resources as well as time consuming
    due to visualizing through naked eye and it results in unhealthy farming. Object
    segmentation and classification was achieved using InceptionResNetV2 for recognizing
    disease in rice leaf image. Kaur et al. (2022) developed hybrid CNN model for
    detection of leaf disease through utilizing feature extraction and feature reduction
    approach. Using this developed approach four different types of diseases such
    as black measles, stable, black rot and leaf blight present in grapevines was
    recognized. Plant village dataset was collected and processed using EfficientNet
    B7 deep model using transfer learning. After extracting features it was further
    reduced by applying logistic regression. According to the literature, numerous
    systems are designed for automatic field monitoring with IoT. Based on the above
    mentioned articles several significant challenges arise in automatic weather forecasting
    and field monitoring approaches. High system cost (Goap et al., 2018), alerting
    system not available (Rani et al., 2020), and only considering a single parameter
    (Akhter and Sofi, 2022) are some of the issues in the existing algorithms. Thus
    effective field monitoring is not achieved using the existing research. So, the
    current research focuses on utilizing IoT and deep learning approach for automated
    and continuous field monitoring. 3. Proposed methodology In India, one of the
    most important economic sectors is agriculture. India''s increased agricultural
    activity can be attributed to the country''s abundant irrigation-supporting water
    supplies and highly productive soil. However, a number of circumstances stop the
    production of the projected yield from occurring. To overcome these aforementioned
    issues and to support farmers with better quality and quantity crops an improved
    automated and computer based technology is designed in this current research.

    Architecture of the Proposed IoT Based System for Improved Precision Agriculture.
    The agricultural area is equipped with several IoT-based sensor nodes to gather
    real-time data. The nodes that have been assembled gather data on the state of
    the soil, moisture content of the soil, presence of humidity, presence of pests,
    diseases, and insects, as well as photographs of plants and other things. The
    information is then either sent to a cloud server based on IoT or stored locally
    in a nearby fog node. The collected data is pre-processed using normalization
    and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful
    data which is required for classification. Pre-processed data is then given as
    input for Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the weather condition. Then,
    in the second step, the images of the crop are acquired to predict the presence
    of disease and pests. The acquired crop images are pre-processed using an Adaptive
    Gaussian filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization (DHE) for
    contrast enhancement of the image. Pre-processed image is then fed to ResNet50
    for feature extraction and classification. Using these predicted data, in case
    of any horrible weather conditions and soil conditions, remedial action will be
    automatically taken by the system. On the other hand, the information regarding
    the horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert message
    will be sent to the farmers. The proposed IoT and deep learning based model can
    support the farmers to achieve quantity and quality crop production in lesser
    time. 3.1. IoT based network for data acquisition The first step in putting together
    a weather forecasting and field monitoring system is setting up a wireless sensor
    network field where each node is linked by a Wi-Fi module as well as lays data
    over a server computer, form where an automated Python script can keep polling
    the information and then transmits alert/start messages for the required procedure.

    Distributed WSN. Data collection using numerous sensors placed around the field
    or garden is the first stage in creating an automatic weather forecasting and
    field monitoring system. The gateway node, or Raspberry Pi 3 B+, will handle all
    communication with the other sensor nodes. Advanced soil moisture sensors, GSM
    and Bluetooth modules, temperature and humidity sensors, MQ2 gas sensors, pH sensors,
    water level indicators, alarm and clock modules, batteries, and relay modules
    are all included in each Arduino mega unit. Ultrasonic sensor for rodents and
    significant intruder detection. Each node will send information to the raspberry
    pi3, which functions as both the base station and the gateway node. The data storage
    on the raspberry pi will be handled by a python script, from which it might be
    displayed to the user via an application layer. The intranet can also accomplish
    what it was designed to do for data transmission from the raspberry pi to the
    server, enabling its use of it in places with limited to no internet access. The
    basic principles of receiver, transmitter, ground, and positive are the basis
    for connecting various sensors to the microcontroller. The majority of connections
    need to be made in this way, because the Arduino Mega board includes a lot of
    digital pins, RXD, analogue pins and TXD in addition to a lot of Vcc and Gnd pins.
    After building the network topology and collecting the data, the first phase of
    the proposed applications is finished. Data processing begins with the initial
    phase of data collection using various sensors. 3.1.1. Node’s structural details
    Each node is made up of a micro-controller, which in this case is advised to be
    an Arduino mega because it most closely matches the scope of the solution. Each
    node has a soil moisture sensor, a Wi-Fi module, a temperature sensor, a DHT11
    sensor, a light intensity sensor, also a battery module linked to it. Fig. 3 below
    contains each node''s block diagram. Download : Download high-res image (161KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Configuration of each sensor node.
    In order to transmit further signals to the actuators and inform the end user
    in the event that manual intrusion is required, all of the data collected by the
    sensors must be processed and analysed. 3.2. Data analysis The data kept on a
    cloud server is also taken into account for analytical purposes, whereby an AI
    system is used to predict the weather, the characteristics of the soil, irrigation,
    and illness. To automate the forecast of various agricultural aspects and take
    corrective action to increase crop output, AI systems are being considered. However
    in the data analysis process initially the information regarding temperature,
    humidity, moisture and soil condition are considered. 3.2.1. Weather monitoring
    (a) Data pre-processing The sensors'' entire collection of data has to be evaluated
    and handled. The given input datasets such as temperature, humidity moisture and
    soil properties contains some missing values. Normalization and mean based missing
    value imputation are used in the proposed method to convert the raw data into
    meaningful data which is required for classification. (b) Normalization Normally,
    attributes from the raw data are high variables and not present in a specified
    range. To accomplish a better outcome, the attributes from the data are kept in
    a uniform range of [A, B]. So here, min–max normalization method is used to normalize
    the attribute ranges. A mathematical formulation of min–max normalization is given
    in Eq. (1). (1) where represents the original value, denotes the maximum value
    of and indicates the minimum value of . (c) Mean based Missing value Imputation
    Imputation using mean values, also known as rough imputation, is a quick and simple
    imputation method that employs the mean value of all the data on the variable
    to be improved. Imputation of numerical variables is done using the mean. This
    rough imputation not only ignores the amount of variance but also the connection
    between variables, resulting in inaccurate estimations. The rough imputation approach
    should only be used when just a few missing data are present, and it is not designed
    for broad usage and is given in Eq. (2). (2) where represents the sample mean,
    and the total of each value in the sample is represented by , while the number
    of values in the population is represented by . 3.2.2. Classification A classifier
    is an algorithm that organises data into labelled informational classes or categories.
    In this designed model, GRU is used to forecast the weather. (a) Gated Recurrent
    Unit (GRU) A GRU can be viewed as a simplification and improvement of LSTM and
    is comparable in performance to LSTM. Introduce LSTM before giving a comprehensive
    description of a GRU. The hidden state is the most crucial portion of an RNN because
    it is in charge of remembering or forgetting certain information (Li et al., 2020).
    From top to bottom, GRU has a total of three layers. The 10 node input layer is
    in charge of feeding information into the hidden layer. The output unit, which
    contains two nodes and one layer, is in charge of classifying and producing the
    data processed from the hidden layer using the SoftMax classifier. 32 nodes and
    one layer make up the hidden layer. The hidden layer''s output processed data
    is handled using one-hot encoding, a real output that is gained following the
    decoding procedure. GRU consists of two gates a reset gate and an update gate
    . The two gates cooperate to regulate the flow of data into and out of the memory
    cell. Although they both use the input and the preceding concealed state to calculate
    them, their functions are distinct. A GRU makes some reductions in complexity
    compared to LSTM. Fig. 4 is a diagram of the GRU''s organisational structure.
    Eq. (3) provides the link relationship seen in Fig. 4. (3) Download : Download
    high-res image (200KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Structure of
    the GRU. In Eq. (3), candidate’s output is represented by , output vector is indicated
    using and represents the input vector. The reset gate of the GRU is designated
    by the letter , and the output gate by the letter (Xu et al., 2018). This GRU
    network is used in proposed approach to forecasting the weather in the agriculture
    area. 3.2.3. Disease prediction (a) Image pre-processing The sensors'' entire
    collection of data has to be evaluated and handled. From the information collected
    from the nodes, the Python programmes running on the Raspberry Pi will check for
    certain criteria. The input crop image dataset is pre-processed in order to convert
    the raw image into a meaningful image. Adaptive Gaussian filter and dynamic histogram
    equalization technique to remove noise and to improve the quality of the image
    for achieving accurate prediction. (b) Adaptive Gaussian filter When using a conventional
    Canny edge detector operator, the Gaussian filter is employed to smooth out the
    image and minimise the parasitic effect that sampling quantization has on the
    image. Due to the fact that both the edge and the noise are high frequency signals,
    the filter operator smoothes the image''s edges while suppressing the noise, which
    affects how accurately the edges are identified. An updated Gaussian filtering
    algorithm is put forth to address this issue; it decides whether to apply a Gaussian
    filter based on the disparity between the pixel''s grey value and the grey mean
    in the surrounding area. If the noise interferes with the image, it can be written
    as in Eq. (4): (4) where is the noise signal. When there is noise, the difference
    between the noise-affected pixel''s grey value also its neighbouring pixels is
    described as in Eq. (5). (5) Due to the approximate zero interference free D,
    the mean value difference between the point grey value of the noise-affected image
    pixel and its neighbouring pixels, called , is roughly equal to , which is the
    degree of noise hopping. (c) Dynamic histogram equalization The cropped image''s
    total number of pixels is used as the basis for the spanning function used by
    the equalisation method to perform equalisation (Dhal et al., 2018). Histogram
    equalisation and mapping the image pixels to a dynamic range are the two stages
    of the process. (d) Mapping image pixels to dynamic range The dynamic range for
    the output sub-histograms can be obtained from as Eqs. (5), (6). (6) (7) The exceptions
    are present at the two extremities, where (e) Equalizing each sub-histogram Similar
    to how a global histogram is equalised, each image''s histogram is equalised using
    the same process. The remapped values for the ith sub-histogram are derived as
    in Eq. (8). (8) where is the new intensity level corresponding to the intensity
    level on the original image, is the histogram value at the intensity level on
    the fuzzy histogram and is the total population count in the partition of the
    fuzzy histogram. 3.2.4. Classification A classifier is an algorithm that organises
    data into clearly defined categories or classes. In this designed model, ResNet50
    a kind of CNN model is used to predict plant diseases. (a) Residual Neural Network
    (ResNet50) The goal of CNN''s back propagation method is to automatically discover
    the spatial hierarchies of feature classes. Convolution, pooling, and fully connected
    (FC) units are common building components utilized in the creation of CNNs. The
    process of repeatedly running the input image through the selected filter is the
    foundation of the convolutional layer''s operation. The filter can be 3 × 3, 5
    × 5 or 7 × 7 pixels in size. As a result, the image with the filter applied to
    it becomes the input of the following layer (m2 × m3). Activation maps are created
    as a result of this convolution process. Local unique elements can be seen on
    activation maps. A filter (m1) exists for each convolutional layer (Toğaçar et
    al., 2020). The output of layer l is made up of feature maps with dimension The
    ith subset of features, displayed as , is calculated utilizing Eq. (9). The matrix
    bias is indicated by and denotes size of the filter. (9) The pooling units preserves
    image characteristics while reducing image size also expenses while maintaining
    image information. This structure reduces the number of parameters, the filter''s
    spatial dimension, and the step. It takes information in the following sizes as
    input: , and again outcomes Eqs. (10), (11), (12) demonstrates, in brief how the
    pooling layer functions. (10) (11) (12) The characteristics from the preceding
    stage are flattened before being assigned to the FC layers, which update the weights
    also provide the final values for each label. An actual multi-layered sensor for
    mapping is a convolutional network with fully interlinked units. In Eq. (13),
    the FC layer''s processing stages are displayed. (13) In the proposed method CNN
    model such as ResNet 50 is used for the training of plant disease image dataset.
    Fig. 5 illustrates a building block for residual learning. A remarkable architecture
    made up of residual layers is called ResNet. Furthermore, ResNet is distinct in
    that it substitutes a collection of global average pooling layers for the more
    customary set of fully linked layers at the network’s conclusion. ResNet50 is
    a type of residual network with 50 layers. Each group of identical layers in the
    ResNet50 design is unique. ResNet calculates data from one layer to the next that
    must occur in order to arrive at the final forecast. ResNet helps to mitigate
    the problem of vanishing gradients by offering an alternative shortcut route for
    gradient to flow through. The model can skip a CNN weight layer if the current
    layer is not necessary thanks to the ResNet identity mapping algorithm (Theckedath
    & Sedamkar, 2020). This assists in preventing the over-fitting issue with the
    training set. This ResNet50 classifier used in the proposed method classifies
    the plant diseases in agricultural land. Predicted data using deep learning approach
    is further used for the purpose of monitoring the agriculture field. Download

    Block for ResNet50. 3.3. Field monitoring The temperature, humidity, irrigation,
    fertilisers and illness in the agricultural field will all be checked when the
    smart agricultural monitoring system is turned on. The water pump will automatically
    start if the temperature is really high. Then if the soil moisture is going down
    then the water pump will start automatically. Nutrient levels of the soils are
    then checked. If nutrient deficiencies occurred then an automatic fertilization
    machine is turned on to spray the fertilizer on the agricultural land. If the
    plants are affected by a particular disease means the automatic pesticide sprayer
    will start automatically. The smart agriculture monitoring system uses a GSM module
    to communicate with mobile devices and establish SMS alerts on the mobile device
    about the levels. 4. Result and discussion Agriculture and farming contribute
    significantly to the GDP of many affluent countries as well as emerging countries.
    As a result, it is urgent that existing farming methods be improved upon. A critical
    matter that requires the highest appropriateness to be addressed is the necessity
    for agricultural maintenance and the rising water issues. To build an automated
    and continuous field monitoring, the proposed research focus on IoT and deep learning

    Period 10 The installation of a wireless sensor network is the first step in the
    implementation of weather forecasting and field monitoring. In order to gather
    real-time data, several IoT-based sensor nodes are set up in the agricultural
    field. The assembled nodes capture information regarding the environmental conditions,
    soil condition, moisture condition, presence of humidity fertility of the soil,
    and presence of the pest, diseases, and insects also capture images of plants
    and so. The collected information’s either stored locally in the nearby fog node
    or transmitted to the cloud server based on IoT. The agricultural node with sensor

    purposes in which the prediction of weather, soil properties, irrigation and disease
    is achieved by means of AI system. The reason for considering AI systems is to
    achieve automated prediction of varying agricultural factors and take remedial
    action for higher crop yield. 4.1. Dataset description Different sensors are placed
    in the agricultural field for monitoring purpose to support smart in order to
    perform healthy farming. The collected sensor data is processed using AI system
    to predict weather, crop disease, soil nutrition and irrigation support. Four
    different datasets collected from publicly available is taken for analysis. Description
    regarding different dataset is given below. Dataset 1: This data contains details
    regarding district wise crop area, season, temperature different types of crops,
    production in hectares and yield. The statistics is collected from 1997 to 2021
    and it is obtained from Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare of India.
    Data is acquired from 35 states and union territory. Dataset 2: For the purpose
    of monitoring and controlling an irrigation system in real-time, data is gathered
    using a wireless sensor network. This method prevents water waste while providing
    the farm and garden with uniform and necessary water levels. This method aims
    to provide an automated irrigation mechanism that activates and deactivates the
    pumping motor in response to the amount of moisture in the ground. In this system,
    the soil moisture sensor, dht11 sensor, and NodeMCU are all used to interface
    with the Arduino board. Using these sensors, the data is collected. Dataset 3:
    Data related to soil nutrients is collected from department of agriculture and
    farmers welfare. Different types of nutrients are essential to be present in the
    soil for plant growth. Various soil nutrients includes pH, Electrical Conductivity
    (EC), Iron (Fe), Organic Carbon (OC), Nitrogen (N), Manganese (Mn), Phosphorus
    (P), Potassium (K), Sulfur (S), Boron (B), Copper (Cu), and Zinc (zn). Dataset
    4: This dataset contains both unhealthy as well as healthy leaves image. Total
    number of image samples present in the dataset is 3600 images of RGB. It contains
    healthy apple leave and diseased apple leaves such as scab, black rot and cedar.

    moisture (Dataset 2) and nutrients (Dataset 3) are pre-processed using normalization
    and mean based missing value imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful
    data which is required for classification. GRU is utilized as a classifier for
    predicting weather condition. This proposed GRU classifier is compared with existing
    classifiers like Deep Neural Network (DNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), K-Nearest
    Neighbour (KNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The performance metrics used
    for comparison between proposed and existing classifiers are accuracy, precision,
    recall, error, specificity, F1_Score, NPV, FNR and FPR. AUC plot and ROC plot
    of the proposed approach is depicted in Fig. 8. To validate or show the effectiveness
    of a multi-class categorization problem, the AUC (Area Under the Curve) and ROC
    (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves are used. The degree or amount of
    separability is represented by AUC. In the proposed method, AUC plot is close
    to 1, so it has a high level of separability. The ROC curve is a probability curve
    that demonstrates how effective the model can discriminate across classes. Table

    The agricultural area’s temperature is first checked using a temperature sensor.
    When abnormal conditions occur like a high temperature greater than or equal to
    35 degree centigrade then the controller sends message to the owner using 19:19:19
    to spray on the leaves of small crops for 15 min to protect the crop from sun''s
    effect. Because of the sun''s heat and high temperature crop growth decrease so
    to avoid it use that fertilizer. The temperature always monitored and displayed
    on LCD which is detected by temperature sensor. When detected high moisture in
    the soil it causes root rot in crops, then this system detects moisture conditions
    and sends that information to owner to protect crop from root rot using copper
    oxychloride 3gmsspltr use at root zone of plants. When a farmer wants to switch
    on motor manually by sending message from his mobile to system with a message
    as “#M ON*” and to switch off motor when he wants then send message as “#M OFF*”.
    Again he wants a change in auto mode he sends a message from his mobile to system
    as “#AUTO*”. When the system detects that disease affected on crops and sends
    that information to the owner to protect crop from diseases by spraying fertilizer
    named as a pyrethroid. The agrobot carries the sprinkler motor which sprays the
    pesticide. It is in ON state till it moves at the end of agricultural land. 5.
    Conclusion Automated weather forecasting and field monitoring using AI based deep
    learning approach is focused in this current research. Traditional farming results
    in unhealthy crops because of poor weather and soil condition, crops affected
    through diseases and pest. To overcome these issue automated weather forecasting
    and field monitoring is essential to support farmers to produce healthy crops
    with higher yield quantity. In this current research initially, sensors are assembled
    in an agricultural field to acquire data regarding agricultural factors and transmit
    it to cloud server for further analysis purposes. The assembled nodes capture
    information regarding the temperature, soil moisture, soil nutrient and capture
    images of plants and so. In first phase, the previous collected data for weather
    forecasting was pre-processed using normalization and mean based missing value
    imputation to convert the raw data into meaningful data. Pre-processed data was
    then fed into Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for forecasting the temperature and soil
    moisture content for upcoming years. In the second phase, the crop images acquired
    from sensors to predict the presence of disease are pre-processed using Adaptive
    Gaussian Filter for noise removal and Dynamic Histogram Equalization to improve
    the image''s brightness. The pre-processed image was then fed to ResNet50 for
    feature extraction and classification. In the third phase, in case of any horrible
    weather conditions and soil conditions observed by these predicted data, remedial
    action will be automatically taken by the system. On the other hand, the information
    regarding the horrible conditions and in presence of pests and diseases, an alert
    message will be sent to farmers. Graphical representation proves that the proposed
    approach results are significantly better than those of existing approaches. Accuracy,
    precision, recall and specificity obtained for weather forecasting is 94 %, 94
    %, 93 % and 93 %. Following that Accuracy, precision, recall and specificity reached
    for crop disease prediction is 98 %,98 %, 98 % and 98 %. Thus, the deep learning
    techniques used in proposed approach are the best choice for automated weather
    forecasting and field monitoring to support precision agriculture. In future,
    by utilizing AI and surveillance, the field area may be kept free of intruders.

    algorithms 1. Introduction A WSN is an intelligent system when compared to others
    because that can independently achieve data fusion, collection, and communication.
    It integrates the real physical and logical information world to comprehend the
    \"ubiquitous computing\" method [1]. A WSN is used in untended target fields,
    namely health care, battlefields, agriculture, habitats, and environmental monitoring
    and they encompass tiny sensor nodes (SNs) that have limited computational ability
    and battery power [2]. These nodes sense the environment to gather information
    from the environment and transfer it to the closest gateway node (GWN) through
    a wireless channel for transmitting to exterior users. Usually, the WSN node works
    in an unprotected environment and is not monitored periodically. This makes it
    especially vulnerable to different attacks and thus critical information can easily
    be revealed to unauthorized parties causing privacy risks and serious security
    [3]. As progressively sensitive data is produced and transferred, cryptographic
    security must be deployed to avoid recognized attacks by hiding data within a
    complex string of seemingly random symbols [4]. However, it remains challenging
    to accept a traditional encryption system in this tiny wireless sensor due to
    the vast quantities of data being generated and switched between the SNs. Standard
    cipher is deployed for resource-rich devices on high bandwidth networks and they
    are almost impossible for limited networks such as WSNs [5]. As heavy encryption,
    implementation might result in failure and frequent disconnection of this node
    due to energy consumption, the energy constraint is the most overwhelming restraint
    in WSN. Excessive cryptographic security could be harmful to the system [6]. Due
    to limited time, energy resources computation power, and communication constraints,
    it frequently causes security requirements to combat real-time dynamic performance.
    It is necessary to provide security during or before the transmission. Data availability,
    data confidence, and data integrity are four different safety aspects to be concentrated
    during data communication [7]. Besides, the security of transmission data networks
    must guarantee the authenticity and confidentiality of all network nodes. Until
    now, several schemes and protocols have been introduced intending to be effective
    in the secure transmission of data [8]. Encryption standards are crucial that
    use keys of lesser length, and only less memory is required. Moreover, ECC grows
    the size of encoded information as well as requires further modification. The
    contemporary study has recommended a lightweight encryption system to overcome
    the problem of resource constraint [9]. The security limits employed through classical
    cryptographic methodology are lessened in lightweight encryption systems to enhance
    the competence of encryption. Light-weight cypher is gentler on resources since
    they require shorter execution times, less memory space, less energy consumption,
    and less computational complexity [10]. Key management strategy is another noteworthy
    feature of WSN security which includes updating, generation, distribution, and
    storage. This article designs an Efficient Key Distribution for Secure and Energy-Optimized
    Communication using Bioinspired Algorithms (EKD-SOCBA) for WSN. The purpose of
    the EKD-SOCBA technique is to accomplish security and energy efficiency in WSNs.
    Initially, the EKD-SOCBA technique applies a golden jackal optimization (GJO)
    based clustering approach to cluster the nodes and select cluster heads (CHs).
    Moreover, DS-TEA is applied to secure data transmission in the network. Finally,
    a lightweight key management phase is employed to protect the encryption key and
    decrease energy utilization and overhead costs. To exhibit the enhanced performance
    of the EKD-SOCBA methodology, a comprehensive pair of imitations was involved.
    2. Literature review Mezrag et al. [11] developed a novel identity-based authentication
    and key agreement system for CWSNs termed IBAKAS that integrates identity-based
    cryptography (IBC) and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to offer common verification
    and create secret session keys over uncertain networks. IBAKAS attains the required
    safety assets of the main contract and averts precise cyber-attacks on CWSN. Misbha
    [12] developed a new light-biased key distribution device for energy-efficient
    and safe communication in WSN. At 1st stage, a hybrid optimization plan is developed
    which is known as the coot upgraded butterfly algorithm with logistic solution
    space (CUBA-LSS) technique to optimum grouping through picking up ideal CH. Data
    transmission is a successive procedure where developed technique safeguards protected
    transmission via enhanced ECC. Roja and Misbha [13] present an effective lightweight
    secure key distribution protocol (LSKDP) for improving procedure security in assorted
    medicinal WSNs. In addition to that, performance and safety diagnoses are directed
    at demonstrating the recommended methodology''s efficiency. The safety analysis
    is executed to determine the projected method''s exposure to system threats. Abi-Char
    and Riman [14] introduce a secure and lightweight genuine key management system
    utilizing Bilinear Pairing (BP) and Elliptic Curve (EC). The system establishes
    unique pairwise keys between devices after authentication, demonstrating resilience
    against various threats and enhanced flexibility against node capture attacks.
    In [15], a lightweight privacy and security system is proposed for WSN routing.
    Employing modified Diffie-Hellman key exchange, symmetric encryption, scalar blinding,
    and elliptic curve cryptography, the system ensures data integrity and effective
    validation while preserving privacy during routing. Xiong and Su [16] project
    a new random key pre-distribution system that depends upon a hash chain. Altering
    assured structure parameters like hash chain length, the number of shared support
    nodes and the sum of hash chains and device nodes requires preloading some key
    that makes it probable to create pairwise basic with great possibility between
    its nearby nodes. Guermazi et al. [17] propose the Key Distribution and Safe Routing
    (KDSR) protocol for securing communication in large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs). The protocol introduces a secure network architecture and employs lightweight
    local procedures for key segmentation in Local Broadcast, Pairwise, and Global
    Broadcast scenarios. Lee and Chen [18] present an efficient Group Key Agreement
    (GKA) structure for WSN, utilizing prolonged hectic maps and eliminating the need
    for a reliable online verification server. Additionally, they propose a forward-privacy-enhanced
    pattern through a long hectic map-based Diffie-Hellman key exchange within the
    developed GKA structure. In [19], a hybrid data routing algorithm is proposed
    using metaheuristic techniques, integrating swarm optimization and an energy-efficient
    heuristic method to enhance route finding for heterogeneous WSNs in the IoTs.
    Mehta and Saxena [20] introduce fuzzy multi-criteria clustering and bio-inspired
    energy-efficient routing (FMCB-ER) model by employing a grid-based clustering
    technique, adaptive fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making for cluster head selection,
    and emperor penguin optimization for optimal data transmission routes. 3. The
    proposed model In this article, we design an EKD-SOCBA algorithm for WSN. The
    purpose of the EKD-SOCBA technique is to accomplish security and energy efficiency
    in WSNs. Fig. 1 demonstrates the workflow of the proposed EKD-SOCBA method. Download

    Workflow of EKD-SOCBA approach. 3.1. System model The assumption made is given
    below [21]. 1. The SN is deployed randomly in a 2D geographical space. 2. The
    BS is positioned at the center of the network and there is multi-hop transmission
    from CH to BS 3. The SN is split into equivalent groups and is distributed randomly
    within the group. 4. The SN is homogeneous within the group and mobility is limited
    to 0.2 5. BS and nodes participating in multi-path transmission may contain continuous
    power sources. 5. BS implements the model for the selection of CH and it gathers
    the information collected from the CH Two different channel models based on the
    radio energy method of SN are given as follows: multi-path propagation fading
    technique for multi-hop path transmission and free space path loss method for
    single-hop transmission. Thus, the power usage for transferring an -bit packet
    over distance is evaluated using Eq. (1): (1) where energy dissipation coefficient
    of multi-path attenuation module energy dissipation coefficient of free-space
    attenuation module packet length energy required for transmitting or receiving
    1-bit data. distance between sender and receiving nodes threshold distance At
    Rx, the amount of power used to receive -bit data packet is evaluated by (2) The
    number of packets expected from SNs are followers of specific clusters, data collection
    implemented by CH, and the number of collected packets transferred from CH to
    BS are parameters that contributed to the power utilization at CH. Consequently,
    the power utilization at CH is shown below as (3) number of SNs in a specific
    cluster data fusion energy/bit. For each SN excluding CHs, the power utilization
    is . The overall residual energy (RE)at iteration can be evaluated as follows:
    (4) overall RE at th iteration number of CHs in the iteration overall amount of
    alive nodes in the iteration energy expended by CH energy expended by SN 3.2.
    Clustering using GJO algorithm Initially, the EKD-SOCBA technique applies a GJO-based
    clustering approach to cluster the nodes and select CHs. The golden jackal is
    nothing but a canid type originating in Eurasia. It shows greatly advanced social
    conduct [22]. Cooperative hunting is one of the most dangerous among their countless
    skills, with an achievement rate about 3 times greater than separate hunting.
    Nitish Chopra has proposed a GJO and swarm intelligence algorithm due to his interest
    in the hunting behavior of golden jackals. The technique is mainly developed depending
    upon key phases of the golden jackal hunting procedure such as pointing for imminent
    prey, nearby and annoying prey till it stops movement and aggressive and catching
    prey. After these phases of hunting, the GJO technique is demonstrated. In the
    initialization stage, the following populaces are casually created. (5) whereas
    N is the number of persons in the populace, and is the quantity of sizes owned
    by persons. After computing the capability of each individual in the present populace,
    the optimal individual is considered a male golden jackal, whereas the sub-optimal
    distinct is called a female golden jackal, and the rest as prey. Affording to
    a value of E and eluding energy, dual methods accessible to upgrade the populace.
    (6) whereas designates the decreasing energy of prey; signifies the early stage
    of its energy; is a random number from to 1; represents the present iteration
    and is the maximum number of iterations. Fig. 2 depicts the steps involved in
    GJO. Download : Download high-res image (331KB) Download : Download full-size

    follows: (7) (8) (9) whereas denotes a male golden jackal; represents a female
    golden jackal; , and Prey (t) individually state to data of male, female as well
    as present individual; is Levy fight plan; is upgraded position data of individual
    after repetition. The below-mentioned formulae are the expression of Levy''s fight
    plan: (10) (11) whereas and are random values between to 1, is a default constant
    set to 1.5. When is a method to renovate the population as follows: (12) (13)
    (14) The GJO technique originates a fitness function (FF) for the optimal cluster
    creation process. The FF employed in the developed method is given in the below
    equation. (15) In Eq. (15), and functions describe the sum of distances among
    CMs to CH of each cluster in the network and the difference of clusters in route
    length. Based on Eq. (16), function is calculated. (16) Where, displays the distance
    of Euclidean calculated for a total amount of clusters. The distance between every
    vehicular to CHs connected to all clusters from the total amount of clusters.
    Similarly, function signifies the absolute degree that is shown below. (17) In
    Eq. (17), implies an overall amount of CM nodes from route length with degree
    emphasizing the constant value of cluster density. Notice that smaller density
    can be familiar by lowermost value. 3.3. Encryption using DS-TEA model At this
    moment, lightweight DS-TEA is applied for secure data transmission in the network.
    TEA is a Feistel structure encryption scheme that functions on dual 32-bit unsigned
    integers that are driven from a 64-bit data block and exploits a 128-bit key [23].
    Furthermore, this model recommends 64 rounds for the standard execution of pairs
    called cycles. Based on the symmetry of cycles, multiples of the magic constant
    are employed to avoid the attack. However, TEA has certain shortcomings. It mainly
    suffers from corresponding keys that imply all keys are equivalent to three others.
    Especially, TEA is insupportable as a Cryptographic hash function. The encryption
    efficiency is increased when the memory consumption is decreased. DS-TEA is a
    block cypher that recollects Feistel structure. DS-TEA makes use of a 64-bit block
    and 128-bit key with 32 cycles or 64 rounds similar to the TEA. The two bits are
    utilized for selecting the subkeys. Accordingly, the subkey is further added.
    Also, we add a shift of 13 into the key schedule to aid subkeys loom out of order.
    The further adaptation to make DS-TEA is rearranging the XOR functions, additions,
    and shifts. Now, the subkeys generate subkey and . In the DS-TEA, dual rounds
    are employed to generate one encryption cycle. An initial round is dependent on
    . The value of amount & 4 is sum logic AND with 4, 0 × 04 , or 0012 , defines

    64 bit-change possibilities. Algorithm 1 demonstrates the process of DS-TEA. Algorithm
    1 Dynamic Step-wise TEA 3.4. Key management Finally, a lightweight key management
    phase is employed to protect the encryption key. Since the WSN transfers information
    through an unprotected open channel, each connectivity of the network should be
    secured [24]. The key managing technique must retain minimum overhead cost for
    the key distribution, creation, and agreement in the limited network. In the system,
    a lightweight key managing technique is performed to decrease the transmission
    latency and power usage. Furthermore, it is capable of creating a verified and
    secure connection between the CHs and SNs connected to them and, lastly linking
    to the access point. The key management structure is composed of two different
    stages. The first step is generating a symmetrical encryption key. The second
    stage is the session key would be created and sent to all the nodes to protect
    the entire node’s symmetric key. The key security cannot be safeguarded since
    they are stored as well as transported in plain sight in wireless devices. To
    satisfy the safe key criterion, a private key βk is generated in this technique
    through a logistic map. Then, the Enhanced ECC uses the private key βk to protect
    the messages for the node. After encrypting its Plain Text (PT), the key and other
    encryption variables are encrypted during the second stage before being transmitted
    to CH. Each node has a physical ID which is protected down. Given the ID of the
    selected CH, each node connected is updated with all the new CHS. The CH evaluates
    its session key (sk) before the beginning of the information communication session
    and allocates it to the related node. The period of the transmission session is
    chosen to avoid overhead generated by using a random strategy for creating sk.
    A new sk is generated whenever CH is transmitted over the nodes. It utilizes it
    to generate a master key (mk) if the node interconnects with CH and gets sk. SN
    will evaluate a new value that uses a hash function to remove the probability
    that attackers might find out ID of CH. The received CH-ID values are hashed with
    the MD5 hash technique for obtaining Hash ID (HID). Then, the node will evaluate
    mk by applying the XOR function to integrate the sk and HID of CH are interconnected
    to all nodes. Subsequently, mk is used for encoding the βk, αk, and Sk parameters.
    When the encryption variable (Cparm) is added, then the payload is transmitted
    to the CH. Initially, the AP computes HID through CH''s registered ID on the AP
    side. Then, the sk and HID are XOR-ed to define mk. The ciphered encryption variable
    is decoded by the acquired mk and decodes the Cipher Text (CT) of the node. The
    repeat process enables each node connected to the CH to deploy the same mk for
    decoding their parameters and attaining the PTs. 4. Performance validation This
    section offers a brief result analysis of the EKD-SOCBA technique under several
    measures. Table 1 presents a detailed distance analysis of the EKD-SOCBA technique

    Conclusion This article designs an Efficient Key Distribution for Secure and Energy-Optimized
    Communication using Bioinspired Algorithms (EKD-SOCBA) for WSN. The purpose of
    the EKD-SOCBA technique is to accomplish security and energy efficiency in WSNs.
    Initially, the EKD-SOCBA technique has accomplished energy efficiency using GJO
    based clustering approach to cluster the nodes and select CHs. Besides, the DS-TEA
    is applied to secure data transmission in the network. Finally, a lightweight
    key management phase is employed to protect the encryption key and decrease energy
    utilization and overhead costs. To exhibit the enhanced act of the EKD-SOCBA method,
    an inclusive set of simulations was involved. An extensive outcome stated enhanced
    performance of the EKD-SOCBA technique over other models on WSN. The EKD-SOCBA
    model boosts WSN security and energy efficiency with clustering, lightweight encryption,
    and key management; yet, it faces challenges in adapting to dynamic network conditions.
    Future work can focus on the design of data aggregation approaches to improve
    energy efficiency in the WSN. Institutional review board statement Not Applicable.

  description: Wearable implantable electronic devices (WIEDs) play an important role
    in data interaction and information collection, which provides new ideas for the
    development of consumer electronics, medicine, industry, and agriculture. However,
    battery endurance has become one of the bottlenecks impeding the development of
    WIEDs. Therefore, finding effective ways to address this issue has become a hot
    research topic in WIEDs. This article summarizes the research progress in the
    field of in-situ power supply technologies for WIEDs, including self-powered technologies
    and wireless power transmission techniques. Self-powered technologies can collect
    energy from the human body and the natural environment, such as biochemical energy,
    mechanical energy, and solar energy. Moreover, the types of wireless power transmission
    depend on different energy carriers, such as electromagnetic waves and mechanical

    new ideas for the development of consumer electronics, medicine, industry, and
    agriculture. However, battery endurance has become one of the bottlenecks impeding

    self-powered technologies and wireless power transmission techniques. Self-powered
    technologies can collect energy from the human body and the natural environment,
    such as biochemical energy, mechanical energy, and solar energy. Moreover, the
    types of wireless power transmission depend on different energy carriers, such
    as electromagnetic waves and mechanical waves. We compare the advantages and the

    body power transmissionSelf-powered 1. Introduction Thanks to the rapid revolution
    in electronic materials and micro-nanofabrication processes, there has been a
    proliferation of wearable/implantable electronic devices (WIEDs) in recent years
    [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. In the realm of intelligent healthcare,
    WIEDs can provide constant monitoring of patients'' conditions, improve speech
    for those with aphasia, and aid medical personnel in diagnosis. In the field of
    consumer electronics, WIEDs can serve as near-eye display devices and flexible
    tactile data gloves, particularly in virtual reality applications. In agriculture
    and industry, WIEDs are used for complex tasks in radioactive or toxic environments.
    Additionally, WIEDs can greatly improve operators'' experience and work efficiency
    by functioning as multimedia system-control interfaces [9], [10], [11], [12],
    [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. At present, the main obstacle
    to the commercialization of WIEDs is their limited battery endurance. Possible
    solutions to this problem include optimizing the energy storage devices and reducing
    the power consumption in line with practical requirements. On the one hand, WIED
    devices can be used for a longer time by reducing power consumption. On the other
    hand, the use of advanced materials and structures in the development of batteries
    and supercapacitors can also extend the life of the device significantly. Commercial
    WIEDs rely on the installation of larger and denser batteries to improve their
    lifetimes. As larger batteries are detrimental to increased device integration
    and improved user experience, striking a balance between battery endurance and
    convenience, flexibility, quality of experience, compactness, and the biosafety
    required for long-term use is essential. In addition to the aforementioned technological
    solutions, in-situ power supply technology for WIEDs is anticipated to fundamentally
    address the challenge of their limited battery endurance and has garnered significant
    attention. Self-powered technology is in line with the trend of increasing Internet-of-Things
    sensors and edge devices, with their energy self-sufficiency resolving the challenge
    of constrained hardware and energy resources for WIEDs. Starting from self-powered
    and external power transmission technologies, as shown in Fig. 1, the analysis
    focuses on low environmental dependency and high energy conversion efficiency
    for external power transmission technology as a new solution for extending the
    battery endurance of WIEDs [21], [22], [23], [24]. Download : Download high-res

    and respective advantages of various potential means of fabricating an energy
    supply suitable for use in WIEDs. Self-powered technologies encompass energy harvesting
    technologies based on taking advantage of the biochemical electricity inside the
    human body and physical activity, as well as extracting energy from the environment.
    The human body contains diverse chemicals and electrolytes, providing ample resources
    for biofuel cells (BFCs) to generate electricity. The natural potential generated
    by these electrolytes inside and outside the cell membrane can serve as an energy
    source. Piezoelectric energy harvesters and triboelectric nanogenerators can effectively
    convert mechanical energy generated by conscious or unconscious human activity
    into electrical energy. In addition, harnessing underexploited sources of energy
    from the environment, such as sunlight, reliably increases the battery endurance
    of WIEDs. External power transmission technology involves transmitting external
    electromagnetic energy, acoustic energy, near-infrared light energy, and other
    forms of energy directly to WIEDs through a specialized medium. Electromagnetic
    energy transmission can be classified into near-field, mid-field, and far-field
    transmission based on the distance and the principle of transmission. Acoustic
    energy transmission typically uses ultrasound as a carrier, and its high permeability
    through human tissue reduces the energy loss from implantable devices. Near-infrared
    light is also a safe, effective way to drive implantable photovoltaic cells and
    pyroelectric generators due to its high degree of penetration. Human-body power
    transmission uses the human body as a medium, which can efficiently couple electromagnetic
    waves transmitted in close proximity to the body to wearable devices, presenting
    significant potential for development. 2. Self-powered technology Self-powered
    technology is a solution in which a device reclaims energy from its surroundings
    without importing external energy. Common sources of self-powered solutions include
    biochemical energy from the human body, mechanical energy generated by physical
    activities, and thermal and light energy from the environment. The human body
    functions as an organic system, producing copious amounts of biochemical, electrical,
    and mechanical energy. This energy can be harnessed to power WIEDs and maintain
    their normal operation. Additionally, the environment in which WIEDs are utilized
    contains significant untapped reserves of light and thermal energy, which can
    serve as potential sources of long-term energy for these devices. 2.1. Self-powered
    technology based on the biochemical energy inside the human body On one hand,
    circulating body fluids contain various high-energy metabolites, including glucose
    and other chemicals, that could potentially be utilized for continuous generation
    of electrical power to operate bioelectronics independently. On the other hand,
    ions flow in the human body under nerve control, creating a potential difference
    between the two sides of the cell membrane, thus forming bioelectricity. Therefore,
    the utilization of the body''s chemical and electrical energy to power WIEDs is
    a widely researched topic, with a focus on biochemical energy harvesting using
    BFCs and bioelectricity-based biochemical energy harvesting. 2.1.1. Biochemical
    energy harvesting based on BFCs BFCs convert chemicals within the human body into
    electricity through bioelectrochemical reactions. For example, in an enzyme glucose
    fuel cell, the oxidizing enzyme causes the fuel to dehydrogenate and produces
    electrons, generating an electric current in an external circuit [25], [26], [27],
    [28], [29]. Fig. 2a illustrates the reaction principle [30]. Download : Download

    2022, Wiley-VCH. BFCs have been extensively utilized in WIEDs. As shown in Fig.
    2b, Jeerapan I et al. reported a battery-free electronic skin powered by highly
    efficient lactate BFCs, which can perform biosensing and communicate wirelessly
    using Bluetooth. The BFCs derive energy from the lactic acid present in sweat,
    and such devices can deliver an outstanding power density of 3.5 mWcm−2.and perform
    stably performance during 60 h of continuous operation. Most e-skin platforms
    use a battery power supply, which cannot drive some WIEDs with high energy consumption,
    such as BLE transmission. With a unique integration of 0D–3D nanomaterials on
    bioanodes and cathodes, BFCs have successfully resolved this challenge, and the
    use of a soft substrate can render a fully compliant platform for maximal comfort
    and wearability [31]. Falk M et al. presented an electronic contact-lens-based
    enzymatic fuel cell that used the chemical compound in human tears to generator
    power. Such BFCs will provide a 0.57 V open-circuit voltage (Voc), about a 1-μW
    cm−2 maximum power density at a cell voltage of 0.5 V, and more than a 20-h operational
    half-life. In combination with the frequency of contact-lens use, such a smart
    device can be used as a daily disposable contact lens. Meanwhile, researchers
    have discovered that human tears contain an array of electrochemically active
    compounds that have a substantial impact on cathode performance. Based on this
    phenomenon, they designed a miniature membrane-less BFC utilizing ascorbate instead
    of glucose to generate electrical power. A conceptual scheme of such a self-powered
    bionic contact lens is shown in Fig. 2c, and such a biodevice has been found to
    have the following characteristics: the Voc of 0.54 V, a maximal power density
    of 3.1 μW cm–2. The power production is a step forward in output and should therefore
    neither affect the concentration of glucose nor influence the sensor’s performance;
    in other words, this BFC could be a suitable source for powering WIEDs efficiently
    or for accurate glucose sensing [32], [33]. In addition, the output of a BFC is
    related to the content of the substance from which the energy is derived. Therefore,
    electrochemical analysis methods that use this substance as a target analyte are
    an effective way to monitor the human body’s condition. Consequently, Amay J et
    al. designed a battery-free, wireless, electronic sensing platform inspired by
    BFCs that integrated chronometric microfluidic platforms with embedded colorimetric
    assays. Fig. 2d presents a close-up image of the near-field communication electrodes
    and a sweat monitor based on BFCs. As a completely noninvasive sweat sensors,
    it can simultaneously detect lactate, glucose, chloride, pH, and sweat rate. The
    implementation of BFCs offers a solution to the substantial augmentation of size
    and weight in battery-operated devices. The amalgamation with battery-free, near-field
    communication electrodes enhances the accuracy of detection and the ease of operation
    [34]. The ingenious design of the structure can improve the effectiveness of body-fluid
    retrieval while simultaneously decreasing the wear and tear on the BFC. Wang,
    J et al. created a single-layer fluff pulp (FP)-based microfluidic module to make
    it easier to utilize body fluids efficiently and to realize steady contact between
    biofuel fluids and wearable BFCs. As a result, the Voc of 0.62 V and a maximum
    power output of 0.656 mW cm−2 was obtained. However, the application of BFCs is
    limited by the problem that the single-cell voltage is lower than the operation
    voltage of WIEDs. As shown in Fig. 2e, the stacking of six BFC in series can generate
    sufficient voltage to light a green LED [35]. Enzyme-based BFCs have recently
    attracted considerable attention as they are recognized as a new type of energy
    conversion technology with attractive features, such as the abilities to operate
    under physiological conditions and provide a permanent electrical power source
    for bioelectronics. Therefore, electro-metabolic conversion based on BFCs might
    help in restoring blood-glucose homeostasis and accelerating alcohol metabolism.
    Though the virtues of BFCs are indeed attractive, they have inherent limitations.
    Nevertheless, the conversion of chemical to electrical energy has an individual-dependent
    efficiency, leading to variability in the BFC’s output power. In the case of lactate,
    for instance, the amount of individual lactate produced is inversely proportional
    to the subject’s fitness level; in other words, the generated power depends on
    the subject''s anaerobic capacity [36]. Secondly, BFCs utilized in WIEDs typically
    have limited operating hours due to the short lifespans of bioenzymes. Therefore,
    effective methods of extending the lives of BFCs are needed and include enhancing
    enzyme activity, minimizing enzyme leakage, and selecting suitable enzymes as
    catalysts for specific situations. The outputs of BFCs used as power sources for
    WIEDs, which use lactic acid or glucose from body fluids as their energy source,
    are summarized in Fig. 3 [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45],
    [46]. As shown in the above figure, the Voc of the BFCs are all less than 1 V.
    According to thermodynamic restrictions, this problem is inevitable because the
    maximum potential gap between two electrodes in most biological fuel cells is
    roughly 1 V, and that voltage is reduced even further to below 1 V due to electron
    mediators, non-ohmic contacts of the electrodes, and other factors. Therefore,
    a stacking approach is needed to raise the voltages of BFCs to levels at which
    WIEDs can be driven. Download : Download high-res image (104KB) Download : Download

    energy harvesting based on bioelectricity Living organisms are filled with electrolytes,
    which are rich in multiple heavy ions. Neural manipulation of ion channels located
    on the surface of a cell enables a specific ion type to move in and out, thereby
    generating a potential difference and a bioelectric potential. The bioelectric
    potential contains important information about human physiology; therefore, researchers
    have been collecting and analyzing the body''s bioelectric signals by using electromyography,
    electrocardiography, electroencephalography, etc. for a considerable time to determine
    bodily health. This bioelectrical potential, which exists in living organisms,
    is expected to serve as another power source for WIEDs. Mercier P et al. designed
    an ultra-low quiescent-power energy harvesting chip integrated with a wireless
    sensor capable of monitoring the endocochlear potential (EP) itself to prove that
    the mammalian EP can be used as a power source for electronic devices [47]. As
    shown in Fig. 4a [47], the printed circuit board with the energy harvesting chip
    is attached to the inner ear of a guinea pig by using electrode tips. The printed
    circuit board also integrates components, such as capacitors and antennae, for
    energy storage and data transmission. The EP results from the difference in ionic
    concentration between the endolymph - an extracellular fluid in the inner ear
    - and the perilymph, an extracellular fluid that bathes the surrounding spaces.
    As shown in Fig. 4b [47], the EP results from the difference in ionic concentration
    between the endolymph and the perilymph that bathes the surrounding spaces. The
    chip extracted 1.12 nW from the EP of a guinea pig for up to 5 h, enabling a 2.4-GHz
    radio to transmit measurements of the EP. Download : Download high-res image (516KB)

    that the energy extracted from a single Xenopus oocyte and stored in a capacitor
    could be used to transmit a radio signal to a nearby receiver[48]. In oocytes,
    overexpressing inward rectifier Kir 4.1 channels displayed a resting membrane
    potential close to − 90 mV, and a mean harvested power of approximately 20 nW
    was obtained. In 2022, the same group presented the results of preliminary experimental
    tests on using the soleus muscle of a mouse to estimate the amount of electrical
    energy that could be harvested from a single muscle fiber. A single soleus muscle
    fiber was able to charge a 1-mF capacitor, and the voltage collected in the preliminary
    tests was − 60 mV, generating 2 µJ of electrical power on a storing capacitor
    [49]. Although several issues persist with such systems, such as requiring a wireless
    kick-start, low energy-harvesting efficiency, and the risk of potential hearing
    loss due to high-impedance glass electrodes with tips, this work offers a completely
    novel approach to conceptualizing energy capture within the human body and has
    endless potential for future biotechnological applications. Fig. 4c shows how
    electric eels can generate thousands of volts of electricity thanks to their unique
    electric organs. Inspired by electrical eels, scientists have invented some electric
    generators based on ion-concentration gradients. Schroeder et al. conceived electrical
    power sources that were able to harness the chemical energy available inside biological
    systems [50]. They engineered a potentially biocompatible artificial electric
    organ that could generate potential differences in excess of 100 V and power densities
    of 27 mW m−2 by using durable and accessible components, as well as automated
    and scalable fabrication processes. As shown in Fig. 4d, the Miura-ori fold was
    used to enlarge the contact area for improving performance. As a result, the electric
    organs of Electrophorus generated 600 V by stacking parallel columns of 100-μm-thick
    electrocytes with membrane contact areas as large as 7000 mm2, enabling discharges
    of 100 W. When an ionic-concentration gradient, which widely exists in human bodies,
    is established across ion-exchange membranes, the Gibbs free energy can be converted
    into electricity. Wang C et al. presented a high-voltage nanofluidic energy generator
    harnessing ion-concentration gradients by using a stack of reverse electrodialysis
    cells. They focused upon energy harvesting with limited electrolyte resources,
    and no external pump system was used for the flow supply. This feature expanded
    the use of cells in the human body. Due to the compartment design and stack number
    of the proposed nanofluidic energy generator, the performance of power generation
    was improved: voltages up to 1 V were achieved by stacking 20 reverse electrodialysis
    cells [51]. Even the evaporation of body fluids can create a new method of energy
    recovery, J. Garemark et al. provided a new strategy for harvesting the water
    evaporation power of wood, which offers continuous electricity generation without
    a specific environmental stimulus. Although this technology has not yet been applied
    to the field of human energy harvesting, the human body’s surface also evaporates
    a large amount of body fluids every day. This phenomenon shows a potential for
    harvesting energy from body water as it evaporates [52]. Nonetheless, currently,
    the generated power is relatively low and only satisfies the operating conditions
    of a limited number of low-power WIEDs. However, there is potential to supply
    stable, efficient power to WIEDs if the efficiency of bioelectricity as a power
    source can be enhanced. Self-powered technology based on the biochemical energy
    inside the human body offers a nearly unlimited source of energy and many pathways
    of energy utilization, such as biofuels, biopotentials, evaporation, and so on.
    Remarkably, using biochemical energy from the human body to power WIEDs is a potentially
    biocompatible power-transfer solution, but powering high-power WIEDs is challenging
    due to physiological conditions and material limitations. In addition, the technology
    for harvesting energy from biochemical sources is still in its infancy, and the
    amount of fuel harvested from the human body depends on the individual''s physiological
    state, making it difficult to meet the energy requirements of current commercial
    WIEDs. Aso, as the above methods deplete substances within the human body, easing
    users'' worries remains challenging, even though studies have indicated that the
    device does not impact human health. This concern has impeded, to some degree,
    the commercialization of biochemical energy-powered devices. If the energy conversion
    efficiency of the devices, as well as their lifespans and stabilities, can be
    improved in the future, then this type of biologically adapted energy solution
    holds great potential for development. 2.2. Self-powered technology based on the
    physical activity of the human body In addition to using biochemical and electrical
    energy, both conscious and unconscious physical activities of the human body can
    serve as high-quality power sources for self-powered systems. Research has indicated
    that a 150-pound adult can generate over 100 watts of power through daily activities,
    like breathing, walking, and limb movements [53]. By recovering only a fraction
    of the mechanical energy produced by physical activity, the normal process of
    WIEDs can be sustained. The most commonly utilized techniques for energy harvesting
    from physical activity in the human body involve a self-powered approach based
    on the piezoelectric and the triboelectric effects. This section will introduce
    self-powered principles and devices in relation to these two aspects. 2.2.1. Mechanical-energy
    harvesting based on piezoelectric nanogenerators The research on piezoelectric
    materials goes back to1880 when the French physicists Jacques and Pierre Curie
    found that the destruction of the central symmetry in a crystal structure caused
    by external mechanical stimulation could induce a piezoelectric potential in piezoelectric
    materials, a phenomenon later defined as the piezoelectric effect [54]. Piezoelectric
    nanogenerators (PENGs) were first proposed in 2006 and have been rapidly developed
    in recent years. Compared to conventional piezoelectric transducers based on piezocrystals,
    PENGs can convert random mechanical energy into electric energy, which can be
    triggered by nano-scale physical motions and work over a large frequency range
    [55]. Due to this property, PENGs have many merits, such as high sensibility,
    high reliability, high flexibility, economical cost, light weight, conformability,
    and so on. The first PENGs in the world were reported by the group of Wang Z L
    and the mechanism of the power generator relied on a coupling of the piezoelectric
    and the semiconducting properties of ZnO, as well as the formation of Schottky
    barrier between the metal and the ZnO contacts [56], [57]. The principle of PENGs
    is shown in Fig. 5a. In 2010, the same team designed PENGs used to harvest biomechanical
    energy under in-vivo conditions [58]. As shown in Fig. 5b, this was the first
    time that PENGs were applied in the implantable field, and the voltage and current
    outputs were around 3 mV and 30 pA. Although the performances reported in these
    two studies were limited, they no doubt represented significant milestones in
    the field of nanomaterials. Download : Download high-res image (524KB) Download

    porous piezoelectric thin films in a bioinspired self-wrapping helical configuration
    for flexible integration with existing implantable medical devices [59]. The schematic
    for that PENG is shown in Fig. 5c (top). Then, they developed a material of PVDF-TrFE
    with a porous structure that was different from its normal structure [60]. The
    piezoelectric output, compared to that of solid PVDF-TrFE thin films, was enhanced
    by three-fold through optimizations of the pore size and the electromechanical
    coupling efficiency. Fig. 5c(bottle) presents a schematic of encapsulated PENGs
    on a pacemaker lead for in-vivo experimental characterizations. Finally, the peak-to-peak
    voltage output of the PENGs was increased to 1.2 V in a vivo condition. As for
    wearable devices, Yao G et al. proposed a snowflake-inspired, blink-driven, flexible
    piezoelectric contact lens that could convert mechanical blink motions into a
    unidirectional pulsed electric field for direct application to moderate corneal
    injury repair [61]. The structure and optical images are shown in Fig. 5d. The
    fractal star-polygon structure of the PENGS promoted the power generation density
    and the component sensitivity due to improvements in the piezoelectric area. Due
    to the expansion of that area, the voltage output rose to 2.9 V. Textile materials
    are ideal candidates for constructing high-performance PENGs due to their lightweight,
    programmable structure, softness, and breathability. Due to these properties,
    textile-based PENGs are highly appealing to researchers. For energy harvesting
    from human movement, the large numbers of variable mechanical deformations and
    loading cycles present significant challenges to the fabrication of highly flexible,
    efficient, and durable textile-based PENGs. To address this, N Soin et al. used
    three-dimensional piezoelectric fabrics based on “3-D spacer” textile technology
    [62]. As shown in Fig. 5e, the PENGs comprise a PVDF monofilament spacer yarn
    and a silver-coated polyamide 66 (PA66) yarn. The fabric consistently produced
    a voltage of ∼14 V and a peak current of ∼30 μA, corresponding to a peak power
    density of 5.10 μW cm−2. The 3D spacer provided significantly higher performance
    than the existing 2D woven structures, resulting in the PENGs being more durable
    for harvesting energy from the motions of humans. T Li et al. focused on the application
    of textile-based PENGs under in-vivo conditions, and they reported nanofibers
    with a self-assembled core/shell structure [63]. Fig. 5f shows the formation mechanism
    for PVDF/DA core/shell NFs. The introduction of DA greatly facilitated the spontaneous
    formation and alignment of β-phase PVDF during the electrospinning process and
    resulted in the formation of a continuous DA nanoshell around a PVDF NF core.
    This continuous interfacial interaction was also thought to be the reason for
    the improved β-phase stability and piezoelectric property of the PVDF/DA NFs.
    A 30-µm-thick thin film was made by randomly stacking PVDF/DA NFs with a size
    of 20 × 10 mm2, and the highest Vpp was 16.2 V. Harvesting mechanical energy through
    the piezoelectric effect is an effective approach to achieving self-powered WIEDs,
    whose simple architecture facilitates the design of miniaturized WIEDs. However,
    the power output of a PENG relies on various internal and external factors, resulting
    in significant power variations. For example, because people cannot be in motion
    all the time, this energy harvester primarily focused on the mechanical energy
    generated by unconscious and random behaviors, which will present new challenges
    to the continuity and stability of energy collection. Additionally, the use of
    PENGs in WIEDs must navigate the challenge of balancing high-performance conventional
    lead-containing piezoelectric materials with non-toxic, biocompatible, lead-free
    alternatives. Utilizing the synergistic properties of both materials, the preparation
    of composites by employing organic polymers and inorganic particles seems to be
    a viable solution. 2.2.2. Mechanical energy harvesting based on triboelectric
    nanogenerators A significant amount of triboelectricity is generated by human
    physical activity, so the potential use of this currently underused form of low-frequency
    electricity as a power source for WIEDs is worth considering. In 2012, the triboelectric
    nanogenerator (TENG) was invented by Z L Wang, who was a pathfinder in the developments
    of TENGs, and his group [64]. It was the first electronic device to effectively
    utilize the triboelectric effect for energy recovery. TENGs, as a new type of
    breakthrough technology for energy harvesting, rely on the coupling of electrostatic
    induction and contact charging [65], which is equivalent to contact-electrification
    (CE). As shown in Fig. 6a, Z L Wang’s group explained this phenomenon and proposed
    an electron-cloud, potential-well model based on the electron-emission-dominated
    charge-transfer mechanism, which can be generally applied to explain all types
    of CE in conventional materials. Download : Download high-res image (697KB) Download

    2023, Wiley-VCH. Since its initial report in 2012, TENGs have undergone significant
    development and garnered widespread research attention on an international level,
    particularly in the area of WIEDs [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71]. As shown
    in Fig. 6b(top), Z L Wang’s group demonstrated a fully implanted symbiotic pacemaker
    based on an implantable triboelectric nanogenerator, which achieved energy harvesting
    and storage, as well as cardiac pacing, on a large-animal scale [72]. The in-vitro
    electrical output performance of the TENGs produced average values for the Voc,
    the short-circuit transferred charge (Qsc), and the short-circuit current (Isc)
    of 97.5 V, 49.1 nC, and 10.1 μA, respectfully. As shown in Fig. 6b (bottom), an
    adult Yorkshire porcine was employed in this work, and Voc of up to ∼65.2 V were
    obtained; the Qsc was ∼13.6 nC, and the corresponding Isc was ∼0.5 μA in vivo.
    Their work provided a promising method, which used the kinetic energy from the
    animal''s heartbeat to operate an implantable cardiac device, to harvest in-vivo
    biomechanical energy. Flexible devices assembled with film materials are generally
    stretchable and bendable in one direction. However, their lack of air-permeability,
    poor 3D deformation, and low damage tolerance limit their use, particularly in
    the domain of WIEDs. Consequently, energy conversion devices based on fibers have
    been developed. Z L Wang’s group realized a novel and scalable self-charging power
    textile for energy-harvesting devices by combining yarn supercapacitors and fabric
    triboelectric nanogenerators devices [73]. Fig. 6c shows the self-charging power
    textile in an individual’s clothes that integrates three functional units: a TENG
    fabric for energy harvesting, a supercapacitor fabric for energy storage, and
    wearable electronics or sensors. Finally, the Voc had a peak-to-peak value of
    about 40 V, and the Isc had a peak value of about 5 μA. This integration of capacitors
    and friction nanogenerators into a single fabric to enhance energy storage represented
    a significant step forward in the field of WIEDs. When individuals move, they
    not only do horizontal work to move forward but also do work vertically to counteract
    the effects of gravity, and the interactions between energy and gravity during
    human locomotion generate a regular inertia effect within the body. This phenomenon
    causes the chest''s vertical height to periodically change by approximately 6 cm.
    For this reason, Ryu H and his colleagues developed and reported an inertia-driven
    triboelectric nanogenerator (I-TENG) and a self-chargeable cardiac pacemaker system
    [74]. As shown in Fig. 6d (left), during this research, an in-vivo stacked TENG
    was successfully operated in a preclinical test, which enabled the simultaneous
    application of mechanical energy. Under 3-Hz regular vertical motion, the five-stacked
    TENGs generated 4.9 μW cm−3 and over 4 V during the laboratory experiment. The
    self-rechargeable cardiac pacemaker is shown in Fig. 6d (right), and the stacked
    TENGs generated around 144 mW of power during 24 h in vivo. What is noteworthy
    is the functioning of stacked TENGs with varying phases, even though the total
    output current was not markedly increased due to current waveform offset. They
    also designed encapsulated TENGs that employed indirect mechanical force to oscillate
    the freestanding unit, enabling the external mechanical energy to be applied to
    synchronize the five TENGs in the same electrical phase. Due the five waveforms
    having identical current phases, they combined, resulting in amplified current
    without the need for extra electronic components. Improving the output energy
    of TENGs is still a significant challenge to their practical use. The surface
    charge density, which could be influenced by the dielectric constant, directly
    correlates to the TENG’s output performance. For this reason, thinner films with
    higher dielectric constants usually yield higher outputs. However, poor durability
    owing to material abrasion during motion restricts the material’s long-term use
    and the stability of its output. Hu, C et al. using spherical metal particles
    as a friction material that provided unlimited point contacts and the force of
    the magnetic field as the driving force for the particles, developed and reported
    for the first time a novel ferromagnetic metal particle-based triboelectric nanogenerator
    (FMP-TENG), which effectively improved the durability and the electric output
    of the TENG devices [75]. Benefiting from the rolling-motion characteristic of
    metal particles, FMP-TENGs can achieve charge densities of 103 µC m−2 and peak
    power densities of 400 mW m−2 Hz−1; they also exhibit excellent durability after
    10 k cycles and retain 97% of the output charge for 110 k cycles. The structure
    and the working mechanism of the FMP-TENG is shown in Fig. 6e. The FMP-TENG couples
    the unlimited point contact of rolling motion, instead of the planar contact of
    a film material, to improve durability and provide a novel and effective approach
    for increasing the durability of a sliding TENG. The same group found that the
    dielectric surface effect could be changed into a volume effect by adopting thicker
    dielectric film with an inner porous network structure so that charges could hop
    in the surface state of the network [76]. From a traditional point of view, the
    back electrode generates an alternating electric signal output due to electrostatic
    induction, which is significantly affected by the thickness of the dielectric
    material; for that reason, the thickness of the film limits the output charge
    density and power. The working mechanism underlying the dielectric-volume-effect
    TENG (DVE-TENG) is shown in Fig. 6f; clearly, the polyurethane (PU) foam film,
    acting as the tribolayer of the stator, leads to a high electric output while
    ensuring excellent durability owing to its porous structure and material characteristics.
    A rotary DVE-TENG exhibited a high electric output by lighting 7552 LEDs and a
    high durability during 200,000 operation cycles. A common feature of the four
    modes of operation of TENG is that it all require two materials to be in direct
    contact. As the workload and time increase, the wear and tear of the contacting
    materials also increases, which may cause issues with the durability and stability.
    Non-contact TENG hold great potential in the field of energy harvesting because
    they do not cause material wear. However, the residual surface charges in the
    non-contact mode are difficult to maintain for a long time, which greatly limits
    its output perfor-mance and applications. X Y Chen et al. proposes a high insulation
    strategy for non-contact mode TENG by elevating the electric insulation strength
    to avoid air breakdown, while both the external charge excitation and the self-excitation
    system are developed [77]. By using dielectric oil with a high dielectric strength
    to fill the floating gap, the air-breakdown effect during the TENG operation is
    avoided, which greatly improve charge storage capacity of floating layer. The
    air-breakdown effect could be avoided, due to the use of high dielectric strength
    oil. This method has the potential to be adapted to other operational modes to
    enhance the productivity of TENG. TENGs has the capacity to convert low-frequency
    irregular mechanical energy into electricity. Thanks to the diverse range of materials
    available, straightforward fabrication processes, low cost, and self-generating
    signals, triboelectric-based sensing technology presents a new opportunity to
    create a highly flexible perception system, which requires minimal power consumption.
    Particularly, TENGs is being leveraged for gesture recognition and motion mapping
    across various sensing domains, and holds significant potential for deployment
    in eye-tracking applications. Shi Y et al. report an active eye-tracking system
    for real-time eye movements monitoring and eye-controlled human-computer interaction
    inspiring by non-contact TENGs [78]. The principle of active eye-tracking system
    based on the electrostatic induction effect, the pre-charged interface has the
    ability to produce electrostatic interactions with human skin even in non-contact
    mode. According to the interface array in front of eye, electrostatic signals
    responding to different eye movements can be identified with the help of deep
    learning. The decoded eye movements are subsequently encoded as instructions,
    which are transmitted to operational systems to achieve eye-controlled mouse actions.
    That novel work promises to solve the lack of portability of traditional eye-tracking
    devices, and to help people suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis realize
    human-computer interactions, as a non-contact technology with breathability and
    low risk of infection. The acquisition of kinesthetic information focused on the
    foot is a prominent subject in self-powered sensing technology. Most shoe sensors
    based on TENGs are set in the areas of insoles or outsoles. The high pressures
    in those area may present a challenge for the sensors to maintain consistent operation
    over time. Yang P et al. proposed an in-shoe sensor pad attached to a vamp lining
    for monitoring the real-time stress distribution on the top side of feet, including
    foot gesture and the in-motion comfort degree of shoes [79]. Each air-capsule
    TENG is fabricated using an activated carbon (AC)/PU film with a stacked cross-honeycomb
    structure and a microsphere electrode array covered by PTFE electrification materials.
    The AC/PU combined with the air-capsule configuration can achieve an ultrawide
    detection range for each sensor, which can reach 7.27 MPa. It is thus far the
    largest detection range reported by TENG sensors. In addition, the integration
    with magnetically coupled inductive wireless power transfergreatly prolongs the
    battery life and widens the application range of the sensor. TENGs can effectively
    convert mechanical energy generated by the body''s physical activities into electrical
    energy while being easy to manufacture and expand. At the same time, they offer
    advantages, such as versatility and biocompatibility on a global scale, thanks
    to a wide range of material options. However, the application of mechanical energy
    harvesters in WIEDs needs to be expanded. On the one hand, there is a requirement
    to further investigate the fundamental theory behind piezoelectricity and triboelectricity
    and to identify the most appropriate model to utilize the full potential of wearable
    PENGs/TENGs. On the other hand, a more rational approach to regulating voltage
    and current is imperative to address the specificities of low power output. In
    addition, a consistent standard for assessing the performance and the robustness
    of nanogenerators operating in different scenarios must be established in order
    to enhance the commercialization and the industrialization of nanogeneraters [80],
    [81]. 2.3. Self-powered technology based on the harvesting of environmental energy
    Harvesting light energy from the environment is an important area of research
    for self-powered systems in WIEDs. One way to do this is to use solar cells (SCs)
    to convert unlimited and clean solar energy into electricity, which potentially
    can provide consistent and efficient power to WIEDs continuously. Another way
    is to use the gradient between the temperature of the human body and that of the
    surrounding environment as a source of heat for collecting electrical energy by
    using wearable thermoelectric generators. These two approaches have been thoroughly
    researched [82], [83], [84], [85], [86], [87], [88], [89]. The development of
    SCs, which are now flexible, portable, lightweight, and aesthetical, has led to
    a plethora of new applications, especially as power sources integrated into wearable
    devices. In 2012, Lingley, A.R. et al. designed contact lenses incorporating SCs,
    which were integrated free-standing 500 × 500 × 10 µm3 single-crystal silicon,
    micrometer-scale SCs, and achieved a maximum efficiency at a wavelength 725 nm
    with a conversion efficiency of 1.24% at 310 mV [90]. As shown in Fig. 7a, the
    contact lenses were tested on live rabbits, and no adverse effects were detected.
    Unfortunately, this performance was determined using an Oriel solar simulator
    comprising a xenon lamp coupled to an AM1.5 filter. Thus, the performance should
    be lower than that under practical conditions. For the integration of smart wearable
    electronics, the low-light performance of SCs and the absorption of diffuse light
    are pivotal. With this in mind, D. Landerer et al. integrated solution-processed,
    semitransparent, organic SCs, which were designed to operate in the bright sun,
    under low-light conditions (indoors), and under oblique light incidence, as well
    as in direct or diffuse light, into smart sun glasses [91]. An optical image is
    shown in Fig. 7b, and the power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of the lens-fitted
    SCs was 6.7% under 500 lux. Download : Download high-res image (526KB) Download

    is by using a watch strap. J Q Zhao et al. used flexible amorphous silicon (a-Si)
    photovoltaic cells to provide adequate power for noninvasive, continuous monitoring
    of glucose levels [92]. As shown in Fig. 7c, the flexible photovoltaic cells,
    with device areas of around 28.44 cm2, used in the smartwatch generated a Isc
    of 28.79 mA, Voc of over 6.28 V, and PCE of 3.20%, under an air mass (AM) of 1.5.
    With the trend toward wearable devices, electronics are now progressively being
    integrated into clothes and textiles. Because of this, more and more SCs are being
    integrated into textile substrates for power sensors and other electronics. As
    shown in Fig. 7d, Zhang, N et al. wove strings of wire-shaped photoanodes and
    counter electrodes (CE) in an interlaced manner to form a single-layered textile.
    With the Voc of 0.46 V, and Isc of 7.8 mA cm−2, the energy conversion efficiency
    of the reported photovoltaic textile reached up to 1.3% [93]. For all-solid, TCO-less,
    flexible SCs, this performance merits attention from researchers. Solar energy
    technology is well-established and easily scalable, with high output. However,
    its environmental dependence means it is better used in sunny places. Additionally,
    considering the impact of shadows and panel distortions caused by body movements
    on the energy output is important. For certain application scenarios, the real-time
    output may fall short of expectations. In the case of solar lenses, for instance,
    exposure of the eyes to direct sunlight for long periods of time is challenging.
    Consequently, the achieved output will be lower than laboratory data. Therefore,
    up-dating self-powered solar glasses to enhance the low-light performance is crucial.
    In the human body, most of the energy is released as thermal energy and dissipates
    into the surrounding environment. The amount of power dissipated as heat from
    the human body can vary between 100 and 550 W, depending on the individual’s level
    of physical activity [94]. However, attaining elevated efficiency is a greater
    challenge than originally foreseen, as TEGs solely encompass a limited portion
    of the human body. Therefore, maximization necessitates the meticulous development
    of TEGs at the material, device, and systematic levels. The development of a scalable
    solution for a wearable thermal harvester is currently on the research frontier
    for wearable TEGs. Fabric, like SCs, offers a direct path towards wearable devices
    and could enhance the flexibility of TEGs. The primary challenges for practical
    implementation of fabrics in wearable TEGs is efficient heat capture in the direction
    of the thermal gradient to achieve high power density and ensure stable performance
    during everyday use. As shown in Fig. 7e, to address the above challenges, Sun,
    T et al. designed a TEG that was directly woven into the textile instead of being
    embedding into clothes [95]. Alternately doped carbon-nanotube fibers wrapped
    with acrylic fibers were woven into π-type thermoelectric modules. The textile
    generator showed a peak power density of 70 mWm−2 for a temperature difference
    of 44 K and excellent stretchability (∼80% strain) with no output degradation.
    As shown in Fig. 7f, Lee, B. et al. designed a highly conformable TEG with high
    thermoelectric performance by lining up silver-coated nickel particles with Bi2Te3
    bulk legs, which significantly improved the heat transfer ability in the through-plane
    direction, thereby achieving minimal parasitic heat loss and conformal thermal
    contact [96]. The TEG consisting of 220 nanoparticle pairs had a maximum power
    of 7.02 mW and the Voc of 2.12 V at a given temperature difference of 40 K. The
    approach facilitated conformal contact with arbitrary 3D surfaces, thus significantly
    minimizing energy loss in undesirable air gaps, which has been a chronic limitation
    of previous flexible, wearable TEGs using rigid interconnects. Due to their excellent
    conformability, these TEGs can operate a self-powered, wearable, warning system
    for arbitrary hot features, proving its superiority in energy harvesting on 3D
    heat sources. The application of thermoelectric generators has encountered significant
    challenges due to heat stagnation in their legs, which curtails power conversion
    efficacy. To address this problem, Karthikeyan, V. et al. harnessed the enhanced
    thermal impedance induced by the cellular architecture of microlattices to fabricate
    three-dimensionally (3D) architected TEGs. Fig. 7g presents the schematics of
    the technological process and a 3D architected TEG that achieved a maximum power
    output from the microlattice of ∼1.4 µW [97]. TEGs have limitations in that they
    only produce considerable energy when the temperature variations are large and
    generate inadequate output voltages and power levels at lower temperature gradients.
    Yang, S. et al. utilized an energy management (EM) circuit and supercapacitors
    to control and harness efficiently the inconsistent output from TEGs, significantly
    improving their usability and allowing operation at lower temperature differences
    [98]. An optical image is shown in Fig. 7h. In the normal state, when the temperature
    difference is 2 K, the TEGs deliver a stable output voltage of 89 mV and current
    of 3 mA; at 13 K, they achieve a stable output voltage of ∼450 mV and current
    of ∼38.5 mA. As the size of TEGs shrinks, achieving low thermal impedance interfaces
    to the environment and maintaining significant temperature differences across
    the device’s terminals becomes increasingly challenging. As shown in Fig. 7i,
    these TEGs use a helical coil architecture to ensure excellent thermal contact
    with the heat source. Specifically, as the substrate equilibrates with the thermal
    source, heat passes into the coils at the bonding locations. The encapsulation
    layers have widths larger than those of the silicon ribbons to increase the surface
    area of the cold-side heat exchanger and to provide mechanical support and protection.
    the resulting Voc was 51.3 mV at ΔT = 19 K, and the maximum power output was ≈ 2
    nW [99]. Although the powers of TEGs currently are insufficient to drive WIEDs,
    they can produce noticeable outputs under appropriate temperature differences.
    If the temperature gradient is lost, human body will not be affected; at the same
    time, the human epidermal temperature can be regulated to enhance the user’s experience
    and reduce the energy consumption in indoor electronic products. Therefore, the
    TEG holds promise for widespread use in WIEDs. The application of self-powered
    technology in WIEDs eliminates the redundancy of large-capacity batteries, makes
    the devices more flexible and lightweight, and eliminates the need for power transmission,
    which can effectively enhance the scope of the devices and improve the user’s
    experience. However, the commercial utilization of self-power technologies necessitates
    enhanced output power and energy conversion efficiencies to fulfil the power demands
    of current equipment, so further improvements to the power management system can
    reduce losses at the system level. 3. External power transmission technologies
    The transmission efficiency can be significantly enhanced through external power
    transmission technology, which is classified into wired and wireless methods based
    on the transmission medium. Among these, the wireless approach has been extensively
    researched as the energy transmission method with the most comprehensive performance.
    Its energy carriers include electromagnetic waves, mechanical waves, and others.
    3.1. Electromagnetic energy transmission Electromagnetic waves, the earliest energy
    carriers used in wireless power transmission (WPT) systems, are widely used in
    manufacturing and in daily life. Amin M et al. established boundaries for the
    near-field and the far-field regions of an antenna by using wave impedance and
    phase difference theory. In recent years, the concept of mid-field has been introduced
    to improve the efficiency of implantable devices. Although light waves, such as
    visible light and near-infrared light, are electromagnetic waves, they will be
    introduced separately because their operating principles and equipment structures
    are quite different from those of traditional WPT systems [100]. 3.1.1. Near-field
    wireless power transfer method based on electromagnetic waves The near-field described
    here refers to the non-radiating region, meaning that the electromagnetic waves
    are confined inside the waveguide and do not propagate in free space. Near-field
    inductive coupling is the most commonly used wireless energy-supply method for
    WIEDs, and as shown in Fig. 8a, the device consists of two coils [101]. Three
    parameters listed in Fig. 8a reflect the operational state of a near-field inductively
    coupled system. The quality factor (Q) of the coils, which can be influence by
    inherent resonant frequency (fr) of the coil, entirely determines the performance
    of system. P is power collected by the receiver coil. Many factors, such as external
    electromagnetic interference, reflections caused by obstacles, and power absorption
    by metals and water, affect the stability and the transmission efficiency of near-field
    inductive coupling [102], [103], [104]. Download : Download high-res image (509KB)

    Ltd. WPT has already been integrated in commercial WIEDs, such as the smartwatches
    exemplified by the Apple Watch. Conventionally, the back cover must be fabricated
    using a non-metallic material to achieve inductive coupling. In consideration
    of aesthetic appearance and mechanical strength, metal rims are integrated into
    most smartwatches. Zhu, J.Q. et al. focused on a metal-rim-connected inductive
    coupler with series-none compensation topology and aimed to achieve WPT through
    metal plates [105]. The inductive coupler and the prototype are shown in Fig.
    8b. The proposed inductive coupler significantly enhanced the coupling coefficient
    from 0.05 to 0.46 by cross-connecting the receiving coil to the edge of the narrow
    slot. Because of the strong coupling between the transmitting coil and the secondary
    coil, the output power and current went up to 5 W and 1 A, respectively. The incorporation
    of the pre-existing metal rim enabled the inductive coupler to be easily integrated
    with other components within the smartwatch, making it highly flexible. As a result,
    the proposed metal-rim-connected inductive coupler proved to be a strong contender
    for smartwatch applications. G Shin et al. presented flexible optoelectronic implants
    powered by near-field power transfer for complete optical control in a variety
    of behavioral paradigms [106]. The overall construction is shown in Fig. 8c (left),
    and an image of the implantable device is shown in Fig. 8c (right). The output
    power reached 1.55 W, which could power Micro-LEDs so that they could operate
    in-vivo optogenetic experiments. However, many additional considerations must
    be taken into account when implementing near-field inductive coupling in wearable
    technology. For example, limiting the emission of electromagnetic waves from WIEDs
    to the human body enhances the safety of operation and lessens the electromagnetic
    interference imposed on other electronic equipment. S. Hong et al. proposed a
    cochlear implant WPT system with an additional shielding coil to effectively suppress
    electromagnetic field radiation from the WPT system to reduce the electromagnetic
    field leakage by 5.1 dB in the operating frequency range [107]. Near-field inductive
    coupling has shown high transmission efficiency and output power in the field
    of WIEDs. Electromagnetic induction is a non-radiant energy supply, so its radiofrequency
    attenuation in the near field is insignificant, and it has minimal effects on
    the human body. However, the effective transmission distance is limited, and the
    coil’s positive angle offset significantly reduces the transmission efficiency,
    which can be improved by adjusting the coil’s material, size, and coupling coefficient,
    as well as by the spatial design and impedance matching [108], [109], [110]. 3.1.2.
    Mid-field wireless power transfer method based on electromagnetic waves The most
    effective transmission of near-field inductive coupling has been demonstrated
    to occur when the coil has a diameter between 5 and 10 mm [111]. The trend towards
    compactness in implantable devices has led to a reduction in the size of the receiver
    coils, which reduces the transmitted power, so a new power scheme is required
    to increase the power of near-field inductive coupling in implantable devices,
    while at the same time increasing its penetration capability to meet the demand
    for powering small coils in deeper tissue implants. This technique of transmitting
    energy via near-field induction in the air and radiation via far-field in tissues
    is referred to as mid-field WPT. Ho J S et al. first introduced the concept of
    mid-field WPT, which could create a high-energy density region deep in tissue
    by using a patterned metal plate placed in close proximity to the skin [112].
    A schematic for power transfer is shown in Fig. 8d, and one for waves propagating
    in tissue multilayers is shown in Fig. 8e. They realized mid-field WPT by using
    a metal plate with slots, which could be excited using four independent radiofrequency
    ports. The source and the device within a porcine tissue volume were separated
    by at least 5 cm. When 500 mW was coupled into tissue, the power transferred to
    the coil was 195 μW for the heart and 200 μW for the brain. The received power
    remained substantial (∼10 μW) even when the operating depth was increased to 10 cm.
    Basir A et al. proposed a complete WPT system integrated with a quad-band implantable
    antenna for a multitasking deep tissue-implanted medical device [113]. They considered
    the two geometries generally seen in implantable devices, capsule-type and flat-type.
    Then, they designed a quad-band implantable antenna for multitasking small implanted
    medical devices to ensure simultaneous bidirectional data communication, control
    signaling, and wireless powering. When the implantable antenna was optimized,
    the proposed system transferred 4 to 6.7 mW of power to more than a 5-cm depth
    in tissues, provided a voltage > 3 V and achieved a high RF-to-dc conversion efficiency
    of 90%. For recharging and operating biomedical implantable devices, Iqbal A et
    al. proposed a dual-band implantable rectenna, which could efficiently rectify
    two RF signals and effectively superimpose them on a single load. They used a
    meandered geometry and a slotted ground plane to enhance the ambient energy harvesting
    from multiple directions [114]. Under conditions that prioritized human safety,
    the rectifier had an RF-to-dc conversion efficiency of 77.02% at an input power
    of 0 dBm. A unique advantage of the proposed WPT system is that it can efficiently
    rectify two RF signals. Mid-field WPT technology propagates electromagnetic energy
    through structures and objects and is capable of effectively powering small, deeply
    embedded WIEDs [115]. This method of power transmission boasts exceptional penetration
    capabilities, making it a promising solution for meeting the power requirements
    in various applications. The radiation of energy within organisms has both advantages
    and disadvantages. Crucially, the power must be enhanced whilst following rigorous
    regulations to ensure the safety of the users [116]. Consequently, more precise
    tissue models will be developed to enhance the transmission efficiency of mid-field
    WPTs, and efforts will be made to mitigate the impact of prolonged use on the
    human body. 3.1.3. Far-field wireless power transfer method based on electromagnetic
    waves The output of near-field WPT decreases exponentially with distance, highlighting
    the necessity to implement far-field WPT systems utilizing electromagnetic radiation
    to enable efficient long-range energy transfer. As shown in Fig. 8f, the far-field
    WPT architecture usually consists of a radiofrequency generator, antenna, transmission
    path, and receiver components [117]. The far-field range discussed refers specifically
    to the region of the Fraunhofer field. That region is characterized by the absence
    of interference between the electromagnetic field and the energy source. Additionally,
    the electric and magnetic fields are in phase with each other, and attenuation
    is proportional to the inverse of the distance [118], [119], [120]. Chow E Y et
    al. proved that a low-power sensor implanted within the eye with miniature form
    factors appropriate for implantation could be wirelessly powered and demonstrated
    the effect that implantation had on RF wave propagation to a medical ocular implant
    [121]. Liu C et al. designed a wireless power link with circular polarization
    to achieve a power link with less polarization loss; a compact CP implantable
    antenna was designed with a very small volume and good radiation performance [122].
    The output voltage of the rectifier circuit was ∼0.136 V, and the converted dc
    power was ∼5.14 μW under this condition. Asif S M et al. used RF energy harvesting
    techniques to power the pacemaker for myocardial stimulations [123]. But the tips
    were sharpened for easy implantation, which may cause irreversible damage to the
    user. Far-field WPT can power WIEDs without the user experiencing any discomfort,
    thus significantly enhancing the user''s range of motion and overall experience.
    Because radiofrequency waves have a longer transmission distance than electromagnetic
    induction, the path losses are significant; thus, the impact of transmission distance
    on radiofrequency waves is important and must be considered. The utilization of
    modulation and demodulation circuits decreases the size of the receiving antenna;
    however, the consequent augmentation in device complexity does not favor the miniaturization
    of far-field devices. Thus, a compromise between integration and output must be
    reached. The effect of electromagnetic waves being absorbed by human organs and
    tissues, known as the body shadow effect, is a notable phenomenon. These tissues
    absorb power, potentially affecting the body. Therefore, the specific absorption
    rate is a widely studied factor in research regarding the effects on human tissue
    [124], [125], [126], [127]. 3.2. Acoustic energy transfer Acoustic energy transfer
    (AET) is a method of energy transfer using media such as sound waves and ultrasound
    (US), of which ultrasound has been widely studied by scientists as a more efficient
    and human-friendly medium. This section focuses on the ultrasound-based AET technique.
    As shown in Fig. 9a, the architectural components include the power source, transducer,
    rectifier circuit, and load [128]. The attenuation of ultrasound in human tissue
    is much lower than that of electromagnetic radiation, making US very suitable
    as a medium for powering deeply implanted electronic devices [129]. Download :

    ultrasound to deliver mechanical energy through skin and liquids and to demonstrate
    a thin implantable vibrating TENG (VI-TENG) able to harvest that energy effectively
    [130]. The VI-TENG was able to generate 25-V voltage peaks at a 40-megohm impedance
    and 1.3-mA current peaks at a 1-ohm impedance. By using high-performance single-electrode
    TENGs, researchers measured output signals of more than 1.93 V and 98.6 μA at
    1.0 cm under porcine layered-tissues, including skin and fat. Fig. 9b (middle)
    and Fig. 9b (right) show the location of the implanted VI-TENG. That work offers
    a sound way to deliver power by using triboelectric technology as it receives
    US energy in liquids and soft tissues and to generate power on the order of milliwatts,
    enabling capacitors and Li-ion batteries to be recharged. Jiang, L. and et al.
    reported a flexible ultrasound-induced retinal stimulating piezo-array that offered
    an alternative wireless artificial retinal prosthesis approach for evoking visual
    percepts in blind individuals [131]. Fig. 9c presents a schematic of the flexible
    ultrasonic device. Under excitation by a 3.3-MHz US pulse with a trigger voltage
    of 100 Vpp, the induced unrectified output voltage reached ∼10.6 Vpp, and the
    US-induced outputs could be flexibly adjusted to reach a power densities of up
    to 22.6 mW cm−2 by using trigger parameters. The fundamental technological achievements
    in that study provide opportunities for the next generation of artificial vision
    prostheses. Inspired by natural wood structures, Hong Y et al. reported a transmuscular,
    ultrasonic, wireless, power-transfer system based on a flexible wood-templated
    piezoelectric ultrasonic energy harvester (W-PUEH) in a unidirectional 3D interconnected
    ceramic–polymer topology. The developed flexible W-PUEH device produced an output
    voltage of 21 V, an output current of 2 mA, and an average output power density
    of 304 μW cm−2 [132]. The design of and the working principle underlying the W-PUEH
    are shown in Fig. 9d. As shown in Fig. 9e (left), Jin P et al. developed a battery-free
    implantable system, based on flexible electronic technology, that could achieve
    wireless recharging and communication simultaneously via ultrasound, as well as
    in-vivo physiological monitoring and cardiac pacing [133]. Under different deformation
    states, the acoustic energy transfer and communication device (AECD) still exhibited
    strong electrical robustness. As shown in Fig. 9e (middle), by injecting water
    into the flexible base to enlarge the curvature and arc height of the outer transmission
    portion, the AECD could receive ultrasound and then steadily produce a 3.3-V dc
    voltage as a power supply, and the received acoustic power increased from approximately
    0.002 W/mm2 to 0.025 W/mm2. As shown in Fig. 9f, Y Yang et al. reported a promising
    alternative they had developed, an implantable ultrasound-powered tumor-treating
    device (UP-TTD), that electromagnetically disrupted the rapid division of cancer
    cells without any adverse effects on normal neurons, thereby safely inhibiting
    brain cancer recurrence [134]. The average output intensity could reach 3 to 4 V/cm
    under an ultrasonic excitation of 0.3 W/cm2 at 20 mm. The UP-TTD still generated
    output signals of ∼2.1 V/cm at a depth of 20 mm with an excitation power of 0.2 W/cm2
    for clinically safe treatment of brain tumors. The UP-TTD is wireless, ultrasound-powered,
    chip-sized, and lightweight; it can be easily operated on complex surfaces, greatly
    increases the therapeutic efficiency, and reduces energy consumption. AET is safer,
    less lossy, and more conducive to antenna miniaturisation than far-field WPT and
    with its smaller receivers and longer distances has greater advantages over near-field
    WPT. To reduce path loss, the ultrasound generator must be in contact with the
    skin, which limits the user''s freedom of movement. At the same time, differences
    in the water and the blood contents of tissues can seriously affect the acoustic
    properties. Simulations of the properties of the different tissue interfaces (skin,
    fat, muscle, etc.) should be performed in order to propose a more targeted solution
    to optimise the efficiency [135], [136], [137]. 3.3. Infrared power transmission
    Near-infrared light has been selected as the transmission medium for implantable
    photovoltaic cells because of its low risk and high penetration capacity [138].
    The superiority of second near-infrared (NIR-II) light over visible light due
    to its lower absorption and scattering by skin tissues has been recognized. Lyu
    S et al. designed a photo-thermal-electric converter by combining photothermal
    conversion and thermoelectric conversion to recharge implantable medical devices
    by using contactless power transfer technologies. That device could generate an
    output power as high as 195 mW when the excised tissues were covered and 20 mW
    under NIR-II light irradiation through rabbit skin with a thickness of 8.5 mm
    [139]. That line of research proposed a strategy of combining photothermal conversion
    with thermoelectric conversion and represented a new paradigm for subcutaneous
    power supplies with the advantages of non-invasion, high output power, negligible
    biological damage, and deep tissue penetration. Moreover, the subcutaneous power
    supply was recognized as a promising supplement to power WIEDs. L Wang et al.
    reported a two-dimensional silicon photodiode array that delivered efficient retinal
    stimulation at safe near-infrared light irradiances without any wired power connections;
    the array photovoltaically converted pulsed near-infrared light into bi-phasic
    current to stimulate nearby retinal neurons for restoring sight to patients blinded
    by degenerative retinal diseases [140]. Pixels with three photodiodes connected
    in series had turn-on voltages of about 1.8 V. For pixel sizes of 280, 140 and
    70 µm, the measured photoresponsivity per diode ranged from 0.33 to 0.4 A W−1.
    Retinal stimulation was achieved at peak irradiances of 0.3 mW mm−2 in vitro and
    0.5 mW mm−2 in vivo when using a 4-ms pulse duration. The use of thin-film SCs
    within the body promotes device miniaturization. That human tissues comprise substances
    such as blood, water, and fat, which scatter and absorb light, is important to
    consider. The optical properties of human tissues can significantly impact the
    propagation of light energy within the body and the reception efficiency of SCs.
    Additionally, fluctuations in body temperature can diminish efficacies of SCs
    [141]. Encapsulation of photovoltaic cells helps to prevent the penetration of
    water and oxygen, provides mechanical support, and reduces the leakage of toxic
    elements. This is a crucial method for improving the device''s long-term stability.
    The integration of flexible polymer encapsulation materials into wearable technology
    will significantly enlarge the scope of the device and enhance the user’s experience.
    Nonetheless, in contrast to traditional and rigid materials, these materials are
    prone to higher levels of water and oxygen permeability, which makes protecting
    the built-in circuitry during prolonged periods of time more challenging. Therefore,
    in-vivo testing should be conducted prior to assessing biocompatibility and cytotoxicity
    to keep the user safe [142], [143], [144]. 3.4. Wired power transmission Wired
    energy transfer is the most well-established power supply method but has several
    limitations in physical space. However, for implantable medical devices intended
    to prolong the life of patients, wired power can reduce the number of surgeries
    needed to replace batteries and thereby lower costs and surgical risk. Typically,
    the structure comprises an ex-vivo controller and an in-vivo functional system
    connected by percutaneous wires. Patients with advanced heart failure must resort
    to having a ventricular assist device due to the absence of suitable transplantable
    organs. Pacemakers consume around 8–10 μW of power [112], and some WPTs and self-powered
    devices can operate them effectively. Nevertheless, ventricular assist devices
    require an output power high enough to substitute for the natural heart. Due to
    limitations in wireless transmission power and biosafety considerations, current
    commercial devices at home and abroad continue to utilize percutaneous wires to
    drive ventricular assist devices. The wired transmission method provides reliable
    output stability and holds an irreplaceable position in certain areas of application.
    The use of percutaneous wires restricts patient mobility and elevates the likelihood
    of wound infection. Therefore, investigating WPT as an alternative to conventional
    wired transmission technology is crucial because WPT ensures consistent and efficient
    output for an extended period [145], [146], [147], [148], [149]. 3.5. Human body
    power transmission The use of the human body as a medium for energy supply and
    data transmission was first proposed in 1997 [150], but due to the limitations
    of science and technology at that time, the method did not attract much attention
    from the academic community. In recent years, with the development of human body
    communication, human body power transmission (HBPT) has recently been revived
    [151]. HBPT can minimize the shadow effect of the human body and is more suitable
    for communication in the vicinity of the human body. The HBPT method, which uses
    the principles associated with human body communication, combines the characteristics
    of both wired and wireless methods, and the transmission link is mediated by using
    highly conductive human tissues with lower channel attenuation compared to air
    while the energy loss due to the body shadowing effect is reduced. As shown in
    Fig. 10a, HBPT can be classified into galvanic coupling, capacitance coupling,
    and magnetic resonance coupling based on the different coupling methods [152],
    [153]. Galvanic coupling refers to the placement of two electrodes at the transmitter
    and the receiver ends and the induction of a current that can propagate across
    the skin’s surface through the differential signal formed between the electrodes,
    the principle of which is shown in Fig. 10a (left). The principle was first proposed
    by Oberle [154]; then, Wegmueller [155], [156], [157] carried out a detailed study
    of the galvanic coupling approach, which can provide 1 mA of current at frequencies
    in the range 10 kHz to 1 MHz. The efficiency of galvanic coupling transmission
    deteriorates dramatically with distance, and this method is more suitable for
    power transmission over short distances, which makes the need to meet the simultaneous
    powering of devices located in different parts of the body difficult. Download

    Consistent with near-field inductive coupling WPT, magnetic resonance coupling
    also uses two coils to complete the energy transfer, and its transmission principle
    is shown in Fig. 10a (middle). Although the magnetic field is more suitable for
    use in the wearable field with less propagation loss in the human body compared
    to the electric field, the technique retains the disadvantages of near-field inductive
    coupling WPT, and based on the consideration of body posture and human safety,
    it is not able to complete the energy supply of the WIEDs near the head, such
    as near-eye displays, and it is only suitable in the fields where the arms are
    used as the energy transmission channel [158], [159]. In 2005, Hachisuka et al.
    [160] found that the transmission efficiency of the two-electrode galvanic coupling
    model was much higher than that of the four-electrode galvanic coupling model.
    Although two of the electrodes were not connected to the circuit, the coupling
    between the suspended electrodes and the surrounding environment actually constituted
    a capacitive coupling model; i.e., this proved that the effect of capacitive coupling
    is superior to that of galvanic coupling. The capacitive coupling method is shown
    in Fig. 10a (right) and is mainly characterized by the coupling between the two
    suspended electrodes, one in the air and the other on the ground. This method
    has the largest effective coverage, but is more sensitive to the transmission
    path, and a significant difference in signal attenuation between paths, such as
    arm-arm and head-foot, is found. A clear relationship exists between the capacitance
    value and the posture of the human body, which forms a return path with the help
    of the parasitic capacitance. As shown in Fig. 10b, Li J et al. demonstrated that
    the body-coupling characteristics of electromagnetic waves—which are either artificially
    introduced or present in the immediate surroundings—can be used to enable a power
    transmission and energy harvesting method that offers power to locations all around
    the body [161]. Body-coupled power transmission exhibits a path loss that is 30-
    to 70-dB lower than far-field radiofrequency transmission in the presence of body
    shadowing. The system can recover 2 µW at the head from a ∼1.2-mW transmitter
    placed 160 cm away at the ankle, and the system can recover ∼2.2 µW from ambient
    electromagnetic waves of up to − 10-dBm coupled onto the human body. Distributed
    charging systems provide a new solution for body-coupled power transfer. Wang
    E J et al. addressed capacitive serendipitous power transfer (CASPER), a charging
    solution to enable a future where wearable devices are much more distributed on
    the human body [162]. The system works by treating the human body as a conductor
    and by capacitively charging devices worn on the body whenever a well-coupled
    electrical path is created during natural use of everyday objects. As shown in
    Fig. 10c, everyday items like beds, chairs and clothing that are commonly used
    as practical charging bases are available to charge on-body devices fortuitously
    throughout the day. Finally, this system has been shown to capture enough energy
    to operate a wound detection device for an entire day (305 μW) or to light more
    than 10 LEDs in a dim environment (248 μW). Similar to the above, Mohammed N et
    al. focused on establishing the technical groundwork of the proposed technology
    by incorporating the capacitive coupling mechanism, in which the forward signal
    path is established through the human body, and the return path is established
    via capacitive coupling to the surrounding environment [163]. To showcase the
    feasibility, they investigated three different use scenarios---i.e., interacting
    with a keyboard on a desk, a laptop, and the steering wheel of a car---to transfer
    power to a wrist-worn device as shown in Fig. 10d, and they demonstrated that
    the system could transfer approximately 0.5 to 1 mW of dc power to the wrist-worn
    device. Mid-field WPT can increase the level of electromagnetic radiation in a
    specific area of the human body. When combined with a body-coupled power supply,
    this method can improve the efficiency of supplying energy to implantable electronic
    components. Tognolatti and colleagues investigated the enhanced electric field
    in tissues experiencing mid-field WPT to enhance the effectiveness of using the
    body-coupled power supply method in implantable devices [164]. They achieved this
    by constructing a multilayered model of human tissues covered with fabrics that
    accounted for variations in millimeter-wave absorption rates across different
    tissues. Using wearable dielectric scatterers, they found that electromagnetic
    transmission for a body power system at millimeter-wave frequencies could be improved.
    Interference from the human body has long been one of the obstacles to wireless
    subsystems. In tuned antenna circuits, parasitic capacitance detunes the antenna
    while in RF circuits, the absorption of electromagnetic waves by human tissue
    causes the energy to be attenuated rapidly [165]. Human electrical energy transfer
    systems use the human body as a medium for energy delivery, turning the disadvantage
    of the human body in energy transfer into an advantage, and have significant potential
    for development towards WPTs and WIEDs. However, each coupling method has its
    own drawbacks: current coupling has a short power supply distance and complex
    equipment; magnetic resonance coupling has strict requirements on the position
    of the transceiver coil; and the efficiency of capacitive coupling is closely
    related to the movement and physical state of the human body. Moreover, the transmission
    efficiency of the human-body energy-transfer system can still be increased by
    improving the performance of the transceiver, establishing an accurate channel
    model, and strengthening related theoretical research. 4. Conclusion This paper
    reviews different power supply technologies for wearable/implantable electronic
    devices, major advances in those devices and their future prospects. Starting
    with self-powered and externally powered solutions, this paper systematically
    presents and analyzes the classic nodes and recent research results in the development
    of power supply solutions in a specific way and discusses the advantages of the
    different technologies in self-powered and externally powered solutions, as well
    as their most suitable application scenarios. As power supply technologies for
    wearable/implantable electronic devices move from basic research to mature applications,
    several key issues need to be urgently addressed. Although the overall performances
    of various power supply technologies have improved, those performances are still
    not sufficient to meet the requirements of commercial applications, so improving
    the efficiency of power transmission is crucial for the development of wearable/implantable
    electronic devices; in addition, the impact of the power supply process on the
    human body and the constraints imposed by human tissues on the powered devices
    need to be reduced. Taking far-field wireless transmission as an example, the
    power supply process will couple a large number of electromagnetic waves into
    electronic devices close to the human body; thus, ensuring higher performance
    while reducing the impact of the electromagnetic and thermal radiation generated
    by the devices on the human body is crucial. The physical activity of the human
    body will stretch and bend the power supply equipment, and the movement and posture
    of the human body will affect the performance of some power supply technologies.
    Therefore, overcoming the negative role of the human body in the power supply
    process is one of the most important research directions to improve output performance.
    Finally, the system structure must be optimized. Matched power management modules
    and low path loss can maximize the transfer of generated power to portable devices,
    and optimizing the system structure is expected to improve the overall efficiency
    of the system. Both self-powered and external power transmission technologies
    need to address how to transfer efficiently electrical energy to wearable/implantable
    electronic devices. Both technologies are at the front end of the energy delivery
    system, and an urgent need exists for a new energy delivery channel to transfer
    energy from the vicinity of the human body to the wearable/implantable electronic
    devices without the need for additional metallic transmission lines to deliver
    electricity. Notably, the combination of self-powered technology and external
    power transmission technology with the human body''s electric power transmission
    system can provide a new solution for the power supply technology of wearable/implantable
    electronic devices and greatly promote the development process of those devices.
    The development of an innovative power supply system can greatly improve the use
    scenarios and the working performance of wearable/implantable electronic devices,
    and such a power supply solution should open the door to a new era of user experience
    in various fields. Funding This research was funded by the Mindu Innovation Laboratory

  description: Increasing the spatial and temporal density of data using networked

    and cost savings in a host of industries. Where applications involve large outdoor
    expanses, such as farming, oil and gas, or defense, large regions of unelectrified
    land could yield significant benefits if instrumented with a high density of IoT
    systems. The major limitation of expanding IoT networks in such applications stems
    from the challenge of delivering power to each sensing device. Batteries, generators,
    and renewable sources have predominately been used to address the challenge, but
    these solutions require constant maintenance or are sensitive to environmental
    factors. This work presents a novel approach where conduction currents through
    soil are utilized for the wireless powering of sensor networks, initial investigation
    is within an 0.8-ha (2-acre) area. The technique is not line-of-sight, powers
    all devices simultaneously through near-field mechanics, and has the ability to
    be minimally invasive to the working environment. A theory of operation is presented
    and the technique is experimentally demonstrated in an agricultural setting. Scaling
    and transfer parameters are discussed.

    important to boosting revenue/productivity in many industries. Sensor installation
    throughout the industrial process plays a fundamental role in these tools. The
    number of sensors that can be installed is limited by the following two primary
    factors: 1) the cost (including installation/maintenance) of the sensor; 2) the
    power source used by the sensor. Recent advances in electronics/manufacturing
    have effectively solved many of the sensor cost challenges. However, there are
    few low-maintenance/low-profile solutions to delivering power to a multitude of
    sensor systems. Difficulties in power delivery are only amplified when applications
    require monitoring in remote and expansive outdoor environments. This is specifically
    challenging in industries such as farming, where large tracts of land are usually
    far from any electrical supply. Weather-dependent sources such as photovoltaics
    and wind turbines, or the continual replacement of batteries are the only real
    solution to this problem, all of which do not support Internet of Things (IoT)
    scaling. These conventional power methods can be intrusive to the working environment
    as devices can become entangled in or damaged by equipment/livestock/wildlife.
    Motorized equipment (such as tractors) must maneuver around solar and wind charging
    solutions, and as crops, trees, or vegetation mature, they may become completely
    overshadowed and/or entwined. Thus, contemporary power solutions make the installation
    of sensing tools time consuming, costly, and in many cases, impractical as the
    number of sensors are increased. These electric power supply limitations have
    led to wireless power transfer (WPT) research that encompasses both near-field
    and far-field techniques. RF energy harvesting [1] or robotic drones [2], [3]
    have both been developed for transferring electric power to soil sensors [4],
    [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. RF energy harvesting requires the rectification
    of space-wave signals that do not penetrate far beneath the soil surface and require
    a substantial time to collect enough energy to perform a function. Drones, either
    land- or air- based, are generally equipped with a magnetic coupling WPT system
    that transfers energy to sensors when the drone is positioned directly over the
    sensor''s receiver. A drone solution adds navigation complexities, high-power
    consumption for locomotion, high operating/maintenance expenses, and limited spatial
    coverage unless multiple drones are used—compounding all factors. Neither of these
    solutions supports wide area IoT scaling, with both suffering from efficiency
    losses when sensors are buried below 15 cm—as bulk soil is conductive, causing
    high attenuation of an electromagnetic (EM) wave''s magnetic component at the
    frequencies used. Long range forms of WPT (LR-WPT) have also been investigated.
    These rely on the transmission of focused EM space-waves. In this category, the
    following are the two predominant LR-WPT technologies in use: 1) laser power beaming;
    2) RF microwave power transfer (MPT) [11], [12], [13], [14]. Both techniques use
    far-field EM waves to transfer power. Literature has shown that MPT is more reliable
    for transmission between fixed installations [11]. Zhu [12] gave a side-by-side
    summary of present MPT endeavors. These systems either exhibit very low efficiency
    or have short transmission distances [14], [15]. While some companies are commercializing
    laser power beaming and MPT-based systems, they are in the very early stages of
    development with limited prototypes demonstrated [16], [17]. All such systems
    are line-of-sight dependent and require large, complex rectenna arrays to lower
    the power density during transmission to improve safety (as the wavelengths used
    are typically limited to 1 W or lower exposure limits). Neither of these LR-WPT
    systems would make good candidates for powering expansive IoT networks. More obscure
    in present literature is the nonline-of-sight approaches where energy is transferred
    along the surface of the Earth with a ground wave [18], [19]. Viziv Technologies
    is a company that claims to be working on ground-wave propagation for power transfer
    [20], [21]. These systems utilize tall above-ground antenna structures to induce
    charge oscillations at the surface. To date, no physically realized experiments
    have been publicly demonstrated by Viziv and based on the data presented in the
    limited literature, the given distributed electric field (E-field) intensities
    are much too weak for long-range wireless power transfer [20]. It can be concluded
    that there currently exists no other techniques beyond line-of-sight far-field
    radiation that has demonstrated LR-WPT. This manuscript presents a first of its
    kind WPT concept that utilizes conduction currents “through the soil” (TTS) to
    transfer power to surrounding devices. The presented system is not line of sight
    dependent and is observed to be robust in the limited locations tested [22]. The
    geometry of the TTS system is similar to a water well, offering a possible way
    to integrate this LR-WPT technique into existing farming infrastructure at very
    little cost to the user. The theory of operation will be expanded from earlier
    studies by the authors. A horizontal receiver geometry will be presented and an
    agricultural case-study using four IoT devices without batteries will be shown
    as proof of concept. A section on range and efficiency will explore possible methods
    for future improvements to the system. SECTION II. Theory and Derivations This
    section presents methods used to investigate the dynamics of the TTS system. First,
    a lumped circuit model is developed to identify the parameters that affect efficiency.
    Next, a concept based on EM field theory is presented for determining the received
    voltage distribution in the soil as a function of radial distance around the transmitter.
    This same theory also provides an expression for the soil''s impedance, linking
    the source current to the received voltage at a distance. The theory for the potential
    distribution is experimentally verified over 0.8 ha in an adjacent hay field.
    The theory is then combined with the lumped circuit model to arrive at an approximate
    equation for the system''s efficiency with parameters that will serve as metrics
    for future improvements to the system. A. Geometry and Circuit Model The TTS transmitter
    (Tx) utilized a minimum of two conductors (defined as electrodes) in direct contact
    with the soil, where one electrode resided at the soil surface and the other resided
    at a vertical distance below the surface (defined as a vertical geometry). The
    top electrode was formed from a well casing that was installed around the bore-hole
    of the Tx. The well casing was made of low carbon steel that was approximately
    15-m long. The bottom electrode was a 15-m section of brass tubing (50 mm in diameter),
    located 75-m below the surface. The brass tubing was connected to a high density
    poly ethylene (HDPE) tubing of the same diameter that ran from the brass to the
    surface. A 12-gauge insulated wire was fastened to the inside of the brass tubing
    at the bottom, and ran to the surface on the inside of the HDPE. Thus, the wire
    allowed an electrical connection to the bottom electrode from the surface, with
    the wiring being isolated from the surrounding soil via the HDPE tubing. The receiver
    (Rx) for this work was constructed using a horizontal geometry, where both electrodes
    (0.7-m long) resided at the surface. This is shown in Fig. 1 where an annotated
    illustration of the geometry is depicted next to a photograph of the experimental
    system. The horizontal geometry of the Rx was chosen for the ease of deployment
    and measurement. Future investigations will explore vertical topologies for the
    Rx, whose placement will become more permanent. A basic schematic of the system
    and its corresponding circuit is shown in Fig. 2(a) with orange bars indicating
    the electrodes. Fig. 1. (a) Diagram of the Tx topology showing in connection to
    the soil. (b) Annotated photograph of the Tx. (c) Diagram of the Rx topology in
    connection to the soil. (d) Photograph of the Rx with electrodes marked with flags.
    Show All Fig. 2. Coupled circuit model for TTS system. Show All Due to soil strata
    layers being mostly horizontal, currently injected into the ground will follow
    strata layers of lower resistivity and not spread (or fringe) as far within the
    surrounding soil medium [23]. This makes horizontal Tx geometries more prone to
    changes in conductivity due to weather and less effective at transmitting energy
    over the surrounding area. A vertical Tx structure exhibits greater current fringing
    since moving charge must traverse all strata layers (regardless of their variations
    in conductivity). The vertical geometry is therefore a better design choice for
    the Tx. For the Rx, the only geometric constraint is that its electrodes must
    reside at different equipotential lines created by the Tx in order for a voltage
    to be received. The energy exchange between the Tx and Rx was modeled as a pair
    of coupled circuits [Fig. 2(b)]. This model is only slightly different from the
    current controlled voltage-source model presented in [24]. The difference between
    the two models is that the coupled circuit allows impedance variations at the
    Rx to be seen by the Tx, which is expected to occur once the resistive components
    of Z TX and Z RX are made small. The transfer efficiency ( η ) of the system can
    be approximated using this model. Applying loop analysis produces two circuit
    equations − V S + Z Tx I S −j( u e ) I R =0 −j( u e ) I S + Z Rx I R + R L I R
    =0. (1) (2) View Source The direction of the coupling is chosen such that current
    flowing in the received circuit will reduce the reactive component in the supply
    circuit—similar to a transformer. The received voltage ( V R ) takes the form
    V R =j u e I s =Φ(r) (3) View Source where u e is a lumped “Earth impedance” that
    is dependent on the distance ( r ) from the Tx. The potential difference in the
    soil, ( Φ(r) ), is derived in the next subsection. Using (1) and (2), the source
    current ( I S ) and received current ( I R ) are solved for yielding: I S I R
    = ( R L + Z Rx ) V S Z Tx ( R L + Z Rx )+( u e ) 2 = j( u e ) V S Z Tx ( R L +
    Z Rx )+( u e ) 2 . (4) (5) View Source Equation (5) will be used in the next section
    to validate the model. The input power ( P IN ) and load power ( P L ) are P IN
    P L = V S I S = ( R L + Z Rx )( V S ) 2 Z Tx ( R L + Z Rx )+( u e ) 2 = R L (
    I R ) 2 = ( u e ) 2 ( V S ) 2 R L ( Z Tx ( R L + Z Rx )+( u e ) 2 ) 2 . (6) (7)
    View Source Dividing (7) by (6) gives the power transfer efficiency ( η ) η= P
    L P IN = R L u 2 e ( Z Tx ( Z Rx + R L )+( u e ) 2 )( R L + Z Rx ) . (8) View
    Source B. Deriving the Potential Distribution To determine u e , the voltage distribution
    around the Tx must be derived with respect to the radial distance r . The complex
    network of resistances, capacitances, and inductances that would be needed to
    model the soil are difficult to approximate and challenging to measure. Fortunately,
    the Tx geometry is similar to, and can be approximated as, an electric dipole.
    By solving for the E-field of this dipole (modeling the medium as a lossy dielectric),
    it should be possible to integrate the E-field radially to find the potential
    distribution along the ground. The usefulness of the dipole approximation is that
    it links source current injected into the Tx to the voltage distribution, mitigating
    the need of developing a complex impedance model of the soil. Referring to Fig.
    3 for the time-varying electric dipole approximation, the perceived separation
    distance ( d ) of the point charges is first modified from a conventional dipole
    to be the circumference of a toroidal path the current would traverse. ( d ) becomes
    d=2πa (9) View Source where a is the physical separation distance between the
    electrodes in the soil as shown in Fig. 3. Taking the vector potential ( A → )
    expressed in the frequency domain, the magnetic field intensity is A → zs H →

    1 r 2 ][ u → φ ] (10) View Source where I S is the source current driving the
    Tx, β is the phase constant, r → is the distance vector from the center of the
    electrodes to the point where the field is being measured, and [ u → φ ] is the
    unit vector in the φ -direction. The E-field is found by applying Ampere''s law
    ∇× H → =ε ∂ E → ∂t + J → =(σ+jωε) E → (11) View Source where ( σ ) is the soil
    conductivity and ω is the angular frequency. Solving (11) for E → yields the E-field
    intensity as a function of the radial distance r E → = 2 I S d 4π(σ+jωε) cosθ[
    jβ r 2 + 1 r 3 ] e −j(βr) [ u → r ] + I S d 4π(σ+jωε) sinθ[ β 2 r − jβ r 2 + 1
    r 3 ] e −j(βr) [ u → θ ]. (12) View Source Fig. 3. Dipole approximation used for
    deriving the potential distribution around the TTS transmitter. Point P corresponds
    to the measurement location. Show All The field distribution of (12) has the following
    three main operational regions [25]: 1) the static region proportional to 1/ r
    3 ; 2) the induction region proportional to 1/ r 2 ; 3) the far region (or radiation
    region) proportional to 1/r . Both the static and induction regions are related
    to the near-field of the electric dipole. In practice, it is the voltage produced
    within the soil that can be directly measured. The potential difference ( Φ )
    is given by Φ=−∫ E → ⋅ dl → (13) View Source where dl → =dr[ u → r ]+rdθ[ u →
    θ ]+rsinθdφ[ u → φ ] . The integral of the dot product produces Φ(r)= I S d(σ−jωε)
    4π( σ 2 + (ωε) 2 ) cosθ[ 2 e −j(βr) r 2 + β 2 e −j(βr) − β 2 Ei(−jβr)]. (14) View
    Source The exponential integral Ei(−jβr) can be expanded using integration by
    parts Ei(x)=− e −x x − e −x x 2 −2∫ e −x x 3 dx…. (15) View Source Since r 3 was
    the highest order term in (12), it is expected that the contributing potential
    should have a maximum order of r 2 due to integration; taking note that the integration
    reduces the order such that the radiation region of the potential becomes a constant,
    the induction region becomes 1/r , and the static region becomes 1/ r 2 . All
    higher-order terms beyond the second order can be neglected. Substituting (15)
    into (14) and rearranging gives Φ(r)= I S dcosθ 4π( σ 2 + (ωε) 2 ) e −j(βr) [(σ
    β 2 + ωεβ r + σ r 2 ) +j(−ωε β 2 − σβ r − ωε r 2 )]. (16) View Source In (16),
    the terms σ β 2 and −ωε β 2 are related to the radiation region and are negligible
    at near-field distances. Similarly, e −j(βr) is approximately 1. Equation (16)
    can be rewritten as Φ(r)= I S dcosθ 4π( σ 2 + (ωε) 2 ) [( ωεβ r + σ r 2 ) −j(
    σβ r + ωε r 2 )]. (17) View Source In order for the soil to appear like a conductor,
    the Tx should be driven within the super low frequency (SLF) to very low frequency
    (VLF) frequency band (30 Hz to 30 kHz). In this frequency range, ωε becomes small,
    making (17) more a function of soil conductivity Φ(r)∝( 1 σ r 2 −j β σr ). (18)
    View Source The real term in (18) is extraneous since conductivity in the static
    region ( 1/ r 2 ) is significantly dependent on temporal charge relaxations [26],
    not spatial distribution. We can therefore neglect the real component of (17),
    taking only the imaginary Im{Φ(r)}= Φ(r)= Im ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ I S dcosθ 4π( σ 2 + (ωε)
    2 ) [( ωεβ r + σ r 2 ) −j( σβ r + ωε r 2 ) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎫ ⎭ ⎬ ⎪ ⎪ − I S d 4π( σ 2 + (ωε)
    2 ) ( σβ (r) + ωε (r ) 2 ). (19) View Source Equation (19) allows one to calculate
    the approximate voltage radially from the Tx. It should be noted that the E-field
    is polarized in the u → θ -direction and thus the cosθ term is typically one.
    Additionally, since the assumption of this derivation is that the soil acts as
    a good conductor, the E-field at the soil/air interface must be vertical due to
    continuity, which again assumes an E-field in the u → θ -direction and a cosθ
    term equal to one. Taking (19) and dividing it by the source current ( I S ) produces
    the equation for u e , that can be inserted into (5) and (8) u e =− d 4π( σ 2
    + (ωε) 2 ) ( σβ r + ωε r 2 ). (20) View Source C. Theoretical and Circuit Validation
    To validate (19), and with it (20), the Tx was driven at various currents ( I
    S ) from 1 to 9 A and radial measurements were taken using steel stakes as the
    Rx electrodes and a Tektronix THS3024 battery powered oscilloscope to quickly
    measure voltages between two points at the soil surface. The potential differences
    were measured every 2.5 m, within a 50-m radius around the Tx. The data were then
    normalized to a 1-m spacing to compare its value with the safety limit of 25 V
    over 1 m [27]. The theoretical response was calculated from (19) using the soil
    Φ parameters given in Table I. Fig. 4 shows the measured and theoretical traces
    plotted side by side. The theory matches the experimental data well, with slight
    variations due to the simplifying assumption that the soil is homogeneous, whereas
    in reality, soil is a heterogeneous medium. The results of Fig. 4 indicate (19)
    can be readily used to predict the potential difference over the area. TABLE I
    Soil Model Parameters Fig. 4. Experimentally measured data (dashed trace), versus
    calculated values using theoretical model (solid trace) for various peak drive
    currents. The orange dash-dot line shows the setup potential safety limit for
    the system. Show All With u e verified, the accuracy of the circuit model in Fig.
    2 was tested. The electrode spacing was fixed at 1 m, and both front and rear
    electrodes were moved together away from the Tx at 1-m intervals (see Fig. inset
    for illustrated layout). This is plotted in Fig. 5(a). Using the measured Tx and
    Rx parameters in Table I, with a drive voltage that produced 6 A in the Tx; the
    short-circuit Rx current was calculated from (5) and plotted in the figure. The
    circuit model approximately follows the experimental data. Next, the effects of
    the Rx electrode spacing were tested. The front electrode was kept stationary
    at 10 m from the Tx while the rear electrode was moved backwards in 1-m intervals.
    Both the measured open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current are plotted in
    Fig. 5(b). The received voltage at the Rx electrodes was found to be the sum of
    the potential between the electrodes, allowing one to utilize (19) to estimate
    the value of received voltage based on the Rx electrode separation at any distance
    away from the Tx. Fig. 5. (a) Plot of the short-circuit Rx current predicted in
    the coupled circuit model versus the measured short-circuit Rx current between
    electrodes spaced 1 m and moved away from the Tx, starting at 10 m and ending
    at 20 m (see inset). (b) Experimental data showing the measured voltage of the
    Rx as the electrode separation is increased compared with what is predicted by
    the theory using (19). Note that the front electrode was placed 10 m from the
    Tx and the rear electrode was moved in 1-m increments away from the Tx. Show All
    From Fig. 5(b), it can be seen that as the electrodes are moved further apart,
    the maximum received power increases. However, the nonlinear distribution of the
    potential decreases with distance (as shown in Fig. 4), putting a limit on the
    received power as the Rx is made significantly long (aka the power does not continue
    to raise indefinitely as the Rx electrode separation is made larger). Long Rx
    geometries are also seldom feasible. For this study the Rx electrodes were kept
    at 3 m, as this gave the minimum received power to operate the sensors while being
    at least a third smaller than the closest tested distance from the Tx (10 m).
    A unique feature of this power transmission technique is that as the injected
    Tx current was raised, the sensors could either support a larger load, or they
    could be moved farther away from the Tx. At 9 A, it was possible to power the
    sensor modules at approximately 20 m from the Tx. D. Simulation With the theoretical
    and circuit model validated, it is important to develop a simulation that matches
    the proper conditions of the TTS system. For this work, Ansys Maxwell was used.
    Future work will utilize this model for investigating better electrode designs,
    whereas the theoretical/circuit model can be used for quick calculations to determine
    Tx drive magnitudes and maximum distance sensors can be placed based on the Rx
    electrode spacing. Fig. 6(a) shows the results from the Ansys simulation for a
    1-A drive current into the Tx. A 1-km, homogeneous cube was modeled as the Earth
    using the same values in Table I. The viewpoint in the figure is top down, depicting
    the E-field at the surface of the cube in the xy-plane and the equipotential regions,
    exemplified with dashed concentric rings. For the Rx to develop a voltage, the
    front and rear Rx electrodes must be located on different equipotential lines.
    Fig. 6. (a) Ansys Maxwell simulation of TTS Tx for a 1-A injection and the accompanying
    E-field distribution over the surface of the Earth. Dashed circles added to highlight
    the equipotential lines. (b) Comparison of the surface potential using the Ansys
    simulation versus the theoretical derivation, versus the experimental measurement
    driving the Tx at 1 A. Show All The simulated values of the E-field were extracted
    from the simulation and integrated with the distance to obtain the surface potential.
    The simulated values of the surface potential were then plotted next to the theoretical
    and experimental values for comparison [Fig. 6(b)]. It can be seen that both the
    Ansys model and the theoretical derivation are all in close approximation to the
    experimental measurements taken in the adjacent agriculture field. SECTION III.
    Power Transfer for IoT Applications A small IoT network of commercial agricultural
    sensors were used to demonstrate the systems ability to wirelessly transfer power
    without batteries or large electric storage elements. Do note that a 1-mF capacitor
    [Fig. 7(b)] was used for dc filtering and did provide energy for the 0.2-W bursts
    the sensor required when transmitting data. The sensors were all powered simultaneously
    within a radius tested between 10 to 20 m around the Tx. Fig. 7. (a) Photograph
    of IoT sensor module showing various components. (b) Schematic of the rectifier
    electronics used to convert the ac conduction currents in the soil to dc, powering
    the sensor module. The module required 3.4 V and 10 mA to operate (60 mA to transmit
    data). Show All The sensor modules are shown in Fig. 7 and include an integrated
    moisture and temperature sensor. The microcontroller ( μ -ctrl) on each module
    is an ATMega32u4 with a LoRa communications IC. Fig. 7(a) is an annotated photograph
    of the sensor module identifying the various components. Fig. 7(b) is a schematic
    that shows the basic rectification electronics used in the module. A full-bridge
    rectifier, connected to the Rx electrodes, converted the conduction currents created
    by the Tx into a dc voltage that was then regulated with a buck/boost converter.
    When the sensors were powered, soil moisture and temperature data were collected
    and transmitted via conventional space waves at 900 MHz, to a receiving ESP32
    at the base station. The ESP32 was only used as a microcontroller, with an attached
    LoRa module to accept the 900-MHz protocol. The ESP32 would then relay the data
    through serial to a computer for storage and postprocessing. Each sensor was waterproofed
    for long-term measurement studies via a box with a rubberized coating. The sensors
    were calibrated prior to their deployment. Fig. 8(a) is a photograph of the experimental
    system''s layout with deployed sensors. Illustrations of the Tx and horizontal
    Rx are inset in the photo for additional clarity. The data were collected for
    1 min each hour, continuously over a seven-day period. Fig. 8(b) is a plot of
    the soil data collected from the four sensors that formed the IoT network. Fig.
    8. (a) Photograph of IoT soil sensor modules deployed around the Tx. The modules
    had no batteries or large electric storage elements. They were powered directly
    from conduction currents transmitted through the soil. (b) Plot of the soil sensor
    data powered continuously for one week during the month of December. Show All
    SECTION IV. Discussion on Improvements in Range and Transfer Efficiency Equations
    (8) and (20) predict that the efficiency of the TTS system is strongly dependent
    on the impedance of the Tx and Rx. Impedance data of the Tx have been collected
    for several years at the Tennessee location, with the first study on the technique
    being conducted in Alberta Canada in 2015 [23]. Fig. 9 is a plot of the impedance
    modulus variations over different seasons, weather types, and locations. In the
    figure, Fair weather is defined as either full or partial sun, the other weather
    descriptors are self-explanatory. It can be seen that the impedance of the Tx
    has a low-Z region and a high-Z region. The high-Z corresponds to a cross-over
    point where the soil begins to function more like a dielectric. The peaks in this
    region are a parallel resonance that occurs with the Tx wiring and is observed
    to have very little energy output into the surrounding media. The high-Z region
    also fluctuates significantly with weather. The low-Z region not only exhibits
    the lowest Tx impedance, its fluctuation is between 30–50 Ω and is fairly consistent—even
    between locations that are 4800-km apart. It is important to note that both the
    US and Canadian locations were conducted on crop growing land—the soil thus had
    a high ion content making it better for plant growth, and consequently more electrically
    conductive. The data show that the system, while dependent on soil parameters,
    is quite robust in the SLF to VLF frequency band. The data also indicate a tendency
    for the system impedance to be lower in more conductive soils with higher moisture,
    ion, or salinity content. This can be seen in Fig. 9, when the soil moisture is
    higher, the Tx impedance tends to reduce–noting that snow in Tennessee is nearly
    always proceeded by rain, so soils are generally highly water saturated by the
    time snow fall occurs. The system is therefore expected to work better in locations
    of higher ion content (which is nearly all farming environments) and have lessened
    performance in drier soils. Fig. 9. Long-term impedance measurements over several
    months, weather conditions, and two different geographical locations. Variations
    from weather in the low-Z region are significantly less than in the high-Z region.
    Show All Improving the efficiency of the system hinges on reducing the Z Tx and
    Z Rx . It was important to investigate the feasibility of altering the impedance
    values of at least the Tx. Literature indicates that the resistance of a soil-grounded
    electrical system can be significantly improved by adding multiple grounding rods
    [28], [29]. With this in mind, an experiment was conducted where the Tx impedance
    was measured using only the top electrode (well casing) [plotted in Fig. 10(a)]
    as the red (circle) trace entitled “no gnd rods.” The well casing in the inset
    illustration was also made red to match the data. The blue (triangle) trace was
    obtained by installing six 3-m long grounding rods within a 3-m radius around
    the casing such that all six rods and the casing formed the surface electrode.
    This new addition was made blue in the inset illustration to match the presented
    data. The simple addition of the grounding rods successfully reduced the Tx impedance
    as shown in the blue (triangle) trace of the figure. Fig. 10. (a) Measured Tx
    impedance using only the well casing (i.e., no ground rods) versus having a surface
    electrode composed of six grounding rods and the well casing. (b) Plots of the
    complex impedance with and without grounding rods. At higher frequencies, the
    inductive component of the Tx is more prevalent, having a peak inductance occuring
    at 10 kHz. Show All The power required to operate four sensor modules was 0.8
    W (when transmitting data on 900 MHz). The Z Rx was measured at 250 Ω for the
    3-m section between the Rx electrodes. Prior to installing the ground rods, it
    required a peak input power of 500 W at 60 Hz to operate the sensor network at
    a distance of 10 m from the Tx. Note that this is the total system input power
    measured from the solar battery bank into the inverter that supplied power to
    the Tx. After adding the grounding rods, the same power delivery of 0.8 W was
    achieved using a 250-W peak, a two-fold improvement in efficiency with an addition
    of only six extra low-cost grounding rods. Experiments are underway to determine
    how low the Tx impedance can be made before the bottom electrode would need modification.
    In its present state, the TTS system is ideally suited for low-power IoT applications
    with relatively infrequent measurements (such as agriculture). In the experiment,
    the field was energized for 1 min every hour and shutdown for the remaining 59
    min, leading to an average power of only one sixtieth of the peak power or 250
    60 =4 W. The benefits of instrumenting a field and expending tens of watts on
    average to know the locations of where to water, fertilize, or spray pesticides
    can make a significant impact on cost savings and the environment. Using renewable
    sources to power the TTS system also reduces the long-term cost of electricity.
    The operation of sensor modules at drive frequencies higher than 60 Hz is currently
    limited by our drive electronics. However, the low-Z frequency spectrum of the
    Tx can give insight into such operations. Fig. 10(b) shows that as the frequency
    increases, the Tx begins to function more like an inductor and less like a resistor;
    with a maximum inductance occurring at 10 kHz. The addition of the grounding rods
    appeared to only affect the Tx resistance, not the reactance. This is important
    since an inductive Tx would not dissipate but store energy in its magnetic field
    every half cycle, allowing for resonant circuits to be utilized for possible range/efficiency
    improvements. The theoretical model also predicts improved efficiency at higher
    drive frequencies. Using (8), the theoretically calculated transfer efficiency
    for a single sensor module, as a function of distance ( r ), is plotted in Fig.
    11(a). The plot shows the response of reducing Z Tx impedances at three different
    operating frequencies. Here, Z Rx and R L were kept the same as the experimental
    data (250 Ω and 56 Ω , respectively). While these theoretical plots of efficiency
    look promising, we are still in the process of validating Fig. 11(a), and will
    communicate such validations in future work. The full system efficiency for the
    proof-of-concept system, while presently low, are similar to values reported for
    MPT and laser-based technologies. Yet unlike MPT/Lasers, the TTS system is not
    line-of-sight dependent and does not require the use of complex/expensive receivers.
    Moreover, the efficiency of the TTS system can be improved by lowering the impedance
    of the Tx and Rx, which is quite achievable via inexpensive grounding rods. An
    MPT/Laser system is instead limited by optical-electric conversion processes and
    beam directionality which has constraints both on safety and complexity/cost of
    the array. Fig. 11. (a) Calculation of efficiency versus range using (8), where
    u e is calculated from (20), as Z Tx is reduced from 30 to 0.5Ω . The highlighted
    areas indicate different operating frequencies. (b) Estimated drive current of
    200 A at 60 Hz using (19), needed to power sensor modules over a 40-ha (100-acre)
    area. Rx electrode separation is 3 m to receive 3.67nbsp;V. Show All Furthermore,
    there does not seem to be a limitation on the TTS transfer range according to
    the derived theory. Taking (19), a drive current of 200 A at 60 Hz is predicted
    to enable power transfer over 40 ha (100 acres) to sensors with a 3-m Rx electrode
    separation (11). 40 ha is the approximate average farm size in the United States
    using statistical data from [30]. Close to the Tx, the step potential safety limit
    exceeds 25 V between 1 m. A 40-m radius around the Tx would need to be restricted
    from access during operation. Beyond 40 m, the step potential is low enough to
    walk freely. It is possible that the system may cause environmental effects/impacts.
    However, there has been no negative effects yet observed in the flora or fauna
    during the course of these studies. Some literature has shown that currents through
    soil can be beneficial to the growth of plants [31]. It was also discovered that
    telluric currents generated from a substation 0.8 km away can be observed at the
    Tx [24]. Measured data show the Tx receives approximately 5.6 V Peak from the
    substation. For a voltage of this magnitude to be measured at the Tx, it can be
    inferred from theoretical models that the magnitude seen at the substation must
    be quite large. Since this is an unintentional byproduct of a substation with
    flourishing trees and vegetation, it can be deduced that the effects on the environment
    are minimal. Moreover, if a substation can produce effects at such a distance
    unintended—the possibility of a designed TTS system achieving the same or better
    level of performance is encouraging. SECTION V. Conclusion In this article, a
    new LR-WPT technique was presented that utilizes conduction currents through soil
    to transmit power to sensing devices. A proof-of-concept prototype was constructed
    that successfully demonstrated power transfer to a small agricultural IoT network
    within a 20-m radius. The energy transfer is not line-of-sight and simultaneously
    powers all sensors in the area; making it an ideal tool for agricultural IoT networks.
    A major benefit of the presented system is that each sensor module does not need
    an individual battery. Instead, batteries can be placed at a central location
    and the energy distributed radially around that location without wires. This work
    has provided theory, simulation, scaling, and transfer parameters that quantify
    the operation of the TTS system. The power transfer range was found to be dependent
    on the injected Tx current while the efficiency was found to be dependent on the
    Tx and Rx bulk impedance. Increasing drive current while developing methods to
    lower the Tx/Rx impedance has the exciting potential to wirelessly power devices
    over great distances. This would revolutionize farm management and transform energy
    security as higher efficiency and power transfer is achieved. Future work will
    focus on the development of TTS communications in tandem with power, methods to
    reduce Tx impedance, and investigations into the effects of frequency and waveform
    shapes on the power transmission. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    a multi-UAV environment, to form a light-weight message verification scheme to
    confirm the identity of the transmitting node. First, five venues having the potential
    to hide data are analyzed. Based on the analysis of bit error rate obtained from
    the simulated multi-UAV environment, both cyclic prefix and padding bits are selected.
    Next, a codeword is generated for each transmission and it is embedded along with
    the unique ID key, κ of the transmitting node into each venue respectively, and
    the output is transmitted as Hello packets. Subsequently, the receiving node extracts
    and decodes the codeword in order to verify the authenticity of the transmitting
    node. An evaluation of the proposed scheme has been conducted by using a simulated
    UAV environment. In the best case scenario, the proposed authentication scheme
    can achieve a successful verification rate of at least 80% at a maximum hop-count
    of 10 hops. Through computational cost analysis, in comparison to the conventional
    methods, the proposed scheme was found to have a significantly lower total execution
    time of 1.7μs. In addition, the security analysis shows that when the proposed
    scheme is paired with physical unclonable functions (PUFs), it is able to resist
    common security attacks, including man-in-the-middle, replay and cloning attacks.

    The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for military as well as civilian applications
    such as search and rescue operations, disaster management, parcel delivery and

    is the increasing concern for wireless communication security within the network.
    Unfortunately, the nodes that comprise these networks are extremely constrained

    verification rate of at least 80% at a maximum hop-count of 10 hops. Through computational
    cost analysis, in comparison to the conventional methods, the proposed scheme
    was found to have a significantly lower total execution time of \\(1.7\\mu s\\).
    In addition, the security analysis shows that when the proposed scheme is paired
    with physical unclonable functions (PUFs), it is able to resist common security
    attacks, including man-in-the-middle, replay and cloning attacks. Similar content

    Routing Protocol in Fanets Article 07 May 2021 1 Introduction UAVs can now be
    deployed for a multitude of applications, including search and rescue operations
    [48, 53], disaster management [15], wind estimation [44], agriculture monitoring
    [13], covering blind spot area for wireless network communication [27], border
    surveillance [4], delivery of goods [10], and cinematography [30] to name a few.
    The UAV network typically operates using the instructions from a base station
    located on the ground. The nodes can also communicate with each other in a decentralised
    and ad hoc manner, giving it the term flying ad hoc network (FANET) [21, 35].
    However, one of the most significant barriers to the widespread adoption of UAVs
    is the increasing concern for wireless communication security within the network.
    As FANETs mainly operate out in the field, they are extremely prone to a wide
    range of security threats. Specifically, the air-to-ground links in the network
    make the confidential messages transmitted by a UAV vulnerable to interception,
    modification, and fabrication by adversaries on the ground. In some cases, unauthorized
    users might even be able to feed false information into the UAV nodes in the hope
    of hijacking or destroying them. Tsao et al. [47] has detailed a taxonomy of FANET
    security threats based on threat vectors and the OSI layers. At the Physical layer
    (PHY), FANETs are primarily vulnerable to Eavesdropping [62], GPS Spoofing [46]
    and Jamming [9]. Therefore, addressing these physical layer challenges is essential
    for reliable and secure UAV communication. In order to prevent the aforementioned
    attacks, the verification of received messages by the UAV nodes is of utmost importance.
    While there are existing security strategies that employ encryption technology
    [3, 22, 49, 58], these encryption algorithms usually require high computational
    power and storage space to carry out the calculations. Unfortunately, the UAV
    nodes that comprise these networks are highly constrained in terms of storage
    space, processing power and battery life, restricting the implementation of such
    complex security protocols. This has lead to a renewed interest in the use of
    data hiding and covert communication methods [11, 12, 31] that typically take
    up less computational power as well as storage space and therefore, align with
    the UAV nodes’ capabilities. Nonetheless, the prevailing research direction in
    the aforementioned studies has centered on concealing the entire transmission
    rather than using data hiding to establish verification prior to transmission.
    In this work, we aim to address this gap and explore data hiding as a lightweight
    alternative to verify the identity of the sender of a message to prevent adversaries
    from feeding false information/instructions to the UAV nodes. This paper involves
    the development of a novel message verification scheme through the joint utilization
    of multiple data hiding venues to ensure the integrity of the packets transmitted
    within the network. An evaluation of the proposed scheme along with a security
    and computational cost analysis are presented in this paper. Our work makes the
    following contributions: (a) evaluate the performance of multiple known data hiding
    venues under the multi-UAV network environment and; (b) propose a novel light-weight
    message verification scheme utilizing two selected data hiding venues. The rest
    of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly reviews the basics of
    UAV network and summarizes existing work on the use of data hiding/covert channels
    in various network environments, including the UAV networks. Section 3 details
    the analysis of known data hiding methods under the FANET setting, along with
    the proposed message verification scheme. Section 3.3 describes the system model
    and the adopted assumptions of the simulated multi-UAV environment. Section 4
    presents the results to confirm the analysis of the proposed method and finally,
    Section 5 concludes the paper and shares potential future directions. 2 Related
    works This section presents recent work in data hiding/covert channels designed
    for various network environments. Subsequently, some technical background of UAV
    network which is related to our proposed method has also been included. 2.1 Network-based
    data hiding methods Covert channels in adhoc networks are typically achieved by
    exploiting one of the following: (a) storage, and (b) timing channels. In storage
    channels, the sender embeds selected bits into the unused fields or other storage
    locations to transmit the secret data [1, 32, 55]. On the other hand, in timing
    channels, the sender manipulates time delays or the order in which the packets
    are sent to convey the secret information [8, 56, 57]. While the aforementioned
    methods are venue-oriented where the authors explore new locations and methods
    to transmit secret bits, another way to secure communications in a FANET is by
    hiding the very existence of the transmission itself. Researchers are now looking
    into ways to optimize the physical layer parameters of a transmission to ensure
    that it stays hidden from potential adversaries. Some examples of such works are
    [19, 40, 51] and [5], where the authors have manipulated the fundamental limits
    of wireless transmissions from a legitimate transmitter Alice to an authorized
    receiver Bob to conceal the existence of any covert transmission from a warden
    Willie, who is actively trying to detect the presence of this covert transmission.
    Some recent works addressed the physical layer security issues in the context
    of UAV networks or the possibility of enhancing the physical layer security by
    UAVs. In general, the security performance of UAV networks can be improved by
    adjusting the UAV’s flight trajectory and transmission power to simultaneously
    increase the channel quality of legitimate links and degrade the channel quality
    of eavesdropping links [34, 59]. In other cases, the height of the UAV is optimized
    to hide the presence of the UAV itself, hence shielding its transmissions [52].
    Other works that explore physical layer security in the context of UAV communications
    include the optimization of rate and power of the transmitting UAV nodes to conceal
    transmissions [31] and the use of a UAV-jammer to enhance physical layer security
    by considering secrecy outage probability and jamming coverage [60, 61]. In addition,
    there is a multitude of content-based data hiding schemes targeting the application
    layer of UAVs. These schemes manipulate Video Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR)
    data and remote sensing imaging for data hiding [24,25,26]. 2.2 Existing authentication
    schemes for FANETs While research focusing on authentication/verification of FANET
    communications is a relatively new area, there are some recent works addressing
    this issue. Specifically, Wazid et al. [49] proposed a lightweight authentication
    scheme for an Internet of Drones environment that utilizes one-way cryptographic
    hash functions and bitwise XOR operations. Alladi et al. [3] presented a two-stage
    mutual authentication protocol for SDN-based multi UAV networks to be deployed
    in surveillance areas. Zhang et al. [58] proposed a compact authentication and
    key agreement scheme that involves a one-way secure hash function where UAVs and
    users mutually authenticate each other. Similarly, Hussain et al. [20] suggested
    a three-factor authentication scheme. Khalid et al. [22] utilize an AES-RSA algorithm
    to provide key management, verification, and signature generation that speeds
    up drone authentication. Although these schemes are energy-efficient and lightweight
    in comparison to typical cryptographic schemes, they still deal with certain bit-sensitive
    operations such as hashing. In a network environment such as FANET, which is characterized
    by the rapid mobility of nodes and frequent changes in topology, it is advisable
    to consider methods that are capable of accommodating a certain level of bit errors.
    Furthermore, there is room for improving computational efficiency to effectively
    address the constraints experienced by the FANET nodes. Therefore, this paper
    proposes a method that can reliably safeguard the integrity of FANET transmissions
    while keeping the execution times low. 3 Proposed method This section first details
    the simulation set up of the FANET framework that was used to carry out all experiments
    in this paper. The rest of the section analyzes the conventional data hiding methods
    that can be applied to the physical layer of a FANET environment. Specifically,
    the bit error rate is analyzed to justify the use of certain embedding venues
    for the proposed scheme. Subsequently, the proposed data hiding method based message
    verification scheme is detailed. 3.1 Problem formulation Designing a robust method
    for verification based on data hiding in the unique context of Flying Ad-Hoc Networks
    (FANETs) requires a meticulous consideration of the suitable embedding venues
    within the physical layer. The decision-making process for selecting these venues
    is informed by a simulated evaluation under the constructed FANET framework, incorporating
    critical simulation parameters outlined in Tables 1, 2 and 3, which reflect the
    dynamic nature of the network due to rapid node movement and frequent topology
    changes. It is noteworthy the FANET nodes face constraints in terms of storage
    space, processing power, and battery life. These inherent constraints render FANET
    vulnerable from both the security and computational perspectives. In response,
    researchers have predominantly explored low-level data hiding methods residing
    in the physical layer of the network model. This strategic emphasis on lightweight
    protocols, as opposed to high-level security services, aligns with the efficiency
    requirements of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) nodes in FANETs. Given this context,
    the focus of this research narrows down to embedding venues exclusively within
    the physical layer. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of these embedding
    venues to discern the most optimal choices for the formulation of a robust message-verification
    scheme.” Table 1 Abbreviations Full size table Table 2 Simulaton parameters Full
    size table 3.2 Preliminaries Existing network based data hiding strategies mainly
    focus on the network and physical layers of the OSI model which is a standard
    network model that can be applied to almost all types of networks although it
    does not exist intrinsically in functional systems.The purpose of the model is
    to break down complex networks into different parts according to their operations
    so that they can be understood better. The network layer acts as the delivery
    system and ensures the correct delivery and receipts of network packets. The data
    to be hidden is embedded into headers and trailers that usually carry routing
    and error control information [2, 6]. The physical layer of the FANET mainly deals
    with primary signal transmission operations such as modulation and signal encoding.
    The data is essentially represented as waveforms by altering the frequency, amplitude
    and phase of the signal. The overall function of the physical layer is to modulate
    the data to be transmitted into sinusoidal waveforms and transmit the output through
    the air with the aid of an antenna. Table 3 IEEE 802.11p parameters Full size
    table Fig. 1 Physical layer protocol data unit format - reproduced from [50] Full
    size image The data is typically transmitted in protocol data units (PDUs). To
    facilitate the presentation, the format of the PDU in the physical layer is shown
    in Fig. 1. It consists of three parts, namely, Preamble, PLCP (Physical layer
    convergence protocol) header and Data field. Over the years, many venues have
    been discovered for embedding secret data in the physical layer by Handel and
    Sanford [18], WiPad [42], Gianvecchio and Sellke [16, 38] and K. Lee et al. [28].
    Some of these venues include the SERVICE and TAIL fields, padding bits, cyclic
    prefix and the inter-packet gap (IPG). Our literature review suggests that methods
    designed to operate in the physical layer are becoming increasingly popular [40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61].
    The physical layer often offers venues for data hiding that are generally ignored
    or discarded before the delivery of packets to the higher layers of the network
    stack. Therefore, these venues are deemed more secure, in comparison to those
    at the network layer. Furthermore, in dynamic networks such as UAV networks, most
    network layer methods, especially the ones that involve timing relations, are
    extremely difficult to implement due to fast node movement and frequent topology
    changes. Thus, it is concluded that this research will focus mainly on data hiding
    methods designed to operate in the physical layer of the OSI network model. Five
    data hiding venues are analysed under the FANET setting in this paper and the
    findings are detailed in Section 3. 3.3 Simulation setup The simulation of a FANET
    framework is conducted on Matlab (Ver. R2018b), where the VANET-Simulation-in-MATLAB
    package downloaded from [14] is modified according to the FANET parameters with
    reference to  [7]. The parameter values The chosen routing protocol was Ad Hoc
    On Demand vector routing, which is a position-based routing protocol. Here, each
    node is aware of the position information of all other nodes, and establishes
    the next forwarding node using the position information. Therefore, each node
    is required to be equipped with precise GPS devices and each node stores a routing
    table, which contains a single record for each destination. Possible communication
    paths between two nodes are only formed when there is a need for a connection
    to be established. Therefore, this routing protocol is preferred for high speed
    and dynamic networks [39]. 3.4 Analysis of existing data hiding methods in the
    FANET setting The first step to designing a method for verification based on data
    hiding method is to decide which embedding venues are well suited for realizing
    data hiding in the FANET setting. In order to make this decision, several shortlisted
    venues are simulated to insert data under the constructed FANET framework, with
    the simulation parameters shown in Table 3. Here, the parameter for FANET is included
    to represent the dynamic nature of the network caused by rapid node movement and
    frequent topology changes. It is important to note that the nodes that comprise
    a FANET are constrained in terms of storage space, processing power and battery
    life. Therefore, FANET is vulnerable in terms of both security and computational
    capabilities. Due to this reason, researchers have been primarily exploring low-level
    data hiding methods that reside in the physical layer of the network model to
    design lightweight protocols instead of high-level security services that might
    not be sufficiently efficient for UAV nodes. Following this, this work will only
    consider hiding venues that exist exclusively in the physical layer. Specifically,
    the following venues are analyzed: 1. Rate Field - A header field in the physical
    layer convergence protocol (PLCP)  [45]; 2. Cyclic Prefix - Added during frequency
    multiplexing (i.e., OFDM) in order to prevent inter-symbol interference [17];
    3. Inter-packet Gap - The gap between two consecutive packets [28]; 4. On/off
    timing channel - Presence and absence of packets in a predetermined time period
    [54], and; 5. OFDM padding - Unused sub-carrier locations [42]. Fig. 2 Comparison
    of BER of transmitted codeword for different embedding venues for different number
    of hops Full size image The graph of bit error rate (BER) vs number of hops is
    shown in Fig. 2. Results suggest that the venues that yield the lowest bit error
    rate in the FANET setting under different number of hops are inter-packet gap
    and cyclic prefix, while the on/off timing channel yielded the highest BER. There
    is some overlap in results for all venues at lower hop-counts. However, when the
    hop-count increases, CP, IPG and padding bits perform better in comparison to
    the on/off timing channel. This could be attributed to the fact that the on/off
    timing channel requires a larger number of data frames to be transmitted for a
    single message verification, and hence, is subjected to higher rates of packet
    delay/drop as the hop-count increases, which could be, in turn, due to topology
    changes. The capacity (defined as the number of bits that can be embedded per
    data frame) is listed in Table 4. The most capacious venue was found to be OFDM
    padding while the least capacious venue was the on/off timing channel. Based on
    both the BER analysis and capacity information, cyclic prefix and padding bits
    are chosen for the design of the proposed method of verification. Table 4 Hidden
    data capacity Full size table Fig. 3 Process of novel message verification scheme
    Full size image 3.5 Data hiding based message verification scheme The proposed
    data hiding based message verification scheme uses the generation of a codeword,
    which is unique to the particular transmission as a means of message verification.
    The codeword is generated and transmitted through the network in two phases with
    the aid of two data hiding methods. Figure 3 illustrates the flow of processes
    of the proposed scheme. These processes are detailed as follows: 1. The legitimate
    sender, Alice initiates a stream of Hello packets to establish a connection with
    the legitimate receiver, Bob during Phase 1. 2. At the physical layer, a sample
    is extracted from the start of the time series of IFFT values, which then undergoes
    discrete cosine transformation (DCT) to generate the DCT coefficients. The DCT
    coefficients are subjected to quantization to produce a sequence of ones and zeroes
    that form the codeword, Q. 3. The codeword to be embedded, \\(Q_{\\kappa }\\)
    is computed by using \\(Q_{\\kappa }= Q - \\kappa \\), where \\(\\kappa \\) refers
    to the unique ID that is assigned to the legitimate sender. \\(Q_{\\kappa }\\)
    is embedded by using multiple Cyclic Prefixes (CPs) of the transmission and sent
    across the network through multi-path propagation. 4. At the receiver’s end, the
    bit sequences of the modified CPs are extracted and their average is computed
    to produce the codeword, \\(Q_{\\kappa }''\\). 5. In Phase 2, the same unique
    ID Key, \\(\\kappa \\) is embedded into the padding bits in the physical layer
    of the transmission. 6. At the receiver’s end, the potentially modified key (e.g.,
    due to transmission error) \\(\\kappa ''\\) is extracted. The start of the time
    series of IFFT values is sampled and the corresponding DCT coefficients are computed.
    The codeword, P is generated through quantization of the DCT coefficients. The
    extracted \\(\\kappa ''\\) is used to generate \\(P_{\\kappa ''}= P - \\kappa
    ''\\). 7. The values of \\(Q_{\\kappa }''\\) and \\(P_{\\kappa ''}\\), which are
    generated at two different phases are compared to confirm the integrity of the
    transmission. 3.5.1 Sampling and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) The first stage
    of the proposed method is the sampling of the time series produced by the inverse
    fast fourier transform (IFFT) stage at the physical layer. A fixed sample of \\(5\\mu
    \\)s is extracted from the beginning of the IFFT signal. The extracted sample
    is then subjected to DCT before being fed into a quantizer. DCT converts the IFFT
    values into a sum of cosine functions at different frequencies following the equation:
    $$\\begin{aligned} X_k = \\sum _{n=0}^{N-1}x_{n} \\times \\cos \\left[ \\frac{\\pi
    }{2}\\Big (n+\\frac{1}{2}\\Big )k\\right] , \\end{aligned}$$ (1) \\(k=0,1,\\cdots
    ,N-1\\). The addition of a DCT step essentially allows the proposed scheme to
    actively discard high frequency components that account for most of its bit errors,
    making the proposed scheme tunable. This is possible thanks for the strength of
    DCT in energy compaction [23]. Hence, we can increase/decrease the rate of the
    channel depending on the network conditions. This is especially helpful during
    instances where the coherence time is lower than the sampling period. This makes
    the use of DCT for the filtering stage both time and energy efficient. 3.5.2 Quantization
    The quantization stage quantizes the DC components generated in the previous step
    to produce a codeword that represents the transmission. Our work adopts the quantizers
    presented in [33]. Most quantizers that exist in the literature define a censoring
    region \\([\\mu +\\alpha \\sigma ,\\mu -\\alpha \\sigma ]\\) for quantization
    where \\(\\alpha \\) is a positive non-zero value, \\(\\mu \\) represents the
    mean value of the DC components and \\(\\sigma \\) represents the standard deviation,
    and all values within the region are considered rejected. This approach results
    in the increase of the number of packets needed to be transmitted in order to
    generate a codeword, which is not ideal in the case of message verification because
    an unnecessarily large amount of Hello packets before a transmission will arouse
    suspicion. The higher number of transmitted packets will also mean that more energy
    has been consumed, which is not fitting for an energy-efficient scheme. Therefore,
    our work adopts the quantizer presented in [33], where the mean, \\(\\mu \\) and
    standard deviation, \\(\\sigma \\) are calculated for the DC components, which
    are then quantized into four separate regions, with each component generating
    two bits. The regions are defined as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} Q(n)= {\\left\\{
    \\begin{array}{ll} 11,&{} x_n\\ge \\mu +\\sigma ,\\\\ 10,&{} \\mu \\le x_n<\\mu
    +\\sigma ,\\\\ 01,&{} \\mu -\\sigma x_n<\\mu ,\\\\ 00,&{} x_n\\le \\mu -\\sigma
    \\end{array}\\right. } \\end{aligned}$$ (2) 3.5.3 Cyclic Prefix (CP) The venue
    utilized for data hiding in Phase 1 is known as the Cyclic Prefix (CP). The CP
    exists in the physical layer of the network model and it is generated during the
    process of OFDM. OFDM modulation is basically a process that allows nodes to transmit
    independent data streams simultaneously through a radio channel by forming OFDM
    symbols. In typical wireless networks, multi-path propagation is a common occurrence
    and usually results in the transmission of delayed copies of the signal transmitted
    due to reflection from obstacles. This leads to inter-symbol interference (ISI)
    between the transmitted OFDM symbols. In order to avoid ISI, an interval is inserted
    in front of each OFDM symbol. This interval is known as the Guard Interval (GI).
    According to the IEEE 802.11 standards, this interval must be filled with a set
    of bits known as a Cyclic Prefix (CP). The CP usually represents the end-part
    of the OFDM symbol that it precedes. However, the CP itself serves no purpose
    for the transmitted data and it is ignored by network devices. This venue was
    first explored for data hiding by Margelis et al. [33], and the proposed message
    verification scheme in this work adopts this method for Phase 1 of the scheme.
    In Phase 1, the codeword Q, computed using the quantized DC components and the
    shared key, \\(\\kappa \\) will be embedded into the CP at the sender. Since the
    CP is affected by interference and network perturbations, embedding into a single
    CP is impractical. Therefore, the codeword Q must be embedded into multiple CPs
    in order to increase the chance of accurately extracting it at the receiver’s
    end. However, the modification of multiple CPs lead to an increase in the chance
    of an adversary detecting the modifications. Therefore, it is important to choose
    the OFDM symbols whose prefixes will be modified. To achieve this, an identical
    pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) should be employed at both the covert sender
    and receiver. The PRNG allows the generation of a random number sequence in a
    deterministic manner and produces the same output for two identical generators
    with the same input (i.e., seed). The hidden data are then embedded into the CPs
    following the sequence of numbers generated by the PRNG. At the covert receiver’s
    end, the modified CPs are extracted according to the same PRNG sequence. The process
    for this operation is illustrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Transmission of hidden data
    using Cyclic Prefix (reproduced from [17]) Full size image Fig. 5 Frame format
    of IEEE 802.11p Full size image 3.5.4 Padding bits The data hiding process in
    Phase 2 is based on bit padding of OFDM symbols at the physical layer. This venue
    was first explored for data hiding by Szczypiorski et al. [43], where frame padding
    in the physical layer of WLAN networks was replaced with hidden data to form a
    steganographic venue with the acronym WiPad (Wireless Padding). The authors of
    [43] dubbed WiPad the most capacious steganographic network channel, with a capacity
    of 1.65 Mbit/s for data frames. The same principle can be applied to the IEEE
    802.11p standard of the FANET. To facilitate the presentation, the physical layer
    frame format is shown in Fig. 5. Specifically, the physical layer defined in the
    IEEE 802.11 standard contains the Physical Layer Convergence Protocol (PLCP) sublayer,
    which handles the differences between physical layers to ensure that packets of
    the same format are sent to the MAC layer. The convergence procedure of this sublayer
    converts the data frame being sent, known as the PLCP Service Data Unit (PSDU),
    into PLCP Protocol Data Unit (PPDU). The PSDU is prepended with the SERVICE field
    and appended with tail and pad bits to create the DATA field of the PPDU. The
    padding bits, in this case, are utilized for ensuring the size of the input bit
    sequence is equal to a power of two. Zeros are appended to the end of the bit
    sequence to make the total number of samples equivalent to the next larger number
    \\(2^n\\), where n is a positive integer. Depending on the transmission data rate,
    modulation type as well as encoding rate, the number of encoded bits per symbol
    varies from 48 to 288 for the IEEE 802.11p standard, as shown in Table 3. Table
    5 Parameters of 802.11p OFDM physical layer Full size table For each transmission
    data rate, the number of bits per symbol can be factorized into primes as included
    in Table 5. Accordingly, the least common multiple can be calculated as \\(2^{8}3^{2}
    = 2304\\). Hence, the maximum number of padding bytes that is used for all rates
    is: $$\\begin{aligned} L = \\frac{2^{8}3^{2}}{8}\\alpha -2 = 288\\alpha -2, \\end{aligned}$$
    (3) where \\(\\alpha \\) is a positive integer. The transmission data rate is
    assumed to be the same throughout, and all frames are assumed to be of constant
    length L. In the proposed scheme, this data hiding venue is used for Phase 2 to
    transmit \\(\\kappa \\) to the covert sender. Specifically, \\(\\kappa \\) will
    be sent by encoding it into the padding bits of the PLCP layer and it will be
    extracted at the covert receiver’s end, which is then used in the computation
    of the codeword \\(P_{\\kappa ''}\\). 4 Performance evaluation 4.1 Verification
    scheme testing The performance of the proposed scheme was analysed in terms of
    the number of positive matches of the extracted codeword \\(Q_{\\kappa }''\\)
    from Phase 1 and \\(P_{\\kappa ''}\\) from Phase 2 at the receiver’s end. A stream
    of Hello packets is typically transmitted in order to establish a connection between
    the sender and the receiver. Using the proposed scheme, these Hello packets are
    used to transmit the codeword, Q and the unique key, \\(\\kappa \\) to carry out
    the verification process. A single physical layer frame is set to have around
    100 OFDM symbols which corresponds to 100 CPs. The length of a single CP is set
    to 72 bits (i.e., a quarter of an OFDM symbol). However, only half of a CP can
    be embedded in order to minimize inter-symbol interference. Therefore, the total
    number of bits that can be used for embedding in Phase 1 is 3600 bits. As for
    the padding bits, a single OFDM symbol contains 288 padding bits for 64-QAM/54Mbytes/s
    as shown in Table 5. Hence, the total number of bits that can be used for embedding
    in Phase 2 is 28,800 bits per frame. Based on this information, length of Q and
    \\(\\kappa \\) was set to \\(2^{11} = 2048\\) bits. The first experiment was conducted
    for different hop-counts ranging from 2 to 10 hops, with each hop-count amounting
    to 100 iterations. The codeword was considered a positive match only if all 2048
    bits of the codeword \\(Q_{\\kappa }''\\) extracted at Phase 1 is the same as
    the codeword \\(P_{\\kappa ''}\\) extracted at Phase 2. Fig. 6 Whisker plot for
    the number of positive matches at each hop-count Full size image The experiment
    was conducted for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of 0dB, 10dB and 20dB. Box-whisker
    plots are generated based on the results obtained and they are shown in Fig. 6.
    The results show an expected trend, namely, decreasing number of positive matches
    per 100 iterations with the increase in hop-count. They also suggest an increasing
    trend in the number of positive matches with the increase in SNR. However, it
    is evident from the larger interquartile ranges, especially around 5-8 hops, that
    there is a considerable amount of error/failed matches. This is due to the fact
    that for the chosen simulation area with 20 nodes, the 5 to 8 hop count scenarios
    return a higher number of possible paths, resulting in more frequent topology
    changes which could potentially have led to a higher packet drop rate. Fig. 7

    A second experiment was conducted without specifying the hop-count in order to
    generate an ROC curve and the results are summarized in Fig. 7. The performance
    of the message verification scheme can be measured by means of True positive rate
    (TPR) and False positive rate (FPR). TPR is calculated as TP/TP+FN, where TP and
    FN refers to the numbers of true positive and false negative, respectively. TPR
    is the probability that the message will pass the verification when it is from
    a legitimate sender. On the other hand, FPR is calculated as FP/FP+TN, where FP
    is the number of false positives and TN is the number of true negatives. It is
    the probability that the message will pass the verification when it is transmitted
    from an unauthorized sender with an incorrect codeword. In this case, the TPR
    refers to the percentage (out of 100 iterations) of positive matches between the
    codewords extracted from Phase 1 and Phase 2 is greater than the defined threshold
    \\(\\tau \\). Mathematically, it is expressed as follows: $$\\begin{aligned} TPR
    = 0.01 \\times || \\{i \\in \\mathbb {N} : i \\le 100 \\text { and } R_{i} > \\tau
    \\} ||, \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where ||X|| refers to the cardinality of the set
    X and $$\\begin{aligned} R_i = \\sum _{j = 1}^{2048} |Q''_{\\kappa }(i,j) - P_{\\kappa
    ''}(i,j)| \\end{aligned}$$ (5) denotes the sum of the absolute differences between
    the codewords for P(i, j) being the j-th bit in the codeword P in the i-th iteration.
    Conversely, the FPR is the rate of genuine attempts of verification, but the percentage
    of positive matches was below the threshold \\(\\tau \\). The closer the ROC curve
    is to the upper left corner the better is the overall performance of the proposed
    scheme. As expected, increasing the SNR of the signal improves the performance.
    This confirms the suitability of the proposed scheme to be utilizing for message
    verification. 4.2 Computational cost In order to evaluate the efficiency of the
    proposed payload authentication scheme, the execution time is reported and compared
    against other related message authentication schemes proposed for the UAV environments.
    The execution time is defined as the sum of all execution times of the significant
    operations involved in the mentioned schemes. Specifically, the operations discussed
    are bit-XOR (\\(T_{XOR}\\)), one-point addition (\\(T_{A}\\)), multiplication/division
    (\\(T_{MD}\\)), pseudo-random number generation (\\(T_{PRNG}\\)), hashing (\\(T_{H}\\)),
    hash-based message authentication codes (\\(T_{HMAC}\\)), fuzzy extraction (\\(T_{FE}\\)),
    quantization (\\(T_{Q}\\)), symmetric encryption (\\(T_{SE}\\)), symmetric decryption
    (\\(T_{SD}\\)), asymmetric signature generation (\\(T_{AS}\\)) and asymmetric
    signature verification (\\(T_{ASV}\\)). The execution time of the aforementioned
    operations was obtained using an Intel Core i5-8250U Processor 1.6 GHz (6M Cache,
    up to 3.4 GHz, 4 cores). The execution time of cyclic prefix data hiding is not
    taken into account because cyclic prefix insertion is a regular part of network
    operation. The proposed work is compared with related existing schemes such as
    those proposed by Wazid et al. [49], Alladi et al. [3], Zhang et al. [58], Hussain
    et al. [20] and Khalid et al. [22], where the results are recorded in Table 6.
    As seen in Fig. 8, it is clear that the proposed message verification scheme has
    a lower total execution time when compared to related work, making it suitable
    to be operated in the FANET environment. Table 6 Breakdown of execution time for
    the surveyed related schemes Full size table Fig. 8 Total execution time (ms)
    for the surveyed schemes Full size image 4.3 Security analysis This section suggests
    some changes to the proposed message verification scheme to combat some commonly
    deployed security attacks. It is evident from Fig. 3 that the proposed scheme
    is vulnerable to a few common attacks that would involve an adversary posing as
    a legitimate node requesting the unique ID key, \\(\\kappa \\) from the base station.
    Therefore, an additional step of authentication must be set in place between the
    UAV nodes and the base station. We propose the use of Physical Unclonable Functions
    (PUF) for this step. Specifically, in a number of recent studies, PUFs have been
    investigated to establish secure communications in several IoT and embedded system
    based applications [3, 37, 41]. Due to the essential randomness added during the
    manufacturing process of these UAVs, the unclonable and unique identities are
    provided to these devices. Therefore, they are suitable to be used as a hardware
    root of trust. The operation of PUFs relies on a challenge-response pair mechanism,
    where PUF has a property that in the event an input stimulus called the challenge
    (C) is applied, the device reacts with an output, which is called the response
    (R). Two separate devices constructed by using the same manufacturing process
    and configuration are presumed to generate different responses when given an identical
    challenge. In this case, the function of PUF is used for producing a unique session
    key for each UAV, which is embedded with a PUF. The PUF chip embedded within the
    UAV would operate as a unique, unclonable, and nonreproducible fingerprint for
    each UAV node in the network. As such, by employing the PUF for the authentication
    process between the UAV nodes and base station, the proposed scheme can be protected
    from the following attacks: Man-in-the-middle/masquerade attack: Adversary cannot
    pose as a legitimate UAV node as it does not have the same PUF. Adversary cannot
    pretend to be the base station as it does not have the same Challenge (C) and
    Response (R) pairs. Replay attack: Adversary cannot replay old messages to either
    UAV node or base station. A new (C, R) pair will be adopted for each session,
    which the adversary will have no access to. Cloning attack: PUF is unclonable
    and unique to each UAV node, hence it is protected against cloning attacks. Brute
    force attack: In order to carry out a brute force attack on the proposed scheme,
    the adversary needs to guess both the codeword Q and the secret key \\(\\kappa
    \\). Therefore, it would take an attacker \\(10^{2048} \\times 10^{2048} = 10^{4096}\\)
    attempts to guess the two passwords. Based on the aforementioned justifications,
    we conclude that, when the proposed scheme is paired with the PUFs, it is able
    to prevent the common attacks, including man-in-the-middle, replay, cloning and
    brute-force attacks. 5 Conclusion Data hiding in networks is typically realized
    by exploiting different layers of the network stack to establish covert communication.
    This research focuses on the application of data hiding methods to a multi-UAV
    network that adopts a dynamic network known as FANET, to be develop a message
    verification scheme. Upon investigation of the BER of the embedded data in multiple
    embedding venues under the FANET setting, Cyclic prefix and padding bits are chosen
    as the venues to realize the proposed message verification scheme. Performance
    evaluation in terms of the number of positive matches and a ROC curve are conducted,
    and favorable results are obtained. In the best case scenario, a successful verification
    rate of 80% and above at a maximum hop-count of 10 hops is attained. The security
    aspect of the proposed scheme has also been discussed, and appropriate solutions
    have been proposed to prevent possible attacks. In addition, the execution time
    was analyzed to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed authentication scheme.
    The results were compared against the existing message authentication methods
    designed specifically for UAV network environments. Results indicated that our
    proposed scheme exhibit noteworthy computational efficiency, highlighting the
    advantages of data hiding-based approaches over cryptographic schemes in terms
    of execution time. As part of our future work, we plan to implement the proposed
    scheme on real UAV processors to assess its practicality. This implementation
    will serve as a pivotal testing platform to gauge the effectiveness and efficiency
    of the proposed scheme within the UAV network environment, considering authentic
    operational scenarios encompassing diverse UAV types, assorted network topologies,
    and varying traffic loads. The outcomes of this assessment will offer valuable
    insights into the potential applicability of the proposed scheme in real-world
    UAV networks, guiding its further refinement and optimization. Data Availability

    in border areas are vulnerable to various security threats caused by illegal intruders
    who perform eavesdropping, garnishing, gray-hole attacks, etc. to compromise the
    network and forge the sensitive data. A multi-level hierarchical secure and optimal
    routing (ML-HSOR) protocol is proposed to overcome these issues. The proposed
    ML-HSOR protocol has four stages: registration, clustering, authentication, and
    optimal routing. In the registration step, the new sensor nodes are registered
    with the base station (BS) using unique identities. In the clustering stage, a
    Markov model with adaptive weighting mechanism is used to choose the most suitable
    node as the cluster head (CH), enhancing network lifespan and performance. The
    authentication stage involves a multi-level trust evaluation to detect malicious
    nodes. The aggregated message and timestamp are encrypted, and finally, the optimal
    data transmission path is chosen based on the polarity learning-based chimp optimization
    algorithm (PL-COA). This approach computes node fitness based on residual energy,
    distance, link quality, delay, and trust, ensuring high packet delivery ratio
    (PDR) (99.8% for 500 nodes), high throughput (48,000 bits per second for 500 nodes),
    less delay (0.058s for 500 nodes), high detection rate (95%), and less energy
    consumption (0.39 J for 500 nodes).'

    in wireless sensor networks Article 31 May 2022 1 Introduction The IoT is an expanding
    network of devices that are connected to gather and share data in real time. With
    the evolution of unified communication, there has been a significant rise in the
    use of devices connected to the IoT [1,2,3]. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) use
    low-cost, smart sensors to improve data collection capabilities as the Internet
    of Things (IoT) expands. In an IoT system, sensors broadcast their data directly
    to the internet, but in WSNs, sensors are connected to a central node or a router
    [4]. To obtain data from WSN, an IoT system can establish a connection with the
    WSN’s router. The gateway offers LoRaWAN wireless connectivity to the sensor network
    over a range of up to 15 km. Low-power, short-distance radios that comply with
    IEEE 802.15.4 are often utilized in several IoT applications [5]. IoT applications
    are being developed for a wide range of fields, like the transportation sectors,
    smart cities, the energy and medical sectors, military, and agricultural monitoring,
    forest monitoring, etc. [6, 7]. The collaboration between IoT and WSNs has brought
    about transformative advancements in various sectors. By connecting IoT systems
    to a WSN, farmers gain access to real-time data regarding soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and crop health, thus enabling precision irrigation and enhancing
    crop yields [8]. Similarly, in the healthcare sector, IoT devices integrated with
    WSN technology offer continuous monitoring of patients’ vital signs, transmitting
    crucial data to healthcare providers for remote patient care, and timely medical
    interventions. In the medical sector, IoT-WSN integration is a game changer, with
    wearable devices collecting patient health data, transmitting it to healthcare
    providers, and enhancing remote patient care and early disease detection [9].
    Moreover, the energy sector benefits from IoT-WSN applications for smart grid
    management, facilitating the monitoring and optimization of energy distribution
    [10]. These concrete examples illustrate how the fusion of IoT and WSN technologies
    drives efficiencies, optimizes resource utilization. However, it is essential
    to acknowledge that this synergy between IoT and WSNs brings about new challenges,
    particularly in terms of security. The security of IoT-based WSNs is critical
    to ensure the integrity and reliability of data, as well as the proper functioning
    of applications. These security challenges encompass various threats, such as
    unauthorized access, data breaches, and network disruptions [6]. In precision
    agriculture, for instance, unauthorized access to IoT-WSN systems can lead to
    inaccurate data collection, potentially resulting in suboptimal crop yields or
    even crop losses. Furthermore, in health care, the compromise of patient health
    data transmitted through IoT-WSN technology poses a significant risk to patient
    care and privacy. These specific examples underscore the gravity of security risks
    in IoT-based WSN applications, emphasizing the need for robust security measures.
    Rosewood, pine, teak wood, and sandalwood are a few of the precious trees that
    have seen a dramatic rise in poaching as a result of man’s excessive desire to
    satisfy his desires [11]. Moreover, Rhino poaching is a serious problem in India.
    The horn may range in length from around 20 cm to about 60 cm; it can cost as
    much as $300,000 due to its high demand in the treatment of diseases, including
    cancer and hangovers. Most of the world’s population of the Indian one-horned
    rhinoceros reside in the protected areas of Assam, particularly in Kaziranga National
    Park, Orang National Park, etc. The nails, skin, and horns of rhinos are all highly
    prized because of its usage in traditional Vietnamese and Chinese medicine [12].
    Moreover, international boundaries may not have nearby settlements, patrolling
    troops, or barriers in challenging terrain such as forests [13, 14]. Therefore,
    IoT-based WSNs provide a solution for real-time environmental monitoring. However,
    these networks are prone to various security threats by illegal intruders that
    may affect the national security [15]. Wireless sensor nodes, constrained by factors
    such as limited processing power, storage space, and battery life, encounter challenges
    in network lifetime due to inefficient clustering and routing techniques. Addressing
    these constraints is crucial for sustaining network performance. Additionally,
    securing data in potentially hostile environments against malicious attacks poses
    a significant challenge for IoT-based wireless sensor networks (WSNs). These attacks
    aim to deplete node energy, disrupt services, or extract sensitive data. They
    provide further challenges, encompassing deceptive behaviors like garnishing and
    bad mouthing attacks, covert tactics such as gray-hole attacks, disruptive strategies
    like denial of service attacks, and identity manipulation in whitewashing attacks.
    Furthermore, the network faces threats from data replay methods and information
    interception through eavesdropping attacks. Combating these security risks is
    essential for ensuring the reliable and secure operation of WSNs in IoT applications.
    Recently, intrusion detection system (IDS)-based methods [16], machine learning
    methods (ML) [17], trust-based methods [18], and cryptographic techniques [19]
    have been proposed to minimize the routing attacks. However, cryptographic methods
    cannot guarantee complete network security for sensor nodes. By comparing nodes’
    behaviors against a set of criteria, trust may be established between them. In
    recent years, researchers focus toward trust-based methods because of its easy
    implementation and less complexity [20]. Several trust formation systems have
    been suggested in different industries, including web-based services, e-commerce,
    and WSNs. In WSNs, trust is calculated regularly depending upon the number of
    occurrences of good and bad conduct measured within a certain span of time and
    using a specific mechanism [21]. Therefore, this work proposes a multi-level trust-based
    optimal routing technique for IoT-based WSN applications. The following are our
    main contributions: The proposed ML-HSOR methodology employs an adaptive clustering
    approach based on the Markov model for CH selection and distinguishes itself by
    introducing a dynamic feature that allows real-time adjustment of attribute weighting
    based on current network conditions. This adaptive mechanism continuously evaluates
    sensor nodes and their attributes, ensuring that the most suitable nodes are appointed
    as CHs. This adaptability enhances network lifespan, performance, and CH selection,
    making the methodology more resilient and dynamic compared to traditional Markov
    models. ML-HSOR addresses the problem of malicious nodes that cause various attacks,
    such as garnishing and bad mouthing, by introducing a multi-level hierarchical
    trust evaluation approach. Trust is evaluated at both intra-cluster and inter-cluster
    levels, considering factors such as interaction trust, data trust, validation
    trust, transmission trust, and identity trust. This approach significantly enhances
    security and reliability, a novel contribution that safeguards environmental monitoring
    systems. In the context of garnishing attacks, a time-window mechanism is introduced
    to observe the behavior of nodes over specific periods. This approach monitors
    the number of successful and unsuccessful interactions between nodes and uses
    this information to assess trustworthiness. The time-window mechanism contributes
    to effectively countering dynamic threats and maintaining system integrity, a
    novel feature not typically found in existing methodologies. To prevent replay
    attacks and eavesdropping, timestamps are added to each message, and data are
    encrypted using the improved blowfish algorithm (IBFA). This ensures data integrity
    and confidentiality, particularly in forest areas where sensitive information
    needs protection. The congestion is reduced and the optimal path is determined
    using PL-COA. The performance of COA is improved by introducing polarity learning
    and Levy flight strategy. Polarity-based learning enables solutions to be found
    efficiently by examining opposite search spaces. This novel feature helps prevent
    local optima entrapment and enhances the algorithm’s exploration capabilities,
    a unique contribution that is not commonly found in traditional metaheuristic
    algorithms. Levy flights facilitating comprehensive data surveying and navigation
    in complex and high-dimensional environmental data spaces. This feature enables
    the algorithm to avoid local optima and discover better solutions, contributing
    to more robust environmental monitoring in dynamic and evolving conditions. The
    remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents the
    related works, Sect. 3 introduces the proposed ML-HSOR protocol, Sect. 4, provides
    the comparative result analysis, and finally, Sect. 5 gives the conclusions and
    future scope. 2 Related works This section provides an overview of relevant research
    conducted in the field of IoT, specifically focusing on clustering, routing, and
    security. Clustering specifies the grouping of nodes into clusters to increase
    network efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Security is another critical
    aspect of IoT systems, and the reviewed literature delves into the different security
    mechanisms deployed in IoT networks to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and
    availability of data. Bany et al. [22] introduced a unique clustering technique
    with the goal of increasing network lifespan by load balancing. The suggested
    technique is divided into two stages: CH allocation and relay node allocation.
    The energy level of the CH and its distance from other cluster nodes are the two
    criteria used to determine which CH is chosen. The choice of a relay node is based
    on how close it is to the sink, providing the shortest path and facilitating in
    energy conservation. Also, the amount of remaining energy in a relay node has
    an impact on the choice of that node. Salim et al. [23] presented a strategy for
    the safe and efficient collection of IoT data. Their approach is divided into
    three stages: setup stage, secure data collection, and data reconstruction. The
    compressive sensing-based technique is employed during the safe intra-communication
    operation for encryption and data compression. The security is enhanced by integrating
    public and private key algorithms. Kaur et al. [24] introduced a routing approach
    for IoT-WSNs that utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Their work is separated
    into two stages: uneven cluster construction and smart data routing. This approach
    splits the network into multiple clusters on the basis of data load. Multi-objective
    DRL is presented for inter- and intra-cluster routing during the data routing
    phase to greatly boost network performance and minimize communication time. This
    method dramatically reduces latency and increases the lifetime of the network.
    Abasıkele¸s-Turgut et al. [25] presented a technique for cluster communication.
    The separation between the BS and the cluster heads determines the size of the
    coverage region. The self-organized nodes identify the cluster heads, clusters,
    and clustering ranges, without the need for a central control mechanism. Furthermore,
    static clustering reduces the number of control messages created by the system.
    Their technique reduced the rate of CH change and prevented the network’s head
    nodes from dying prematurely. Mahajan et al. [26] introduced a nature-inspired
    algorithm-based cross-layer clustering (NICC) technique to significantly increase
    the lifespan of WSN in a smart farming application. This technique is used for
    constant monitoring of the agricultural field. As a WSN protocol designed for
    IoT applications, NICC operates in clusters. Bacterial Foraging Optimization determined
    the ideal sensor for routing and clustering issues. The energy balancing is achieved,
    and the jitter, delay, and overhead are reduced. However, data privacy and security
    were poor. Alotaibi [27] developed a novel secure routing technique by selecting
    the most efficient route possible and encrypting the data. In the beginning, optimum
    link-state multipath routing is executed, during which optimal nodes are chosen
    for the purpose of ensuring secure transmission. Following this, encryption takes
    place, which makes communication completely safe. For the purpose of providing
    safe authentication, an Improved Blowfish algorithm is presented in this study.
    This method is secure against several attacks. However, the energy efficiency
    was low. In order to lessen the amount of power that is used by WSNs, an energy-efficient
    two-stage routing protocol known as EETSP was developed by Dwivedi et al. [28].
    The EETSP is segmented into two distinct phases. The key step involves the selection
    of CH and secondary CH. The secondary CH serves as a backup for the initial CH.
    The second stage performs intra- and inter-cluster routing. The number of packets
    transmitted to the BS experiences a substantial surge, while the CHs strive to
    diminish the network’s overall energy consumption. Subramani et al. [29] introduced
    mobile sink-based energy aware clustering for routing in IoT-enabled WSNs. This
    approach efficiently minimizes energy consumption. In addition, the type-II fuzzy
    logic approach is employed to optimize the selected routes. However, this method
    has a high delay, less reliability, and less security. Arya et al. [30] proposed
    a deep belief network to enable improved data transfer along the selected path.
    In this architecture, the nodes in the whole network were first clustered using
    a reinforcement learning method. A manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) method
    was then used to choose the CH necessary for effective data transfer. Through
    the implementation of a proficient deep-learning approach, the packet is directed
    to the BS node via the selected CH. Consequently, there was an improvement in
    the packet delivery ratio (PDR). Nevertheless, this method does not provide safeguards
    against various forms of attacks in WSNs. By leveraging controller discovery,
    virtual routing, and topology available in novel virtualization and load-balancing
    routing (VLBR), Hajian et al. [31] proposed architecture resulted in an extended
    lifespan and decreased load. This solution minimized the interchange of network
    status and other pertinent data. Network load distribution reduced network energy
    usage and increased network lifetime. Seyyedabbasi et al. [32] proposed two metaheuristic
    algorithms: improved gray wolf optimization (I-GWO) and extended (Ex-GWO) to optimize
    the pathfinding and data transmission processes in WSN and decentralized IoT systems.
    The energy-efficient routing based on the I-GWO algorithm (EERI-GWO) was used
    to optimize the pathfinding process by finding the optimal path for data transmission
    between the source and destination nodes. The Ex-GWO algorithm was created to
    enhance the data transmission process by minimizing both delay and energy consumption
    that occurs during the transmission of data. Benelhouri et al. [33] suggested
    an evolutionary gateway-based load-balanced routing (E-GLBR) protocol that focuses
    on balancing the load between nodes and improving the quality of service (QoS)
    by optimizing the path selection process. This protocol used Genetic Algorithm
    to optimize the routing paths and improve the QoS in WSNs. The primary goals of
    this algorithm are to improve the selection process for CHs, reduce the range
    of energy transmission, enhance stability, and extend the lifespan of the network
    with the increase in the coverage of WSN. Preeti et al. [34] presents a focus
    on addressing energy constraint issues in WSNs through the development of the
    Improved Chimp Optimizer Algorithm (IChoA). While this approach integrates the
    chimp optimizer with the dimension learning-based hunting (DLH) search technique,
    aiming to strike a balance between exploitation and exploration, it’s essential
    to highlight some limitations in their method. Notably, this work lacks a comprehensive
    discussion of the practical implications and real-world applications of their
    proposed approach. Also, the absence of polarity learning and Levy flight-based
    algorithms in this approach can result in suboptimal path selection, limiting
    the network’s ability to efficiently adapt to dynamic conditions, resulting in
    reduced throughput and less effective energy management in wireless sensor networks.
    Hosseinzadeh et al. [35] primarily focuses on enhancing security within wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs) by employing the Fire Hawk Optimizer (FHO) for trusted
    routing. They introduce a weighted trust mechanism (WTM) that dynamically adjusts
    trust levels based on interactions between sensor nodes, considering aspects like
    the weighted reception rate, weighted redundancy rate, and energy state. Furthermore,
    their approach utilizes a FHO-based clustering method for selecting cluster heads
    from a candidate set, comprising nodes with energy and trust levels above network
    averages. However, it exhibits suboptimal path selection, reduced throughput,
    and inefficient energy management, which limits its suitability for dynamic and
    resource-constrained WSN environments. Khan et al. [36] proposed a novel and comprehensive
    trust estimation approach (LTS) for large-scale WSNs, leveraging clustering to
    enhance cooperation, trust, and security by identifying malicious nodes with reduced
    power consumption. The approach operates at both intra and inter levels to facilitate
    accurate trust decisions with minimal overhead. To address malicious nodes, it
    introduces unique features, including a robust trust estimation function, resistance
    to attacks, and efficient trust aggregation at the cluster head for obtaining
    a global feedback trust value. These features aid in eliminating dishonest recommendations,
    incorporating punishment mechanisms, and introducing a trust severity feature
    for finer network tuning. However, the method does not account for the weight
    and frequency of misbehavior, making it susceptible to on–off and collusion attacks.
    Additionally, it is not optimized for homogeneous WSNs. In a work conducted by
    Kalidoss et al. [37], they proposed a wireless sensor network (WSN) with a Quality
    of Service (QoS)-aware, trust-based routing algorithm designed to provide accurate
    trust scores. The algorithm calculates three different trust scores to enhance
    communication security. Additionally, they suggested a cluster-based secure routing
    algorithm tailored for secure routing within clusters. The final path selection
    is determined through a consideration of path-trust, energy, and hop count for
    routing purposes. The study was simulated using the NS2 simulator. However, it
    did not address the issue of handling uncertainty. Arulanantham and Palanisamy
    [38] proposed a trusted cognitive sensor-based dual-routing network (TCSRN) for
    IoT to handle different types of attacks. Building upon this, the communication
    system achieves the highest packet delivery ratio and minimal delay toward the
    conclusion. This outcome results from the utilization of a reliable path selection
    approach employing the dual-path selection method. The method relies on one-hop
    reports and endorsement reports for reliability assessment, as well as global
    cumulative reliability, establishing connections between sensors. However, they
    were unable to reduce the complexity by minimizing parameters such as congestion,
    channel selection, and interruption. Bangotra et al. [39] proposed a trust-based
    secure intelligent opportunistic routing protocol (TBSIOP) designed to identify
    malicious nodes based on three distinct characteristics, which are also employed
    in trust computation. The relay selection algorithm removes malicious nodes before
    they can be chosen as relay nodes. The proposed protocol is applied to the forwarder
    node list generated by the intelligent opportunistic routing protocol. The protocol
    is then simulated and compared with existing trust-based routing protocols from
    the literature. However, the utilization of only three wireless sensor network
    (WSN) attributes may pose disadvantages, particularly in terms of scalability
    within large networks. Table 1 provides comparison of the proposed and the existing
    WSN. Table 1 Comparison of the proposed and existing WSN Full size table Traditional
    clustering algorithms, such as Markov models [40], may get trapped in local optima,
    leading to suboptimal solutions. The proposed method overcomes this by introducing
    Levy flights for exploration, which allows it to escape local optima and discover
    better solutions. Also, environmental conditions can change rapidly, affecting
    the performance of WSNs. The proposed methodology adapts to real-time environmental
    changes and varying network conditions, ensuring its robustness and effectiveness
    in dynamic and evolving environments. WSNs are vulnerable to various security
    threats, including malicious nodes and attacks like garnishing and bad mouthing.
    The proposed multi-level hierarchical trust evaluation approach enhances security
    and reliability by identifying and mitigating these threats. Replay attacks, where
    intercepted messages are retransmitted, and eavesdropping on sensitive data can
    compromise network integrity. The use of timestamps and encryption in the proposed
    method safeguards against these security threats. Network congestion can lead
    to delays in detecting environmental activities and anomalies. The PL-COA algorithm
    reduces congestion and optimizes the network’s data transmission, ensuring timely
    and efficient monitoring. Many traditional metaheuristic algorithms have limited
    exploration capabilities in complex and high-dimensional environmental data spaces.
    The incorporation of Levy flights in the proposed method facilitates comprehensive
    data surveying and navigation, enabling it to discover better solutions effectively.
    Static clustering approaches like traditional Markov models lack the ability to
    dynamically adjust attribute weighting in real time based on network conditions.
    The proposed methodology introduces dynamic attribute weighting, improving CH
    selection and network performance. 3 Proposed ML-HSOR methodology In our proposed
    ML-HSOR methodology, we assume that the Base Station (BS) does not face resource
    limitations and remains secure from potential attackers. As the central command
    authority, the BS has the ability to eliminate malicious nodes and replace them
    with trustworthy ones to ensure stable operation. This assumption is grounded
    in practical considerations where the BS typically possesses greater computational
    resources and security measures compared to individual sensor nodes in WSNs. This
    distinction allows the BS to perform resource-intensive tasks and security functions.
    In practice, the BS often serves as the network’s control center, enabling measures
    such as physical isolation, security protocols, and secure communication channels.
    These safeguards protect the BS and align with real-world practices to ensure
    its resource adequacy and security, thereby empowering it as the central command
    authority within our methodology to enhance network stability and security. Figure
    1 illustrates the architecture of the proposed ML-HSOR methodology. It consists
    of perception, networking, and application layer. First, all the nodes in the
    network are registered, and then clustering is performed using the Markov model.
    The aggregated data are encrypted and transmitted via a secure and optimal path
    using the PL-COA algorithm. Fig. 1 The architecture of the proposed ML-HSOR methodology
    Full size image Furthermore, the assumption of the BS’s security extends to its
    resilience against sophisticated attacks, requiring the implementation of anomaly
    detection systems, intrusion prevention measures, and constant vigilance. The
    complexity is heightened by the need for the BS to dynamically adjust its security
    protocols based on evolving threat landscapes, ensuring a proactive defense mechanism
    against emerging vulnerabilities. The proposed algorithm’s complexity is further
    compounded by the interplay between the perception, networking, and application
    layers. The registration and clustering of nodes, encryption of aggregated data,
    and transmission through a secure path using the PL-COA algorithm demand meticulous
    coordination and synchronization. Achieving optimal performance while maintaining
    security adds layers of intricacy, necessitating a carefully crafted algorithmic
    framework. The BS dynamically allocates resources that perfectly complements the
    adaptability built into our algorithm. The ML-HSOR model excels in real-time resource
    optimization, intelligently responding to changing network conditions. This synergy
    between the assumed resource allocation capabilities of the BS and our algorithm’s
    adaptability enhances the overall responsiveness and efficiency of the WSN. Real-time
    decision-making stands as a core strength of our proposed model. The BS, as the
    central command authority, capitalizes on the strengths of our algorithm to make
    instantaneous decisions. The energy efficiency for the BS mirrors the energy-saving
    strategies embedded in our algorithm. The ML-HSOR model optimizes communication
    protocols, manages power consumption, and employs sleep–wake strategies for sensor
    nodes, all contributing to the sustainable operation of the network. Scalability
    is a prominent strength of our algorithm, and the assumption that the BS accommodates
    network growth seamlessly reinforces this. The ML-HSOR model scales effectively
    with an increasing number of nodes, maintaining optimal performance. 3.1 Registration
    The new sensor node that is added to the network is first registered with the
    BS using a unique identity. To enhance the security of the system, each node is
    assigned a distinct identity such as labels or hash values using a modified SHA-1
    and SHA-2 algorithm [41]. The unique identities of the sensor nodes (SN) are generated
    by using Eq. (1). $$U_{{{\\text{ID}}}} = \\left( {\\left( {{\\text{Ky}} + 1} \\right)
    \\oplus N_{{{\\text{Rd}}}} \\left\\| {H\\left( {{\\text{Ky}} + 1} \\right) \\oplus
    {\\text{ID}}\\left\\| {N_{{{\\text{Rd}}}} } \\right.} \\right.} \\right)$$ (1)
    where, \\({\\text{Ky}}\\) represents the key needed for the hash function, \\(N_{{{\\text{Rd}}}}\\)
    denotes the random number generated by the BS, and \\({\\text{ID}}\\,\\) denote
    the serial number. By using this labeling approach, communication becomes more
    efficient, and the system is protected against various external attacks, such
    as the spoofing and whitewashing attacks. 3.2 Clustering In our clustering approach,
    we uphold the core principles of the Markov model [40] for CH selection. This
    model is the fundamental of our methodology, enabling the meticulous selection
    of secure and energy-efficient CHs. However, what sets our approach apart is the
    introduction of a pioneering feature: the ability to adaptively adjust the weighting
    of attributes in real time, based on the network’s current conditions. This adaptive
    weighting mechanism performs a continuous evaluation of sensor nodes and their
    attributes, ensuring that the most suitable nodes are appointed as CHs. This adaptability
    grants us a unique advantage. For instance, if particular nodes consistently demonstrate
    exceptional energy efficiency, our model may assign a higher weight to energy-related
    attributes for CH selection. This dynamic responsiveness allows our network to
    swiftly adapt to variations in energy levels and node behavior, ultimately leading
    to more precise CH selection. The innovative essence of our method lies in this
    adaptability, transforming it from a static model into a dynamic and resilient
    solution, capable of maintaining optimal performance throughout its operational
    lifetime. This dynamic and adaptive CH selection mechanism significantly boosts
    network lifespan and performance, all while optimizing the distribution of responsibilities
    among CHs. By integrating this novel feature, our methodology ensures efficient
    operation and longevity, rendering it a robust choice for WSNs in evolving environments.
    While the Markov model naturally adapts to changes in energy levels and node behavior
    over discrete time slots, the adaptive adjustment we introduce serves to fine-tune
    the model’s parameters continuously in real time. This means the Markov model
    operates in a step-wise fashion, periodically reassessing and reselecting CHs
    based on discrete time slots. In contrast, our adaptive adjustment is more continuous
    and responsive, enabling real-time fine-tuning of model parameters to accurately
    mirror the immediate state of the network. The goal of introducing adaptive adjustment
    is to enhance CH selection responsiveness to the network’s real-time condition.
    It accomplishes this by continually monitoring and adjusting parameters, a capability
    not captured by the Markov models discrete time slots. This added adaptability
    further optimizes CH selection and elevates overall network performance. For example,
    consider a network with 100 sensor nodes. Our methodology employs the Markov model,
    a dynamic and adaptive approach, to continuously monitor the energy levels and
    behaviors of these sensor nodes in real time. This model updates the network state
    as it evaluates each node for the role of CH. For instance, at the beginning of
    the observation period, in time slot 1, node 50 exhibits the highest energy level.
    The Markov model, recognizing this, selects node 50 as the CH for that specific
    time slot. However, as time progresses and the network’s state evolves, the energy
    levels of the nodes are subject to change. In the next time slot, it may turn
    out that node 20 now has the highest energy level, surpassing node 50. In response
    to this shift in energy levels, the Markov model dynamically adjusts and selects
    node 20 as the new CH. This process of continually updating the CH selection carries
    on, with the Markov model making real-time decisions based on changing energy
    levels and other relevant network conditions. The ability to select CHs dynamically
    and adapt to the network’s immediate state ensures the efficient operation and
    longevity of the network, making our methodology a robust choice for WSNs in dynamic
    and evolving environments. Every CH is responsible for managing the Member Nodes
    (MN) within its cluster and maintaining a record of their IDs and locations. The
    CH also maintains and updates the energy values of each node with the arrival
    of each message in a matrix, as given in Eq. (2). $${\\text{Mat}}_{{{\\text{MN}}}}
    = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {{\\text{ID}}_{1} } & {{\\text{PO}}_{1} } &
    {{\\text{En}}_{1} } \\\\ {{\\text{ID}}_{2} } & {{\\text{PO}}_{2} } & {{\\text{En}}_{2}
    } \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ {{\\text{ID}}_{k - 1} } & {{\\text{PO}}_{k
    - 1} } & {{\\text{En}}_{k - 1} } \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right]$$ (2) where, ID,
    PO, and En denotes the identity, position, and energy of the MNs respectively.
    Similarly, the BS keeps a record of IDs, positions, and energy of the CHs as given
    in Eq. (3). $${\\text{Mat}}_{{{\\text{CH}}}} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c}
    {{\\text{ID}}^{\\prime }_{{1}} } & {{\\text{PO}}_{1}^{\\prime } } & {{\\text{En}}_{1}^{\\prime
    } } \\\\ {{\\text{ID}}_{2}^{\\prime } } & {{\\text{PO}}_{2}^{\\prime } } & {{\\text{En}}_{2}^{\\prime
    } } \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ {{\\text{ID}}_{l - 1}^{\\prime } } &
    {PO_{l - 1}^{\\prime } } & {{\\text{En}}_{l - 1}^{\\prime } } \\\\ \\end{array}
    } \\right]$$ (3) where, ID′, PO′, and En′ denotes the identity, position, and
    energy of the CHs respectively. 3.3 Authentication by multi-level hierarchical
    trust evaluation Wireless sensors used in environmental monitoring applications
    can play a role in detecting illegal poaching in wildlife reserves and protected
    areas. For example, the sensors can detect any movement and trigger an alert,
    while infrared cameras can provide real-time images of the poacher, and sound
    recorders can pick up any sounds of vehicles or weapons. When a poacher enters
    the protected area, the wireless sensors are activated and send an alert to the
    park rangers. With this information, park rangers can quickly respond to the situation
    and prevent the illegal activity from taking place. This helps to protect wildlife
    and their habitats and supports conservation efforts. However, if the sensor network
    is disabled or otherwise compromised by the attackers, it becomes much easier
    for poachers to engage in illegal activities. To overcome these issues, the proposed
    method detects the malicious nodes that cause various attacks such as garnishing,
    bad mouthing, gray-hole etc., using a multi-level hierarchical trust evaluation
    approach as provided in Fig. 2. The trust of the nodes is determined at inter
    as well as intra cluster level. Intra-cluster trust refers to the level of trust
    evaluated between Cluster Members (CM) and between CH and CM, while inter-cluster
    trust pertains to the trust evaluated between CH and CH, as well as between BS
    and CH. The proposed method computes the interaction trust, data trust, validation
    trust, transmission trust, and identity trust of a node directly or based on the
    feedback (indirect) trust obtained from the neighboring nodes. Fig. 2 Multi-level
    hierarchical trust evaluation Full size image The process depicted in Fig. 3 involves
    the interaction between CM-CM and CM-CH for cluster head selection and information
    transfer to the BS. In this process, the trust level of CMs is assessed using
    three distinct types: interaction trust, data trust, and transmission trust. Subsequently,
    the most secure CMs undergo identity and validation trust to pinpoint the CM with
    a high trust level, who then transmits information to the CH. This process involves
    both direct and indirect nodes. Additionally, the information gathered from various
    cluster heads undergoes identity trust once again to identify the reliable cluster
    head in the network. Once the secure CH is determined, the information is sent
    to the BS, which encrypts the data before forwarding it. In a garnishing attack,
    the malicious nodes alternate their behavior between trustworthy and malicious,
    which aims to harm the network while remaining undetected. To address this issue,
    trust is computed in which, a time-window mechanism, as illustrated in Fig. 4,
    is used to observe the behavior of nodes over a certain time frame. Fig. 3 Interactions
    between the different nodes in the Trust evaluation Full size image Fig. 4 Illustration
    of time window Full size image  (i) Time window Trust computation takes advantage
    of a time-window mechanism each lasting a fixed amount of time interval. Interactions
    between nodes are periodically tracked and recorded for successful and unsuccessful
    outcomes. The time window then moves to the right and includes new interactions
    while discarding the oldest ones. This way, the time window provides an overview
    of a node’s behavior over a certain period, taking into account both past and
    current actions. For instance, if node A transmitted 5 successful readings and
    2 unsuccessful readings in the first interval, this information is recorded. After
    each 5-min interval, the time-window slides to the right and includes new interactions
    while discarding the oldest ones. If the BS notices that a particular node has
    a high rate of unsuccessful transmissions during this time interval, the BS gives
    a penalty to reduce trust or replaces the node to ensure the reliability and security
    of the environmental monitoring system.  (ii) Time stamp A replay attack in WSNs
    can occur when an attacker intercepts a message and later retransmits it. This
    kind of attack has the potential to interfere with the WSN’s regular operations
    or grant the attacker unauthorized access. To prevent this, a timestamp is added
    to each message before transmission. The recipient can check whether the message
    is new and hasn’t been replayed by looking at the timestamp, which shows the date
    and time the message was sent. The receiver has the option to delete messages
    that are too old. By discarding a message with an outdated timestamp, the receiver
    prevents an attacker from intercepting and later retransmitting it. Nevertheless,
    an attacker could alter the timestamp to an earlier time, deceiving the recipient
    into believing that the message was transmitted earlier than it actually was.
    Moreover, eavesdropping attacks in forest areas can have various motives for attackers.
    They may aim to access sensitive or confidential information about environmental
    or conservation activities in the forest. By eavesdropping on the communication
    signals, they can obtain sensitive details regarding the location of valuable
    resources such as timber or minerals and execute their theft more efficiently.
    To address this issue, the aggregated data and the timestamp are encrypted before
    transmitting them to the receiving node using the Improved Blowfish Algorithm
    (IBFA) [27]. Upon reception, the recipient can decode the message and timestamp.
    Since the attacker does not possess the decryption key, an attacker who intercepts
    the communication cannot read or alter the message or timestamp. Encryption helps
    secure the integrity of the timestamp and aggregated data. 3.3.1 Intra-cluster
    trust The intra-cluster trust is computed in two levels: CM-CM and CH-CM. 3.3.1.1
    CM-CM level The trust between CM-CM relies on factors such as interaction trust,
    data trust, and transmission trust.  (i) Interaction trust (IT) The direct interaction
    trust of node A on node B is computed using Eq. (4). $$I_{{\\text{A,B}}} \\left(
    {\\Delta T} \\right) = \\left[ {N_{{{\\text{TW}}}} \\times \\left( {\\frac{{S_{{\\text{A,B}}}
    \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)}}{{S_{{\\text{A,B}}} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)
    + F_{{\\text{A,B}}} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)}} * \\frac{1}{\\varphi }\\left(
    {\\frac{{S_{{\\text{A,B}}} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)}}{{S_{{\\text{A,B}}} \\left(
    {\\Delta T} \\right) + 1}}} \\right)^{\\beta } } \\right)} \\right]$$ (4) where,
    \\(N_{{{\\text{TW}}}}\\) denotes the number of units in the time window, \\(S_{{\\text{A,B}}}
    \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)\\) denotes the sum of successful interaction of node
    A with node B during the time window \\(\\Delta T\\), \\(F_{{\\text{A,B}}} \\left(
    {\\Delta T} \\right)\\) represents the sum of failed interaction of node A with
    node B, \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\beta\\) signifies the penalty and pay factor that
    changes the trust value. The values of φ and β are tuned based on the application
    requirement. Consider the case of node A which has never communicated with node
    B before but wants to determine whether node B can be trusted to forward a packet.
    In this case, the IT of node B is computed on the basis of scores given by other
    neighboring nodes (indirect trust) of the node B. The trust estimation accuracy
    is improved by utilizing feedback from neighboring nodes to determine the node
    B trust level. Thus, the indirect interaction trust is computed using Eq. (5).
    $$I^{\\prime}_{{\\text{A,B}}} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{k
    = 1}^{n} {I_{{\\text{N,B}}} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)}$$ (5) where, \\(n\\)
    denotes total number of neighbors of node B, \\(I_{{N,{\\text{B}}}} \\left( {\\Delta
    T} \\right)\\) represents the trust calculated directly by neighboring node N
    on node \\(B\\) which can be computed similar to Eq. (4).  (ii) Data trust (DT)
    The concept of data trust is utilized to detect the presence of malicious nodes
    that cause gray-hole attacks, in which the intruder drops only certain kinds of
    data packets to stay as hidden as possible. An example to illustrate a gray-hole
    attack in a WSN could be monitoring the temperature in a forest for early fire
    detection. A malicious node, acting as a gray-hole attacker, might drop data indicating
    high temperatures, making it appear as if the forest is not in danger even if
    there is an active fire. Failure to detect the fire promptly could result in significant
    damage. Direct DT of node B is computed using Eq. (6). $$D_{{\\text{A,B}}} \\left(
    {\\Delta T} \\right) = \\frac{{{\\text{DP}}_{{\\text{B}}} (\\Delta T)}}{{{\\text{ST}}_{{\\text{A}}}
    (\\Delta T)}}$$ (6) where, \\({\\text{ST}}_{{\\text{A}}}\\) denotes the sum of
    data packets sent by node A, \\({\\text{DP}}_{{\\text{B}}}\\) represents the sum
    of packets dropped by node B. Similarly, the indirect data trust of node B is
    computed using Eq. (7). $$D^{\\prime}_{{\\text{A,B}}} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)
    = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{n} {D_{{\\text{N,B}}} \\left( {\\Delta T}
    \\right)}$$ (7) where, \\(n\\) denotes total number of neighbors of node B, \\({D}_{{\\text{N}},{\\text{B}}}\\left(\\Delta
    T\\right)\\) represents the trust calculated directly by neighboring node N on
    node B which can be computed similar to Eq. (6).  (iii) Transmission trust A DoS
    attack can cause a node to become overloaded and reduce the responsiveness of
    the system. This causes delays in detecting environmental activities or anomalies,
    which can be critical in real-time monitoring applications. To prevent this, the
    transmission trust of a node is computed using Eq. (8). $${\\text{TT}}_{{\\text{A,B}}}
    \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right) = \\frac{{{\\text{Pt}}\\left( {\\text{A,B}} \\right)}}{t}$$
    (8) where, \\({\\text{Pt}}\\left( {\\text{A,B}} \\right)\\) denotes the sum of
    packets transmitted from node A to node B at time \\(t\\). The indirect transmission
    trust is computed using Eq. (9). $${\\text{TT}}_{{\\text{A,B}}}^{\\prime }\\left(
    {\\Delta T} \\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{n} {{\\text{TT}}_{{\\text{N,B}}}
    \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)}$$ (9) where, \\(n\\) denotes total number of neighbors
    of node \\(B\\), \\({\\text{TT}}_{{\\text{N,B}}} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)\\)
    denotes the direct transmission trust calculated by neighboring node N on node
    B. 3.3.1.2 CH-CM level Trust between CH-CM is determined as follows:  (i) Identity
    trust A whitewashing attack is a security threat that occurs when the system detects
    the malicious node and disconnects it from the network, and the malicious node
    then attempts to reenter the network under a different identity in order to trick
    the system into assigning it a new reputation score. To prevent this threat, identity
    trust is computed, in which each CM sends its data to its corresponding CH along
    with its ID for trust evaluation. During trust evaluation, the identity trust
    of node A is computed directly by using Eq. (10). $$ID_{A} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l}
    1 \\hfill & {{\\text{IF}}\\,{\\text{ID}}_{{\\text{A}}} = {\\text{ID}}\\left( {{\\text{Mat}}_{{{\\text{MN}}}}
    } \\right)} \\hfill \\\\ 0 \\hfill & {{\\text{otherwise}}} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array}
    } \\right.$$ (10) where, \\({\\text{ID}}_{{\\text{A}}}\\) represents the identity
    of node A, \\({\\text{ID}}\\left( {{\\text{Mat}}_{{{\\text{MN}}}} } \\right)\\)
    represents the MN identities registered in matrix \\({\\text{Mat}}_{{{\\text{MN}}}}\\)
    by the base station. The data are forwarded to the base station by the CH after
    undergoing trust verification and aggregation.  (ii) Validation trust The CH gathers
    data from the MNs and makes decisions based on the information. During these processes,
    the CH obtains the reputation score of the target node from other nodes in the
    cluster. However, a malicious node can affect the reputation of legitimate nodes
    by giving them a low reputation score (bad mouthing attack). To determine if the
    information received is accurate, it is crucial to evaluate the reliability of
    the recommender. To counteract such attacks, the validity of the reputation score
    computed by node A is determined indirectly from other nodes using Eq. (11). $${\\text{VT}}_{{\\text{CH,A}}}
    \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right) = \\left| {\\mathop R\\nolimits_{{{\\text{score}}({\\text{A,B}})}}
    - \\mathop R\\nolimits_{{{\\text{avg}}({\\text{B}})}} } \\right|$$ (11) where,
    \\({\\text{VT}}_{{\\text{CH,A}}} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)\\) denotes the validation
    trust score of node A computed by the CH at the time interval \\(\\Delta T \\cdot
    \\mathop R\\nolimits_{{\\text{score(A,B)}}}\\) represents the reputation score
    of node A given to node B. \\(\\mathop R\\nolimits_{{\\text{score(A,B)}}}\\) is
    obtained based on other trust measures such as interaction trust, data trust,
    transmission trust, and identity trust. The average of all the trust measures
    gives the reputation score and \\(\\mathop {{\\text{RS}}}\\nolimits_{{\\text{avg(b)}}}\\)
    represents the average reputation score of node B obtained from other neighboring
    MNs (indirect) in the cluster. 3.3.2 Inter cluster trust The degree of trust built
    between several clusters in a WSN is referred to as inter-cluster trust. The inter-cluster
    trust is computed in two levels: CH-CH and BS-CH. 3.3.2.1 CH-CH level It demonstrates
    how much a CH trusts the information provided by other CHs in the network. The
    ability of the CHs in various clusters to acquire and convey data accurately and
    reliably is indicated by the amount of inter-cluster trust between them. The direct
    interaction trust of CH ‘Q’ is computed using Eq. (12). Formula 12 calculates
    the direct interaction trust of CH ‘Q’ in CH ‘P’. This trust value represents
    how much CH ‘Q’ relies on the information provided by CH ‘P’. The formula considers
    the accuracy and reliability of data shared by CH ‘P’ and CH ‘Q’s assessment of
    CH ‘P’s overall network activity. $$I_{{\\text{P,Q}}} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)
    = \\left[ {N_{TW} \\times \\left( {\\frac{{S_{{\\text{P,Q}}} \\left( {\\Delta
    T} \\right)}}{{S_{{\\text{P,Q}}} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right) + F_{{\\text{P,Q}}}
    \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)}} * \\frac{1}{\\varphi }\\left( {\\frac{{S_{{\\text{P,Q}}}
    \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)}}{{S_{{\\text{P,Q}}} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)
    + 1}}} \\right)^{\\beta } } \\right)} \\right]$$ (12) where, \\(S_{{\\text{P,Q}}}
    \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)\\) denotes the number of successful interaction of
    CH ‘P’ with CH ‘Q’ during the time window \\(\\Delta T\\), \\(F_{{\\text{P,Q}}}
    \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)\\) represents the number of failed interaction of
    CH ‘P’ with CH ‘Q’, \\(\\varphi\\) and \\(\\beta\\) signifies the penalty and
    pay factor that changes the trust value depending on the CH behavior. The indirect
    interaction trust of CH ‘Q’ is computed using Eq. (13). $$I^{\\prime}_{{\\text{P,Q}}}
    \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{n} {I_{{\\text{M,Q}}}
    \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)}$$ (13) where, \\(n\\) denotes total number of neighbors
    of CH ‘A’, \\(I_{{\\text{M,Q}}} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)\\) represents the
    direct interaction trust calculated by neighboring CH ‘M’ on node CH ‘Q’. 3.3.2.2
    BS-CH level It is essential for the BS to trust the data sent by CHs since it
    uses this data to make critical decisions. Therefore, the identity trust of CH
    ‘P’ is computed by using Eq. (14). $${\\text{ID}}_{P} \\left( {\\Delta T} \\right)
    = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} 1 \\hfill & {{\\text{IF}}\\,{\\text{ID}}_{P}
    = {\\text{ID}}\\left( {{\\text{Mat}}_{{{\\text{CH}}}} } \\right)} \\hfill \\\\
    0 \\hfill & {{\\text{otherwise}}} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$ (14)
    where, \\({\\text{ID}}_{{\\text{P}}}\\) represents the identity of CH ‘P’, \\({\\text{ID}}\\left(
    {{\\text{Mat}}_{{{\\text{CH}}}} } \\right)\\) represents the CH identities registered
    in matrix \\({\\text{Mat}}_{{{\\text{CH}}}}\\) by the BS. 3.4 Optimal route selection
    The encrypted data are then sent to the destination node via a secure and optimal
    path using the PL-COA algorithm. Algorithm 1 outlines the Optimal Route Selection
    process using the PL-COA. This algorithm is designed to efficiently find the best
    route for secure data transmission in a network of nodes. The process involves
    population initialization, dynamic location updates, fitness evaluation, and the
    utilization of Levy flights for exploration. The ultimate goal is to identify
    the optimal path for data transmission while considering factors like residual
    energy, distance, link quality, overhead, and trust. There are four categories
    of chimpanzees in a group named driver chimp, barrier chimp, chaser chimp, and
    attacker chimp. The drivers (source node) pursue the preys (destination node)
    but don’t try to catch them. Barriers put themselves in trees to block the way
    of the prey’s escape route (block the malicious nodes). Chasers (intermediate
    nodes) move quickly to catch their prey. When the target stops moving, the attackers
    (node closest to the destination) attack the prey and end the hunt. The paper
    uses this approach to identify the most efficient route to reach the destination
    node. Here, the prey is considered the destination node. In the context of environmental
    monitoring, our approach introduces two significant innovations. Firstly, the
    utilization of Levy flights for exploration enhances the algorithm’s ability to
    comprehensively survey the environmental parameters, making it adept at navigating
    intricate and multidimensional data spaces. This novel feature enables the algorithm
    to effectively avoid local optima and discover more optimal solutions in dynamic
    and complex environmental conditions. Secondly, our algorithm incorporates polarity-based
    learning, which empowers it to dynamically adjust its monitoring strategy based
    on the evolving environmental conditions and the presence of critical data patterns.
    By preventing the algorithm from becoming trapped in local data minima and allowing
    it to adapt to real-time environmental changes, these innovations significantly
    improve its performance in environmental monitoring applications, addressing a
    limitation in existing algorithms that often fail to consider these aspects and,
    as a result, struggle to adapt to changing environmental conditions effectively.
    This algorithm computes the fitness of the solution based on trust, delay, link
    quality, residual energy, and distance. The residual energy, distance, and link
    quality metrics improve the network lifetime and QoS. The trust metric helps to
    protect the network against various malicious attacks, while the delay metric
    reduces congestion. The chimp population \\(y_{i}^{0}\\) is randomly initialized
    at the beginning. 3.4.1 Fitness evaluation The optimal path is chosen based on
    the nodes with maximum residual energy, minimum distance, maximum link quality,
    maximum residual energy, and, minimum overhead. The objective is to maximize the
    fitness. The objective is to maximize fitness. To optimize the system, the objective
    is to increase the fitness value \\(F\\) in Eq. (15). $$\\mathop {F = wt_{1} E}\\nolimits_{res}
    + wt_{2} D\\left( {A,S} \\right) + wt_{3} \\mathop L\\nolimits_{qty} + wt_{4}
    O_{hd} + wt_{5} T$$ (15) The weights \\(w{t}_{1}\\), \\(w{t}_{2}\\), \\(w{t}_{3}\\),
    \\(w{t}_{4}\\), and \\(w{t}_{5}\\) are used to balance the importance of each
    objective function, where higher weights indicate higher priority. The values
    \\(w{t}_{1}=0.3\\), \\(w{t}_{2}=0.1\\), \\(w{t}_{3}=0.2\\), \\(w{t}_{4}=0.1\\),
    and \\(w{t}_{5}=0.3\\) adjusted such that \\(wt_{1} + wt_{2} + wt_{3} + wt_{4}
    + wt_{5} = 1\\). \\(\\mathop E\\nolimits_{res}\\), \\(D\\left( {A,S} \\right)\\),
    \\(\\mathop L\\nolimits_{qty}\\), \\(O_{hd}\\), and \\(T\\) are the residual energy,
    distance, link quality, overhead, and trust.  (i) Residual energy The residual
    energy of a SN is computed using Eq. (16). $$\\mathop E\\nolimits_{res} = \\mathop
    E\\nolimits_{ini} - \\mathop E\\nolimits_{T\\_con}$$ (16) where, \\(\\mathop E\\nolimits_{ini}\\)
    is the initial energy of a node and \\(\\mathop E\\nolimits_{T\\_con}\\) denotes
    the total energy consumed which can be determined using Eq. (17). $$\\mathop E\\nolimits_{T\\_con}
    = \\mathop E\\nolimits_{tx} + \\mathop E\\nolimits_{rx}$$ (17) where, \\(\\mathop
    E\\nolimits_{tx}\\) and \\(\\mathop E\\nolimits_{rx}\\) represents the energy
    consumed during data transmission and data reception which can be determined using
    Eq. (55) and Eq. (54).  (ii) Distance The distance between node A and sink S is
    computed by Eq. (18). $$D\\left( {\\text{A,S}} \\right) = \\sqrt {\\mathop {\\left(
    {\\mathop {X^{\\prime}}\\nolimits_{{\\text{A}}} - \\mathop {X^{\\prime}}\\nolimits_{{\\text{S}}}
    } \\right)}\\nolimits^{2} + \\mathop {\\left( {\\mathop {Y^{\\prime}}\\nolimits_{{\\text{A}}}
    - \\mathop {Y^{\\prime}}\\nolimits_{{\\text{S}}} } \\right)}\\nolimits^{2} }$$
    (18) where, \\(\\left( {\\mathop {X^{\\prime}}\\nolimits_{{\\text{A}}} ,\\mathop
    {X^{\\prime}}\\nolimits_{{\\text{S}}} } \\right)\\) and \\(\\left( {\\mathop {Y^{\\prime}}\\nolimits_{{\\text{A}}}
    ,\\mathop {Y^{\\prime}}\\nolimits_{{\\text{S}}} } \\right)\\) are the coordinates
    of the node A and sink S respectively.  (iii) Link quality The link quality of
    two nodes A and B is computed using Eq. (19). $$\\mathop L\\nolimits_{{{\\text{qty}}}}
    = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} 1 \\hfill & {{\\text{if}}\\,{\\text{dist}}\\left(
    {\\text{A,B}} \\right) \\le \\mathop R\\nolimits_{{{\\text{com}}}} } \\hfill \\\\
    0 \\hfill & {{\\text{otherwise}}} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$ (19)
    where, \\(\\,dist\\left( {A,B} \\right)\\) represents the distance between node
    \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(\\mathop R\\nolimits_{com}\\) represents the node’s communication
    range.  (iv) Overhead The overhead of a node A is computed by using Eq. (20) $$O_{hd}
    = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {1,} \\hfill & {{\\text{if}}\\,L_{{{\\text{queue}}}}
    \\left( {\\text{A}} \\right) \\le \\mathop L\\nolimits_{\\min } } \\hfill \\\\
    {0,} \\hfill & {{\\text{otherwise}}} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$ (20)
    where, \\(L_{{{\\text{queue}}}} \\left( {\\text{A}} \\right)\\) denotes the queue
    length of node A and \\(\\mathop L\\nolimits_{\\min }\\) denotes the minimum queue
    length.  (v) Trust During data transmission, the trust \\(T\\) of a node or CH
    is determined based on the multi-level hierarchical trust evaluation approach
    provided in Sect. 3.3. 3.4.2 Driving and chasing the prey The current location
    of the chimp is denoted as given in Eq. (21). $$Z_{{{\\text{chimp}}}} \\left(
    {t + 1} \\right) = Z_{{{\\text{prey}}}} \\left( t \\right) - d \\cdot C$$ (21)
    where, \\(Z_{{{\\text{prey}}}} \\left( t \\right)\\) denotes the location of the
    prey, the parameters \\(d\\) and \\(C\\) are computed using Eqs. (22) and (23).
    $$d = 2 \\cdot h \\cdot s_{1} - h$$ (22) $$C = \\left| {m \\cdot Z_{{{\\text{prey}}}}
    \\left( t \\right) - n \\cdot Z_{{{\\text{chimp}}}} \\left( t \\right)} \\right|$$
    (23) where, \\(s_{1}\\) and \\(s_{2}\\) represents the random number in the range
    [0, 1], \\(n\\) represents chaotic map vector, and the coefficient \\(h\\) is
    decreased from 2.5 to 0 nonlinearly, \\(m = 2s_{2}\\). 3.4.3 Exploration Exploration
    involves searching the entire search space to find new solutions. It is assumed
    that the attacker is in the same location as the prey. The attacker’s location
    could then be used to change the location of the driver, barrier, and chaser.
    The other chimp’s locations are updated to the best chimp’s locations as given
    in Eqs. (24) to (28). $$Z_{1} = Z_{A} \\left( t \\right) - d_{1} \\cdot C_{A}$$
    (24) $$Z_{2} = Z_{B} \\left( t \\right) - d_{2} \\cdot C_{B}$$ (25) $$Z_{3} =
    Z_{C} \\left( t \\right) - d_{3} \\cdot C_{C}$$ (26) $${Z}_{4}={Z}_{D}\\left(t\\right)-{d}_{4}\\cdot
    {C}_{D}$$ (27) $$Z\\left( {t + 1} \\right) = \\frac{{Z_{1} + Z_{2} + Z_{3} + Z_{4}
    }}{4}$$ (28) where, \\(t\\) represents the present iteration, \\(Z_{A} \\left(
    t \\right)\\), \\(Z_{B} \\left( t \\right)\\), \\(Z_{C} \\left( t \\right)\\),
    and \\(Z_{D} \\left( t \\right)\\) represents the attacker chimp, barrier chimp,
    chaser chimp, and driver chimp’s location respectively. The value of \\(d\\) for
    various chimps can be computed similar to Eq. (22) and \\(C\\) can be computed
    using Eqs. (29) to (32). $$C_{A} = \\left| {m_{1} \\cdot Z_{A} \\left( t \\right)
    - n_{1} \\cdot Z\\left( t \\right)} \\right|$$ (29) $$C_{B} = \\left| {m_{2} \\cdot
    Z_{B} \\left( t \\right) - n_{2} \\cdot Z\\left( t \\right)} \\right|$$ (30) $$C_{C}
    = \\left| {m_{3} \\cdot Z_{C} \\left( t \\right) - n_{3} \\cdot Z\\left( t \\right)}
    \\right|$$ (31) $$C_{D} = \\left| {m_{4} \\cdot Z_{D} \\left( t \\right) - n_{4}
    \\cdot Z\\left( t \\right)} \\right|$$ (32) 3.4.4 Exploitation Utilizing information
    from past iterations, exploitation improves the exploration of potential solutions.
    In addition to the \\(d\\) and \\(m\\) parameters specified in the exploration
    phase, an additional parameter introduced in the exploitation phase determines
    how to prevent local minima trapping. If \\(\\left| d \\right|\\) is higher than
    one, the chimpanzees are pushed to depart from the prey (preventing local optima
    entrapment), but if \\(\\left| d \\right|\\) is less than one, the chimps are
    driven to converge at global optima. The following Eq. (33) models the updating
    process in this technique. $$Z_{{{\\text{chimp}}}} \\left( {t + 1} \\right) =
    \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {Z_{{{\\text{prey}}}} \\left( t \\right) - d
    \\cdot C} & {\\mu < 0.5} \\\\ {{\\text{choatic}}\\,{\\text{value}}} & {\\mu >
    0.5} \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$ (33) where, \\(\\mu\\) denotes random number
    in [0, 1]. 3.4.5 Polarity-based learning In general, when the initial solutions
    in metaheuristic algorithms are closer to the optimal location, convergence occurs
    quickly; else, slow convergence occurs. Polarity learning finds the optimal solution
    by looking at the opposite search space. The polarity learning then selects the
    best path among all possible paths.  (i) Polarity Number The following can be
    used to identify a polarity-based number. Let’s say \\(y_{0}\\) is a real number
    that falls within an interval \\(y_{0} \\in \\left[ {p,q} \\right]\\), the opposite
    number of \\(y_{0}\\) is determined by Eq. (34). $$\\overline{y}_{0} \\in p +
    q - y_{0}$$ (34) Similarly, the opposite point is given by Eqs. (35) and (36).
    $$y = y_{1} ,y_{2} , \\ldots ,y_{D}$$ (35) $$\\overline{y} = \\overline{y}_{1}
    ,\\overline{y}_{2} , \\ldots ,\\overline{y}_{D}$$ (36) Equation (37) is used to
    calculate the values of each item in \\(\\overline{y}\\). $$\\overline{y}_{l}
    = p_{l} + q_{l} - y_{l}$$ (37) where, \\(l = 1,2,3, \\ldots ,D\\). If \\(f\\left(
    {y_{0} } \\right)\\) is greater than \\(f\\left( {\\overline{y}_{0} } \\right)\\),
    then \\(y_{0}\\) remains unchanged; else, \\(y_{0} = \\overline{y}_{0}\\); thus,
    population solutions are updated depending upon the better value of \\(y_{0}\\)
    and \\(\\overline{y}_{0}\\).  (ii) Levy flights (LF) LF is focused on a heavy-tailed
    probability distribution for random walks to explore the search space efficiently
    using step length and potentially find better solutions. Traditional random walks
    tend to get trapped in local optima, but Levy flight can make larger jumps and
    explore farther away regions of the search space, increasing the chance of finding
    better solutions. The Levy distribution computed using Eq. (38) is used to identify
    a probability function, from which the step sizes of LF are calculated. $$L\\left(
    {y_{i} } \\right) = \\left| {y_{i} } \\right|^{1 - \\gamma }$$ (38) where, \\(y_{i}\\)
    denotes the flight length, \\(1 < \\gamma \\le 2\\) signifies the power law exponent.
    The Levy probability density in integral form is determined using Eq. (39). $$f_{L}
    \\left( {y;\\gamma ,\\alpha } \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\pi }\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty
    } {\\exp \\left( { - \\alpha q^{\\gamma } } \\right)} \\cos \\left( {qy} \\right){\\text{d}}q$$
    (39) where, \\(\\alpha\\) denotes the scale unit, \\(\\gamma\\) signifies the
    distribution index. When \\(y\\) has a large value, Eq. (39) typically require
    series expansion as given in Eq. (40). $$f_{L} \\left( {y;\\gamma ,\\alpha } \\right)
    \\approx \\frac{{\\alpha \\Gamma \\left( {1 + \\gamma } \\right)\\sin \\left(
    {\\frac{\\pi \\gamma }{2}} \\right)}}{{\\pi y^{{\\left( {1 + \\gamma } \\right)}}
    }},y \\to \\infty$$ (40) where, \\(\\Gamma\\) signifies gamma function. Random
    numbers are produced using the Magneta technique based on the Levy distribution
    as given in Eq. (41). $$levy\\left( \\gamma \\right) = 0.05 \\times \\frac{y}{{\\left|
    z \\right|^{1/\\gamma } }}$$ (41) where, \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) represents two normal
    distribution variables computed using Eq. (42) and Eq. (43) \\(\\sigma_{y}\\)
    and \\(\\sigma_{z}\\) represents the standard deviation of \\(y\\) and \\(z\\).
    $$y = {\\text{Normal}}\\left( {0,\\sigma_{y}^{2} } \\right)$$ (42) $$z = {\\text{Normal}}\\left(
    {0,\\sigma_{z}^{2} } \\right)$$ (43) $$\\sigma_{y} = \\left[ {\\frac{{\\Gamma
    \\left( {1 + \\gamma } \\right)\\sin \\left( {\\frac{\\pi \\gamma }{2}} \\right)}}{{\\Gamma
    \\frac{{\\left( {1 + \\gamma } \\right)}}{2}\\gamma 2^{{\\frac{{\\left( {\\gamma
    - 1} \\right)}}{2}}} }}} \\right]^{1/\\gamma } ,\\sigma_{z} = 1,\\gamma = 1.5$$
    (44) The new location after applying LF becomes, $$\\overline{C}_{A} = levy\\left(
    \\gamma \\right) \\otimes \\left| {m_{1} \\cdot Z_{A} \\left( t \\right) - n_{1}
    \\cdot Z\\left( t \\right)} \\right|$$ (45) $$\\overline{C}_{B} = levy\\left(
    \\gamma \\right) \\otimes \\left| {m_{2} \\cdot Z_{B} \\left( t \\right) - n_{2}
    \\cdot Z\\left( t \\right)} \\right|$$ (46) $$\\overline{C}_{C} = levy\\left(
    \\gamma \\right) \\otimes \\left| {m_{3} \\cdot Z_{C} \\left( t \\right) - n_{3}
    \\cdot Z\\left( t \\right)} \\right|$$ (47) $$\\overline{C}_{D} = levy\\left(
    \\gamma \\right) \\otimes \\left| {m_{4} \\cdot Z_{D} \\left( t \\right) - n_{4}
    \\cdot Z\\left( t \\right)} \\right|$$ (48) $$\\overline{Z}_{1} = Z_{A} \\left(
    t \\right) - d_{1} \\cdot \\overline{C}_{A}$$ (49) $$\\overline{Z}_{2} = Z_{B}
    \\left( t \\right) - d_{2} \\cdot \\overline{C}_{B}$$ (50) $$\\overline{Z}_{3}
    = Z_{C} \\left( t \\right) - d_{3} \\cdot \\overline{C}_{C}$$ (51) $$\\overline{Z}_{4}
    = Z_{D} \\left( t \\right) - d_{4} \\cdot \\overline{C}_{D}$$ (52) The algorithm
    1 stops the process when the optimal path is found out or when \\(I_{\\max }\\)
    is reached. 4 Simulation results and analysis The proposed ML-HSOR protocol is
    implemented in Python 3.9 and the obtained results are compared with the recent
    existing techniques such as EACMRP-MS [29], DBN [30], VLBR [31], EERI-GWO [32],
    and E-GLBR [33] in terms of energy consumption, delay, detection rate, throughput,
    etc. Table 2 gives the parameter settings used for implementing the proposed ML-HSOR
    method. Table 2 Parameter setup Full size table 4.1 Simulation setup The proposed
    ML-HSOR protocol is implemented in Python 3.9. The implementation relies on NumPy
    for efficient numerical operations and array manipulations, Matplotlib and Seaborn
    for compelling data visualization, and scikit-learn’s StandardScaler module to
    standardize input data. The Cryptography library’s Fernet module is employed for
    secure encryption processes, while SymPy enhances the simulation’s mathematical
    modeling capabilities. Additionally, Python’s built-in libraries, such as ‘uuid’
    for universal identifier generation and ‘random’ for random number generation,
    contribute to the robustness of the simulation setup. The simulation also utilizes
    the LT-FS-ID intrusion detection dataset [42], which includes information such
    as area, sensing range, transmission range, and the number of sensor nodes. The
    dataset’s target variable is the “Number of barriers”, which is predicted during
    the simulation. It is important to note that this dataset is synthetically generated
    through Monte Carlo simulations. 4.2 Evaluation metrics The metrics used for evaluating
    the proposed ML-HSOR method are defined in this section.  (i) Energy Consumption
    The energy consumed in the network can be computed by using Eq. (53). $$E_{con}
    = (E_{rx} \\times N_{T} ) + E_{tx}$$ (53) where, \\(N_{T}\\) denotes the total
    number of nodes, \\(E_{rx}\\) and \\(E_{tx}\\) represents the energy consumed
    during reception and transmission respectively. $$E_{rx} = M_{bits} E_{elec}$$
    (54) where, \\(M_{bits}\\) signifies the number of bits in the message, the energy
    needed to activate electronic circuits during reception is expressed as \\(\\mathop
    E\\nolimits_{elec}\\). The required energy to run the transmitter is given by
    Eq. (55). $$E_{tx} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {M_{bits} E_{elec} + M_{bits}
    \\varepsilon_{fs} d^{2} ,} & {d < d_{0} } \\\\ {M_{bits} E_{elec} + M_{bits} \\varepsilon_{amp}
    d^{4} ,} & {d \\ge d_{0} } \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$ (55) where \\(d_{0}
    = \\sqrt {\\frac{{\\varepsilon_{fs} }}{{\\varepsilon_{amp} }}}\\), \\(d\\) indicates
    the distance between the source and the destination node, \\(\\mathop \\varepsilon
    \\nolimits_{amp}\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_{fs}\\) indicates the dissipated energy
    in the transmit amplifier and the energy lost in free space respectively.  (ii)
    Delay It refers to the time it takes for data to be transmitted from one node
    to another. It can be computed using Eq. (56). $${\\text{Dly}} = \\sum\\limits_{i,j
    = 1}^{n} {\\frac{{At_{j} - St_{i} }}{{N_{{{\\text{con}}}} }}}$$ (56) where, \\(\\mathop
    {St}\\nolimits_{i}\\) is the time at which the packet is sent from node i, \\(\\mathop
    {At}\\nolimits_{j}\\) is the time at which the packet is received at node j, \\(N_{{{\\text{con}}}}\\)
    indicates number of connections that is made between the source and destination.  (iii)
    PDR It is a metric used to measure the percentage of data packets transmitted
    by a sender that are successfully received by the intended recipient. It is computed
    by using Eq. (57). $${\\text{PDR}} = \\frac{{P_{{{\\text{DN}}}} }}{{P_{{{\\text{SN}}}}
    }} \\times 100$$ (57) where, \\(P_{{{\\text{DN}}}}\\) denotes the data packets
    received by the destination node (DN) and \\(P_{{{\\text{SN}}}}\\) denotes the
    data packets sent by the sender node.  (iv) Throughput It is the volume of data
    that can be sent across a communication link in a specific amount of time. Typically,
    it is expressed in bits per second (bps) and can be estimated using Eq. (58).
    $${\\text{Throughput}} = \\frac{{\\mathop P\\nolimits_{{d\\left( {{\\text{DN}}}
    \\right)}} }}{{\\mathop T\\nolimits_{{{\\text{sim}}}} }} \\times 100$$ (58) where,
    \\(\\mathop T\\nolimits_{{{\\text{sim}}}}\\) indicates the simulation time and
    \\(\\mathop P\\nolimits_{{d\\left( {DN} \\right)}}\\) represents the packets delivered
    to the destination.  (v) Detection Rate It is used to calculate the proportion
    of events or occurrences observed by the network’s sensor nodes like environmental
    tracking, spying, etc. Detection rate is computed using Eq. (59). $$\\mathop D\\nolimits_{r}
    = \\frac{{\\mathop T\\nolimits_{\\det } }}{{T_{{{\\text{act}}}} }} \\times 100$$
    (59) where, \\(\\mathop T\\nolimits_{{{\\text{det}}}}\\) signifies the sum of
    malicious nodes that are detected and \\(T_{{{\\text{act}}}}\\) denotes the actual
    number of malicious nodes.  (vi) Network Lifetime It the amount of time the network
    can operate effectively before the batteries of the sensor nodes run out or the
    nodes begin to fail or malfunction. 4.3 Comparative analysis The reduction in
    energy consumption and delay holds paramount importance in the context of Quality
    of Service (QoS) for IoT wireless sensor networks (WSNs), particularly in applications
    like environmental monitoring. It directly affects the network’s efficiency, reliability,
    and overall performance. IoT WSNs are often deployed in remote or inaccessible
    areas, where replacing sensor node batteries is impractical. Minimizing energy
    consumption is essential for prolonging network lifetime. This extended network
    lifespan, as demonstrated by the ML-HSOR protocol, reduces maintenance and operational
    costs, making it highly practical for long-term deployments. Real-time monitoring
    applications, such as environmental sensing, surveillance, and industrial control,
    rely on low-latency data transmission. High end-to-end delays can result in missed
    critical events, affecting the timeliness and effectiveness of decision-making
    processes. ML-HSOR’s reduced delay ensures that data reaches the application layer
    promptly, making it suitable for time-sensitive applications. In addition to energy
    consumption and delay, other performance indicators also play pivotal roles in
    evaluating the effectiveness of the ML-HSOR protocol. High throughput, as achieved
    by the ML-HSOR protocol, is essential for IoT applications requiring real-time
    data transmission. In environmental monitoring, for example, rapid data transfer
    ensures that environmental changes are reported promptly, enabling timely response
    to critical events. The high throughput of ML-HSOR enhances its practicality in
    these applications. Maintaining a high PDR is crucial in IoT WSNs, especially
    in applications like surveillance and environmental monitoring, where data accuracy
    is paramount. By enhancing PDR through the prevention of gray-hole attacks, ML-HSOR
    ensures that the collected data are dependable, making it highly suitable for
    applications demanding data integrity and trustworthiness. A longer network lifetime,
    as demonstrated by ML-HSOR, is of immense practical value in remote and challenging
    deployment scenarios. Reduced maintenance and prolonged operational lifespans
    reduce the costs and logistical challenges associated with battery replacement,
    making it a cost-effective solution for applications in remote or hostile environments.
    High detection rates are essential for ensuring the security of IoT WSNs. By improving
    the detection rate of malicious nodes, the ML-HSOR protocol enhances network security
    and reliability. This is of paramount importance in critical infrastructure protection
    and surveillance applications, where the detection of malicious events is imperative.
    The proposed ML-HSOR protocol is evaluated by comparing its performance to established
    techniques, such as EACMRP-MS [29], DBN [30], VLBR [31], EERI-GWO [32], and E-GLBR
    [33]. By altering the number of nodes, Fig. 5 provides an analysis of energy consumption
    across different methods. It is observed that the proposed ML-HSOR method has
    consumed less energy compared to the existing methods such as EACMRP-MS [29],
    DBN [30], VLBR [31], EERI-GWO [32], and E-GLBR [33]. The consumption of energy
    by the existing EACMRP-MS [29], DBN [30], VLBR [31], EERI-GWO [32], and E-GLBR
    [33] methods are 1.0 J, 1.2 J, 1.1 J, 0.5 J, and 0.7 J when the number of nodes
    is raised to 500 whereas ML-HSOR has the lowest energy consumption, at 0.39 J.
    Energy-efficient CH selection and routing contribute to minimizing the energy
    consumption of the proposed ML-HSOR protocol. Fig. 5 Energy consumption analysis
    Full size image ML-HSOR exhibits dynamic adaptability by adjusting energy consumption
    strategies based on real-time variations in network conditions and node characteristics.
    The comparative analysis explores the protocol’s effective handling of varying
    traffic levels, showcasing its prowess in optimizing energy consumption under
    fluctuating communication demands. Additionally, the theoretical framework of
    ML-HSOR is scrutinized for resilience to changes in network topology, emphasizing
    its capacity to maintain energy efficiency even in dynamic Wireless Sensor Network
    (WSN) environments. The protocol’s robustness extends to fault tolerance, with
    an in-depth exploration of its capabilities for fault recovery and energy optimization
    in the face of node failures or network disturbances. ML-HSOR’s scalability is
    a notable feature, ensuring sustained energy efficiency as the network scales,
    making it applicable across both small and large-scale deployments. The protocol’s
    adaptability to varying transmission ranges is investigated theoretically, shedding
    light on its effectiveness in optimizing energy consumption for different communication
    distances. Furthermore, the analysis delves into latency considerations, investigating
    how ML-HSOR minimizes delays, contributing to its overall energy-efficient operation.
    A nuanced understanding of trade-offs within ML-HSOR, striking a balance between
    energy efficiency and communication reliability, adds depth to the assessment
    of its performance characteristics. The ML-HSOR protocol significantly minimizes
    energy consumption, making it well-suited for long-term, remote deployments common
    in environmental monitoring. This is achieved through a dynamic Markov model for
    CH selection, which intelligently considers real-time energy levels and network
    conditions. By ensuring judicious selection of CHs and employing energy-efficient
    routing mechanisms, the protocol optimizes energy consumption. Techniques such
    as data aggregation and intelligent path selection play a vital role in reducing
    the energy footprint of the protocol. This reduction in energy consumption has
    direct practical implications in environmental monitoring. IoT sensors deployed
    in remote areas, such as rainforests, wildlife reserves, or Arctic ecosystems,
    can operate for extended periods without the need for frequent battery replacements.
    The cost savings and logistical benefits of this approach are particularly relevant
    in environmental conservation and biodiversity studies. One of the key factors
    that have a significant impact on the quality of service (QoS) of IoT-based wireless
    sensor networks is a delay. For real-time monitoring applications, it is required
    to maintain less delay. High delays occur due to factors such as network congestion
    or high processing time. When the network has 500 nodes, the delay for the existing
    methods such as EACMRP-MS [29], DBN [30], VLBR [31], EERI-GWO [32], and E-GLBR
    [33] are 0.08 s, 0.09 s, 0.084 s, 0.065 s, and 0.078 s. The outcomes from Fig.
    6 show that the ML-HSOR protocol has less delay of 0.058s compared to the existing
    methods such as EACMRP-MS [29], DBN [30], VLBR [31], EERI-GWO [32], and E-GLBR
    [33]. The delay is minimized by transmitting the packet via the path that has
    less overload/congestion. Fig. 6 End-to end delay analysis Full size image Low-latency
    data transmission, as demonstrated by the ML-HSOR protocol, is essential for real-time
    environmental monitoring. Environmental changes and critical events can occur
    at any time, and minimizing end-to-end delay is crucial for timely response. By
    dynamically evaluating network conditions and selecting paths with minimal congestion,
    the protocol reduces delay. This is particularly important in applications like
    wildfire detection, where timely data transmission can help mitigate ecological
    damage and protect human lives. The ML-HSOR protocol’s ability to minimize delays
    directly enhances its practicality in environmental monitoring scenarios. Throughput
    is a crucial metric in WSNs because it shows how well the network can transmit
    data. It depends on a number of variables, including the size of the network,
    the type of transmission medium, and the data-transfer routing protocol. High
    throughput is preferred because it guarantees that data can be transmitted quickly
    and effectively, allowing applications to receive data on time. For instance,
    high throughput is crucial in applications like environmental monitoring to ensure
    that the data are transmitted in real time and can be analyzed quickly to make
    informed decisions. From Fig. 7, it can be observed that the proposed ML-HSOR
    protocol has a high throughput of 48,000 bps compared to the existing methods
    such as EACMRP-MS [29], DBN [30], VLBR [31], EERI-GWO [32], and E-GLBR [33]. Based
    on the analysis, DBN has the least throughput of 30,000 bps followed by VLBR (38,000
    bps), EACMRP-MS (39,000 bps), E-GLBR (45,000 bps), and EERI-GWO (47,000 bps).
    Since the PL-COA algorithm converges quickly by using polarity learning and levy
    flight, the throughput is increased. Fig. 7 Throughput analysis Full size image
    The PL-COA algorithm, incorporating polarity learning and Levy flight, enhances
    the protocol’s search for optimal data transmission paths. This results in faster
    and more efficient data transfer, crucial for applications like environmental
    monitoring that require real-time data analysis. High throughput, which the ML-HSOR
    protocol excels at, is indispensable in applications like environmental monitoring.
    The ability to transfer data quickly is essential for real-time data analysis.
    For example, in the context of tracking climate parameters in rapidly changing
    environments, high throughput is crucial for ensuring that data reaches the application
    layer promptly. The protocol’s enhanced throughput is particularly relevant for
    applications where timely decision-making is imperative. PDR measures the dependability
    of the communication link between a sender and a receiver in a WSN. A high PDR
    indicates that the majority of packets are received successfully, whereas a low
    PDR indicates that a significant number of packets are lost during transmission.
    PDR is especially important for applications requiring reliable data delivery,
    such as surveillance and environmental monitoring, because a high PDR ensures
    that the collected data are accurate and complete. From Fig. 8, it can be seen
    that the PDR of the proposed ML-HSOR protocol is higher (99.8% for 500 nodes)
    than the existing methods such as EACMRP-MS (96.5%), DBN (93.0%), VLBR (95.0%),
    EERIGWO (98.9%), and E-GLBR (97.5%). The PDR is increased by preventing gray-hole
    attacks using the data trust metric. Fig. 8 PDR analysis Full size image ML-HSOR
    employs a data trust metric and a multi-level hierarchical trust evaluation, which
    significantly enhance the PDR. These measures efficiently detect and mitigate
    gray-hole attacks, ensuring reliable data delivery. A high PDR, as achieved by
    the ML-HSOR protocol, is vital for applications like environmental sensing and
    surveillance. In these scenarios, data accuracy and completeness are critical.
    By efficiently detecting and preventing gray-hole attacks, the protocol ensures
    that data collected for environmental analysis is reliable and trustworthy. This
    trustworthiness is vital for making informed decisions based on sensor data, such
    as those required for pollution control or wildlife conservation. Network lifetime
    refers to the time duration for which the network can operate effectively before
    the batteries of the sensor nodes are depleted or the nodes start to malfunction
    or fail. The network lifetime is a crucial metric in WSNs, especially in applications
    where the nodes are deployed in remote locations, and battery replacement or maintenance
    is difficult or impossible. A longer network lifetime is needed in such applications
    to minimize the cost required to operate the network. From Fig. 9, it is observed
    that the proposed ML-HSOR method has 250 alive sensors at the end of 36,000 rounds
    and EERI-GWO method has 200 alive sensors at the end of 36,000 rounds. On the
    other hand, all the other existing methods such as EACMRP-MS [29], DBN [30], VLBR
    [31], and E-GLBR [33] have no alive sensors at the end of 36,000 rounds. The analysis
    from Fig. 9 shows that the network lifetime of the proposed ML-HSOR method is
    high compared to the existing methods such as EACMRP-MS [29], DBN [30], VLBR [31],
    EERI-GWO [32], and E-GLBR [33]. The dynamic change in CH by the Markov model helps
    to increase the network lifetime. Fig. 9 Network lifetime analysis Full size image
    The extended network lifetime achieved by ML-HSOR is crucial for remote and challenging
    deployment scenarios. The dynamic change in CHs, guided by the Markov model, effectively
    optimizes energy usage and node lifespan. This is particularly vital in remote
    locations where battery replacement or maintenance is challenging. Deployments
    in remote or hostile environments, such as ocean monitoring or desert climate
    studies, benefit from prolonged network lifespans. Reduced maintenance requirements
    and operational longevity are cost-effective and logistical advantages in scenarios
    where sensor nodes are challenging to access. In an IoT-based WSN, high detection
    rate relies on the security level of the protocol used. A high detection rate
    indicates that the sensor nodes are efficient at detecting malicious events, whereas
    a low detection rate suggests that some malicious events are missed or not noticed
    by the nodes. When 25 malicious nodes are deployed in the network, the proposed
    ML-HSOR protocol has the highest detection rate of 95% and DBN has the lowest
    detection rate of 45%. The outcomes obtained from Fig. 10 show that, compared
    to existing methods, the proposed ML-HSOR protocol demonstrates a high detection
    rate. This is because the multi-level hierarchical trust evaluation in the proposed
    ML-HSOR protocol increased the detection rate of the malicious nodes. Fig. 10
    Detection rate analysis Full size image ML-HSOR implements a multi-level hierarchical
    trust evaluation that elevates the detection rate of malicious nodes. This trust-based
    approach ensures enhanced security and reliability in IoT-based WSNs. In environmental
    monitoring, maintaining a high detection rate is critical. Malicious events or
    sensor malfunctions can have adverse ecological consequences. By employing a multi-level
    hierarchical trust evaluation, the ML-HSOR protocol enhances the detection rate
    of malicious nodes, ensuring the security and reliability of the monitoring network.
    This is invaluable in applications like forest fire detection and pollution tracking,
    where the identification of anomalies is imperative for environmental protection.
    The ML-HSOR model distinguishes itself through a myriad of distinctive features,
    setting it apart from the other models under comparison. A key highlight is its
    adaptive clustering approach, dynamically adjusting attribute weighting in real
    time during cluster head (CH) selection—an aspect that optimizes network lifespan
    and performance. Furthermore, ML-HSOR confronts the challenge posed by malicious
    nodes by introducing a unique multi-level hierarchical trust evaluation approach.
    Factors like interaction trust and identity trust are considered, significantly
    bolstering network security. To counteract garnishing attacks, ML-HSOR introduces
    an innovative time-window mechanism, systematically observing node behavior over
    specific periods to conduct effective trustworthiness assessments. Security enhancements
    in ML-HSOR extend to the use of timestamps and the application of the improved
    blowfish algorithm (IBFA) for encryption. These advanced security measures ensure
    data integrity and confidentiality, providing an additional layer of protection.
    Noteworthy are ML-HSOR’s optimization strategies involving the PL-COA algorithm,
    polarity-based learning, and Levy flights. This combination presents a unique
    approach for efficient exploration and data surveying in complex environmental
    spaces, demonstrating greater superiority when compared to other models. Thus,
    ML-HSOR emerges as a comprehensive and advanced solution, adeptly addressing specific
    challenges in wireless sensor networks through its dynamic adaptability, enhanced
    security measures, and unique optimization techniques. In conclusion, the ML-HSOR
    protocol’s superior performance in energy consumption, delay reduction, and other
    evaluation metrics carries substantial practical implications for environmental
    monitoring. The reduction in energy consumption enhances the protocol’s suitability
    for long-term deployments in remote areas, reducing operational costs and logistical
    challenges. Its low-latency data transmission capabilities make it suitable for
    real-time monitoring, ensuring timely response to critical environmental events.
    These features position the protocol for applications such as air quality monitoring,
    wildlife conservation, climate change research, and natural disaster monitoring.
    The high PDR, throughput, network lifetime, and detection rate further enhance
    its applicability in environmental monitoring, providing reliable, timely, and
    cost-effective data collection and analysis. Overall, the ML-HSOR protocol’s remarkable
    performance metrics directly translate into its relevance and significance in
    real-world scenarios across various industries and applications, with a strong
    emphasis on environmental monitoring. 4.4 Simulation on LT-FS-ID dataset The proposed
    model is simulated using the LT-FS-ID intrusion detection dataset and compared
    with other standard models, including EACMRP-MS [29], DBN [30], VLBR [31], EERIGWO
    [32], and E-GLBR [33], across five evaluation metrics: correlation coefficient
    (R), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, and computational
    time. The corresponding values are presented in Table 3. Table 3 Simulated results
    for different models in LT-FS-ID dataset Full size table The ML-HSOR model presents
    a holistic and advanced solution for wireless sensor networks, particularly evident
    in its superior performance compared to other models as given in Table 3. In terms
    of the trust process, ML-HSOR exhibits exceptional adaptability through its adaptive
    clustering and Cluster Head (CH) selection, as demonstrated by its significantly
    higher correlation coefficient (R: 0.95) compared to EACMRP-MS (0.89), DBN (0.92),
    VLBR (0.88), EERI-GWO (0.91), and E-GLBR (0.87). This signifies ML-HSOR’s ability
    to dynamically adjust attributes in real time, ensuring precise CH selection.
    In the routing process, ML-HSOR excels in optimized path determination, achieving
    the lowest root-mean-square error (RMSE: 2.1) and Mean Squared Error (MSE: 4.41)
    among all models. This showcases its proficiency in selecting optimal paths for
    data transfer, contributing to enhanced network stability and lifetime. Furthermore,
    ML-HSOR’s security assessments exhibit a remarkable level of precision, reflected
    in its high correlation coefficient (R: 0.95) and low RMSE and MSE values (2.1
    and 4.41, respectively). This precision reinforces its seamless integration of
    trust considerations into the network, ensuring reliable security assessments.
    The model also demonstrates a strong correlation between security and energy consumption,
    guiding accurate and energy-efficient decisions. Its low RMSE and MSE values (2.1
    and 4.41) in the context of energy consumption emphasize its effectiveness in
    predicting and optimizing energy usage based on trust information. Additionally,
    ML-HSOR’s efficient computational time (20 ms) positions it as a practical and
    effective choice for real-time applications, ensuring timely security and energy-related
    decisions. Therefore, ML-HSOR emerges as a comprehensive and advanced solution,
    adeptly addressing specific challenges in wireless sensor networks through its
    dynamic adaptability, enhanced security measures, and unique optimization techniques.

    metrics of simulated results on LT-FS-ID dataset Full size image 5 Conclusion
    In conclusion, the secure and optimal routing method in IoT-based environmental
    monitoring WSN that employs the improved chimp optimization algorithm is a promising
    approach for achieving high performance and reliability in WSNs. By computing
    the fitness of the nodes based on residual energy, distance to the destination,
    link quality, delay, and trust, this method ensures a high packet delivery ratio
    (PDR), high throughput, low delay, a high detection rate, and low energy consumption.
    Moreover, the multi-level trust evaluation approach helps to detect and avoid
    malicious nodes, making the network more secure and reliable. The improved chimp
    optimization algorithm and the trust evaluation approach provide an effective
    solution for addressing the challenges of routing in WSNs, making it suitable
    for applications like environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, and industrial
    automation. ML-HSOR significantly reduces energy consumption through intelligent
    CH selection, energy-efficient routing, data aggregation, and path optimization.
    This translates into extended network lifespans, making it an ideal choice for
    long-term deployments in remote and inaccessible areas where frequent battery
    replacements are impractical. ML-HSOR’s ability to minimize end-to-end delay ensures
    that data reach the application layer promptly. This is critical for real-time
    environmental monitoring, enabling timely responses to crucial events like wildfire
    detection. The protocol’s high throughput, achieved through the PL-COA algorithm,
    ensures that data can be transmitted quickly and efficiently. This is particularly
    relevant for applications like environmental monitoring, where real-time data
    analysis is essential for informed decision-making. Also, ML-HSOR excels in PDR
    by employing data trust metrics and multi-level hierarchical trust evaluations.
    This enhances data accuracy and completeness, vital for applications requiring
    reliable data delivery, such as surveillance and environmental monitoring. The
    protocol effectively prolongs network lifespans by optimizing energy usage and
    node lifespan through dynamic CH selection guided by the Markov model. This is
    a crucial benefit in remote or challenging deployment scenarios. ML-HSOR’s high
    detection rate of malicious nodes, achieved through a multi-level hierarchical
    trust evaluation, ensures the security and reliability of environmental monitoring
    networks. This is indispensable for identifying anomalies that could have adverse
    ecological consequences. Overall, this method is a promising approach for achieving
    efficient and secure routing in IoT-WSNs. Future works will focus on enhancing
    the security against other attacks and testing the scalability. Specifically,
    we aim to fortify security by addressing a broader spectrum of threats, including
    advanced intrusion techniques, emerging AI-driven attacks, and quantum computing-based
    vulnerabilities. Simultaneously, we will focus on ensuring the scalability of
    the methodology for larger networks, possibly encompassing thousands or even millions
    of devices, through optimized network protocols, resource management, and energy-efficient
    strategies. Further advancements in machine learning algorithms will be a focal
    point to enhance predictive capabilities. The methodology will be rigorously validated
    in diverse real-world environments and industry settings, ensuring its adaptability
    and robustness across various use cases. This comprehensive approach aligns with
    the evolving demands of secure and efficient data transmission in modern sensor
    networks and the dynamic landscape of emerging security threats and network scales.

    Abstract Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based smart irrigation solutions rely on
    sensors for data reporting, a central infrastructure for generating irrigation
    parameters and a mobile machinery called Linear for irrigating. In this scenario,
    change in soil and environmental properties is referred as an event. Spatial distribution
    of such properties leads to multiple event regions in farmland. Identifying Boundary
    Nodes (BNs) of an event region is a well investigated problem in WSN, however,
    data reporting from BNs that caters to application specific requirements have
    rarely studied. To this end, an energy efficient data harvesting protocol for
    smart irrigation is designed that integrates three modules. First, to reduce number
    of source nodes and hence, energy consumption, a distributed Representative Node
    (RN) selection mechanism is proposed to identify a subset of BNs as the source
    nodes. Information from these RNs ensures correct actions even when nodes of more
    than two event regions lie nearby that is not achieved by existing RN selection
    mechanisms. Second, stop time of Linear must be adequate to collect data from
    RNs for ensuring proper actions. However, existing mechanisms limit to optimizing
    network lifetime. Calculation of data collection dependent stop time of Linear
    without having any information of RNs is proposed. Third, Reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme is proposed that uses single message transmission by a node for Linear
    location information dissemination. Results indicate that at least 58% of BNs
    are required for accurate region construction and overall, 12% to 56% less energy
    is consumed in the data harvesting process. Similar content being viewed by others

    Chapter © 2021 1 Introduction Smart irrigation or Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI)
    is an emerging technique for precision agriculture where an area is irrigated
    according to its requirement. A field is divided into smaller sub-regions (event
    regions) of varying water requirement subject to soil texture, topography, crop,
    and environmental parameters. These event regions are called Management Zones
    (MZs). In traditional VRI setup, an irrigation machinery called Linear is guided
    by Base Station (BS) to move on a predefined linear path and irrigate the field.
    To generate control actions for irrigation, BS collects data from sensors in two
    ways. First, sensors send data to BS (placed outside the farmland) via multi-hop
    in flat [1, 2] or clustered architecture [3]. Second, data is collected from the
    nodes deployed in MZs of farmland having similar soil properties and irrigation
    requirement [4, 5]. These arrangements suffer from high energy consumption in
    data transmission from sensor nodes to BS for community agriculture where a large
    farmland is to be irrigated. Moreover, studies from agronomy [6] report the need
    of dynamic identification of MZs for monitoring purpose. MZs are spatio-temporally
    varying. To make the information regarding this change available near real-time
    at the Linear, is a key challenge. To accomplish this, Boundary Nodes (BNs) and
    non-BNs of MZ are marked in distributed fashion in our previous work [7]. The
    next step is to send information of BNs to Linear for generation of actions. Hence,
    the proposed work investigates the challenges of data harvesting from BNs of MZs.
    We assume that BS is mounted on Linear that stops at on-the-go identified locations,
    collects data from BNs, generates control actions and irrigates field while moving.
    In this work we intend to explore following research questions: Can a subset of
    BNs be identified as source nodes without loss of information of the event region
    boundary? How can stop time of Linear at a location be calculated at BS without
    any information of BNs? How does a Linear disseminate its location information
    with reduced network traffic and how a path is constructed from BNs to Linear?
    Will partial event region information be able to facilitate required action? What
    are the other applications where similar problem of data harvesting from BNs exists?
    Fig. 1 Data collection from a small region (Source: http://www.valleyirrigation.com)
    Full size image Figure 1 presents a scenario of data collection from BNs. A large
    irrigating machinery called Linear is guided by BS to move on a predefined linear
    path and irrigate the field. Linear moves at a low speed (\\(\\approx 2 m/s\\))
    or stops at some locations depending on the control action generated by BS. Data
    from the sensor nodes in a small region in front of Linear is collected at the
    BS, which then controls the sprinklers (actuators) mounted on Linear accordingly.
    For example, in Fig. 1, Linear is at position A and irrigating the region around
    it. The next region to be irrigated is B (enclosed by red line). Therefore, the
    information from sensors deployed in the shaded region must be delivered before
    Linear moves from position A and enters region B. Region B may consist of more
    than one event regions (sub regions of different irrigation requirements). Partial
    boundary information of all the sub regions facilitate irrigation schedule for
    region B. If all BNs send data to BS, the boundary information received at BS
    will be correct and proper actuation is ensured. However, if the number of BNs
    is large in a sub-region, network traffic increases. So, to reduce network traffic,
    the proposed work identifies a minimal set of BNs as sources laying in an event
    region. The minimal set must be selected such that the information from identified
    nodes suffice for the decision at BS. The nodes belonging to such minimal set
    are called Representative Nodes (RNs). Information from these nodes are sufficient
    to construct event boundary at BS. To demonstrate the impact of reducing BNs and
    hence, loss of information at BS, concept of event region map construction is
    introduced. Event region map is the virtual boundary of event regions created
    at BS from the position and data information of RNs. An example scenario (see
    Fig. 2a) consists of three event regions (MZs) A, B, and C where BNs 1–10 form
    boundary of A, 11–15 and 16–22 are the BNs of B and C, respectively. Suppose the
    RNs for construction of the event regions A, B, and C are \\(\\{2, 4, 6, 7, 10\\}\\),
    \\(\\{12, 13, 15\\}\\), and \\(\\{16, 17, 19, 21\\}\\), respectively. The coarsely
    constructed local map at BS from the information of these RNs, is shown in Fig.
    2b. Exclusion of any of these nodes will result in incorrect event region map
    and addition of other BNs to the set of RNs will fine grain the coarsely constructed
    boundary, however, increase the energy consumption. Thus, a trade-off between
    network traffic and information loss is to be maintained. Fig. 2 Minimal set of
    BNs Full size image Construction of event region map is limited to our work and
    actual decision making process depends on the algorithm running on BS. This work
    identifies a minimal set BNs as sources and explores the challenges of mobility
    assisted data collection (as explained with the help of Fig. 1). These challenges
    are application specific and vary from application to application. For example,
    in enemy troop detection [8], where soldiers move in their own area of surveillance,
    if there are some intruders, it becomes important to be aware of the area ahead
    of the troop. The problem is same to that of VRI, however, precise boundary information
    is required for this application. In automated brooding systems (chick, quail,
    goose, ducks) [9], temperature and humidity sensors are deployed to report different
    temperature zones. The problem of local map construction is similar to VRI, however,
    network of sensors is three dimensional. Thus, for enemy detection and livestock
    monitoring, the proposed scheme must be modified according to the challenges posed
    by specific scenario. This work takes VRI as use case and investigates the challenges
    of energy efficient data collection for reconstruction of event region map at
    Linear. Having discussed the application specific scenario and the other application
    where the problem may find its place, the essential features of the problem considered
    in the work are presented as follows: To minimize the traffic and energy consumption,
    a minimal set BNs known as RN is identified in such a way that correct actions
    are ensured at BS using the information of these nodes. Fig. 3 Taxonomy of data
    harvesting schemes in WSAN/WSN. Deploying Linear as a data harvesting and processing
    infrastructure for smart irrigation is proposed for the first time in this work
    to the best of our knowledge. This taxonomy presents existing mobility assisted
    data harvesting techniques Full size image Considering the RNs are identified
    through a distributed scheme, another challenge is posed by data acquisition from
    these RNs. Linear stops at some locations and collects data from the BNs laying
    in sub-region ahead, constructs a local view of the sub-region and generates control
    actions. In this context, the stop time of Linear must be adequate to collect
    data from all RNs. Inadequate stop time can result into insufficient information
    from RNs leading to inaccurate event decision at Linear. Hence, a data collection
    dependent stop time of Linear at a location is proposed. Moreover, to reduce energy
    consumption in location information dissemination, a reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme is proposed where a node transmits only one location information message.
    Temporal and spatial suppression of information is prevalent to reduce energy
    consumption of nodes. For example, authors in [10] have reduced the volume of
    data by modified version of KNN algorithm on sensor node and further aggregation
    of data at Cluster Head (CH). Authors in [11] proposed Data Transmission (DaT)
    Protocol for suppressing redundant data to save the energy while maintaining a
    suitable level of accuracy. Other temporal data compression techniques to reduce
    the energy consumption is proposed in [12,13,14,15,16,17]. Spatial information
    suppression focuses on reducing number of source node in the network. The existing
    algorithms for identifying RNs as source nodes are designed for boundary monitoring
    [18,19,20,21]. These schemes are energy efficient and select lesser number of
    BNs, however, construct incorrect event region in the case of more than two subregions
    (A, B, and C in Fig. 2). The mechanisms give inaccurate result when neighbors
    of a sensor node lay in two different event regions. For example, BN 4 and its
    neighbors 15 and 16 in Fig. 2a. Node 4 suppresses the data of its neighbors and
    sends information to BS that 15 and 16 are BNs of another region. However, while
    constructing the event region map, BS can not visualize that nodes 15 and 16 are
    the BNs of two different subregions. Detailed discussion is presented in Section
    4.2.2 with the help of Figs. 17, 18, and 19. Moreover, these schemes do not investigate
    data acquisition from RNs. There is a plethora of mobile infrastructure based
    data collection schemes (a taxonomy is presented in Fig. 3). In most of these
    works, the stop time is either independent of data collection [22, 23] or negligible
    [24, 25] for a mobile BS. A few research works have modelled the stop time of
    mobile BS. Table 1 discusses these works and the limitations regarding applicability
    to the scenario under consideration. The paper aims to design a distributed Lightweight
    Event Region map Construction based data harvesting protocol LERC, for delay tolerant
    applications with following contributions: To reduce network traffic, RNs are
    identified as data transmitters. The scheme identifies RNs that in turn construct
    correct event region map even when BNs of more than two event region lay in the
    neighborhood (explained in Section 4.2.2). BN calculates the gradient (defined
    in the first paragraph of Section 3.3) of line joining it to previous RN. If the
    gradient is greater than an application dependent threshold, BN marks itself as
    RN. The decision of BNs is evaluated by plotting the boundary of event region
    at Linear in which less number (at least 58%) of BNs are required for correct
    event region construction. A reduced overhead broadcast scheme is proposed for
    path construction that ensures only one message transmission by each node. It
    restricts transmission of multiple copies of location information message of Linear
    in the network. The efficiency of this scheme is measured in terms of energy consumption.
    Reduced overhead broadcast decreases the energy consumption of network by 19.5%\\(-\\)46.6%
    with respect to the limited broadcast scheme proposed in [26]. Sojourn locations
    of Linear are identified on-the-go and data collection dependent stop time at
    a location is modelled. The modelled stop time is adequate to collect data from
    all RNs laying in the event region ahead that in turn ensures correct event region
    map construction at BS. Modelled stop time is the sum of maximum time required
    for dissemination of location information to the farthest BN of the region and
    data transmission from it to Linear. 2 Related work This section discusses the
    research related to RN selection, limited broadcasting, stop time, and stop location
    modelling. A summarized discussion of the research gaps with respect to the applicative
    scenario’s requirements, follows. 2.1 Selection of RNs (data reporting nodes to
    sink) In [19] energy efficient Continuous Boundary Monitoring (COBOM), only one
    BN is selected randomly as RN among its neighbor BNs. Selected RNs maintain and
    transmit a BN-array to sink that includes the boundary information around the
    RN. First all nodes send their position to sink to maintain a neighborhood map
    at sink. In each iteration, only one BN sends the data to sink along with the
    status of its neighbors as BN or non-BN. COBOM suppresses the BNs and achieves
    desired accuracy when nodes are belonging to only one event region that is either
    a node is inside the event region or outside of it. However, for smart irrigation
    there may be more than one event regions present. A node’s neighbors may belong
    to different event regions and in such condition boundary construction at sink
    will fail. It is proved by simulation in Section 4.2.2 with the help of Fig. 17.
    Authors in [20] have proposed a BN selection algorithm that identifies a small
    set of BNs independent of node density and provides well-balanced RN selection
    from the small set. It chooses only the closest sensor nodes to the boundary of
    an object as BN. A Neighbor Descriptor Table (NDT) that includes neighbor location
    information and event detection status is maintained as each node. From the selected
    BNs, the algorithm tries to choose only one RN per each radio range regardless
    of node density. The algorithm selects a BN as RN if no RN selection message arrives
    from its neighbor BNs and the two most distant neighbor BNs are selected as left
    and right RNs. Since the RN selection algorithm identifies only one RN per each
    radio range, it is not suitable for the applications where one-hop neighbors belong
    to different event regions. For the applicative scenario considered in our work
    one-hop neighbors may lay in different event regions and selection of only one
    BN among neighbors as RN lead to information suppression and incorrect decision.
    Hence, the above mentioned scheme is not applicable to the applications mentioned
    earlier in Section 1. Energy-efficient DEtection and MOnitoring for COntinuous
    objects in wireless sensor networks (DEMOCO) [21] focuses on reducing the number
    of BNs that eventually results in lowering the number of RNs to reduce traffic
    as well as communication between sensor nodes. It selects the nodes inward to
    the boundary of continuous event as RNs and ignores the outward BNs. It reduces
    number of RNs to half in comparison to COBOM. In this work, minimizing number
    of RNs and hence, overall energy consumption in data reporting are the main objectives.
    However, event region construction at BS is ignored. Hence, DEMOCO is not suitable
    for the applications where information from RNs facilitate construction of event
    region at BS. In [18], authors have proposed BN detection and boundary refinement
    scheme for continuous boundary monitoring in heterogeneous Internet of Things
    (IoT). Boundary of event region consists of resource rich backbone nodes that
    are assisted by resource constrained edge nodes. Planarization algorithms are
    applied to generate a coarse boundary region. Sensory data of edge nodes is estimated
    by backbone nodes by applying interpolation techniques. For boundary refinement,
    mobile BS visits each BN to collect data. The path of mobile BS is optimally planned
    by applying models including the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) with
    time constraints and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), to enable the near real-time
    requirement of domain applications. The scheme identifies less number of BNs,
    however, the accuracy of boundary region decreases. Moreover, the scheme is centralized
    and hence, not suitable for automated smart irrigation scenario where BNs are
    identified by a distributed algorithm. 2.2 Limited broadcast Authors in [27] have
    proposed a limited broadcast scheme, where an actor transmits the location information
    in its Voronoi cell. Authors have assumed that sensors belonging to the Voronoi
    cell of an actor, are one-hop distant to it. Hence, number of messages transmitted
    for location update reduces. However, in applications such as VRI a few RNs may
    or may not be one-hop neighbors of Linear at its current stop location. In such
    scenario, the above mentioned scheme tends to perform as flooding. A Mobile Actor
    Routing Protocol (MARP) for data transmission in mobile Wireless Sensor and Actuator
    Networks (WSAN) is proposed in [28]. Actors stop at some locations for random
    time and broadcast two control signals to construct cluster around it. Cluster
    members send data to the actor within its pause time at that location. Stop locations
    and stop time are independent of data collection. The location information dissemination
    is restricted to the nodes belonging to the cluster around stop location of actor.
    However, the approach is still flooding that causes high energy consumption and
    moreover, if cluster size or node density increases energy consumption increases
    exponentially. Authors have proposed sensor-actor coordination mechanism in [29]
    where network is divided into grids and a CH is chosen for each grid. Actor broadcasts
    its location information while moving and CHs further floods it to other CHs and
    sensor nodes. The location information dissemination is restricted to the grid
    however, flooding of location messages consumes much energy. Moreover, if size
    of grid or density of nodes increases energy consumption increases exponentially.
    A limited flooding mechanism for cluster formation is proposed in [26], in which
    mobile BS broadcasts beacon periodically. Beacon contains hop count, energy, source
    address, and time to live (ttl). A node discards a packet if hop count of received
    packet is greater than the hop count stored at the node. If hop count is less
    than current value, it is updated and broadcasted again. Cluster formation stops
    if ttl has expired. Though limited flooding consumes less energy than flooding,
    the repetitive transmission by a node till ttl is reached, causes significant
    energy consumption in larger networks and hence is not scalable. 2.3 Stop time
    modelling A taxonomy of research works utilizing mobile BS is shown in Fig. 3.
    In WSAN (where mobile BS works as actuators), mechanisms of periodic visit are
    not appropriate to the problem under consideration, as the stop locations depend
    either on the nearness of previous stop point [30] or on the probability of event
    occurrence [31] and thus, are independent of data collection. However, for Linear
    move irrigation, next stop locations and stop time should take decision making
    and actuation into account. In existing works of on-demand visit [32], the key
    concern is to select an optimal actuator to take action in the event region. Table
    1 Evaluation of stop time based models Full size table In Wireless Sensor Network
    (WSN) (where mobile BS acts as a data collector), for Linear visiting each node
    [38], the stop time is modelled for one hop transmission taking buffer constraint
    and speed of mobile BS into account. Another way of data collection is to visit
    a subset of nodes such as Rendezvous Points (RPs) [24, 25, 39,40,41] or Rendezvous
    Area (RA) [42, 43]. The stop locations are RPs that are decided by BS and known
    a priori to mobile data collector. Stop time at RPs are negligible most of the
    time. These algorithms do not fit for the applicative scenarios’ requirement as
    BS mounted on Linear has no prior knowledge of the BNs. Moreover, BNs are subject
    to change, so every time transmitting location of all BNs for calculation of stop
    locations will be wastage of constrained resources. In RA based mechanisms, stop
    time and stop location are random. When RPs are selected along the path of mobile
    BS, stop time is either negligible or modelled for one hop transmission. To the
    best of authors’ knowledge, none of the works design stop time and stop location
    taking the crucial aspects (collision, number of hops) of multi hop data collection
    into account. Apart from stop time and stop location, neither RP nor RA can furnish
    Linear with the event region boundary information. The mechanisms that model stop
    time are discussed in Table 1. 2.4 Discussion Limited flooding mechanisms broadcast
    location updates in a smaller region rather than entire network and hence, perform
    better than flooding. However, nodes are involved in repetitive transmission that
    consumes a considerable amount of energy. Stop time modelling in literature is
    either negligible or dependent on the energy consumption of the nodes for lifetime
    maximization. However, in application under consideration, stop time of the Linear
    should be adequate to collect data from enough BNs to construct a map of the event
    region. For reducing network traffic, data aggregation on CHs is a much prevalent
    method. However, CH election and cluster formation itself consume a considerable
    amount of energy [19, 20]. Moreover, CHs are not able to demarcate the boundary
    of a subregion (detailed discussion is presented in [7]). On the other hand, the
    RN selection schemes are energy efficient, however, fail to construct accurate
    map at sink when neighbors of a node lies in two different subregions. In VRI,
    incorrect boundary identification at sink hampers the decision making and actions
    to event region. 3 Lightweight Event Region Construction (LERC) protocol This
    section discusses the proposed methodology for data collection from BNs of a MZ.
    First, system framework and problem formulation are presented. Next, the three
    modules of the proposed methodology namely, reduced overhead broadcasting method
    (Section 3.2), RN selection scheme (Section 3.3), and calculations of stop time
    and next stop location (Section 3.4) are discussed. 3.1 System framework In this
    subsection, first we present the network model, energy model and problem formulation
    follows. 3.1.1 Network model Figure 4 depicts a scenario of farmland where a set
    of sensor nodes S = {\\(s_1, s_2...., s_n\\)} are deployed in an irregular polygon
    shaped field. The uniformly distributed sensors form a network represented as
    a graph \\(G=(S,E)\\) where sensor nodes form the vertices and connection among
    them is represented by a set of edges E = {\\(e_1, e_2...., e_m\\)}. \\(\\forall\\)
    s\\(_i\\), \\(\\exists\\) NB\\(^{d}_i\\) where NB\\(^{d}_i\\) is the one hop Neighborhood
    set of \\(s_i\\) with d members and \\(d <n\\). A node \\(s_j \\in\\) NB\\(^{d}_i
    \\iff \\left| s_i-s_j \\right| \\le\\) 2r, where \\(\\left| s_i-s_j \\right|\\)
    is the Euclidean distance between \\(s_i\\) and \\(s_j\\) and r is the communication
    range of \\(s_i\\). A multi attribute sensing sensor node \\(s_i\\) is capable
    of measuring different soil properties (for example soil moisture, temperature,
    AWC). In Fig. 4 there are two categories of nodes, namely, Boundary Nodes (BNs)
    and Interior Nodes (INs) where boundary of a MZ is demarcated by the BNs (solid
    circles). A node \\(s_i\\) marks itself as BN or IN depending on the measurements
    and position information received from the nodes in NB\\(^{d}_i\\). Each node
    upon receiving data from its neighbors runs MZ delineation algorithm (for details,
    please refer [7]). A list of symbols is presented in Table 2. Table 2 List of
    symbols Full size table BNs represent the MZ, on boundary of which, these are
    laying. To collect data from the BNs, Linear are deployed in the field. BS is
    responsible for data collection and generation of control actions and is mounted
    on a self propelled Linear move irrigation machinery (shown in Fig. 1). The actuators
    (mounted on Linear) control the rate, amount, timing of irrigation as well as
    the on/off mode of sprinklers according to the location of BNs. Fig. 4 An example
    scenario with multi Linears Full size image Linear (\\(Linear_1\\) or \\(Linear_2\\))
    starts from the periphery of the farm that is the first stop location of it. It
    gathers data from RNs (a subset of BNs), construct MZ map, generates control actions
    and irrigates the field while moving. Thus, there are two states of Linear namely,
    Stop and Collect (S&C) and Move and Irrigate (M&I). The assumptions made are based
    on the various real life VRI systems. VARIwise [44] is an autonomous control platform
    developed to generate Prescription Map for automated VRI. In an another project,
    VRI system developed by University of Georgia [45], for generating dynamic Prescription
    Map takes feedback from the sensor network. The University of Georgia Smart Sensor
    Array (UGA SSA) consists of smart sensor nodes and a base station that form a
    mesh network. 3.1.2 Energy model In this setup, sensor nodes are deployed in the
    field having transmission range equal to r. Nodes remain in sleep state till a
    control signal from Linear arrives to wake these nodes. Energy consumption of
    a node is the sum of the energy consumed in various states of a node namely, idle
    (\\(E_{idle}\\)), transmit (\\(E_t\\)), and receive (\\(E_r\\)) as proposed in
    [46, 47]. Where, \\(E_{idle}\\) is the energy consumed in Carrier Sense Multiple
    Access (CSMA) backoffs and idle state (waiting for data or control packet). Since,
    we are not optimizing any parameter of idle state, energy consumed is depicted
    as \\(E_{idle}\\) to keep it simple. Energy consumed in transmit state (\\(E_t\\))
    and receive state (\\(E_r\\)) are as follows [46]: $$\\begin{aligned} E_t= (e_t+e_{d}r^{p})B.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (1) $$\\begin{aligned} E_r=e_{r}B. \\end{aligned}$$ (2) where,
    \\(e_t\\) is the energy/bit consumed by the transmitter electronics, and \\(e_d\\)
    accounts for energy dissipated in the transmit op-amp. r is the transmission range
    and p is the channel path loss index. B is the bit rate of radio. The first phase
    of LERC protocol is Reduced Overhead Broadcast, where, each node receives a control
    message from all its predecessors and broadcast one message to its successors.
    Thus, in this phase, a maximum of k messages are received and one message is transmitted
    for a node. The energy consumed during this phase is: $$\\begin{aligned} max E^{ROB}_i
    = (k_i*E_r+E_t). \\end{aligned}$$ (3) where, \\(k_i\\) is the number of neighbors
    of node \\(s_i\\). A node enters in RN selection phase after it receives a control
    message \\(RN_c\\) from its predecessor (explained in the first paragraph of Section
    3.3). It broadcasts this control message after deciding about its role as RN or
    non-RN. Thus, in this phase at most one message is transmitted and received by
    a node. The energy consumed during this phase is: $$\\begin{aligned} max E^{RN}_i
    = n_{BN}(E_t+E_r). \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where, \\(n_{BN}\\) is the number of BNs.
    Though size of packets in downstream, upstream and RN selection phase differs,
    it is ignored to make calculations simple. After deciding its role as RN or non-RN,
    a node transmits its data towards Linear (via the path constructed in reduced
    overhead broadcasting phase) if it is a RN or waits for the data from RNs to forward,
    otherwise. In worse case, a node may forward data packets of all RNs. So, for
    upstream data transmission, a node receives and transmits messages equal to number
    of RNs. So, the maximum energy consumption is written as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    max E^{DT}_i = n_{RN}*(E_r+E_t). \\end{aligned}$$ (5) Thus, the maximum energy
    consumption of a node \\(s_i\\) is written as: $$\\begin{aligned} max E_i = E_{idle}+
    (k_i*E_r+E_t)+(n_{RN}+n_{BN})*(E_t+E_r). \\end{aligned}$$ (6) where, \\(E_{idle}\\)
    is the energy consumed in idle state for during all phases mentioned above. LERC
    aims to reduce number of transmissions of a node for location information dissemination.
    Moreover, it selects a subset of nodes as the source nodes that further decreases
    in-network traffic. Thus, LERC regulates \\(E_t\\), \\(E_r\\), and \\(n_{BN}\\).
    The objective function of the proposed work can be formulated as: $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\forall {s_i\\in S} \\hspace{.1in}Minimize \\sum _{i=1}^{|S|} E_i \\end{aligned}$$
    (7) Subject to constraints: $$\\begin{aligned} Re(MZ(RN\\subseteq BN) )\\ge R_0.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (8) $$\\begin{aligned} D((RN_{i}^{MZ}\\in RN)\\subseteq BN) \\le
    T. \\end{aligned}$$ (9) where, the constraints in Eqs. (8) and (9) are explained
    as follows: 1. Minimum reliability constraint \\(Re(MZ(RN\\subseteq BN) )\\ge
    R_0\\) The constraint depicts that number of RNs must not be reduced beyond \\(R_0\\),
    where, \\(R_0\\) is the minimum number of RNs to achieve correct event region
    map at BS. In this work, we define reliability (Re) with respect to MZ map construction.
    It is the number of BNs sending data to Linear for MZ map construction. If all
    BNs transmit data to Linear, Re is 100% and the map constructed is correct and
    can be treated as the reference. However, in-network traffic and energy consumption
    in this case is high. Let us define a set of BNs as \\(BN=\\{BN_1, BN_2...., BN_{n_{BN}}\\}\\).
    To reduce in-network traffic, a subset of BN defined as \\(RN= \\{RN_1, RN_2....,
    RN_{n_{RN}}\\}\\) is chosen as source nodes such that \\(RN \\subseteq BN\\) and
    \\(n_{RN}\\le n_{BN}\\). As the number of selected RNs decreases, the constructed
    map can deviate from the correct (reference). After one point, the deviation in
    map hampers the decision making and implementation of actions (explained by Figs.
    14 and 15 in Section 4.2). The number of RNs at this point is defined as the minimum
    reliability \\(R_0\\). Thus, \\(R_0\\) is the minimum number of RNs required to
    demarcate the boundary of MZs at Linear such that the decision and implementation
    remains same to the reference. A generalized approach to calculate \\(R_0\\) is
    not mentioned in the proposed work since it is topology and event region dependent.
    Minimum number of BNs to construct an event region (MZ) at BS is \\(R_0\\) and
    its value ranges from 1 to \\(n_{BN}\\). So, an event region may be represented
    by 1 BN or may be represented by all BNs laying in that event region. As the soil
    parameters change, shape of event region (MZ) changes and so the BNs representing
    the MZ. Thus, proposing a method to calculate the exact number of \\(R_0\\) is
    out of scope of this study. However, an empirical study is shown with the help
    of Figs. 14 and 15. 2. Delay constraint \\(D((RN_{i}^{MZ}\\in RN)\\subseteq BN)
    \\le T\\) T is the stop time of Linear at a location for data acquisition. If
    delay of a packet is greater than T, it will be discarded by Linear. Thus, D is
    the maximum end to end delay of data transmission of a RN that is selected as
    data transmitter to construct MZ map at Linear. Fig. 5 Flow chart of the proposed
    method Full size image Thus, the work intends to minimize energy consumption of
    sensor nodes. The energy consumption of a node depends on \\(E_t\\), \\(E_r\\),
    and \\(n_{BN}\\) (as represented by Eq. (6)). These variables are in turn depend
    on the number of transmissions of control packets in disseminating the location
    information of Linear and data packets in sending information from source nodes.
    To minimize the number of messages during location information dissemination of
    Linear a Reduced Overhead Broadcast mechanism (explained in Section 3.2) is proposed
    where nodes receive control packets from all predecessors and transmit only one
    message. To reduce number of data packets, number of source nodes are minimized
    by selecting a sub-set of BNs namely, RNs, where the number of RNs must be sufficient
    to construct boundary of event region at Linear. RN selection mechanism minimizes
    \\(n_{BN}\\). It is an angle-based greedy approach where each BN marks itself
    as RN or non-RN depending on the angle formed with previous RN (explained in Section
    3.3). Since, RNs are identified in a distributed fashion, stop time (T) of Linear
    must be adequate to collect data from all RNs to ensure the correct construction
    of event region boundary at Linear. A data collection dependent stop time is modelled
    and explained in Section 3.4. Section 3.5 discusses the RN selection when one-hop
    neighbors belong to multiple MZs and data collection by multiple Linears. A flow
    chart of the mechanism is shown in Fig. 5. 3.2 Reduced overhead broadcasting In
    S &C state, at a stop location, Linear sends two control signals. First control
    signal is broadcasted with a transmission range R that is greater than the transmission
    range of sensor nodes (r). This control signal is sent to wake up the nodes from
    sleep state. R depends on the Region of Action (ROA) of Linear that in turn depends
    on the length of field (L) and number of sinks deployed. For example, in Fig.
    4, \\(R=L/4\\), to cover the ROA of Linears. However, for single sink in the same
    region R will be L/2. Fig. 6 Structure of start message Full size image Next,
    a control message start is transmitted with a transmission range of r. start is
    sent for path construction from BNs to Linear. It contains the coordinates of
    Linear (coordinate), hop, residual energy (energy), and sleep time = present time
    + stop time (time) of nodes as shown in Fig 6. Nodes receiving start from neighbors,
    will increment value of hop by one and store its remaining energy in residual
    energy field. Every node will broadcast only one start message to its neighbors
    to reduce network traffic. To ensure reduced overhead broadcast, once a node receives
    first start message (at time \\(t_{start}\\)), it will wait for time \\(t_w\\)
    (Please refer Eq. (15) in Section 3.4), to collect start messages from other neighbors.
    Among all of its neighbors, a node will select one having smallest hop as next
    hop node, for upstream data transmission. If two nodes with same hop are there,
    then a node with largest energy is selected. If multiple nodes with same energy
    and hop are there, randomly a node will be selected as next hop. After next hop
    selection, each node will broadcast its start message to neighbors. Any start
    message received after this broadcast will be discarded. For example, please refer
    Fig. 7 that represents a small portion of a larger network. It consists of a Linear
    (diamond shaped) near node 41 and 42 and BNs (laying on the boundary of network
    and MZ). Let us suppose all nodes shown in the figure are in receive state and
    waiting for start message. Linear broadcasts start message that is received by
    the one-hop neighbors of Linear, nodes 41, 42, 40, 39, 38, 37, 33, and 32. Since
    these nodes are one-hop neighbors of Linear (hop = 0), they update hop and energy
    of the start message and broadcasts it. After this broadcast, these nodes start
    contending for data transmission (explained in the second last paragraph of right
    column on page 12) and discard the start message received from their one-hop neighbors.
    Fig. 7 An example scenario for start message dissemination and RN selection Full
    size image Next, we take example of node 27 to elaborate the reduced overhead
    broadcast scheme. It will wait for \\(t_w\\) time (depends on the maximum transmission
    time of all neighbors), after it receives first start message. After \\(t_w\\)
    time expires, it has start messages from nodes 33(hop = 2), 34(hop = 3), and 26(hop
    = 2). It does not receive start from nodes 35 and 30, since these nodes will broadcast
    start after \\(t_w\\) for node 27 is expired. It selects node 33 or node 26 depending
    on the energy as its next hop since hop is least for them. Node 27 then broadcasts
    start message. Figure 8 depicts various states of Linear and activities associated
    with it. S &C state comprises of three states namely, transmit, wait, and receive.
    In transmit state, Linear sends two signals, wake and start. It then switches
    to wait state, where it waits for a time T (calculation is shown Section 3.4).
    If data packets are received from sensor nodes, it switches to receive state and
    start preparing the Prescription Map (PM) that is set of control actions such
    as rate, location, on/off state for sprinklers, etc. When timer T expires Linear
    switches to M &I state and irrigate the field according to the PM generated. When
    the next stop location is reached, calculation of which was done in S &C state,
    Linear switches to next S &C state and repeats the above mentioned activities.
    Fig. 8 State space representation of Linear Full size image 3.3 Representative
    Node (RN) selection Key idea of RN selection scheme is to select a BN as RN if
    it lies on a large gradient (\\(\\theta\\)) with respect to previous RN. Large
    \\(\\theta\\) depicts a significant change in the shape of event region. Each
    BN marks itself as RN or non-RN. One hop neighbors of Linear (nodes 41, 42, etc.)
    and corner nodes, for example nodes 36 and 37 in Fig. 7 (for corner node identification
    please refer Outward Nodes in the algorithm proposed in [7]), are RNs by default.
    One hop neighbors of Linear are RNs as only one hop transmission is required for
    these nodes. Corner nodes are RNs as these nodes are key enablers to achieve minimum
    reliability (shown by Fig. 15 and discussed in the last paragraph of left column
    on page 18). These nodes broadcast a control message \\(RN_c\\) to inform others
    that they are default RNs. Other nodes, when receive this message, first calculate
    Euclidean distance from Linear. If the calculated distance is in between \\(R-r\\)
    and \\(R+r\\), the BN marks itself as RN and sends \\(RN_c\\) message. If the
    calculated distance is less than \\(R-r\\), BNs calculate angle \\(\\theta\\)
    with its neighbor RN. \\(\\theta\\) is \\({{\\,\\mathrm{tan\\,inverse}\\,}}(\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1})\\)
    if \\(y_2-y_1 < x_2-x_1\\) and \\(\\theta\\) is \\({{\\,\\mathrm{tan\\,inverse}\\,}}(\\frac{x_2-x_1}{y_2-y_1})\\),
    otherwise. (\\(x_2, y_2\\)) is the coordinate of neighbor RN and (\\(x_1,y_1\\))
    is the coordinate of the node calculating \\(\\theta\\). If \\(\\theta\\) is less
    than \\(\\theta _0\\) (an application dependent threshold discussed in the next
    paragraph), it marks itself as non-RN and as RN otherwise. A non-RN node sends
    \\(RN_c\\) message containing coordinate of RN with which it has calculated the
    angle \\(\\theta\\). The BN receiving this message calculates the angle \\(\\theta\\)
    with the coordinate received in the message. A BN receiving multiple \\(RN_c\\)
    messages will decide according to the lowest \\(\\theta\\). Exact \\(\\theta _0\\)
    can be calculated in a distributed fashion by local talk of sensor nodes where
    nodes between two corner nodes can decide among themselves the value of \\(\\theta
    _0\\) for that setting. However, when boundary pattern changes significantly re-tuning
    \\(\\theta _0\\) is required. Exact mechanism for fixing \\(\\theta _0\\) is a
    work in progress. For the sake of simplicity, in this work, we assume that the
    boundary does not change significantly to change \\(\\theta _0\\). However, a
    safe range of \\(\\theta _0\\) is provided by recording the effect of \\(\\theta
    _0\\) on energy consumption and reconstruction of coarse boundary by simulating
    various networks (explained in Section 4.2.1). We elaborate RN selection by an
    example scenario, shown in Fig. 7. The one hop neighbors of Linear (node 41, 42,
    37, 38, 39) excluding the non-BNs (32 and 40) mark themselves as RN and send \\(RN_c\\)
    message to their neighbor node. Moreover, the corner nodes (36 and 37) also mark
    themselves as RN by default. Among neighbors of node 42, only node 33 calculates
    the angle \\(\\theta\\) since others are either non-BNs or RNs. Suppose \\(\\theta
    _0\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\) for this case. \\(\\theta\\) for node 33 is \\(32^\\circ\\)
    and hence, node 33 marks itself as RN and sends \\(RN_c\\) message to its neighbors.
    Angle \\(\\theta\\) for nodes 34, 26, 27, 29 are \\(4^\\circ\\), \\(12^\\circ\\),
    \\(17^\\circ\\), and \\(38^\\circ\\) respectively. Node 29 marks itself as RN.
    However, when node 29 receives message of node 27 and calculates angle with node
    27 (it is an RN because distance from Linear is \\(R-r\\)) that is \\(6.7^\\circ\\),
    it marks itself as non-RN. Nodes 34 and 35 will mark themselves as non-RN with
    respect to node 33. Node 30 will mark itself as RN with respect to node 36. All
    default RNs (one hop neighbors of Linear and corner nodes) start contending for
    channel access through Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
    (CSMA/CA) [48] scheme as soon as they receive start message. Other nodes contend
    after marking themselves as RNs or non-RNs. If a RN has residual energy less than
    a threshold, it informs its neighbors about the situation and go to sleep. Its
    neighbors transmit data and its position information to next hop neighbors. Figure
    9 shows various states of sensor nodes and actions associated with it. Each sensor
    node can be in one of the four states namely, sleep, receive, wait, and transmit.
    Sensor nodes switch from sleep state to receive state when they receive wake signal
    from Linear and go to sleep state when timer T expires. When start message is
    received, a node (BN or non-BN) broadcasts it by changing hop and residual energy.
    A BN first decides whether it is a RN or not. If it is RN, it follows CSMA/CA
    mechanism. Various activities associated with it is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 State
    space representation of a sensor node Full size image 3.4 Stop time modelling
    and next stop location calculation for the Linear Stop time of Linear at a location
    depends on the data collection delay from all RNs. This delay in turn is the sum
    of propagation time of start message to the farthest RN (within range R) and data
    transmission time from this RN to Linear. The stop time (T) can be calculated
    as: $$\\begin{aligned} T = h_{max}*(delay_{d,max} + delay_{u,max}). \\end{aligned}$$
    (10) where, \\(h_{max}\\) is the maximum number of hops between Linear and the
    farthest RN, \\(delay_{d,max}\\) and \\(delay_{u,max}\\) is the one hop delay
    of downstream and upstream traffic respectively. \\(h_{max}\\) is calculated from
    the probability density function (pdf) of distance covered in one hop proposed
    in [49]. The pdf depends on the number of neighbors of a node that can forward
    data towards Linear, transmission range of nodes (r), and the maximum transmission
    range of Linear (R). The maximum one hop delay in transmitting start message to
    the farthest RN is the sum of the waiting time (\\(t_w\\)) a node waits for its
    neighbors to send start message and the time required for that node to successfully
    broadcast it. $$\\begin{aligned} delay_{d,max} = t_w + t_{tx} + n_R*t_{tx}. \\end{aligned}$$
    (11) where, \\(n_R\\) is the average number of retransmissions and \\(t_{tx}\\)
    is the total time required for transmission of a packet that depends on the back
    off time (\\(t_{BO}\\)), Clear Channel Access (CCA) time (\\(t_{CCA}\\)), transmission
    time of a packet (\\(t_{txn}\\)), and transmission of an acknowledgement (\\(t_{Ack}\\)).
    $$\\begin{aligned} t_{tx}=t_{BO} + t_{CCA} + t_{txn} +t_{Ack}. \\end{aligned}$$
    (12) The upper bound of \\(t_{BO} + t_{CCA}\\) is reached when a node extracts
    highest back off timer at each back off stage, and at each back off stage it finds
    the channel busy. The value is 120*\\(t_b\\), where \\(t_b\\) is the duration
    of one time slot [48]. The average number of retransmissions \\(n_R\\) is modelled
    using Geometric distribution, that is the probability of number of failures before
    first successful transmission [50]. $$\\begin{aligned} n_R= (1-p)/p. \\end{aligned}$$
    (13) where, p is the probability of successful transmission given by: $$\\begin{aligned}
    p=\\frac{1}{n_c}. \\end{aligned}$$ (14) where, \\(n_c\\) is the number of nodes
    contending for channel access. For the worse case analysis, number of nodes contending
    is taken as number of nodes of the network (n) as stated in [48]. Based on the
    above discussion, \\(t_w\\) of a node can be calculated as the time required for
    receiving start message from all neighbors. Thus, $$\\begin{aligned} t_w = k*(t_{tx}+
    n_R*t_{tx}). \\end{aligned}$$ (15) where, k is the average degree of the network.
    Similarly, \\(delay_{u,max}\\) can be written as: $$\\begin{aligned} delay_{u,max}=
    t_{tx} + n_R*t_{tx}. \\end{aligned}$$ (16) Next stop location of Linear The data
    packets received in S &C state contain the coordinates of source RNs. The farthest
    RN in the direction of move of Linear will be its next stop location. However,
    there may be a situation where no data packet is received from the farthest RN.
    Such situation may arise due to two reasons: first, there are no BNs (in receive
    state) in the direction of move of Linear and second, data packet from BN may
    be lost due to various reasons (congestion, link quality, etc.). In this case,
    Linear stops at a location that is R meters away from present stop location. Although
    the probability of packet loss is low due to re-transmission, however, loss of
    packet of corner nodes for \\(Re \\ge R_0\\) and of RNs for \\(Re=R_0\\), can
    effect the decision of Linear. 3.5 Critical cases In this subsection, we discuss
    some critical situations that may occur during data acquisition. These situations
    are discussed separately for ease of understanding. 3.5.1 How will a BN mark itself
    as RN if BNs of two MZs are in receive state Fig. 10 BNs laying in different MZs
    Full size image The example discussed for RN selection in previous subsection
    assumed that BNs of one MZ are in receive state. However, in some cases BNs of
    two adjacent MZs may be in receive state as shown in Fig. 10. Nodes 6, 17, 20,
    29, 26, 27, and 30 are the BNs of one subregion. Nodes 7, 19, and 18 are the BNs
    of second subregion and nodes 8, 9, and 21 are the BNs of third subregion. We
    propose a rule based scheme for marking a BN as RN, when BNs of two MZs are in
    receive state. When all neighbors of a BN are BNs of another MZ: The BN will mark
    itself as RN, since it is the only BN of its MZ, among its neighbors. For example,
    refer Fig. 10, where BNs of three subregions are shown, as mentioned above. Node
    8 is a BN of third subregion, and all other neighbors are the BNs of second subregion,
    Hence, node 8 marks itself as RN. When only one neighbor of a BN is in its MZ
    and others are in different MZs: The BN will mark itself as RN, since it is the
    node laying on the corner of its MZ. For example please refer nodes 7, 19, 9,
    and 21 in Fig. 10. For nodes 7 and 19, node 18 is the only neighbor BN in their
    subregion. Similarly, node 9 and node 21 are the only BN neighbors of each other
    laying in same subregion. Thus, these nodes mark themselves as RNs. When more
    than one neighbors of a BN are its MZ and others are in different MZs: The BN
    will measure angle \\(\\theta\\) with RN of its MZ, and declare itself as RN if
    \\(\\theta > \\theta _0\\) (as explained in Section 3.3). For example, refer nodes
    27, 26, 29, 20, and 17 of the first subregion and node 18 of second subregion
    in Fig. 10. These nodes will calculate \\(\\theta\\) from neighboring RN and will
    decide accordingly. 3.5.2 How will data collection be accomplished by multiple
    Linears We have discussed data harvesting by single Linear, so far. However, for
    a large area multiple Linears can be utilized for data collection. Figure 4 shows
    data acquisition by two Linears, where each Linear has a fixed area in which it
    can collect data, named as its ROA. It is equal to \\(\\frac{L}{S}\\), where,
    L is length of the field perpendicular to the direction of move of Linear and
    S is number of sinks. The area is divided into three subregions namely, A, B,
    and C. RN selection, next stop location, and stop time calculation remain same
    for multiple Linears to that of single Linear. However, the maximum range (R)
    with which Linear transmits control signal to wake the nodes, changes for multiple
    Linears. R should be selected in such a way, so that it covers the nodes laying
    in the ROA of the Linear horizontally. Thus, \\(R=\\frac{L}{2S}\\) for proper
    functioning of the proposed protocol. However, the BNs laying near to the dividing
    boundary of ROAs of both sinks (nodes 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 4) may receive signals
    from both Linears. These nodes can send data to any of the Linear, and Linears
    can exchange data before the generation of control actions. The range R decreases
    with increase in number of sinks and so does the area from which data is to be
    collected for current S &C state. However, number of sinks must be bounded by
    a value where R becomes 2r. Since increasing number of sinks beyond this point
    will result in a collecting region as small as the sensing range of a sensor node
    that in turn leads to one hop data collection by Linear. Number of collecting
    regions are \\(\\lceil \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil\\) for one sink where W is the length
    of the area along the direction of move of Linear. Lemma 1 Total energy consumption
    of the network decreases by \\(\\frac{h_{avg}}{h_{avg}^{''}}\\) for S Linears.
    Proof Let us assume that energy consumption of the network with \\(N_b\\) sources
    (BNs) and one sink is \\(E_T\\), where, $$\\begin{aligned} E_T= N_{b}h_{avg}E_b.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (17) where, \\(E_b\\) is the average energy consumed in one hop
    transmission and is calculated taking the various factors (backoff and retransmissions)
    into account, as discussed in Section 3.4 and \\(h_{avg}\\) is average number
    of hops between source and destination. As number of sinks increases by 1, ROA
    and R of a sink shrink by a fraction of 2. Number of collecting regions are \\(\\lceil
    \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil S\\), from which data is to be collected for S sinks. Energy
    consumption for S sinks is: $$\\begin{aligned} E_{T}^{''}= \\lceil \\frac{W}{R}
    \\rceil SE_S. \\end{aligned}$$ (18) where, \\(E_S\\) is energy consumption for
    one collecting region and is given by: $$\\begin{aligned} E_S= N_b^{''}h_{avg}^{''}E_b=\\frac{N_b}{
    \\lceil \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil S}h_{avg}^{''}E_b. \\end{aligned}$$ (19) where, \\(h_{avg}^{''}\\)
    is the average number of hops when distance between source and destination in
    one collecting region with reduced range R. Thus, $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{E_{T}}{E_{T}^{''}}=\\frac{h_{avg}}{h_{avg}^{''}}.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (20) Validation of the proposed lemma is done through numerical
    analysis and network simulation. For numerical analysis, \\(h_{avg}\\) and \\(h_{avg}^{''}\\)
    is calculated by the pdf given in [49] and \\(E_b\\) is calculated as the sum
    of energy dissipated in different states namely, idle, transmit, and receive.
    In idle state, average number of backoffs is calculated by the equation proposed
    in [48]. Energy in transmit and receive states are calculated taking average number
    of retransmissions (discussed in Section 3.4) and packet size into account. Values
    are calculated and simulated for two networks of 42 nodes (low average degree
    \\(\\approx\\) 6) and 150 nodes (high average degree \\(\\approx\\) 20) deployed
    in an area of \\(900\\times 500\\) \\(m^2\\). For network simulation, average
    of 100 runs is considered as the values saturate after this point. The result
    shown in Fig. 11 depicts that numerical analysis matches with the simulation.
    Number of sinks is varied from 1–2 for this network since, range of sink R reduces
    to 125m that is less than 2r (160m). 4 Results and discussion Fig. 11 Validation
    of Lemma 1 through numerical analysis and simulation Full size image Table 3 Simulation
    setup Full size table The section discusses the performance of the three modules
    of LERC. Simulation is performed on the discrete event simulator NS3.30.1 and
    various simulation parameters are mentioned in Table 3. Experiments are performed
    on a data set [51] consisting of 42 nodes deployed in a \\(900\\times 500 m^2\\)
    area. The range of sensor nodes is set as 80m as this is the minimum range for
    connected graph. The data set [51] consists of soil moisture values and position
    information at 42 locations in a farm. The proposed work identifies source nodes
    (RNs) among BNs that in turn depend on position information of sensor nodes. Moreover,
    the proposed work intends to reduce energy consumption in data collection from
    RNs. Thus, the data set is apt to add a realistic flavor for simulating the impact
    of the proposed work. First, energy consumption in reduced overhead broadcast
    is discussed in comparison to cluster trail [26] and MARP [28]. Since, reduced
    overhead broadcast does not depend on the data values of sensor nodes, different
    networks are created keeping transmission range constant. Number of nodes are
    increased randomly to vary average degree of the network by 2. Average degree
    is varied from 6–20, varying nodes from 42–150. In Section 4.2, energy consumption
    in data transmission from RNs to Linear and event region map construction at Linear
    for different value of \\(\\theta _0\\) is discussed. RN selection depends on
    BN identification (proposed in [7]) that in turn is data dependent. Scarcity of
    available agriculture data set restricts the evaluation of RN selection, stop
    time modelling and total energy consumption to one data set [51]. However, robustness
    of RN selection is shown in different topology by varying \\(\\theta _0\\). RN
    selection is scheme is compared with the recent state-of-the-art methods in terms
    of event region map construction in Section 4.2.2 for \\(\\theta _0=0^\\circ\\).
    Stop time modelling is evaluated by comparing the end to end delay in transmitting
    data from RNs to Linear with the modelled stop time of Linear. End to end delay
    is recorded for different values of \\(\\theta _0\\). Total energy consumption
    of the proposed scheme compared with CH based data transmission, cluster trail,
    and MARP is presented in Section 4.4. Total energy consumption of data collection
    is the sum of energy consumed in BN detection, RN selection and transmission from
    identified RNs to Linear. BN detection mechanism [7] is our previous work and
    is evaluated in same simulation environment and data set. Thus, reduced overhead
    broadcast, RN selection, and stop time modeling are evaluated by simulation in
    this work and total energy consumption includes simulation results from our previous
    work in same simulation environment. 4.1 Analysis of reduced overhead broadcast
    Energy consumption in dissemination of start message for the proposed reduced
    overhead broadcast scheme, cluster trail scheme, and flooding is shown in Fig.
    12. The proposed mechanism is tested for different networks, keeping transmission
    range constant. Number of nodes are increased to vary average degree of the network
    by 2. Average degree is varied from 6–20, varying nodes from 42–150. The proposed
    reduced overhead broadcast scheme consumes 33.3%\\(-\\)61.1% and 19.5%\\(-\\)46.6%
    less energy than the flooding scheme [28] and cluster trail [26] respectively.
    A node receives k number of messages and transmits only one message as opposed
    to multiple message transmissions in others. Fig. 12 Energy consumption in start
    message dissemination Full size image 4.2 Analysis of data transmission from BNs
    to Linear and construction of MZ map at Linear In this subsection, variation in
    number of RNs and corresponding energy consumption of the network, with respect
    to the tuning of angle \\(\\theta _0\\) is presented. As \\(\\theta _0\\) increases,
    number of RNs (source) decreases and so is the energy consumption (as shown in
    Fig. 13). The values written in brackets are the number of RNs for corresponding
    \\(\\theta _0\\). \\(\\theta _0\\) is varied from 0\\(^\\circ\\) to 45\\(^\\circ\\)
    (maximum \\(\\theta\\) is 45\\(^\\circ\\) from the formula given in Section 3.3),
    with an interval of 1. However, only those values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is shown
    in the figure for which there is a change from previous value. When \\(\\theta
    _0\\) is 0\\(^\\circ\\), all BNs act as data transmitters to Linear. A BN does
    not mark itself as a RN if its \\(\\theta\\) (angle of the gradient of line joining
    it to its previous RN) is less than \\(\\theta _0\\). Thus, number of RNs keeps
    on decreasing with increasing \\(\\theta _0\\). For \\(\\theta _0\\) = 40\\(^\\circ\\),
    number of RNs and energy consumption are minimum. For this value, only the BNs
    that are one hop neighbors of Linear and the corner nodes act as RNs. However,
    this value is not the optimum one to achieve reliability (Re), since it depends
    on the MZ construction at Linear. Fig. 13 Variation of energy consumption in data
    transmission from RNs to Linear with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image
    Fig. 14 MZ map at Linear for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 0 Full size image Fig. 15 Variation
    in the construction of MZ at Linear with varying \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image
    Linear constructs MZs, depending on the data and position information received
    from RNs. Constructed MZs at Linear for some values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is shown
    in Figs. 14 and 15. When \\(\\theta _0\\) is 0\\(^\\circ\\) (refer Fig. 14), all
    BNs send data to Linear and MZ is constructed with 100% reliability. As \\(\\theta
    _0\\) increases, number of RNs decreases gradually and MZ at Linear changes. For
    example, when \\(\\theta _0\\) is 5\\(^\\circ\\), nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 34
    do not mark themselves as RNs. However, exclusion of these nodes have insignificant
    impact on construction of MZ at Linear (it can be clearly seen in Fig. 15a). Similarly,
    for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 15\\(^\\circ\\) nodes 15, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 31 are excluded
    (Fig. 15b) and for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 20\\(^\\circ\\), nodes 17 and 20 are removed
    from RN set having a negligible variation in MZ map at Linear (Fig. 15c). When
    node 30 marks itself as non-RN node for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 35\\(^\\circ\\) (Fig.
    15d), distortion in MZ map is seen with respect to the original MZ for \\(\\theta
    _0\\) = 0\\(^\\circ\\). For \\(\\theta _0\\) = 40\\(^\\circ\\) only corner nodes
    and one hop neighbors are marked as RNs. (refer Fig. 15e). Thus, it can be inferred
    from the above discussion that as value of \\(\\theta _0\\) increases, number
    of data transmitter BNs and overall energy consumption decreases. However, after
    a certain value of \\(\\theta _0\\), data collected from RNs become insufficient
    to construct a correct MZ map at Linear. For the topology under consideration
    \\(\\theta _0\\) should be less than or equal to 20\\(^\\circ\\) for a reliable
    construction of MZ map at Linear. Moreover, Fig. 15f shows the constructed MZ
    map for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 35\\(^\\circ\\) without corner nodes 4 and 12. The
    map shows that corner nodes are key enablers for MZ map construction and hence,
    must be selected as RNs. 4.2.1 Safe range of \\(\\theta _0\\) To test the variation
    of MZ map with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) further, networks are deployed by varying
    number of nodes from 50–150 with an increase of 1 in average degree in the area
    900\\(\\times\\)500 \\(m^2\\). Change in boundary and BNs was insignificant for
    the networks of more than 150 nodes. RNs are identified by varying \\(\\theta
    _0\\) from \\(0^\\circ -45^\\circ\\) and effect on the boundary is observed. As
    \\(\\theta _0\\) increases number of RNs decreases and so is the energy consumption
    of the network. However, the reconstructed boundary of MZs deforLinear with decrease
    in number of RNs. \\(\\theta _0\\) after which no significant change in energy
    consumption is recorded for various networks is shown in Fig. 16. The results
    show that the minimum value among all recorded values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is \\(20^\\circ\\).
    Maximum \\(\\theta _0\\) to retain the shape of coarse boundary is shown in Fig.
    16. For correct reconstruction of boundary, maximum \\(\\theta _0\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\).
    Thus, \\(\\theta _0\\) must be tuned between \\(20^\\circ\\) and \\(30^\\circ\\).
    \\(\\theta _0\\) selected in this range reduces energy consumption while maintaining
    the correctness of coarse boundary of reconstructed MZ map. Limitation Exact tuning
    of \\(\\theta _0\\) is a limitation of the proposed work as mentioned in Section
    3.3. Fig. 16 Optimal values of \\(\\theta _0\\) for energy consumption and correct
    MZ map reconstruction Full size image 4.2.2 Comparison with RN selection schemes
    The RN selection algorithm of the proposed LERC protocol is compared with COBOM
    [19], DEMOCO [21], and the algorithm proposed in [20]. Figures 17, 18 and 19 show
    the selected RNs among BNs and the demarcated boundary map by the algorithms.
    Both the algorithms identify lesser number of RNs than the proposed scheme, however,
    give ambiguous and incorrect results. Fig. 17 RNs and event region construction
    by COBOM [19] Full size image As shown in Fig. 17, COBOM identifies 9 RNs among
    20 BNs. If a node has different reading (depending on threshold) than its neighbors,
    it is marked as BNs. RNs are selected among BNs by suppressing the neighbors.
    A node in COBOM declares itself as RN if none of its neighbors broadcast their
    status as RN within a predefined time. RN transmits its data and its neighbors’
    IDs. Thus, every two-hop neighbors are marked as RNs. Node 27 informs the sink
    that its neighbors, nodes 18, 19, and 22 are in different subregion. On the other
    hand, node 21 informs that nodes 9, 13, and 22 are in same subregion. Nodes 17
    and 8 informs that nodes 7 and 18 are in different subregion. According to these
    reports, sink draws a boundary as shown in Fig. 17 where nodes of two different
    subregions are merged (please refer Fig. 14 for correct map). COBOM is designed
    for continuous object boundary monitoring, where only two subregions exist: one
    in which object is present and second in which object is not present. Fig. 18
    RNs and event region construction by DEMOCO [21] Full size image Fig. 19 RNs and
    event region construction by the scheme proposed in [20] Full size image DEMOCO
    reduces number of BNs and hence, number of RNs to minimize number of source nodes.
    It enhances COBOM by selecting only \"IN\" nodes as BNs leaving \"OUT\" nodes.
    Thus, it selects BNs that lay on one side of the boundary. BNs, RNs, and the event
    region boundary constructed at BS by DEMOCO is shown in Fig. 18. It reduces number
    of RNs to 5, however the event region boundary formed at BS is Incorrect. The
    BNs belonging to four event regions are entirely suppressed since, DEMOCO selects
    nodes laying one side of the boundary as BNs. Thus, neighbors of BNs laying in
    different event regions are not selected as BNs and RNs. DEMOCO reduces number
    of RNs to a great extent, however, this in turn leads to suppression of information
    from different event regions. The algorithm proposed in [20], identifies a node
    as BN if its data value is different from at least one neighbor and distance from
    this neighbor is least among the distances from all of its neighbors. Every two
    hop neighbor among BNs is selected as RN. In this course, the algorithm reduces
    RNs by 72% as compared to LERC. However, such suppression leads to information
    loss and the constructed event region map is faulty as shown in Fig. 19. 4.3 Stop
    time for the Linear In this subsection, the modelled stop time is evaluated by
    varying the application dependent threshold \\(\\theta _0\\) as shown in Fig.
    20. Calculated stop time is 30seconds for network of 42 nodes and simulated End
    to End (E2E) delay for \\(\\theta _0\\) = \\(0^\\circ\\) is 23.5seconds. The E2E
    delay decreases slightly with increase in \\(\\theta _0\\), as number of RNs decreases
    with increase in \\(\\theta _0\\) (explained in previous subsection). Decrease
    in number of source nodes in turn decreases in-network traffic and retransmissions.
    Hence, E2E delay decreases. However, for \\(\\theta _0>40^\\circ\\) E2E delay
    saturates at 23.05seconds as decrease in number of RNs seizes beyond this point
    (shown in previous subsection). The modelled stop time for two sinks is lesser
    than that of one sink because of the number of hops between Linear and farthest
    RN. E2E delay for two sinks is less than the modelled stop time and decreases
    slightly with increasing \\(\\theta _0\\). Hence, it can be concluded that modelled
    stop time of Linear is adequate to collect data from all RNs. Fig. 20 Variation
    in end to end delay with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image 4.4 Overall
    analysis of the system The proposed scheme is compared with a clustering based
    data collection by mobile BS moving on fixed trajectory [41], to prove the efficacy
    (in terms of energy consumption) of data transmission from BNs to Linear over
    the data transmission from CHs to mobile BS. Next, the proposed scheme is compared
    with MARP that is a recent sensor actuator coordination protocol. Further, the
    proposed scheme is compared with two recent agent based routing protocols. Energy
    efficient Geographic Routing Protocol based on mobile sink (EGRPM) [23] is mobile
    BS based data collection protocol, whereas, Energy Efficient Layered Routing Protocol
    (EELRP) [52] is a static BS based layered routing protocol. In addition, the proposed
    scheme is compared with cluster trail [26] that is a communication protocol implementing
    limited broadcast for mobile BS location information dissemination. Experiments
    are performed on the data set [51] consisting of 42 nodes. Total energy consumption
    is the energy consumed in transmitting start message from Linear to nodes and
    data transmission from RNs to Linear. To test reduced overhead broadcast scheme
    we varied number of nodes since BNs are not required for it. However, energy consumption
    in data transmission from RNs to Linear for varying number of nodes requires selection
    of BNs in each setting. Scarcity of available agriculture data set restricts the
    performance evaluation to this data set [51]. However, variation in number of
    nodes can be done by extrapolation technique. Fig. 21 Comparison of total energy
    consumption with recent protocols Full size image The proposed scheme performs
    better in terms of energy consumption as shown in Fig. 21. For network of 42 sensors,
    there is 12 %, 19%, 24%, 34%, 56% decrease in energy consumption with respect
    to EGRPM, CH based scheme, cluster trail, MARP, and EELRP, respectively. Total
    energy consumption of the proposed scheme is the sum of energy dissipation in
    BN selection (algorithm proposed in [9]), start message dissemination, and data
    transmission from selected RNs to Linear. For CH based data transmission, there
    are two phases namely, initial and collection. Initial phase involves control
    message flooding from mobile BS to the sensor nodes, hop count transmission from
    each node to BS, and maximum and minimum hop count flooding from BS to sensor
    nodes. Flooding of several control messages incur high energy consumption, however,
    it is a one time process. In collection phase, CHs are elected by several control
    message transmission, sensor nodes are attached to CHs as Cluster Members (CMs),
    and CHs choose another CH as next hop for forwarding of data transmission. At
    the end, data is transmitted from CMs to respective CHs and is forwarded to BS
    via another CHs. In the proposed scheme, BN selection algorithm consumes approximately
    529 mJ in which identification of BNs laying on network boundary (one time process)
    consumes 400 mJ (for details please refer [7]). The initial phase of [41] consumes
    less energy (=350 mJ) than the proposed scheme despite of more number of message
    exchanges. The reason behind this decrease is the size of packets. In BN identification,
    data packets are transmitted in addition to the control packet transmission whereas,
    in [41], only control packets are flooded. However, in collection phase the CH
    election, cluster formation, and data transmission consumes more energy than reduced
    overhead broadcast and data transmission from selected RNs. EELRP [52] divides
    the network into sectors centered at the BS that sits in the middle of it. Each
    node transmits three control packets to select agent of their sector and sends
    data to the agent via multi-hop. Agents of the sectors aggregates and forwards
    the data to BS via multi-hop. The proposed scheme performs better than EELRP since
    selecting agent involves multiple messages and moreover, multi-hop data transmission
    between sensor nodes to agent and agent to BS causes high energy consumption.
    Table 4 Key findings of the research Full size table EGRPM [23] divides the network
    into similar grids where the size of grid is decided based on the length and width
    of the network. Each cell nodes flood control messages to identify agent of the
    cell. Mobile BS traverses through the network and stops at four locations on the
    periphery of the network. Each cell node sends data to the agent of cell via one-hop
    or multi-hop. The agent then transmits data to mobile BS via one-hop or multi-hop.
    LERC performs better than EGRPM in terms of energy consumption as in EGRPM selection
    of agent is an energy consuming process due to flooding of control messages. Moreover,
    all nodes are source nodes and forwards data towards agent via multi-hop. Moreover,
    agent forwards data to mobile BS via multi-hop. Average path length is 5 for EGRPM.
    LERC achieves less energy consumption by reducing number of source nodes and minimizing
    location information messages of mobile BS. Energy consumption of cluster trail
    is more than the proposed scheme as mobile BS location information broadcast consumes
    much energy as shown in previous subsection. Data transmissions from sensor nodes
    consume slightly more energy due to the movement of sink. In some cases, BS moves
    before data is received by it. In such cases, nodes follow the trail generated
    and ends up into many multihop transmissions. The proposed scheme consumes less
    energy than MARP [28], because of two reasons. First, the reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme and second is the selective sources. In MARP, actuator floods its control
    message to establish a path from each source to it. Flooding causes high energy
    consumption as already shown in previous subsection. Moreover, all nodes transmit
    sensed data to the actuator during its pause time that consumes more energy than
    the data transmission from a few RNs in the proposed scheme. A summary of the
    key findings in this research is presented in Table 4. 4.5 Interpretability and
    explainability of performance gain over existing methods The performance gain
    of the proposed mechanism is twofold: Correct map construction and Low energy
    consumption. Correct map construction is achieved by transmitting data from RNs.
    The existing mechanisms for RN selection mechanism are developed for selecting
    appropriate nodes among BNs. However, these methods do not include the communication
    cost from RNs to BS. Therefore, to evaluate the communication cost of the proposed
    mechanism, it is compared with existing communication protocols. Thus, the proposed
    scheme is compared with two class of state-of-art mechanisms: RN selection mechanisms
    and communication protocols. Correct map construction is achieved by the proposed
    mechanism even if nodes of more than two event regions lie nearby. The existing
    methods fail to reconstruct the boundaries at BS in such a scenario (As described
    in Introduction section and shown in the results (Figs. 17 and 19). However, in
    case of two event regions sharing a single boundary, existing methods perform
    better than the proposed mechanism as less number of RNs are selected by existing
    mechanisms. As RNs are the sources for data transmission, less number of RNs result
    into reduced energy consumption. There are two components contributing for low
    energy consumption in data transmission for local map construction than the existing
    methods. First component is the reduced overhead in Linear location information
    dissemination. Each node waits for its neighbour to transmit the control packet
    having Linear location information and sends only one message. Second component
    is the reduced number of sources. However, for a particular boundary, decrease
    in number of RNs beyond a point reduces the energy consumption but hampers the
    correctness of map constructed at Linear. Selection of this point is the limitation
    of our work as mentioned in above subsection. The cost of correct local map construction
    with low energy consumption at Linear is increased delay. Linear waits for a certain
    period of time modelled as the Stop Time before decision making and actuation.
    This time includes the waiting time of nodes for location information dissemination
    of Linear and the data transmission time from the farthest RNs to Linear. The
    waiting time for Linear location information dissemination ensures reduced energy
    consumption and data transmission time guarantees the correctness of constructed
    map. However, the application under consideration can tolerate the increased delay.
    5 Conclusion The paper develops a distributed lightweight scheme for event region
    map construction at Linear. It identifies minimal set BNs as source nodes and
    models stop time of Linear to collect information from these nodes. A reduced
    overhead broadcast scheme is proposed for location information dissemination where
    each node transmits only one message. This scheme addresses the challenge of reducing
    message overhead in location information dissemination. Stop time is modelled
    as the sum of control message transmission to the farthest BN, and data packet
    transmission from it to Linear. The challenge of modelling adequate stop time
    for data collection is addressed in this module. Next, to reduce network traffic,
    a minimal set BNs are selected as data transmitters (RN) to Linear. The RNs are
    selected such as the data transmitted by them must construct a correct map at
    Linear. Moreover, data collection in multiple Linear scenario is investigated.
    Simulation results demonstrated a significant decrease in energy consumption with
    respect to the state-of-art mechanisms. Data availability Not applicable. References

  description: Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a core mechanism of the internet of
    things used in the army, robotics, agriculture, environment, etc. Wireless detection
    and monitoring applications require WSN energy systems and message transmission
    dependability. Many routing techniques based on clustering and hierarchical topology
    have been developed to increase WSN performance and optimize energy usage. Most
    routing protocols don't consider all the metrics needed to extend network life.
    This work introduces Probability Density Based Adaptive-LEACH (PDBAC-LEACH), an
    enhanced algorithm of a LEACH protocol aimed to equalize the energy exhaustion
    of sensor nodes to maximize WSN longevity. The suggested methodology selects Cluster
    Heads (CHs) using sensor node residual energy. Only nodes with enough current
    could be chosen the CH. From then, it prioritizes current energies and distance
    to the Base Station (BS) to identify a root CH with higher present energy than
    average CH energy and a shorter average distance to the BS (base station). This
    parent CH contains root CH information, by using a multi-hop technique across
    CHs, the root clusters head CH collects and transmits compressed data to the BS.
    They were enhancing an algorithm in MATLAB R2016b. The model findings showed that
    the supplying protocol is better than LEACH Protocols used to extend network lifespan.

    1. Introduction With the rapid development of human society and economy, global
    energy shortage and climate problems are becoming increasingly serious, and reducing
    carbon emissions has become a consensus among countries worldwide. Developing
    renewable energy sources such as wind power, solar power, hydropower, etc. is
    an important means of tackling the energy crisis and environmental problems [1],
    and developing new power systems based on these is a significant part of reducing
    carbon emissions. Taking China as an example, the carbon emissions of energy account
    for nearly 90% of the total, while the power industry accounts for 42.5% of the
    total carbon emissions from energy. The increasing grid-connection of distributed
    renewable energy and the adoption of electric vehicles make the power grid system
    more diverse, and the power flow bidirectional. This reduces the anti-disturbance
    ability and adjustment ability and seriously affects the stability of the power
    system [2]. The power grids not only play a vital role in electric energy transmission,
    mutual supply, and backup sharing but also have a significant responsibility in
    ensuring a steady and reliable supply of electricity. Since 2003, the Electric
    Power Research Institute (EPRI) of the United States first innovated power infrastructure
    using information technology, taking the lead in conducting research on smart
    grids [3]. In 2005, Europe also proposed a similar concept of a \"smart grid\",
    aiming at the automation technology in the power transmission and distribution
    process, to ensure the power quality of the EU grids. In 2009, State Grid Corporation
    of China proposed to achieve the digitalization, informatization, and intelligence
    of the power system. In addition, other extensive research is carried out on the
    transformation and upgrading of power grids, and various development concepts
    have been proposed [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], as shown in Fig. 1. The smart grids
    are based on physical power grids, combined with advanced sensing and measurement
    technology, information and computer technology, and control technology, to achieve
    a comprehensive perception of transmission lines and equipment status, enhance
    the ability to detect faults, risk warning, and proactive protection, and improve
    safety and reliability [9]. The \"metaverse\" was initially proposed in N. Stephenson''s
    science fiction novel Snow Crash, and is a new type of internet applications and
    social forms that integrates various emerging technologies and combines reality
    with virtual reality [10]. The metaverse will create massive economic and commercial
    opportunities, thus, becoming the focus of research and development in various
    industries [11], [12], [13], [14]. For example, in 2021, Facebook changed its
    name to \"Meta\" and established the Metaverse team; Epic Games developed the
    game \"Fortnite\", which is closest to the definition of the metaverse. The power
    metaverse is the ultimate embodiment of digitalization, informatization and intelligence
    of the power system, and a complete mapping and real-time interaction of the physical
    power grids in the virtual space [15]. The power metaverse utilizes various emerging
    technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoTs), digital twins, cloud computing,
    big data, blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced human-machine
    interaction to achieve the virtual and real integration of humans and the power
    metaverse, forming an intelligent power system centered around humans [16], [17],
    [18], [19]. Briefly, IoTs technology connects the physical power grid and power
    metaverse by massive wireless power grid sensors, while digital twin, cloud computing,
    big data, blockchain, AI, and human-machine interaction technologies enhance data
    synchronization, analysis, security, decision-making, and user experience in the
    power metaverse. Therefore, the key to achieving both the power metaverse and
    smart grid is electricity data acquisition by means of advanced sensing technology.

    Fig. 1. Future development concepts of power system. Generally, the physical power
    grids include five parts: power generation, transmission, transformation, distribution,
    and consumption, as shown in Fig. 2. In order to obtain more comprehensive data
    for the development of the power metaverse and smart grid, a huge number of distributed
    sensors need to be deployed to collect not only electrical data of the power grids
    for line prediction and early warning, but also collect environmental data from
    the surroundings to achieve a comprehensive perception of climate characteristics.
    Fluctuations or deviations of electrical parameters, such as voltage, current,
    and power, may cause power failure, device damage, and even security risks. The
    normal running of the device is inevitably affected by the surrounding environment.
    Environmental monitoring such as temperature, humidity, wind, and vibration can
    provide more comprehensive data to ensure the normal running of the device. However,
    traditional sensing instruments such as field grinding type electric field meters
    and current transformers always have a large volume and difficult to install on
    the power grid lines with limited space, thus are difficult to use on a large
    scale. In addition, energy supply still remains a problem [20]. Direct power supply
    from the low-voltage side through transmission lines is not possible due to safety
    issues of high voltage levels of power grids. Battery-powered energy is limited,
    requires regular replacement, and is resource-intensive, creating pressure on
    the environment. Therefore, sensors featured as intelligent, multi-parameters,
    miniaturization, high precision, low power, self-powered, wireless transmission,
    low cost, and high reliability, making them more suitable for distributed power
    grids. With the rapid development of MEMS technology and nanotechnology, micro
    and high-performance sensors have increasingly expanded their application fields,
    due to their advantages of small size, low cost, low power, and batch manufacturing.
    By combining multi-parameter micro-sensors with energy-harvesting devices can
    realize long-term, maintenance-free intelligent monitoring of power systems. Download

    Profiles of multi-parameter sensing requirements and potential harvestable energy
    sources in power grid systems. Despite the summary of self-powered sensors in
    areas such as medical health [21], [22], smart cities [23], and smart agriculture
    [24], there is still a lack of review on related sensing technologies for power
    metaverse and smart grids. Here, we review the advances and practical applications
    of self-powered, multi-parameter, micro sensing systems for power metaverse and
    smart grids. The first section provides background information and sensing requirements
    in power grid system. The second and third sections systematically present the
    milestone progress in the development of micro electrical and environmental sensors
    and energy-harvesting technologies. The fourth section comprehensively summarizes
    the applications of self-powered micro sensing systems in power grids. Finally,
    the challenges and future research directions to construct smart grids based on
    self-powered multi-parameter sensors are discussed. 2. Multi-parameter micro sensors
    for power grids Amidst energy shortage and unequal distribution, the new power
    system needs to undertake large-scale, long-distance power transmission with high
    capacity. As the integration of renewable energy sources like photovoltaic and
    wind power increases, the load side of power grid is plagued by harmonic and voltage
    issues, while the power generation side struggles with frequency and voltage problems,
    leading to equipment damage, power grids instability, and posing enormous harm
    [25]. Additionally, extreme weather poses a threat to new energy power generation,
    and the natural climate affects the power load capacity of high-voltage transmission
    lines. To address these issues, low-power micro sensors can be deployed across
    a wide area to collect electrical information such as voltage and current, as
    well as environmental data like temperature, humidity, and vibration. 2.1. Micro
    electrical sensors Real-time monitoring of voltage and current at key nodes and
    equipment is crucial for ensuring reliable power system operation and transmission
    security. This section focuses on the latest research progress in micro voltage/electric
    field and current/magnetic field sensors. Voltage sensors are classified into
    four types based on their working principle: induced charge principle, electrostatic
    force principle, inverse piezoelectric effect, and electro-optical effect. On
    the other hand, current sensors can be classified into three types: induction
    coil principle, piezoelectric effect, and magnetoresistance effect. 2.1.1. Micro
    voltage/electric field sensors (MVESs) 2.1.1.1. MVESs based on induced charge
    principle Fig. 3a-i illustrates the basic principle of micro voltage/electric
    field sensors (MVESs) based on induced charge principle. These sensors consist
    of a shielding electrode, induction electrode, driving structure, and auxiliary
    structure. When a vertical electric field is applied, the shield electrode of
    the sensor undergoes periodic vibration, leading to a periodic change in the induced
    charge on the induction electrode. This process generates an induced current i0,
    which can be converted into a voltage signal through the trans-resistance amplifier
    to measure the voltage/electric field. Current research on MVESs based on the
    induced charge principle primarily focuses on improving sensitivity and resolution
    through the optimization of driving modes, electrode direction and shape, vibration
    direction, and other factors. The driving modes of MVESs based on the induced
    charge principle are mainly categorized into three types: electrostatic actuation,
    thermal actuation, and piezoelectric actuation. Download : Download high-res image

    [47] (Copyright 2020 Elsevier); (iii) Micro ring resonator MVESs [42] (Copyright
    2022 IEEE). Electrostatic-actuation MVESs involve generating an electrostatic
    force between the driving structures, causing the shielding electrode to vibrate
    periodically with the same frequency as the driving voltage. This method is advantageous
    due to its fast-response time and simple structure. For instance, Yang et al.
    [26] design a micro electric field sensor using SOI micromachining technology.
    By optimizing the motion direction of the shielding electrode to reduce edge effects
    (Fig. 3a-ii), they achieve a sensitivity of 0.404 mV/(kV/m) with a range of 0–50 kV/m.
    Chu et al. [27] report a MEMS electric field sensor with torsional resonant structures,
    which increases the effective area of the induction electrode and achieves a sensitivity
    of 4.55 mV/(kV/m) with a range of 0 ∼ 50 kV/m, which is an order of magnitude
    higher than that of existing sensors. On the other hand, thermal-actuation MVESs
    involves generating Joule heat by applying voltage, causing the driving structure
    to bend or expand, resulting in a reciprocating motion of the shield electrode.
    This method has lower driving voltage and power consumption and can obtain greater
    displacement through cascading structures. As shown in Fig. 3a-iii, Bahreyni et
    al. [28] design a micro electric field sensor with a fishbone-shaped thermal drive
    structure, improving sensing resolution up to 5.67 times by amplifying the shielded
    electrode''s displacement with a leverage structure. Finally, in piezoelectric-actuation
    MVESs, a piezoelectric driving layer deforms by applying voltage, resulting in
    the vibration of the shield electrode. This method has advantages such as fast
    response speed and low cost. As shown in Fig. 3a-iv, Lei et al. [29], [30] propose
    a PZT-based MEMS electric field sensor with a low driving voltage. The movable
    and fixed electrodes act mutually as the induction and shielding electrodes, improving
    charge induction efficiency and achieving a sensitivity of 0.292 mV/(kV/m) with
    1 V AC driving voltage at 0 ∼ 50 kV/m. MVESs based on the induced charge principle
    have a long history and offer numerous advantages, including practicality, small
    size, low cost, and ease of production. However, several challenges also remain,
    such as a short lifespan of the mechanical structure, high power, weak detectable
    signals, and poor long-term stability. The electrostatic and piezoelectric actuation
    methods have limited driving force and displacement, while thermal actuation is
    sensitive to environmental temperature. 2.1.1.2. MVESs based on electrostatic
    force principle Fig. 3b-i demonstrates the basic principle of MVESs based on the
    electrostatic force principle. When subjected to an electric field, a substantial
    amount of induced charge accumulates on the metal film''s surface, generating
    an electrostatic force that causes the film to deform. This deformation results
    in a change in resistance or displacement, enabling the measurement of the electric
    field. MVESs based on the electrostatic force principle typically exhibit low
    static power consumption and a high signal-to-noise ratio due to the absence of
    an external drive source. Currently, MVESs based on the electrostatic force principle
    measure the deformation and displacement parameters induced by the electrostatic
    force by mainly coupling the piezoresistive effect, optical principle, and mode
    localized effect. MVESs coupled with the electrostatic force and piezoresistive
    effect exhibit an output frequency twice the electric field frequency, effectively
    separating the noise and achieving a high signal-to-noise ratio. As shown in Fig.
    3b-ii, Han et al. [31] design a trampoline type MEMS electric field sensor for
    measuring AC and DC. The electrostatic force deforms the silicon springs under
    the effect of an electric field, changing the piezoresistive doping region''s
    resistance (Wheatstone bridge) on the springs and converting the electric field
    into a differential voltage signal output. The sensor achieves a high resolution
    of 172 V/m/Hz1/2 (AC) and 301 V/m (DC) at 312 V/m∼700 kV/m. The sensor utilizes
    the measured electric field as the driving source, reducing static power consumption.
    However, its cutoff frequency is often limited by the mechanical structure''s
    resonant frequency, requiring structural optimization based on different testing
    requirements. Similarly, MVESs coupled with electrostatic force and optical principles
    provide distortion-free detection that is immune to external electromagnetic fields.
    As shown in Fig. 3b-iii, Kainz et al. [32] propose an innovative MEMS electric
    field sensor that utilizes electrostatic force and optics to minimize distortion
    in measured electric fields. This sensor comprises an LED, photodiode, blackout
    metal, movable silicon block, and silicon spring. As the electric field acts on
    the sensor, the electrostatic force drives the silicon blocks to reciprocate horizontally,
    resulting in a change of light flux. This change is then converted into output
    current by the photodiode, achieving a high resolution of 100 V/m/Hz1/2 and a
    wide measuring range of tens of kV/m. However, the optical module increases the
    size and complexity of the sensor structure, the difficulty of preparation, and
    the static power consumption. MVESs coupled with electrostatic force and mode
    localized effect can utilize the high sensitivity of amplitude ratio to achieve
    high-resolution detection. Liu et al. [33] propose a closed-loop feedback electrostatic
    force and mode localized effect coupled MEMS electric field sensor [34], [35]
    to enhance the sensing resolution and sensitivity. As shown in Fig. 3b-iv, the
    sensor comprises three symmetrical resonators with tiny air gaps between them
    for electrostatic coupling. When an electric field is introduced, the input electrode
    generates electrostatic stiffness disturbance on resonator 1, detuning the system
    and causing a mode localized effect. Under the mode localized effect, even small
    disturbances can cause dramatic changes in the system, converting the electric
    field into the amplitude ratio of resonators and achieving a high resolution of
    10 V/m and sensitivity of 3.2 (kV/m)−1 at 0–10 kV/m. 2.1.1.3. MVESs based on inverse
    piezoelectric effect The inverse piezoelectric effect is the phenomenon of deformation
    of piezoelectric materials under the effect of the external electric field. Fig.
    3c-i illustrates the basic principle of MVESs based on the inverse piezoelectric
    effect, mainly utilizing the deformation of piezoelectric materials under an external
    electric field to detect changes in capacitance or resistance. As shown in Fig.
    3c-ii, Han et al. [36] propose a high-resolution capacitive electric field sensor
    on the inverse piezoelectric effect that uses a piezoelectric film to drive a
    micro-cantilever beam to bend up and down, converting the electric field into
    a capacitance change. The sensor achieves high resolution detection of 45 V/m
    and a measurement range of 1.5 MV/m. However, due to the fatigue susceptibility
    of piezoelectric materials, long-term stability testing of the sensor should be
    increased to evaluate their reliability in practical applications. Similarly,
    as shown in Fig. 3c-iii, Cheng et al. [37] propose an electric field sensor with
    a PZT/PDMS/PZT sandwiched bimorph structure, where the upper and lower piezoelectric
    layers deform in opposite directions, increasing the capacitance variation of
    the Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer and achieving a high resolution detection
    of 0.1 V/m at − 3–3 kV/cm. In Fig. 3c-iv, Xue et al. [38] propose a MEMS electric
    field sensor based on the inverse piezoelectric effect and piezoresistive effect
    to address the incompatibility between broad spectrum and large dynamic range
    of the electric field measurement. The deformation of the piezoelectric crystal
    under the electric field causes strain on the semiconductor film at the top, resulting
    in a change in resistance. This converts the electric field into a differential
    voltage signal output by the Wheatstone bridge, with a bandwidth of up to 100 kHz
    at 0–1.57 MV/m and increases sensing intensity by 15 times. Recently, MVESs based
    on the inverse piezoelectric effect have garnered attention for their wide measuring
    range, low power consumption, and high temperature stability, making them a new
    research direction. However, the compatibility of piezoelectric materials with
    micro-fabrication processes is a challenge, and long-term stability remains a
    problem that needs to be addressed. 2.1.1.4. MVESs based on electro-optic effect
    The electro-optical effect refers to the phenomenon that certain isotropic transparent
    materials exhibit optical anisotropy under the effect of an electric field, resulting
    in a change in refractive index. Commonly used electro-optic materials mainly
    include potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP),
    lithium titanate (LiTaO3), and lithium niobate (LiNbO3), etc. The integrated Mach-Zehnder
    (M-Z) interferometer is the most commonly used topology in MVESs based on the
    electro-optic effect [39], [40], whose basic principle is shown in Fig. 3d-i.
    The incident light is split into two equal power beams through Y-coupling. Under
    the influence of the electric field, one beam of light experiences a phase difference
    Δφ due to the Pockels effect of the electro-optic crystal, while the other beam
    serves as a reference. The measurement of the electric field can be achieved by
    measuring the output optical power signal through an optical receiver. After passing
    through the asymmetric optical waveguide structure, the output laser power Po
    can be calculated by (2.1) (2.2) Among them, Pi is the input laser power, Po is
    the output laser power, k is the attenuation constant, ne is the intrinsic refractive
    index of the electro-optic crystal, γ33 is the linear electro-optic coefficient
    of the crystal, L is the effective length of the electric field acting on the
    optical waveguide, λ is the wavelength of light, and E is the applied electric
    field. Optimizing the electrode structure and increasing the effective optical
    path is one of the main ways to improve the performance of this type of sensor.
    As shown in Fig. 3d-ii, Zhang et al. [41] propose a LiNbO3 optical waveguide asymmetric
    electric field sensor consisting of a cone antenna array to achieve wider bandwidth
    detection. They achieve a high bandwidth of 9 kHz to 39 GHz and a resolution of
    245 mV/m. Luo et al. [42] report an integrated MEMS electric field sensor based
    on micro ring resonators (MRR) and silicon waveguide (Fig. 3d-iii), which features
    a small size and simple structure. The efficient electro-optical energy coupling
    between MRR and electro-optical polymer film enables the conversion of the electric
    field into a phase difference of output light intensity and achieves a detection
    range of 6.2–150 kV/m and a bandwidth of 5 Hz to 13.5 MHz. MVESs based on the
    electro-optical effect are currently the most widely studied and practical technology.
    They have many advantages, such as lossless transmission, high resolution, wide
    measurement frequency range, and anti-interference capability. However, the complex
    optical system, high price, poor temperature stability, and signal modulation
    and demodulation are still challenges. Table 1 provides a summary of the basic
    performance, advantages, and disadvantages of the various MVESs. These MVESs apply
    to various scenarios in new power systems, realizing overvoltage monitoring of
    transmission lines and equipment, power quality analysis, power metering monitoring,
    electromagnetic environment measurement of transmission corridors, electrostatic
    and transient electric field signal warning, lightning warning, atmospheric electric
    field monitoring, and other functions. In addition to MVESs based on the sensing
    mechanism mentioned above, there are also electric field sensors based on electroluminescence
    [43], electrothermal effect [44], and evanescent field [45]. However, research
    on MVESs based on these new principles is in its infancy and not yet mature. Table

    (MCMSs) 2.1.2.1. MCMSs based on induction coil principle MCMSs based on induction
    coil principle have been used for more than 100 years and are widely used in the
    measurement of AC and transient large current due to their advantages of simple
    structure, wide measuring range, and strong anti-interference ability [56]. Fig.
    4a-i demonstrates the basic principle of MCMSs based on induction coil principle,
    where coils are uniformly and symmetrically wind around a support structure. The
    variation of the wire current induces a change in the magnetic flux through the
    coils, resulting in a change of induced electromotive force at both ends of the
    coil. Therefore, the detection of power line current can be achieved by measuring
    the induced voltage of the three-dimensional sensing coils, which can be calculated
    by the following formula: (2.3) Where, N is the number of coil turns, Φ is the
    magnetic flux through the induction coil, A is the cross-sectional area of the
    coil, μ0 is the vacuum permeability, and r is the distance from the coil to the
    power line. From formula (2.3), increasing N and A, and decreasing r can both
    improve the sensitivity of the sensor, but all aspects of performance and volume
    need to be comprehensively considered in the design. However, the volume and weight
    of the sensor are usually large due to the number and density of windings, the
    winding also difficult to achieve complete uniform symmetry, and the deviation
    of the wire from the center can cause an uneven distribution of magnetic flux
    in the coil to affect measurement accuracy. Therefore, the optimization of the
    structure design and manufacturing process of coils is mainly used to reduce the
    size of sensors, improve the consistency of mass production, and reduce the influence
    of transmission line position on measurement results. As shown in Fig. 4a-ii,
    Li et al. [57], [58] develop a micro current sensor with 3D induction coil based
    on micro-machining process, achieving a sensitivity of 9.38 mV/A and linearity
    of 0.56% with a range of 0–60 A. This sensor has advantages such as good linearity,
    simple structure, and easy installation, but more factors such as temperature
    compensation and electromagnetic shielding should be considered in structural
    design. Yamashita et al. [59] prepare a flexible thin film current sensor based
    on induction coil principle through flexible printed circuit technologies, which
    can be used by winding the cable, greatly reducing installation space and the
    error caused by cable movement, achieving a sensitivity of 39.4 mV/A at 0–20 A.
    As shown in Fig. 4a-iii, Watanabe et al. [60] propose a MEMS Rogowski current
    sensor with a spiral return coil, which forms clockwise and counterclockwise coils
    through TSV (Through Silicon Via) structure to eliminate interference from external
    magnetic fields, achieving linear detection of current at 0–40 A. Download : Download

    MCMSs based on piezoelectric effect The basic principle of MCMSs based on piezoelectric
    effect is that ferromagnet materials suffer a magnetic force under an external
    magnetic field, causing the deformation of piezoelectric materials and outputting
    electrical signals. MCMSs based on piezoelectric effect can use mechanical resonance
    characteristics to improve sensitivity to magnetic field signals close to the
    resonance frequency. They have the advantages of high sensitivity, high resolution,
    and can achieve passive detection. Generally, the most commonly used structure
    is the cantilever beam type, its principle is shown in Fig. 4b-i. One end of the
    piezoelectric cantilever beam is fixed to the substrate, the other end has a permanent
    magnet, and the cantilever is equipped with a piezoelectric layer and electrodes.
    Under the action of a magnetic field, the permanent magnet vibrates up and down
    under the influence of magnetic force, causing the piezoelectric layer to bend.
    By measuring the voltage signal of the piezoelectric layer, magnetic field information
    can be obtained. Niekiel et al. [61] propose a highly sensitive MCMS that integrates
    the permanent magnet completely (Fig. 4b-ii, which successfully miniaturized sensors
    based on permanent magnets and improves its performance. The sensor has a sensitivity
    of up to 35 kV/T and a detection limit of as low as 7.2 pT/Hz0.5 at a resonant
    frequency of 2.2 kHz. Wang et al. [62] report a high-precision DC/AC sensor that
    balances the stress between piezoelectric plates and eliminates positional errors.
    The sensor is equipped with slots between adjacent piezoelectric plates to reduce
    the uneven stress distribution on the surface and increase the measurement error
    by 7.5%. Moreover, an array of four piezoelectric cantilevers of different lengths
    can reduce the error caused by position. As shown in Fig. 4b-iii, Wu et al. [63]
    propose a wide linear range current sensor consisting of NdFeB/PZT/NdFeB, which
    produces attractive or repellent forces on NdFeB in the thickness direction and
    acts on PZT, achieving a sensitivity of 1.52 mVpp/Arms in a large range of 0–500
    Arms. Nonetheless, several issues including material fatigue-induced limited lifespan
    and sensitivity to both sensor position and wire distance, should be improved
    for piezoelectric-based MCMSs. 2.1.2.3. MCMSs based on magnetoresistance effect
    The magnetoresistance effect refers to the phenomenon that the resistance value
    of some semiconductor or metal materials changes under the effect of a magnetic
    field. There are three main types of magnetoresistance effect, which include anisotropic
    magnetoresistance (AMR) effect, giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect, and tunnel
    magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. The AMR effect was first discovered by William
    Thomson in ferromagnetic materials in 1857 [64], while the GMR effect was discovered
    by Greenberger and Fehr in 1988, for which they shared the 2007 Nobel Prize in
    physics [65], [66]. Although the TMR effect was discovered before the GMR effect,
    it was not until 1995 that Miyazaki et al. [67] successfully replicated the tunnel
    magnetoresistance effect at room temperature, leading to a surge in research.
    Initially used in data reading heads for magnetic tapes and hard drives, the magnetoresistance
    effect has become widely used in distributed real-time current monitoring due
    to its many advantages, including a wide measuring range (mA-kA), wide frequency
    range (DC-MHz), high sensitivity, easy integration, and low cost. The main body
    of the AMR-based current sensor is a single-layer Permalloy thin film sandwiched
    between two electrodes, its working principle is shown in Fig. 4c-i. When an external
    magnetic field is applied, the direction of magnetic domains within the thin film
    changes, while the current direction remains unchanged, resulting in a change
    in the angle α between the synthesized magnetization direction and the current
    direction, causing a change in resistance. The GMR current sensor consists of
    multiple thin films, with a non-magnetic metal layer in the middle and the current
    direction parallel to the film direction as shown in Fig. 4c-ii. The external
    magnetic field changes the magnetization direction of the free layer, causing
    a change in the relative magnetic moment direction of adjacent ferromagnetic layers,
    resulting in different scattering during the electron transport process, and presenting
    different resistance values. As shown in Fig. 4c-iii, TMR current sensor also
    consists of multilayer films, but the middle layer is a tunnel barrier, and the
    current direction is perpendicular to the film direction. The external magnetic
    field changes the relative magnetization direction between the free layer and
    the pinned layer, causing the tunnel barrier layer to conduct through the quantum
    tunneling effect, resulting in a change in the resistance of the tunnel junction.
    According to the measurement structure, MCMSs based on magnetoresistance effect
    can be divided into open-loop sensors and closed-loop sensors, as shown in Fig.
    4c-iv, v. The MCMSs with open-loop structure can collect most of the magnetic
    field around the wire by the magnetic concentrator, reducing spatial magnetic
    interference and increasing sensitivity, but the measurement range is small and
    the magnetic ring exists magnetic saturation phenomenon. The MCMSs with closed-loop
    structure add a negative feedback loop to balance the feedback magnetic field
    and the measured magnetic field to dynamic equilibrium, increasing the measurement
    range, response speed, and detection accuracy. Table 2 presents the technical
    parameters of MCMSs based on AMR, GMR, and TMR effects. AMR sensors have a simple
    structure and high technical maturity, while GMR and TMR sensors have higher temperature
    stability, sensitivity, and linear range, making them ideal for constructing magnetic
    sensors and having broad prospects in many fields [68], [69], [70]. Bernieri et
    al. [71] propose a strategy of arranging two AMR sensors in each phase to solve
    uncertainties caused by other wires in three-phase systems, achieving symmetric
    balance and unbalance with an average error of about 0.65% and 2.30%, respectively.
    Hu et al. [72] propose a high-performance GMR current sensor for smart grids,
    which demonstrates good performance in measuring transient, DC, leakage, and corona
    currents. The sensor has good temperature stability and electromagnetic compatibility
    and achieves accurate measurement of current with a bandwidth of 10 MHz and amplitude
    of 1 mA to 1.6 kA. Hu et al. [73] propose a current sensor based on the TMR effect
    for measuring weak currents in smart grids, combined with low noise design to
    achieve a minimum detectable current of 280 μA and a sensitivity of 10.52 V/A,
    indicating that 1/f noise is the main factor limiting the minimum detectable current
    of the sensor. Table 2. Typical technical parameters of different magnetoresistance

    performance, advantages, and disadvantages of various current sensors. Table 3.

    / [73] 2.1.2.4. MCMSs based on optical principle The principle of optical MCMSs
    is mainly based on Faraday magneto optical effect and magnetostrictive effect,
    corresponding to all-fiber current sensors and magnetostrictive current sensors.
    The transmission and sensing parts of the all-fiber current sensor are both optical
    fibers, and the principle as shown in Fig. 4d-i. The sensing fiber is wind around
    the wire to form a closed optical path through polarizer, analyzer, coupling lenses,
    etc. The change in the current of the current carrying wire causes the change
    of the surrounding magnetic field, causing the polarization direction of the linearly
    polarized light propagating in the optical fiber to deflect due to the magneto
    optical effect. By measuring the Faraday rotation angle θ in the optical fiber,
    current measurement can be indirectly achieved. (2.4) Among them, V is the Verdet
    constant of the material, N is the number of turns of the optical fiber, and I
    is the current of the conductor. The all-fiber current sensor has the advantages
    of simple structure, wide measurement range, and high sensitivity. Sima et al.
    [74] propose an all-fiber current sensor with a dual wound structure coupled with
    a Faraday rotator, which can be applied to real-time sensing of transient currents
    at various voltage levels. At 10 Hz∼10 kHz, the amplitude error is less than 2.3%,
    the phase difference not exceeding 2°, and the output voltage error is less than
    4.3% in the range of -20 °C∼60 °C, which has good frequency response characteristics
    and excellent temperature adaptability. However, all-fiber optic current sensors
    are prone to linear birefringence problems caused by pressure, temperature, vibration
    or other factors, which affect measurement accuracy and long-term stability. Magnetostrictive
    current sensors mainly use giant magnetostrictive materials (GMM) winded, coated,
    or pasted onto fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) as sensing probes. Under the action
    of the magnetic field, the deformation of GMM causes the strain on FBG, resulting
    in a change in the central wavelength. The measured current information can be
    obtained by demodulating the central wavelength through the FBG demodulation system.
    The magnetostrictive current sensor has the advantages of wide measurement range
    and high sensitivity. As shown in Fig. 4d-ii, Zhang et al. [75] propose a GMM-FBG
    current sensor based on a double ring lever structure. The lever mechanism amplifies
    the micro displacement of GMM, and differential processing is used to eliminate
    the influence of temperature, achieving a sensitivity of 10.223 pm/A and a temperature
    compensation error of approximately 0.1 pm/℃. However, fiber Bragg gratings are
    cross sensitive of temperature and strain, and magnetostrictive materials are
    susceptible to temperature, and the price is high. 2.2. Micro environmental sensors
    As global climate change accelerates, extreme weather events occur more frequently,
    resulting in damage to electric power equipment and disruptions to power supply.
    Renewable energy-based distributed generation stations, such as solar and wind
    power, are particularly vulnerable to environmental factors, leading to high levels
    of unpredictability. To ensure the safety, reliability, and sustainability of
    power grids, designing micro-weather monitoring systems tailored to different
    geographical environments and climate characteristics is crucial for predicting
    future grid operations, issuing timely warnings of potential weather disasters,
    and mitigating risks. This section focuses on introducing micro environmental
    sensors that provide real-time monitoring of crucial environmental parameters,
    including temperature, humidity, wind speed, vibration, and icing. 2.2.1. Temperature
    and humidity sensors Temperature and humidity measurements are the most important
    environmental monitoring indicators in the power grid system. High ambient temperatures
    in the power grids can potentially cause power equipment failures and damage,
    as well as reduce the efficiency of power transmission lines. High humidity can
    also cause corrosion of metal components and reduce the insulation strength, thus
    shortening their service life. Currently, infrared temperature measurement is
    the main method used for temperature sensing in power grids due to its intuitive,
    fast, and non-contact nature. However, it has some drawbacks such as high power
    consumption and susceptibility to environmental factors, making it unsuitable
    for large-scale deployment. Micro temperature sensors can be categorized into
    thermocouple and thermal resistance types based on their principles. In a thermocouple
    temperature sensor, thermoelectric materials A and B are connected at the two
    ends to form a loop, as depicted in Fig. 5a-i. Electrons flow from the hot end
    to the cold end, resulting in a current, and the temperature can be determined
    by measuring the potential difference between the two ends. Thermocouple temperature
    sensors normally have a simple structure, a wide temperature measurement range,
    fast response time, and do not require an external power source. Sheng et al.
    [80] use inkjet printing of liquid metal-organic decomposition material to successfully
    fabricate a flexible Cu-CuNi thermocouple temperature sensor with a low thickness
    (about 2 µm), resulting in a high sensitivity of 20.6 μV/°C and response time
    of less than 2 s at temperatures ranging from 25 to 100 ℃, as illustrated in Fig.
    5a-ii. However, the thermocouple temperature sensor is susceptible to corrosion
    and requires temperature compensation. Thermal resistance sensors work based on
    the principle that the resistance of temperature-sensitive material changes with
    temperature. Resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) and thermistors are the two
    main types of thermal resistance sensors, which are made of metal materials such
    as Pt, Cu, and Ni, and semiconductor materials, respectively. RTDs are known for
    their high measurement accuracy, stability, and linearity. For example, He et
    al. [81] employ MEMS technology to design a serpent-shaped Pt-based RTD on a PI
    substrate that exhibits a remarkable resistance temperature coefficient of 0.00235/℃
    at temperatures ranging from 25 to 90 ℃. Thermistors have faster response times
    and higher sensitivity, which makes them well-suited for detecting small temperature
    changes. Turkani et al. [82] demonstrate this by using screen printing and gravure
    printing to create a carbon nanotube (CNT) thermistor on a polyethylene terephthalate
    (PET) substrate. The thermistor exhibits a resistance temperature coefficient
    of − 0.004/℃, and a response/recovery time of 300 ms and 4 s, respectively, at
    temperatures ranging from − 40–100 ℃. Nevertheless, RTDs are often associated
    with slow response times and high costs, while thermistors typically have non-linear
    response curves. Download : Download high-res image (516KB) Download : Download

    sensors. (c) Wind sensors. (d) Galloping monitoring sensors [88] (Copyright 2023
    Elsevier). (e) Icing monitoring sensors [89] (Copyright 2022 IEEE). Micro humidity
    sensors are generally classified into two categories: capacitive and resistive
    humidity sensors. As illustrated in Fig. 5b, humidity-sensitive materials absorb
    water molecules in the air, and changes in resistance or capacitance value are
    measured to obtain humidity information [83]. Resistive humidity sensors are known
    for their high sensitivity, low cost, and ease of fabrication. For instance, Pereira
    et al. [84] employ aerosol printing technology to develop a micro resistive humidity
    sensor based on MoS2 ink, which exhibits high sensitivity and rapid response.
    The sensor demonstrates a six-orders-of-magnitude increase in conductivity within
    a humidity range of 10%RH to 95%RH at room temperature, and its response and recovery
    time are 8 s and 22 s, respectively. On the other hand, capacitive humidity sensors
    offer better linearity, accuracy, and higher thermal stability than resistive
    sensors. McGhee et al. [85] present a screen-printed all-metal oxide micro capacitive
    humidity sensor that can be tailored to specific size requirements. The sensor
    incorporates a porous ITO layer capable of absorbing more water molecules, resulting
    in a high sensitivity of 3.8 pF/RH% across a humidity range of 5–95% RH, and response
    and recovery times of 47.2 s and 49.5 s, respectively. 2.2.2. Other sensors In
    addition to monitoring temperature and humidity, stable operation of the power
    grids requires more environmental sensing sensors [86]. For example, strong winds
    can easily cause damage to power equipment and lead to fatigue and broken power
    lines. Snow disasters can cause power lines to freeze, resulting in a sharp drop
    in electrical performance and power communication interruptions. Research on other
    environmental quantity sensors has also made significant progress. For instance,
    as shown in Fig. 5c, Wang et al. [87] propose a vertically stacked MEMS wind speed
    and direction sensor. The maximum wind speed detection error of the sensor is
    1.3 m/s, and the maximum wind direction error is 4° in the range of 0–33 m/s.
    Gao et al. [88] propose a conductor galloping monitoring sensor based on a swinging
    piezoelectric cantilever beam structure (Fig. 5d). By analyzing the signal generated
    when the swinging ball hits the side wall due to conductor motion, the conductor
    motion can be obtained. Xie et al. [89] propose a micro interdigital-complementary
    split-ring resonator sensor that can detect the thickness of icing by measuring
    its resonant frequency (Fig. 5e). The detection range of the sensor is 0.2–8.0 mm,
    and the sensitivity is 0.341 GHz/mm. The insulation characteristics detection
    of power equipment and transmission lines is equally crucial for ensuring the
    safety of maintenance personnel and the stability of the power system. Partial
    discharge is a typical degradation phenomenon in power equipment [90]. One method
    proposed by Liu et al. [91] is a dual loop Sagnac interferometric fiber optic
    sensing system for ultrasonic detection of partial discharge in DC cables, achieving
    accurate detection and localization within a ± 80 m range for a 6 km long cable
    in a ± 320 kV flexible DC transmission system. Another method proposed by Xia
    et al. [92] is a hypersensitive multispectral partial discharge optical sensor
    array based on solid-state silicon-photomultiplier. The array utilizes classification
    algorithms and multispectral characteristics to pattern recognition and evaluation
    of three typical partial discharge patterns: Creeping discharge, Suspension discharge,
    and tip discharge, the hit rate exceeded 91%. In order to effectively suppress
    partial discharge phenomena, SF6 gas is widely used as an insulation medium for
    high-voltage electrical equipment due to its good insulation characteristics and
    stability. Under high voltage, SF6 can decompose and generate gases such as SO2,
    SO2F2, H2S, SOF2, etc. Therefore, some studies focus on monitoring the insulation
    status of equipment by detecting these decomposed gases. Wang et al. [93] propose
    a TiO2/Ni/C based gas sensor for effective monitoring of decomposed gases such
    as SO2F2, with a wide detection range of 5–200 ppm, fast response/recovery time
    of 26 s/9 s, and significantly higher response compared to other gas sensors.
    Wang et al. [94] propose an MXene/TiO2/SnSe sensor for monitoring decomposed gas
    SO2, which has excellent response (Vg-Va)/Va of 170% @ 30 ppm). And the data of
    the gas sensor system is integrated and processed using a back propagation neural
    network model, achieving temperature and humidity error correction. {{{Table 4}}}.

    During the construction of a new power system, the number of distributed sensors
    in the power grids has significantly increased. Some sensors are exposed to the
    wilderness for extended periods and cannot be powered directly by high-voltage
    transmission lines. Currently, the main power supply methods for grid sensors
    can be categorized into the transmission power supply, battery power supply, and
    self-powered supply. The transmission power supply transmits energy from the ground
    to sensors through optical fiber or microwave. However, this method is expensive
    and unsuitable for large-scale distributed applications [98]. Although battery
    power supply technology is highly mature, its lifespan is limited, necessitating
    regular replacements and resulting in significant manpower and material resource
    consumption. Self-powered technology is achieved by directly converting grid environmental
    energy and has the advantages of high reliability, strong environmental adaptability,
    wide application scenarios, and low maintenance costs. This makes it more suitable
    for providing long-term and stable energy supply for grid sensors and is one of
    the most promising power supply technologies. This section provides an introduction
    to energy harvesting technologies for power grids, including harvesting internal
    energy of electric and magnetic fields energy, and external environmental energy
    of solar, mechanical, and thermal energy. 3.1. Internal energy harvesting 3.1.1.
    Magnetic field energy In the vicinity of transmission lines, there are many AC
    magnetic fields of power frequency (50 Hz). Currently, the current transformer
    is the primary method for harvesting magnetic field energy, which is also the
    most widely used in power grid energy harvesting technologies. When the current
    in the transmission line changes, the magnetic field around it also changes, and
    the induced voltage is generated through the secondary coil of the current transformer
    to provide electric energy for online monitoring sensors. A magnetic field energy
    harvesting device usually includes an energy harvesting module, a processing circuit
    module, and an energy storage module. Depending on the installation position,
    magnetic field energy harvesting devices (MFEHDs) can be divided into two types:
    low potential MFEHDs installed on the tower and high potential MFEHDs installed
    on the transmission line, as shown in Fig. 6a-i and 6a-ii. The low potential MFEHDs
    are easy to install, but they are far away from high-voltage transmission lines
    and thus have low output power. The high potential MFEHDs have high output power
    but have a power supply dead zone, easy saturation of magnetic core, and are unable
    to supply power for low potential loads. Therefore, current research focuses on
    improving the adaptability and output power of magnetic field energy harvesting
    devices by optimizing the magnetic core structure, the magnetic core material,
    the design of the secondary coil, and other methods. Download : Download high-res

    Technology [103] (Copyright 2016 IEEE). (g) Add an artificial corona electrode
    [104] (Copyright 2023 IEEE). For instance, as shown in Fig. 6b, Yuan et al. [99]
    extend the magnetic flux path using a helical core to increase the magnetic flux
    density within the core and improve the output power of low potential MFEHDs.
    They achieve a high output power of 612 μW and a power density of 2.1 μW/cm3 with
    a 400-turn coil at 7 μT. As shown in Fig. 6c, Najafi et al. [100] propose MFEHDs
    that utilize nanocrystals as magnetic cores and achieve an output power of 55 W
    and a power density of up to 100.2 mW/cm3 at 60 Hz and 615 A. As shown in Fig.
    6d, Zhuang et al. [101] report a high power high potential MFEHDs by adding control
    coils and introducing an artificial magnetic field in the opposite direction of
    the magnetic field of the power line to prevent magnetic core saturation. They
    achieve an average output power of 283 mW (23.4 mW/cm3) at 50 Hz and 10 Arms,
    which is 45% higher than the device without a control coil. 3.1.2. Electric field
    energy To achieve high-capacity and long-distance electricity transportation,
    transmission lines operate at high voltage levels, creating a strong electric
    field energy surrounding them. Electric field energy harvesting devices mainly
    utilize the principle of capacitor voltage division to obtain energy from the
    surrounding electric field, which is then rectified, filtered, and regulated to
    provide power for online monitoring devices. Plate or tubular metal energy harvesting
    electrodes are set up below the transmission line to form coupling capacitors
    C1 and C2 between the transmission line and the metal electrode, and between the
    metal electrode and the ground, respectively. The generated displacement current
    I charge the capacitor and supply power for online monitoring sensors. According
    to the load position, electric field energy harvesting devices (EFEHDs) can also
    be divided into low potential and high potential, as shown in Fig. 6a-iii and
    6a-iv. Suppose the rated working voltage of the transmission line is U, the frequency
    is ω, the equivalent impedances of the parasitic capacitances C1 and C2 are Z1
    and Z2 respectively, and the equivalent impedances R of the condition monitoring
    device are much less than Z1 and Z2. The displacement current I can be obtained
    according to equation 3–1. (3.1) For low and high potential electric fields energy
    harvesting, C1 and C2 are related to electrode size, structure, and distance to
    the ground. Therefore, current research aims to improve the output power of electric
    field harvesting devices by optimizing the structure of harvesting electrodes,
    optimizing the circuit design, and so on. Low potential EFEHDs have flexible installation
    and do not require complex insulation structures, but have low output power, requiring
    larger energy plates. As shown in Fig. 6e, Wang et al. [102] utilize the edge
    effect of parallel plate capacitors to improve the coupling capacitance value
    per unit area by using a grid energy harvesting plate, achieving an output power
    of 25 mW, which is 2.5 times higher than before optimization. High potential EFEHDs
    have high output power but are difficult to install and increase stress on power
    lines due to their large weight and size. As shown in Fig. 6f, Zhang et al. [103]
    propose a transformer up-frequency oscillator circuit with a smaller size for
    high potential EFEHDs. Compared with direct electric field energy harvesting,
    the up-frequency oscillator circuit achieves optimal impedance matching, and the
    maximum charging power reaches 663 μW on a 10 kV power line, while the energy
    harvesting efficiency increases from 3% to 90.5%. As shown in Fig. 6g, Shi et
    al. [104] propose an energy harvesting device that utilizes a metal plate to collect
    corona current to meet the energy supply requirements of HVDC transmission systems.
    By adding an artificial corona electrode, they achieve a high output power of
    10.15 mW at 22 kV. 3.2. External environmental energy harvesting 3.2.1. Solar
    energy Solar power generation technology can be divided into two types: solar
    thermal power generation technology and photovoltaic power generation technology.
    Solar thermal power generation technology converts light energy into heat energy,
    which is then used to generate electricity through heat collection devices that
    drive steam turbines, which are mainly used in large-scale solar power stations.
    Photovoltaic power generation technology, on the other hand, directly converts
    light energy into electricity using the photovoltaic effect of semiconductors.
    It is suitable for powering small devices. The technology of combining photovoltaic
    power generation and battery power supply is relatively mature and has been widely
    used in practical projects, the principle is shown in Fig. 7a. Currently, research
    on photovoltaic power generation focuses primarily on improving photoelectric
    conversion efficiency and reducing the production cost of photovoltaic panels.
    Prakoso et al. [105] propose a PV-Power solar cell that can absorb light energy
    not only from the top surface but also from the huge side walls, achieving a small
    footprint and high output power. The 10 PV-Tower cells in series cover an area
    of 0.85 cm2 and have an output power of 66.7 mW (78.5 mW/cm2), which is about
    80 times higher than that of traditional solar cells. Bastiani et al. [106] propose
    a bifacial monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell that can absorb not
    only sunlight on the front side but also light reflected from the environment
    on the back side. It has a photoelectric conversion efficiency of over 25% and
    a high power density of 26 mW/cm2. Download : Download high-res image (859KB)

    and environmental benefits, is mature, and is mainly suitable for outdoor areas
    with sufficient light. However, the volume and weight of solar panels are generally
    large, and the photoelectric conversion efficiency is low. They cannot work in
    harsh environments such as cloudy, rainy, and night conditions, and require regular
    maintenance. 3.2.2. Temperature difference energy Due to the Joule thermal effect
    of conductors, high-temperature heat sources are usually present around power
    grid equipment during operation. Thermoelectric power generator (TPG) converts
    thermal energy into electrical energy based on the Seebeck effect of thermoelectric
    materials [107]. As shown in Fig. 7b, the P-type semiconductor has a high hole
    concentration at the hot end, and the holes diffuse from the hot end to the cold
    end; the N-type semiconductor has a high electron concentration at the hot end,
    and the electrons diffuse from the hot end to the cold end, forming a potential
    difference between the two ends, which converts the temperature difference energy
    into electrical energy. (3.2) Where N is the number of thermocouples; αpn is the
    Seebeck coefficient; ∆T is the temperature difference at both ends. TPG has the
    advantages of easy installation, no pollution, long term maintenance-free, and
    high reliability. Current research mainly focuses on improving output performance
    by developing high-performance thermoelectric materials, optimizing structural
    design, and optimizing preparation processes. Choo et al. [108] propose a honeycomb
    Cu2Se TPG by 3D printing technology. By utilizing the optimal aspect ratio and
    strong mechanical stiffness of the honeycomb structure, the TPG achieves a high
    output power of 621.40 mW/cm2 at temperatures ranging from 323 K to 873 K. Ohkubo
    et al. [109] propose a TPG based on novel Mg2Sn0.8Ge0.2-Bi thermoelectric material
    that is compatible with MEMS technology. The TPG achieves an output power of 0.6
    μW and a power density of 21 mW/cm2 at a temperature difference of 110 K. The
    energy conversion efficiency of TPG is usually low (about 5∼7%). However, in power
    equipment with severe heat generation, such as isolation switches, TPG can be
    used to directly harvest energy, providing the possibility for self-powered temperature
    monitoring and directly powering some low-power devices. 3.2.3. Mechanical energy
    Mechanical energy exists in various forms in the power grid system, such as wind
    energy in the environment, vibration energy caused by wind on transmission lines,
    vibration energy generated by power equipment during operation, etc. Currently,
    there are two main ways to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy: piezoelectric
    nanogenerators (PENG) and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). They were proposed
    by Prof. Zhong Lin Wang in 2006 and 2012, respectively [110], [111]. 3.2.3.1.
    Piezoelectric nanogenerator Piezoelectric nanogenerators mainly capture vibrational
    energy through the positive piezoelectric effect of piezoelectric materials, as
    shown in Fig. 7c. In this process, one end of the piezoelectric material is fixed,
    while the other end is subjected to up-and-down vibrations from external vibration,
    causing the piezoelectric layer to deform and induce an AC voltage, thereby converting
    mechanical vibrational energy into electrical energy. Commonly used piezoelectric
    materials can be divided into piezoelectric crystals, piezoelectric ceramics,
    piezoelectric polymers, and composite piezoelectric materials [112]. Examples
    include lithium niobate (LiNbO3) single crystals, lead magnesium niobate (PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3),
    barium titanate (BaTiO3), lead zirconate titanate (PZT), polyvinylidene fluoride
    (PVDF), PDMS, epoxy resins, etc. Currently, research on PENG mainly focuses on
    improving output performance through piezoelectric materials, optimized structural
    design, and other related aspects. For instance, Lee et al. [113] propose a magneto-mechano-electric
    PENG based on a cantilever beam structure. By adjusting the bending stiffness
    of the magneto-mechano-electric PENG, the volume of the permanent magnet, and
    the magneto-electric coupling coefficient, a large vibration amplitude is obtained,
    achieving an output power of 0.4 mWavg (0.15 mWavg/cm3) under a 100 μT geomagnetic
    field, which is 400% higher than previous works. Tang et al. [114] propose a multidirectional
    wind energy harvesting PENG that can be installed on power grid towers. The device
    uses a wind vane to keep the PVDF piezoelectric film deformed at the maximum windward
    area, and the S-shaped rotor rotates to drive the impact bar to amplify the deformation
    and generate more electrical energy. The device achieves an output power of 46.2 mW
    at a wind speed of 6.5 m/s. However, the structural design of the sensor should
    also consider the stability of the equipment under high temperature, rain, and
    snow weather, and the reliability of the test results. 3.2.3.2. Triboelectric
    nanogenerator TENG converts mechanical energy into electrical energy based on
    the principles of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction [115], [116].
    It includes four operating modes as shown in Fig. 7d: vertical contact-separation
    mode, lateral-sliding mode, single-electron mode, and freestanding triboelectric-layer
    mode [117], [118], [119], [120], [121], [122], [123]. TENG has the advantages
    of lightweight, low-cost, diverse in material selection, and high power density,
    making it more suitable for distributed power generation [124], [125]. Taking
    the contact-separation mode as an example [126], the working principle of TENG
    is that the triboelectric positive electrode and the triboelectric negative electrode
    are first fully in contact, with positive and negative charges on their surfaces,
    respectively. Under external force, the triboelectric positive electrode begins
    to separate, which generates a potential difference and displacement current until
    complete separation. Afterward, the triboelectric positive electrode begins to
    contact, generating a reverse potential difference and displacement current until
    the original state is restored, and the above cycle is repeated. So far, TENG
    has made significant progress in theoretical research [127], [128], developing
    high-performance triboelectric materials [129], [130], harvesting various forms
    of mechanical energy [131], [132], and optimizing power management circuits [133],
    [134], and has provided critical support for the development of self-powered of
    power grid systems. For instance, as shown in Fig. 7e, Ko et al. [135] propose
    a self-suspended structure TENG that can harvest wind energy from all directions
    around transmission lines, ranging from ultra-low wind speeds of 0.3 m/s to high
    wind speeds of 10 m/s. It achieves a power density of 8.43 mW/m2 at 10 m/s wind
    speed. As shown in Fig. 7f, Hu et al. [136] propose a vibration-driven TENG (V-TENG)
    that can harvest the vibration energy of transmission lines and has the potential
    for vibration attenuation. At an amplitude of 2.5 mm, the V-TENG achieves a maximum
    output power of 4.31 mW, with a power density of 43.28.43 μW/m2. As shown in Fig.
    7g, Zeng et al. [137] propose a fully packaged TENG based on flow-induced vibration
    (FIV-TENG) for wind energy harvesting, achieving an output power of 0.9 mW at
    a wind speed of 2.9 m/s. Even on rainy days, the FIV-TENG can convert low-speed
    wind energy into stable electrical output, demonstrating its high practicality.
    Moreover, TENG not only easily couples with other mechanical energy harvesters
    but also has the capability to be coupled with energy harvesters of different
    forms to further enhance overall output performance. For instance, in Fig. 7h,
    Zhao et al. [138] propose a hybrid nanogenerator (HNG) by combining TENG with
    PENG to harvest wind energy, resulting in an output voltage of 150 V and a current
    of 150 μA at a wind speed of 14 m/s. The HNG exhibits an average power of 10.88 mW
    and a power density of 6.04 mW/cm2 at a rotational speed of 100 rpm. In Fig. 7i,
    Du et al. [139] develop an HNG that utilizes triboelectric-piezoelectric-electromagnetic
    effects, converting vibration energy into electricity and achieving a high output
    power of 100 W/m3. In Fig. 7j, Xu et al. [140] propose a hybrid nanogenerator
    that combines spherical TENGs with solar cells for wind, raindrop, and solar energy
    harvesters, achieving a high output power of 5.63 mW. The energy harvesting device
    based on mechanical energy has multiple energy sources and can be designed with
    different mechanical structures to meet various needs, making them widely applicable.
    However, the material is prone to fatigue, resulting in limited service life and
    poor mechanical stability, the collection device is easily affected by the environment,
    resulting in unstable output power, and there are mechanical losses make the collection
    efficiency low. To achieve the long-term maintenance-free operation of energy
    harvesting devices, it is necessary to further optimize the design structure to
    improve the system integration, develop energy exchange materials with high energy
    density and long service life to improve power generation efficiency, optimize
    the power management unit to reduce circuit self-loss to achieve stable and efficient
    power output. {{{Table 5}}}. Table 5. Performance comparison of different energy

    sensing systems for power grids Self-powered, multi-parameter micro grid-information
    sensing systems can comprehensively monitor power grid status and operating environment
    while enabling long-term, maintenance-free operation. Typically, power grid sensing
    systems comprise sensor modules, energy supply modules, signal acquisition and
    processing modules, and wireless communication modules [148]. To achieve self-powered
    operation of the power grid sensing system, the conventional technological approach
    is to couple energy harvesting modules and energy storage modules, and the sensing
    units and energy supply units operate independently. Recently, dual-functional
    devices that can serve as both sensors and energy harvesters have received widespread
    attention. This type of device improves sensing system integration and provides
    a new solution for the implementation of self-powered sensors [149]. 4.1. Self-powered
    electrical sensing systems With the intelligent development of power grid systems,
    the power flow becomes more complex, requiring more widely deployable self-powered
    electrical sensing systems to monitor the real-time current and voltage of power
    equipment and transmission lines. As shown in Fig. 8a, Li et al. [150] develop
    a self-powered hoop-type current sensing system using TMR current sensing array
    and current transformer (CT) energy harvester, which can be used for current monitoring
    of equipment such as switchgear and transformers. Their system achieves a wide
    measurement range of 0–1500 A with less than 0.6% error between 150A-1500 A. The
    system is compact, measuring 4.5 cm × 2.5 cm× 1.5 cm, and is cost-effective, priced
    at $30. In addition to current sensors based on the magnetoresistive effect, wireless
    radio frequency (RF) sensing tags are also used for battery-free current monitoring.
    As shown in Fig. 8b, Shao et al. [151] propose a wireless current system based
    on RF sensing tags for cable current detection. The sensing tag employs a multi-layer
    structure of magnetic film/planar coil, achieving a measurement range of 5–17.5 A
    at 50 Hz, with a measurement error of less than 1.83%, sensitivity of 16 μV/A,
    and maximum wireless distance of 5.2 m. For voltage monitoring of transmission
    lines, electric field energy harvesting devices can also be implemented to provide
    a stable power supply for sensors. In Fig. 8c, Liao et al. [152] propose a self-powered
    high-voltage monitoring system based on LED-in-capacitors (LIC) for voltage amplitude
    monitoring and harmonic pollution identification. The system converts the high
    voltage of transmission lines into electroluminescent pulses, and when harmonic
    pollution exists in the transmission line, the number and relative strength of
    the output pulses by LIC change accordingly. By establishing a one-dimensional
    convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for harmonic pollution identification, the

    Self-powered environmental sensing systems In addition to electrical monitoring,
    the surrounding environment can also affect the normal operation of the grid system,
    so self-powered environmental sensing systems for temperature, humidity, vibration,
    galloping, and wind are equally important. As shown in Fig. 9a, Chen et al. [153]
    propose a self-powered temperature sensing system based on a CT energy harvester
    for temperature monitoring of transmission lines. The system utilizes the temperature
    characteristics of bipolar transistors to achieve a temperature detection range
    of 0–80 °C with a resolution of 0.8 °C. The maximum output power of the CT energy
    harvester is 270 μW with a power density of 49.09 μW/cm3, and the average power
    consumption of the temperature system is only 3.26 μW. Download : Download high-res

    data acquired by the wireless receiving terminal. For environmental variables
    such as vibration, motion, and wind that can serve as both monitoring targets
    and energy sources, dual-function devices, particularly TENG can serve as both
    energy harvesting devices and sensors, and are more suitable for monitoring purposes
    [154], [155], [156], [157]. For instance, in Fig. 9b, Wu et al. [158] present
    a self-powered vibration sensing system based on a spring mass-based TENG (S-TENG)
    for vibration monitoring and abnormal alarm of power transmission lines. The S-TENG
    can output power reaches 2.5 mW and detect vibration amplitudes ranging from 0.4 mm
    to 6 mm with a maximum error rate of 3.7%. The sensing system can transmit electrical
    signals generated by vibrations to the platform for drawing vibration mapping,
    and alarm when the threshold value is exceeded. In addition to monitoring the
    vibration of transmission lines, vibration monitoring of electrical equipment
    is also important in power grid systems [159]. As shown in Fig. 9c, Wu et al.
    [160] propose a TENG driven infrared wireless communication online vibration monitoring
    sensing system, which can monitor abnormal vibration signals of key electrical
    equipment such as generators and transformers. By combining TENG with mechanical
    switches, vibration energy can be converted into electrical energy, generating
    an instantaneous output power of 616 W to power the infrared LED, enabling reliable
    long-distance wireless communication. For monitoring the galloping state of transmission
    lines, as shown in Fig. 9d, Gao et al. [161] propose a hybrid generator based
    on triboelectric-electromagnetic module. This generator can collect energy from
    different galloping directions of the conductor, with a maximum output power of
    16.4 mW. The output current is linearly correlated with the galloping amplitude
    of the horizontal, vertical, and elliptical directions, which can reflect the
    galloping trajectory to a certain extent. The power grid system is not only affected
    by wind speed, but also by wind direction. As shown in Fig. 9e, Lu et al. [162]
    report an intelligent self-powered wind sensing system utilizing a rotating TENG
    as both a wind energy harvester and a sensor. This system achieves an average
    output power of 44.4 μW at 300 rpm and wind speed detection within the range of
    6–12 m/s. Tang et al. [163] propose a TENG-based self-powered wind sensor (WM-TENG)
    for wind direction and speed monitoring of power transmission lines. The top turbine
    blade is used to collect wind energy and measure wind speed, while the bottom
    wind vane is used to monitor wind direction, achieving wind speed detection of
    1.7–6.7 m/s. For monitoring rainfall intensity, in Fig. 9f, Xu et al. [164] propose
    a self-powered hyetometer based on TENG to collect raindrop energy, with a sensitivity
    of 0.239 V/(mm/min). When the rainfall intensity reaches 71 mm/min, the maximum
    output power is 325 μW. By real-time monitoring of the electrical and environmental
    parameters of the power grid system, real-time understanding of the grid''s operational
    status can be achieved. This enables the timely detection of potential issues
    and abnormal situations, allowing for proactive measures to be taken for adjustment
    and repairs. This ensures the safe and stable operation of the power grid and
    provides crucial data for the power metaverse and smart grid. 5. Conclusions and
    prospects The construction of the power metaverse and smart grids is a highly
    complex engineering project that requires massive sensors to access the entire
    process of power generation, transmission, transformation, distribution, and consumption,
    presenting a new form and new mode of interdisciplinary cross and multi-field
    integration. We review the research progress of micro voltage/electric field sensors,
    micro current/magnetic field sensors, environmental sensors, and energy harvesting

    providing various data expression modes required for the real-time and accurate
    twinning in virtual power grids, and dynamically and interactively presenting

    Abstract In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensor nodes were considered to be
    an integral part of IoT (Internet of Things) for sensing and monitoring the environment.
    The IoT-based applications need to be optimized regarding the changing requirements
    of users as everything is connected via the internet. In today’s era, where every
    day new technologies were rebuilt where sensor nodes plays an important role on
    it. In every field, whether it is healthcare, smart agriculture, smart home appliances,
    smart traffic, or smart city sensors were deployed for sensing their environment,
    collecting data from them, and forwarding it to the servers. These sensor nodes
    were made up of non-rechargeable power batteries, as a fact efficient energy consumption
    of these batteries becomes vital. In WSN, efficient energy consumption is still
    an issue, and its solutions were given by many researchers among them, clustering
    is considered to be more effective in this domain. For efficient energy consumption,
    multi-attributes of cluster head selection need to be considered and proper coordination
    among the conflicting nature of multi-attributes needs to be done. In this paper,
    we have proposed PROMETHEE II and modified AHP together for cluster heads selection

    a Hibernated Clustering based framework for improving energy efficiency of wireless
    sensor networks Article 18 July 2022 Multiple-Parameter Based Clustering for Efficient
    Energy in Wireless Sensor Networks Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction In recent technologies,
    sensor nodes were playing important role in sensing the environment and aggregating
    data to the base station. Sensors are having a wide area of applications where
    they can be applied to recent technologies [2, 37]. Almost everything is connected
    through the internet and we need some meta-heuristics approaches for optimal network
    performance. Thus for optimal performance, we need to focus on sensors as they
    are the basic building blocks of IoT-based applications. In sensor networks, there
    are a large number of small sensors deployed for sensing in their entire vicinity
    and sending data to the server. But as far as sensors were concerned they have
    limited battery power due to which their optimal use is recommended. Besides having
    various issues in sensor networks researchers give solutions to the issues but
    among all these clustering algorithms are considered to be good when it comes
    to energy consumptions. The entire network is divided into several clusters and
    each cluster has member nodes and one cluster head shown in Fig. 1. In each cluster,
    sensor nodes join via having a neighborhood and sense the environment. After sensing
    the environment member nodes sends data to their respective cluster heads and
    cluster heads aggregate those data. After this, data is sent to the base station
    by cluster heads [1]. In all these scenarios, the selection of cluster heads is
    important if these are selected optimally then only efficient energy consumption
    is feasible. For this many classical algorithms were given by researchers for
    clustering where cluster head selection is focused. Algorithms such as LEACH [5,
    11], LEACH-C [40], HEED [44, 47], and other algorithms also were proposed. In
    the LEACH selection of cluster heads selection was made through probabilistic
    approaches but this did not promise efficient energy consumption thus various
    upgradation of LEACH algorithms were made. All of these algorithms focused on
    one attribute for cluster head selection but advancement in technologies leads
    to optimal cluster head selection. Thus, only considering one attribute for cluster
    head selection is not realistic and also some meta-heuristics approaches need
    to apply for better performance. Thus multi-attribute decision-making is applied
    in this paper where we have chosen twenty-one attributes for cluster head selection.
    By reading many research papers on clustering it strikes to mind that not one
    or two factors lead to optimal cluster head selection instead various factors
    play important roles in the selection of optimal cluster heads. Although from
    time to time various methods for cluster head selection have been given where
    authors have taken attributes such as distance from CH and its residual energy,
    some authors suggested the use of neighbouring nodes and residual energy [3, 6,
    17, 21, 35, 43]. But deciding on these parameters will not provide optimal CHs
    selection, thus multi-attributes need to be considered [12, 30] for optimal performance.
    In IoT sensor nodes plays an important role where they sense their surrounding
    and act accordingly [15, 16]. Today, we all rely on the Internet for our day-to-day
    life activities and use recent applications such as smart TV, smart home appliances,
    smart traffic [8], healthcare [28], smart agriculture, smart irrigation system,
    and much more. Thus for enhancing the performance of the network we need a decision
    system that selects optimal cluster heads and transfers data to the base station.
    Considering multi-attributes and making coordination among them by Multi-Attribute
    Decision Making (MADM) approaches [31, 41] will enhance the network lifetime of
    the network. Various technologies need optimal node deployment where the performance
    of applications increased with efficient energy consumption. In a hostile environment,
    it is believed that energized nodes must be alive for a long period but knowing
    the fact their battery is irreplaceable or not feasible to change their battery
    in real time [33] immediately. This necessity of sensor nodes to be alive for
    a long time in the network leads to the advent of a new alternative approach for
    energy-efficient techniques for WSNs for resolving traditional issues such as
    network lifetime, connectivity, accuracy, latency, distance from the base station,
    power, efficient energy consumption, etc. [10, 36], at the same time these are
    conflicting in nature too. Thus these conflicting factors need to be considered
    in this approach and proper coordination is needed for making proficient cluster
    head selection which is the main part of any clustering approach. Various issues
    and open challenges have been faced by WSNs such as routing, data, topology, coverage,
    security, and various clustering approaches have been given by the researchers
    for resolving these issues [42].The clustering approach has been used for an efficient
    energy data process. Some cluster heads (CH’s) were chosen from the normal nodes
    such as in LEACH [7], and HEED [39], and somewhere chosen from the advanced node
    sometimes known as gateways [22, 26, 29] and selected CH’s is responsible for
    the sending the data back to the base station itself after data aggregation, filtering
    or compression. When individual sensor nodes send their data to the base station
    energy is not efficiently used. Thus by clustering approach efficient energy utilization
    is possible and thus network lifetime will be enhanced. Optimal cluster head selection
    leads to efficient energy consumption thus now researchers were focussing on this
    issue, as recently every technology needs sensors for data collection, sensing,
    and monitoring. MADM (Multiple-Attribute Decision Making) is a meta-heuristics
    approach where multi-attributes of given alternatives were considered and their
    proper ranking is done by making coordination among various conflicting alternatives.
    MADM specifies how we can process the information of the multiple attributes to
    assign the ranking among the given alternatives. Many research works were done
    in sensor networks where MADM has been used but only a few attributes have been
    considered. Many conflicting attributes play an important role in cluster head
    selection, so for selecting optimal cluster heads we need to make proper coordination
    among them. In this paper, coordination among the multiple attributes has been
    done for finding the optimal solution. Sensor nodes were deployed almost in every
    field accordingly to the applications but seeing today’s user requirement we need
    to focus on the multiple attributes which lead to efficient energy which is lacking
    in the scenario. Multi-attributes of sensor nodes affect the performance of sensor
    nodes used in applications and simulations. In this paper, we have considered
    twenty-one multiple conflicting attributes of sensor nodes for the cluster head
    selection. Results validate that making coordination among conflicting attributes
    is the best way to choose the cluster heads. In this paper, we have proposed MADM
    based method for the cluster head selection where the network becomes load-balanced
    and increase in the network lifetime. Fig. 1 Clustering in WSN Full size image
    The novel contribution of our proposed work is summarized as follows: 1. Multi-attribute-based
    energy efficient cluster head selection is proposed. 2. A total of twenty-one
    attributes have been evaluated for cluster heads selection, these attributes are
    of conflicting in nature among themselves. 3. Proper coordination among the conflicting
    attributes has been made, based on which cluster heads were chosen and Gateways
    are also used along with normal sensor nodes for cluster head selection. 4. Modified
    PROMETHEE-II and AHP has been proposed with twenty-one attributes and compared
    with modified AHP for showing the significance of proposed approach. 5. The simulation
    results validate that the proposed method is optimal among the available methods
    for efficient energy consumption which also enhances network lifetime. Here load
    balance among the sensor nodes is also maintained. The rest of the paper is organized
    as follows: In Section 2 “Related work” has been discussed. In Section 3 energy
    model considered for the simulation and parameters used for the experiment have
    been discussed in “Hypothesis and Energy Model”. The detail about the proposed
    methodology has been discussed in the proposed methodology and the Attributes
    used in Section 4. Data set generation has been discussed in Section 5. In Section
    6 Simulation results and experimentation with case studies have been discussed
    in the section “Simulation and Experimental analysis”. Concluding remarks with
    the future scope have been discussed in the section “Conclusion and Future Scope”.
    2 Related work In clustering, much work has been done for efficient energy consumption
    but still researchers finding an optimal solution for energy efficiency. Researchers
    have given many solutions focusing on one or two attributes for cluster head selection.
    The clustering can be done in many ways such as using multi-hop or single–hop,
    clustering methods. There are many related works have been done regarding clustering,
    which is discussed in this section. LEACH [11] is the classical algorithm that
    uses the probabilistic method for the selection of random numbers in clustering.
    After LEACH many upgrades has been done and various LEACH-based algorithm has
    come up in the research. In [46] author has proposed a new energy-aware CH selection
    framework for efficient energy consumption. The proposed method is a hybrid of
    an optimization problem where CH selection is done based on distance, energy,
    quality of service, and particle distance updated Sea Lion Optimization (PDU-SLnO)
    is named as the proposed algorithm. In this hybrid approach, two algorithms particle
    swarm optimization and Sea Lion Optimization has been used and results have been
    validated among various classical algorithm. In [19] author has combined a harmony
    search algorithm (HSA) and competitive swarm optimization (CSO) for energy-efficient
    clustering that gives a global search with a fast convergence rate. In this hybrid
    approach, both approaches have been taken such as CSO capability which enhances
    network lifetime and HSA is used for efficient searching. The results have been
    evaluated in terms of alive nodes, dead nodes, throughput, and energy consumption.
    In [14] author has proposed an algorithm that uses the high-level search of sparrow
    search algorithm and differential evolution algorithms for enhancing network lifetime.
    Here, the author chooses energy efficient clustering in which they choose optimal
    cluster heads for sending data to the base station. The result of this proposed
    algorithm proves that its residual energy and throughput are better than other
    compared algorithms. Author [27] has considered multiple levels of sensor nodes
    where nodes have been distributed randomly and the base station has a large number
    of sensor nodes deployed. Here the author has used a Whale optimization algorithm
    (WOA) and the performance of the algorithm is measured in terms of residual energy
    and network lifetime. Here the residual energy ratio is reduced by 50% and 39%
    for initial energy of 50 J. In [32] author has proposed a new method for cluster
    head selection which depends on the energy of the node and node distance. Here
    shortest path relay node concept has been used, if the sub-cluster is loaded heavily
    on the network then it achieves a depleted energy level due to more energy consumption
    hence selected trajectory cluster is launched. There are many research works have
    been done in clustering for energy efficient consumption and enhancing network
    lifetime. In addition to this, some more literature work has been added [13] as
    WSN is prone to link failure or success due to its environmental deployment that
    hinders data transfer and is not able to reach the base station. This link failure
    degrades the network performance and quality of sensor networks in applications.
    For solving this problem author has proposed Taylor-Spotted Hyena Optimization
    (Taylor-SHO) for effective cluster head selection. Here fitness is calculated
    based on distance, delay, and residual energy, and routing of data is done via
    modified k-Vertex Disjoint Path Routing (mod-k VDPR) by using parameters such
    as throughput and link reliability. The simulation of the proposed algorithm is
    done using 50 nodes and 10 nodes and it outperforms other compared algorithms.
    In [18] author has already evaluated the proposed energy-efficient clustering
    for enhancing energy efficiency. The author has introduced a new methodology Hibernated
    Clustering wireless sensor networks which improves the operation period of the
    individual sensor followed by enhanced network lifetime. In [24] author has proposed
    ICCM (Integrated CS-clustering mechanism) that incorporates both compressive sensing
    and clustering for designing WSN architecture that enhances network lifetime.
    In this approach, cluster heads choose the optimal CH mechanism for data transmission
    to the base station. In [23] grid-based clustering is used for forming robust
    clusters. Here fuzzy –AHP and TOPSIS are after that applied for cluster head selection
    along with it three parameters have been used such as QoS, energy, and position
    of the nodes. After cluster heads selection EPO has been used for finding the
    optimal path for data transmission to the base station. In [4] author has developed
    a novel ARSH-FTI based cluster head selection that switches between exploitation
    and exploration to achieve high performance and enhances network lifetime. Here
    three parameters have been used such as workloads of cluster heads, communication
    distance, and residual energy for selecting cluster heads and simulation has been
    done for evaluating WSN in terms of network lifetime. In [46] author has proposed
    a new energy-aware cluster head selection for enhancing network lifetime by means
    of a hybrid optimization clustering algorithm and hierarchical routing algorithm.
    Some Attributes were considered such as distance, energy, and QoS for cluster
    head selection. For optimal clustering, a hybrid-based approach Particle Distance
    Updates Sea Lion Optimization (PDU-SLnO) enhances network lifetime. In [38] has
    proposed a secured energy-aware clustering algorithm entitled energy efficient
    trusted moth flame optimization and genetic algorithm. This fitness, function
    is calculated based on five parameters residual energy of sensor nodes, node density,
    packet forwarding, delay transmission, and the average distance of clusters. Their
    simulation results show an improved energy efficient consumption as compared to
    other algorithms. In [25] this hybrid approach of Firefly with Particle Swarm
    Optimization has been proposed for selecting optimal cluster heads. The algorithm
    enhances the global search behavior of Firefly using PSO and obtains optimal cluster
    heads. Here the results were evaluated in terms of throughput, alive nodes, and
    residual energy. In [20] author has suggested the use of an optimal number of
    intermediate nodes as they consume more energy consumption. This has enhanced
    network lifetime with efficient energy consumption. Author [34] has reviewed renewable
    energy sources which will help in power batteries for sensor nodes and will in
    turn enhance the network performance. Besides this, the author has discussed challenges
    regarding renewable energy resources and discussed future directions. In [45]
    author has proposed LAPU (Load Balanced Adaptive Position Update) for balancing
    the load among the senor nodes for routing. In this algorithm, the two best next
    hops are selected based on length queue and data mobility, data is transmitted
    to both nodes but this does not guarantee optimal clustering. It is clear that
    a lot of research work has been done in the clustering field with limited attributes
    by considering two or three attributes for cluster head selection but it does
    not guarantee the selection of optimal cluster heads. Multiple attributes are
    required for cluster head selection for enhancing the network performance, therefore
    we have taken MADM approach. In this paper, and we have proposed modified PROMETHEE
    II and AHP for cluster head selection by making some changes in basic algorithms
    and integrating them. Here we have taken conflicting attributes and making co-ordination
    after the optimal number of cluster heads selection. 3 Hypothesis and energy model
    We have simulated our research work and made some assumptions which has been discussed
    in Section 3.1. The energy model is also discussed in Section 3.2. In Section
    3.3 parameters used in simulation has been discussed. 3.1 Hypothesis The following
    hypothesis has been made in our simulation: 1. The random uniform distribution
    of sensor nodes has been assumed. 2. All sensor nodes send data to the base station.
    3. We have used gateways also in the implementation. 4. Some gateways were selected
    as cluster heads and sent the data to the base station. 5. Gateways are approximately
    six times higher energy than the normal sensor nodes. 6. The base station are
    aware about the location of sensor nodes, gateways, and vice-versa. 7. The base
    station is considered to be having more capability and computation power. 8. Sensor
    nodes having the potential to transmit the data to the different energy level
    based on the distance from the sensor nodes. 9. Single hop clustering is considered.
    3.2 Energy model In WSN, most of the sensor nodes sense the data from the environment
    from their vicinity and send back data to the respective CHs and CHs send this
    data to the base station. We need an energy model for transmitting the data, so
    we have taken the classical energy model for performing the operation. In our
    experiment, we have considered both the free-space channel and multi-path model.
    These models depended on the distance between the transmitter and receiver. Here
    appropriate settings have been provided for preventing energy loss and providing
    power control to the power amplifier i.e. if the distance for the transmission
    is less than \\({d}_{0}\\) which is threshold distance then a free-space path
    will be used else a multi-path model will be used. If \\(l\\) bit packets send
    at a distance \\(d\\) then, the required energy model for the transmission is:
    $${E}_{TRi}={E}_{({TR}_{i}-ele)}+{E}_{{(TR}_{i}-mp)}$$ (1) $${E}_{TRi}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}l\\ast
    {E}_{ele}+l\\ast {\\varepsilon}_{fs}{d}^2& if\\ d<{d}_0\\\\ {}l\\ast {E}_{ele}+l\\ast
    {\\varepsilon}_{mp}{d}^4&\\ if\\ d\\ge {d}_0\\end{array}\\right.\\kern1.5em$$
    (2) The energy consumption for receiving the message at the receiver end is given
    as: $${E}_{REi}={E}_{(REi-ele)}\\left(l\\right)=l{E}_{ele}.$$ (3) Here, \\({E}_{ele}\\)
    is the electronic energy based on some factors such as filtering, signal spreading,
    modulation, and digital coding. The amplifier energy is known as \\({\\varepsilon
    }_{fs}{d}^{2}\\) or \\({\\varepsilon }_{mp}{d}^{4}\\), this is based on the receiver
    distance and bit error rate. For our experiment analysis, these energy parameters
    for transmission purpose has been set as: \\({E}_{ele}=50 nJ/Bit\\); \\({\\varepsilon
    }_{fs}=10pJ/bit/m\\), and \\({\\varepsilon }_{mp}=0.0013\\) pJ/bit/m. For data
    aggregation, the energy consumption has been taken as \\(5pJ/bit/signal\\). The
    optimal number of cluster heads (CHs) can be calculated as: $${k}_{opt}=\\frac{\\sqrt{n}
    }{\\sqrt{2\\pi }}\\sqrt{\\frac{{\\varepsilon }_{fs}}{{\\varepsilon }_{mp}}}\\frac{M}{{d}^{2}\\;
    to \\;BS}.$$ (4) Here, \\({d}^{2} \\;to\\; BS\\) is known as the distance from
    cluster heads (CHs) to the base station (BS), \\(M*M\\) is the network deployment
    area and \\(n\\) is the number of sensor nodes. In Fig. 2 energy model has been
    presented. Fig. 2 Energy Model Full size image 3.3 Parameters Parameters used
    in the simulation for energy dissipation have been given in Tables 1 and 2 shows
    the parameters used for the repeated simulations in our experiment. Table 1 Parameters
    used in Energy Dissipation [31] Full size table Table 2 Parameters Used in Our
    Simulations Full size table 4 Proposed methodology and attributes used In the
    proposed approach, we have integrated the PROMETHEE II and modified AHP for optimal
    cluster heads selection where twenty-one attributes have been taken. In this paper,
    we have first applied modified AHP where rank reversal problem is solved by taking
    twenty-one attributes so that significance of integrated approach can be understood.
    In proposed approach, we have integrate PROMETHEE II with modified AHP by taking
    the best of both approaches. In the simulation results, we have first applied
    modified AHP on twenty-one attributes in first phase and then in second phase
    modified PROMETHEE II has been applied where modified AHP is integrated. For better
    understanding we have also compared our proposed approach with modified AHP to
    its significance. The concept of solving rank reversal problem is that in normalization
    steps there may exists inconsistency which means the value of particular attributes
    may change if we add any other new attributes on it. This may affect the ranking
    of the given alternatives thus to solve this problem we have modified PROMETHEE
    II and AHP. In PROMETHEE II we have taken AHP for structuring the decision problem
    and developing the weight criteria matrix. After that optimal ranking of the alternatives
    is executed. In AHP we have modified the normalizations step by eliminating the
    rank reversal problem and all the modifications have been shown in Section 6.
    The proposed methodology can be stated below: 1. Identify the twenty-one attributes
    for cluster head selection and do the formation of hierarchical structure. 2.
    Using the modified AHP method for weight criteria matrix. 3. Using PROMETHEE II
    for overall optimal ranking of the cluster heads. In this approach, we have integrated
    the weight criteria matrix of modified AHP and the overall ranking of PROMETHEE-II.
    The overall mechanism of this approach has been discussed below. In our proposed
    approach we have considered twenty-one conflicting attributes by using modified
    PROMETHEE II and AHP. Here we have taken the basic energy model which is explained
    above. The algorithm works in two phases which describes the modifications done
    in their modified versions. In this section, we have discussed the modified part
    of the approaches and detailed about the modified approaches have been discussed
    in Section 6. 4.1 First Phase In the first phase, sensor nodes were deployed and
    their multi-attributes have been considered. In this phase, modified AHP method
    is applied where the normalizations step is modified for solving the rank reversal
    problem. The mathematical approach of modified steps is discussed below: 1. The
    first step is to normalize the data set (\\({M}_{1}\\)) by using the following
    equation we can denote the matrix by \\(({{M}_{1ij})}_{mn}\\). There are two types
    of factors, one is a beneficial factor and the other is a non-beneficial factor.
    For the beneficial factor, we have to select the max value of each factor \\({V}_{J}^{+}\\)
    compute the normalized value to the column \\(i \\;to \\;M\\) and \\(j=\\mathrm{1,2},3\\dots
    n\\). $${M}_{1ij}=\\frac{{M}_{ij}-{MIN}_{J}}{{V}_{j}^{+}}.$$ (5) And for non-beneficial
    min value for each factor has been calculated \\({V}_{j}^{-}\\), where \\(j=\\mathrm{1,2},3\\dots
    n\\) $${M}_{1ij}=\\frac{{max}_{J}-{V}_{j}^{-}}{{M}_{1ij}}.$$ (6) 2. In next step
    relative importance [9] will be calculated with the help of the scale of importance
    shown below, and the detailed modified approach is discussed in Section 6. Intensity
    of Importance Definition 1 Equal Important 2 Weak 3 Moderate Important 4 Moderate
    Plus 5 Strong Importance 6 Strong Plus 7 Very Strong 8 Very Very Strong 9 Extreme
    Strong 4.2 Second phase In the second phase, we have implemented PROMETHEE II
    where the weight criteria matrix from the modified AHP method is integrated. In
    this complete ranking of the alternative has been done. There are various conflicting
    attributes, so proper coordination among them has been made. After making proper
    coordination among them, the pairwise comparison has been done and preference
    functions have been calculated. After that net flow has been calculated and lastly,
    the optimal ranking of the cluster heads has been done. The flow diagram of proposed
    algorithm has been presented in Fig. 3 below: Fig. 3 Flow Diagram of Proposed
    Mechanism Full size image Calculate the denomination matrix for each \\(n\\) Attribute
    and \\(m\\) alternatives \\(m*m\\) matrix. \\({{Q}_{j}}_{m*m}\\) Here twenty-one
    attributes have been considered for our proposed work and these are conflicting
    in nature. These attributes have an important impact on cluster heads selection.
    Attributes considered in this paper were given below in Fig. 4. These are conflicting
    attributes, thus proper coordination among them is necessary for further use in
    other applications. The reason for choosing twenty-one attributes for cluster
    head selection is that these attributes play an important role in cluster heads
    selection and gives us an understanding of how optimal clustering leads to energy-efficient
    clustering. In earlier research works cluster heads were selected based on two
    or three attributes but that not leads to efficient energy consumption. After
    reading earlier research works, we found research gaps of not using multi-attributes
    that lead to optimal cluster head selection. And these twenty-one attributes play
    a vital role in cluster head selection, thus in this paper, we have considered
    twenty-one attributes where connectivity, coverage, residual energy, distance
    to the CH, member node, node density, and their standard deviation were considered
    that are conflicting in nature. Being conflicting in nature proper coordination
    among the attributes has been made. And our results validate that choosing these
    twenty-one multi-attributes enhances network lifetime with efficient energy consumption.
    The Attributes such as coverage, connectivity, distance to the base station, and
    power node plays an important role but the standard deviation of residual energy,
    distance, and power also plays important for optimal cluster heads selection.
    Fig. 4 Attributes Considered in Proposed Work Full size image 5 Data set generation
    For the simulation purpose, we have used MATLAB for modeling the WSN. In our simulation,
    we have generated a random population of 20 for preserving the difference between
    the 20 alternative populations. The more difference helps us to understand the
    proposed algorithm in a better way. In Fig. 5 the sensor nodes deployment has
    been presented. The population generated in our experiment has been done by using
    the above equations for every given alternative. Table 3 shows the abbreviation
    used for the attributes considered in our proposed work. Whereas Table 4 shows
    the computed values of the attributes for modeled WSN by using the CHs selected
    for each alternative. In the simulation we have firstly shows the modified AHP
    results and then proposed approach results has been simulated to understand the
    working of modified PROMETHEE II using AHP. Fig. 5 Sensor nodes in Simulation

    selection using MADM Many methods can be applied to selecting the best cluster
    heads (CHs). In this section, we have first explained modified AHP in Sections
    6.1 and 6.2 proposed algorithms i.e. Modified PROMETHEE II and AHP is explained.
    The reason of showing both methods is simply to understand the significance of
    PROMEHTHEE II with Modified AHP that it enhances the network performance better
    than modified AHP. Here each methods with its respective results has been discussed:
    6.1 Modified AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method for CH’s selection Step
    1: The normalizations of the data set (\\({M}_{1}\\)). By using the following
    equation we can denote the matrix by \\(({{M}_{1ij})}_{mn}\\) and the normalized
    data has been presented in Table 5: There are two types of factors one is a beneficial
    factor and the other is a non-beneficial factor. For the beneficial factor, we
    have to select the max value of each factor \\({V}_{J}^{+}\\) compute the normalized
    value to the column \\(i\\; to\\; M\\) and \\(j=\\mathrm{1,2},3\\dots n\\) $${M}_{1ij}=\\frac{{M}_{ij}-{MIN}_{J}}{{V}_{j}^{+}}$$
    (7) And for non-beneficial min value for each factor has been calculated \\({V}_{j}^{-}\\),
    where \\(j=\\mathrm{1,2},3\\dots n\\) $${M}_{1ij}=\\frac{{max}_{J}-{V}_{j}^{-}}{{M}_{1ij}}$$
    (8) The values of the normalized matrix lie between \\(0-1\\). Step 2: After this
    Relative Importance Matrix will be generated \\({W}_{n*n}\\). In Table 6 the relative
    importance of all considered attributes has been given. Step 3: Geometric Mean
    (GM) of each has computed by using the following equation $${GM}_{i}={\\prod }_{i=1}^{n}{W}_{ij},
    i=\\mathrm{1,2},\\dots m\\; and\\; j=\\mathrm{1,2},\\dots n$$ (9) Step 4: In this
    step, the weighted matrix will be calculated \\(({{M}_{2})}_{n*1}\\). Table 7
    denotes the weighted matrix of the attributes. $${GM}_{i}=\\frac{{GM}_{i}}{{\\sum
    }_{i=1}^{n}{GM}_{i}} , \\sum\\nolimits_{i=1}^{n}{M}_{2i}=1$$ (10) Step 5: Check
    the consistency: Compute the matrix \\({M}_{3}\\) and it is represented in Table
    8. $${{M}_{3}}_{n*1}= {{M}_{1}}_{n*n}*{{M}_{2}}_{n*1}$$ (11) Compute the matrix
    \\({M}_{4}\\) and it is represented in Table 9. $${{M}_{4}}_{n*1}=\\frac{{{M}_{3}}_{n*1}}{{{M}_{2}}_{n*1}}$$
    (12) Compute \\({\\lambda }_{max}\\) $${\\lambda }_{max}=\\frac{{\\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{{M}_{4}}_{i}}{n}$$
    (13) Consistency Index \\(CI\\) as: $$CI=\\frac{{\\lambda }_{max}-n}{n-1}$$ (14)
    Compute consistency Ratio $$CR=\\frac{CI}{RI}$$ Here \\(RI=random\\; index\\)   Step
    6: Calculate the value of \\({P}_{i}\\) by using the SAW method, in our experiment
    we used the SAW method for selecting the CH. The value is presented in Table 10.
    $${P}_{i}=\\sum\\nolimits_{j=1}^{n}{M}_{2i}*{{M}_{1}}_{ij } ,\\; i=\\mathrm{1,2},3
    \\;m.$$ (15) Where \\({\\varvec{M}}\\) stands for Matrix. Step 7: We finally rank
    the given alternative according to the higher value of \\({P}_{i}\\). And the
    rank is presented in Table 11. Table 5 Normalizations of Modified AHP Full size

    Full size table 6.2 Modified PROMETHEE II and AHP method for CH selection using
    Modified AHP This is our proposed approach where integration of PROMETHEE II and
    Modified AHP is performed. And the result analysis shows that proposed algorithms
    performs better than the modified AHP. In this section proposed approach with
    each step has been explained with results. The significance of proposed algorithm
    can be understand by analyzing the results with modified AHP which shows that
    proposed algorithms has better performance with efficient energy consumption and
    enhanced network lifetime. Step 1: The normalizations of the data set (\\({M}_{1}\\)).
    By using the following equation we can denote the matrix by \\(({{M}_{1ij})}_{mn}\\)
    a. Calculate the denomination matrix for each \\(n\\) attribute and \\(m\\) alternatives
    \\(m*m\\) matrix. \\({{M}_{j}}_{m*m}\\). Step 2: Now the corresponding weights
    of each attribute are multiplied by each denomination matrix and the final matrix
    is calculated by doing the summation of each matrix. And the final denomination
    matrix is presented in Table 12. $${({M}_{j}}_{m*m})={{Q}_{j}}_{m*m}*{w}_{j}$$
    (16) Where \\({w}_{j}=1\\) $${Q}_{m*m}=\\sum\\nolimits_{j=1}^{n}{({M}_{j}}_{m*m}),\\;
    i=\\mathrm{1,2},\\dots ..m.$$ (17) Step 3: Now compute \\({\\$}_{i}^{+} \\;and\\;
    {\\$}_{i}^{-}\\) by adding rows and columns. This is presented in Table 13. Step
    4: Compute the net flow by using the following equation and presented in Table
    14: $${\\$}_{i}={\\$}_{i}^{+}-{\\$}_{i}^{-}$$ (18) Step 5: Lastly rank the alternative
    according to the higher value of \\({\\$}_{i}\\) and the rank is given in Table
    15. Table 12 Final Denomination Matrix Full size table Table 13 Computation of
    \\({\\$}_{i}^{+} \\;and\\; {\\$}_{i}^{-}\\)   Full size table Table 14 Net-Flow
    Full size table Table 15 Rank according to the Modified PROMETHEE II and AHP Full
    size table 7 Simulation results This section evaluates the proposed algorithms
    with modified AHP and another clustering algorithm under different scenarios.
    MATLAB is used for the simulation and we have compared the proposed algorithm
    by modified AHP, LEACH, LEACH-C, EPSO, and EES-WCA. The reason of showing the
    results of modified AHP is that it can be made clear that Modified PROMETHEE II
    and AHP together is better and results validates the same. Thus, we have integrate
    both algorithms for enhancing the performance of networks. Although modified AHP
    performs better than other compared algorithms but proposed algorithms outperforms
    it. We have performed the proposed approach under different scenarios using three
    metrics FND, CHD, and Network_Dead. Here, network dead means when 75% of the nodes
    are dead then we consider all nodes dead. Here, we have taken both types of cluster
    heads i.e. bad and good for a clear understanding of our simulation. The attributes
    taken in our simulation belong to two categories: beneficiary and non-beneficiary.
    Higher values are preferred in beneficiary attributes, and in Non-beneficiary
    low values for attributes were preferred. Here we have taken the base model LEACH-C,
    the amount of energy consumption as it is reduced by minimizing the squared distance
    between member nodes and cluster heads. But only considering one attribute for
    cluster head selection leads to non-optimal cluster head selection that degrades
    the network performance. Thus, in our proposed work we have considered multi-attributes
    of sensor nodes by making coordination among them. Here, we have taken the overall
    ranking of the cluster heads which enhances network lifetime and leads to efficient
    energy consumption. In comparison to the base model, our proposed algorithm performs
    better in terms of network dead, cluster heads dead, and energy consumption by
    37%. A total of four scenarios have been considered where the simulation area,
    number of nodes, the initial energy of the sensor nodes, and base station position
    values were considered in a different scenario. In all four scenarios, it is shown
    that the proposed algorithm preserves the energy of sensor nodes and outperforms
    the other algorithms. Here we have taken four scenarios by changing the values
    of the simulation area, number of nodes, and base station position, and in all
    scenarios our proposed algorithm performs better than modified AHP, LEACH, LEACH-C,
    EPSO, and EES-WCA. The performance has been measured in terms of the First node
    dead, Cluster Head Dead, and Last Node Dead. By evaluating the first node dead
    we understand, how much time our first node will die when our first cluster head
    will die and the last node dead indicates to us when our whole network will die.
    We measured network lifetime in terms of dead nodes, as network lifetime means
    how much time the network sustains. In Table 16 abbreviations for the compared
    algorithms taken for our proposed algorithms have been presented. Figure 6 below
    shows that in all the scenario whether we change the simulation area, increases
    the number of sensor nodes, or change the base station position, the proposed
    algorithm performs better than other algorithms. In Fig. 6, we have also shown
    the simulated area with sensor nodes in each scenario so that we can better understand
    the scenario. Our proposed algorithm, by applying multi-attributes for cluster
    head selection shows that network lifetime has been increased with efficient energy
    consumption. Also considering every aspect of sensor nodes leads to load balance
    between nodes and thus efficient energy consumption helps in increasing the network
    lifetime. Table 16 Abbreviations Used for Comparison of Our Proposed Algorithms
    Full size table Fig. 6 Scenarios Taken in Simulation Full size image The results
    validate that the proposed algorithm enhances network lifetime by balancing load
    among the sensor nodes with efficient energy consumption. Value of FND, LND, and
    CHD shows that each of the cluster heads are having a load balance among them
    as some of them are gateways and no cluster heads die before other compared algorithms
    in all scenarios we have considered. The performance evaluation of our proposed
    work is evaluated in terms of network lifetime by analyzing LND, energy consumption
    by using an energy consumption graph, and Load Balance among the senor nodes of
    the network. If we see in scenarios 1 and 3 cluster heads and the last node dead
    of the proposed algorithm is better than the compared algorithms, and also energy
    consumption of modified PROMETHEE II is better than modified AHP, LEACH, LEACH-C,
    EPSO, and EES-WCA. If we see scenarios 2 and 4, the energy consumption is efficient
    and the network lifetime is enhanced by balancing load among the sensor nodes
    of modified PROMETHEE II than other compared algorithms. The analysis of the proposed
    work has been explained below for better understanding. Here in the simulation
    results and scenarios we have also analyzed proposed approach (modified PROMETHEE
    II and AHP) with modified AHP and results validates that modified PROMETHEE II
    performs better than the AHP. In all scenarios, modified AHP energy consumption,
    network dead and cluster heads dead performance is not better than our integrated
    proposed work where both PROMETHEE II and modified AHP is integrated. 7.1 Analysis
    of energy consumption In the performance evaluation of our proposed work, firstly
    we have analyzed the energy consumption in all the scenarios taken to see how
    energy consumption works in all scenarios. The energy consumption of sensor nodes
    can be defined as the energy consumed in transmitting and receiving the data from
    cluster heads or base stations. The performance of energy consumption in scenarios
    1, 2, 3, and 4 have been presented in graphs of Fig. 7 which shows that in all
    scenarios our proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms. This is because
    at the early stage, we have evaluated the multi-attributes of sensor nodes and
    proper coordination between them is done which avoids wastage of energy if the
    node is idle. From LND, FND, CHD it can be seen clearly that by integrating PROMETHEE
    II and modified AHP performs better than modified AHP. Although modified AHP perform
    better than other compared algorithms. Proposed approach (Modified PROMETHEE II
    and AHP) has balance the load among sensors so that every node has an equal load
    accordingly. The efficient energy consumption in all scenarios has been presented
    in Fig. 7. Proposed approach has better energy consumption than all other algorithms.
    Although modified AHP has better performance than other compared algorithms but
    proposed approach has better performance than it. Fig. 7 Performance of the Experimental
    Results Full size image 7.2 Analysis of network lifetime Network lifetime can
    be defined as when all sensor nodes run out of energy and due to which the network
    goes down. The result of network lifetime has been presented in Fig. 7 where FND,
    LND, and CHD where our proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms in LND
    our proposed algorithms perform better than others as also energy consumption
    is more efficient than other algorithms. In Fig. 7, it can be seen that FND of
    proposed approach is better than modified AHP, LND of modified PROMETHEE II is
    better than modified AHP and other compared algorithms. Here on analyzing network
    lifetime it can be seen, that modified PROMETHEE II and AHP has better network
    lifetime than the modified AHP. The significance of proposed approach is that
    modified PROMETHEE II and AHP perform better than the modified AHP. 7.3 Load balance
    analysis As in sensor networks sensor nodes may have a different energy levels
    that can prolong network lifetime by using efficient energy consumption. In our
    proposed work, we have taken different sensor nodes such as gateways and normal
    sensor nodes having different energy levels. But by making coordination among
    the conflicting attributes helps in balancing the load among all sensor nodes.
    Our proposed algorithm has a better way of balancing the load among sensor nodes
    that not only enhances network lifetime but makes efficient utilization of energy
    consumption. The performance of modified PROMETHEE II and AHP is better than modified
    AHP and other compared algorithms. For experimental results and scenarios graphs
    clearly indicates that our modified PROMETHEE II and AHP is better than the modified
    AHP and other compared algorithms. The performance of modified AHP is better than
    LEACH, LEACH-C, EPSO and EES-WCA. Among all the compared algorithm our proposed
    algorithms outperforms than the other compared algorithms. 8 Conclusion and future
    scope In WSN efficient energy consumption is considered to be the most important
    issue and various algorithm has been given by the researchers for the same. In
    today’s era, where everything is connected, multi-attributes considerations are
    important. The proposed aaproach modified PROMETHEE II and AHP provide load-balanced
    and increased network lifetime by considering the twenty-one attributes for the
    selection of cluster heads. In this, all the attributes were considered and coordination
    among them has been done for the data collection process. The selected cluster
    heads (CHs) have a balanced load among the sensor nodes and also optimal energy
    consumption for the data transmission to the base station. The results validate
    the outcome of our proposed algorithms modified PROMETHEE II and AHP and also
    verify that they consume optimal energy consumption during the data transmission.
    Modified AHP network performance is less efficient as compared to our Modified
    PROMETHEE II and AHP in terms of LND, FND and CHD. The comparison of proposed
    algorithm with modified AHP signifies that PROMETHEE II and modified AHP has optimal
    CHs selection with efficient energy consumption. Our results show that the considered
    multi attributes play an important role in efficient energy consumption and increased
    network lifetime. As far as energy consumption is considered to be the most important
    factor in sensor networks, thus sensor nodes consume less energy and also balance
    the load among the sensor nodes. So, our proposed algorithm favored the data transmission
    and collection for a longer time in the network. We conclude that our proposed
    algorithm performs better than the other algorithms and our results validate it.
    In future work, we will apply nature-inspired algorithms for enhanced performance.
    In the future, this approach may be applied to the application areas of the IoT
    domain, health care system, and traffic monitoring system. Data availability Data
    will be available on reasonable request from the author. References Abbasi AA,

  description: WSNs(Wireless Sensor Networks) has been developed with applications
    in many domains including agriculture, telecommunication, manufacturing industry,
    healthcare, and surveillance. More specifically, WSN plays a pivotal role in IoT
    (Internet of Things). The IoT sensors provide information about the physical phenomena
    in the deployed fields. As the sensors contain only limited resources, the factors
    like data processing, power consumption, transmission, and storage capabilities
    adversely affect the efficiency. Thus, the process of routing is necessary for
    network longevity. The data from IoT-based sensors is routed to the destination
    through a multi-hop routing system. The Energy aware Routing is motivated by the
    nature inspired Fuzzy Butterfly Optimization (E2RFBOA). Further a new data aggregation
    method is introduced in this article customized for IoT based WSN to acquaint
    higher crop yield in precision farming. Nevertheless, the scalability becomes
    a primary concern when deployed in larger and denser networks. This is due to
    the fact that all nodes in IoT and WSN are mostly alive depending on higher usage
    of bandwidth and power. The primal aim is to build a novel routing protocol developed
    for IoT-WSN. Apart from this, an Energy aware Clustered Routing that is motivated
    by Adaptive Elephant Herding Optimization (E2CR-AEHO) is proposed, which sensors
    collect data and find a group of Cluster Heads (CHs). In the AEHO Algorithm, the
    formed CH is rotated depending on power consumption. This also prevents frequent
    re-clustering; at the same time it can effectively adapt to the changes in network
    topology. According to the AEHOA, the node population comprises of nodes that
    can choose its CHs among the other nodes. This algorithm takes into account a
    number of criteria, including power consumption, residual power of Sensor Nodes
    (SN), network reliability, and data reliability. The suggested approach can efficiently
    represent the network environment, allowing the routing algorithm to avoid passing
    over marked zones. Network-specific performances measures including PDRs (Packet
    Delivery Ratios), NLs (Network Lifetimes), PLRs (Packet Loss Ratios), and AE2E
    (Average End To End) delay are used to evaluate simulation outcomes. This proposed
    framework aggregates IoT, which can gradually reduce the amount of data, hence
    extending network lifetime.

  description: Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm supported by mobile edge
    computing is attracting more and more attention, such as smart agriculture, smart
    transportation, smart security surveillance, and smart environmental monitoring.
    Nevertheless, small UAV devices cannot deploy advanced best-performing DNN models
    with insufficient computing and storage resources. Aerial computing centers serving
    as edges can collect tasks from UAVs, reduce UAV load, and provide high-accuracy
    inference. Limited radio resources in offloading and load imbalance in computing
    centers could lead to significant latency in task inference. Considering image
    processing in UAV applications, we propose a hybrid inference framework combining
    early exit and task offloading based on distributed neural network. The bottleneck-designed
    DNN provides a smaller intermediate data size than the original input. By deploying
    shallow neural networks at the drone terminals and advanced DNNs at the aerial
    computing servers, latency-constrained tasks can be exited after local inference,
    offloaded to the edge after local computation, or directly offloaded to the edge.
    Compared to binary or partial offloading, the early-exit-based framework provides
    fast inference as the workflow stops when a confident result is obtained. Combining
    task offloading into the inference process offers a more flexible option to release
    the UAV computing load. The proposed approach efficiently utilizes wireless transmission
    and balances the computation load to maximize the system inference accuracy within
    the latency constraints. Practical task inference simulations demonstrate that
    our approach obtains higher system accuracy under different radio resources, task
    generation rates, and terminal computing capacities conditions.

    vehicles (UAVs), driven by the development of automation and radio technology,
    are widely applied in civil and military fields such as communication, remote
    sensing, surveillance, monitoring, and disaster recovery because of their high
    mobility and flexibility, diverse applications, and low deployment cost [1]. UAVs
    provide many potential scenarios for the application of mobile communication networks.
    For example, they can fast and flexibly achieve remote control, communication
    enhancement, large-scale three-dimensional coverage, and rapid response [2], [3],
    [4]. With the development of computer technology, more and more applications can
    be integrated into UAV devices. Rapidly inference feedback by deploying neural
    networks in UAV terminals becomes a potential future application [5], [6], such
    as computer vision, natural language processing, and digital signal processing.
    Deep neural networks (DNNs) can express various concepts by extracting high-level
    features from the original data and achieving excellent performance. In the UAV
    inference scenario, the energy consumption comes mainly from the propulsion part
    of maintaining the UAV terminal altitude and free-flying rather than data transmission
    [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Hence we focus on the task inference accuracy with
    the latency constraint using DNN deployed at UAV and aerial computing centers.
    The drone terminals typically acquire data directly from sensors in a streaming
    fashion. However, there are some limitations to task processing after data acquisition.
    As DNN applications continue to achieve performance breakthroughs, the network
    structure becomes more complex, the number of network layers increases, and the
    amount of computation required by DNNs grows. Drone terminals have limited computing,
    storage, and energy capacity to support state-of-the-art, high-complexity DNN
    deployments. EfficientDet-D7 offers excellent performance in object inspection
    but requires 52M parameters, which take a few seconds to process even with the
    support of advanced graphics processing units [12]. The limited computing capacity
    of drone terminals can only support lightweight models, and relative model accuracy
    is lost. To increase the accuracy from 20% to 33.8% in the COCO data set, even
    the simplest EfficientDet family, EfficientDet-D0, requires three times more operations
    than SSD-MobileNetV2 [13]. Computational tasks are processed by drone terminals
    as local and aerial computing centers as edge. In a fully local computation, DNNs
    are performed entirely by the local drone. This approach eliminates data transmission
    over the wireless channel. The complexity of the best-performing DNNs exceeds
    the computational capacity and energy consumption level of drone terminals, in
    which case simpler models, such as MobileNet and MnasNet, are used [13], [14].
    Widely used techniques for model lightweight, such as knowledge distillation and
    model pruning/quantization, are often applied in local model deployments [15],
    [16]. In full offloading computing, the input is transmitted to the aerial computing
    centers, and then a complex high-performance model is executed. This approach
    focuses on high precision, where the drone terminals are not assigned computing
    loads, and the entire input needs to be uploaded to the edge server. In the case
    of poor channels, the system can suffer from significant end-to-end delays and
    even fail to transmit tasks. Compressing the input is one way to reduce the load
    on the wireless transmission. Models are executed with reconstructed inputs rather
    than executed with original inputs. Low-complexity conventional and neural compression
    models are applicable for input compression [17], [18]. In order to utilize both
    local and edge computing power, we deploy distributed neural networks at drone
    terminals and edge servers to support drone-edge cooperation scenarios. Neural
    network deployment includes split computing and early exiting. Split computing
    splits the DNN into a head model that executes at the drone and a tail model that
    executes at the edge server. The inference time in split computing includes the
    processing time at the drone terminal, the communication delay between the drone
    and the edge server, and the processing time at the edge server. In conventional
    split computing deployments, the execution of the header model is performed by
    drone terminals with less computing capacity than edge servers, which may increase
    the total execution time. The intermediate data transmission may be larger or
    smaller than the data transmission directly from the input, depending on the network
    structure of the header model. However, we note that in most relevant applications,
    the size of the intermediate transmitted data becomes smaller than the original
    input only in the later layers. In considering the transmission partitioning,
    this will allocate most of the computational load to the drone terminals. The
    split computing frameworks have introduced the concept of bottlenecks to implementing
    in-model compression for task execution [19]. A bottleneck is a compression point
    at one layer of the model, which reduces the number of nodes or channels in the
    target layer, and intermediate data may lack the information needed to fully reconstruct
    the original input data. Since split computing implements task-oriented compression,
    it provides better privacy than fully edge computing. The early exit approach
    trains the model to embed multiple “exits” in the DNN model. The system can select
    the first exit that satisfies the confidence of output. It is unnecessary to perform
    the entire network computational process for each task to obtain sufficiently
    confident results, so an early exit will reduce the system computation amount
    compared to executing the entire network. Determining the exit by sample or system
    conditions will yield different model computational complexities. The higher the
    number of model layers used to produce the results, the higher the accuracy. Thus,
    the trade-off between accuracy and latency can be adjusted according to current
    system conditions or task requirements. For fast feedback requirements, we prefer
    to compute tasks locally. The demands for accuracy lead us to offload tasks to
    the edge. Due to the radio spectrum scarcity and the limited transmission capacity
    of drone terminals, it is difficult for us to offload all the tasks to the edge
    for computing. The contributions of this work include: • We design a real-time
    task execution process in joint drone-edge computing scenarios with early-exit-supported
    distributed DNNs. Conventional binary or partial offloading obtains a valid result
    only after all computing sections are completed and may fail due to latency constraints
    and limited UAV resources. The inference flow stops at the early exit point once
    the drone has a confident inference and a valid result is obtained, reducing the
    demanded computation and radio resources. • We implement hybrid task offloading
    with practical image processing by distributed model deployment and task computation.
    The processed task demands smaller intermediate data transmission compared to
    the unprocessed one. Conventional split computing and early exiting approaches
    execute all tasks’ shallow models at the drone, which may lead to failure under
    the heavy load. The proposed framework includes tasks exited after local computation,
    uploaded to edge computation after local computation, and directly transmitted
    to edge computation. • We investigate system inference accuracy, including image
    processing accuracy and latency constraints. The computation results obtained
    exceeding the latency constraint are considered invalid. Each image processing
    task may or may not be recognized correctly, depending on its difficulty. • We
    optimize the task assignments under three computational flows and balance the
    load of local and edge computing with limited transmission capacity. We form the
    pending upload queues from processed and unprocessed tasks by latency and local
    inference results. The server loads are balanced based on the length of the waiting
    computation queue. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
    related work is reviewed. In Section 3, the system model and problem formulation
    are presented. In Section 4, we analyze the proposed framework, and the corresponding
    discussion has been presented. In Section 5, simulation results are presented.
    Finally, the conclusion is drawn in Section 6. 2. Related work Many works on UAV
    offloading mainly focus on binary and partial offloading, where valid results
    can only be obtained after all computational sections are completed. The computing
    demands for tasks are relatively high, and system resources are limited, which
    may lead to unavoidable failures under heavy loads. A resource allocation framework
    is proposed to support the partial and binary computation offloading modes with
    a two-stage and three-stage strategy, which maximizes the computation rate under
    energy and speed constraints [20]. In [21], a modified genetic algorithm is proposed
    to solve the graph-based task assignment problem with a proper execution order.
    The work [22] investigates UAV-assisted mobile edge computing and optimizes the
    computation offloading with minimum UAV energy consumption by the Dinkelbach algorithm
    and UAV trajectory planning. A two-level hierarchical game and reinforcement learning
    framework is used in [23] to model the computational offloading among multiple
    service providers and analyze the aggregated payoffs. The task balancing in multi-UAV
    integrated edge computing system under coverage constraints is optimized by differential
    evolution mechanism and reinforcement learning [24]. In the research on split
    computing, many studies have focused on finding the optimal model splitting point.
    The work [15] minimizes the inference latency by finding the best splitting point
    of the DNN model. Jeong et al. [25] proposes the partial offload approach in privacy-preserving
    computing. Itahara et al. [26] discuss the effect of the discard layer [27] on
    the model performance in splitting computing based on the VGG model. Based on
    [28], for most of the DNN models, executing the entire model on a drone terminal
    or an edge server is the best regarding total inference and energy consumption.
    Communication latency in data transmission from drone terminals to edge servers
    is critical to split computing overall inference time. Studies in [19], [29] first
    proposed to design of relatively small bottlenecks in the early layers of the
    DNN model instead of introducing compression techniques like quantization to the
    model to reduce communication delays and overall inference time. With acceptable
    model prediction performance, over-compression of intermediate features and communication
    errors between devices is tolerable [30]. In the research on early exit, many
    studies have focused on selecting the best exit points. In [31], an early exit
    structure is proposed consisting of the cloud, the edge, and end devices with
    different data sample distributions. The work [32] proposes an exit point and
    partition point search method with BranchyNet to exit the model if the accuracy
    is satisfactory, where only the first few layers might be executed. Focusing on
    minimizing transmission energy rather than delay, the authors in [33] investigate
    the problem of merging exit point selection and splitting strategies. In [34],
    an authentic operation is proposed to set stochastic threshold values for different
    DNN output classes with an early exit strategy. By identifying the “easy” samples
    in the compressed images, the work [35] proposes a resource-efficient blind quality
    enhancement approach to process the samples with early exits dynamically. Table
    1 shows the comparison of literature. The previous works investigated binary or
    partial offloading, the selection of exit points, and the selection of network
    partition points. Conventional offloading and split computing must complete all
    the computing sections of the desired workflow to provide a valid result, which
    may lead to inevitable failures with latency constraints and limited system resources.
    Early exit and computing offloading are jointly considered in this work to take
    full advantage of edge computing and wireless transmission. The bottleneck structure
    is applied to reduce the wireless transmission load. We focus on the overall accuracy
    of the joint drone-edge inference system under latency constraints. Table 1. The
    comparison of literature. 3. System model and problem formulation 3.1. Fast inference
    with drone-edge cooperation We deploy distributed neural networks in the drone-edge
    cooperation inference system for fast inference. The system architecture is shown
    in Fig. 1(a), and the task inference process is illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Specifically,
    we divide the DNN model into two parts deployed on UAV devices and edge servers.
    Due to the difference in computing capacity, and storage capacity between drone
    terminals and edge servers, their deployed neural networks are different in size.
    At the drone terminal, we deploy shallow network models to provide fast feedback,
    and at the edge server, we deploy deep network models to offer precise inference
    for challenging tasks. With the early exit approach, the shallow part of the model
    is executed, and an inference result is output without running through all of
    the complex network structures. Tasks can be exited early when confidence requirements
    are met, reducing bandwidth usage and providing faster responses. Download : Download

    layers traversed by the input positively correlates with the classification accuracy
    [36]. Assume the images of vehicles, cats, and dogs form a dataset. Because vehicles
    have different features compared to those of cats and dogs, vehicle classification
    is a relatively easy task. When the classification task is the vehicle, the system
    can fast get the exit result by the shallow network deployed at the drone terminal.
    When the classification task is a cat or a dog, the system can use advanced DNNs
    at the edge to precisely classify challenging tasks. Download : Download high-res

    splitting of the large-scale DNNs does not improve performance in most cases [37].
    Without a specific design, the intermediate data transmitted in the network is
    higher than the original image data due to the multiple channels in the convolutional
    neural network. We utilize the bottleneck concept and design the compression structure
    in the model at the drone terminal exit point, enabling the intermediate data
    transmission between the drone and the edge to be less than the original data.
    While the bottleneck optimizes the intermediate representations, it retains the
    higher-order information about the task. Neural networks deployed on drone terminals
    and edge servers enable tasks to be exited after local computation, offloaded
    to the edge after local computation, or transmitted directly to the edge. The
    system allows a trade-off between model accuracy and task latency to maximize
    system inference accuracy based on current system situations and task latency
    requirements. Fig. 2 illustrates the proposed framework for distributed inference
    process. The computational flow of the overall system is shown as follows. Table

    and generates the tasks at each time slot. 2. The drone terminal forms a local

    the adjacency among edges to balance the edge computation load. 9. The computation
    module computes the tasks in order and returns the inference results. Data not
    computed in the current time slot is returned to their storage. The relevant notations
    are listed in Table 2 for convenience. 3.2. The entropy of early exit In the early
    exit structure, the confidence of the image processing output can be expressed
    by the entropy of its classification. Since we use the softmax function in image
    classification, each softmax output represents the probability that the image
    belongs to the corresponding class (1) where is the number of output classes,
    is the index for the classes, and are the th and th class original output, and
    is the th class softmax output. Let denote the -dimensional vector of the softmax
    outputs for all the classes. The entropy of a classification result can be defined
    as (2) The entropy function expresses the overall distribution of the softmax
    output. The lower its entropy, the higher the system’s confidence in the results
    of task inference. The probability of task classification focusing on a particular
    output. The higher its entropy, the lower the system’s confidence in the results
    of task inference. The probability of task classification is spread over multiple
    outcomes. A threshold is determined such that when the entropy of the output is
    less than the threshold, the system is confident enough that the inference of
    the task is sufficiently reasonable to provide quick feedback by the early exit.
    3.3. Model training We train a DNN model for image processing based on the RESNET
    and Branchy structure. We design one early exit at the shallow level, deploy the
    shallow network at the drone terminals, and the entire network at the edge servers.
    There are 32 layers in the principal network, 10 layers in the head network for
    fast response, and 22 layers in the tail network structure for better performance.
    We design the network structure with the bottleneck so that the intermediate representation
    data after local processing is significantly smaller than the original input data.
    We use cross entropy as the loss function and optimize the DNN parameters by the
    stochastic gradient descent algorithm. For the time complexity of our distributed
    neural network, the computational load refers to the number of operations to accomplish
    each layer’s module. For fully connected layers, the computing requirement can
    be formulated as (3) where and represent the number of input and out neurons.
    For convolutional layers, to simplify the number of variables in the expression,
    the shape of both the input and the convolution kernel is assumed to be square
    uniformly. The computing load could be expressed as (4) where denotes the length
    of the feature map, represents the length of each convolution kernel, is the number
    of input channels of the convolution layer equal to the number of feature maps
    generated by the previous layer, represents the number of filters, which indicates
    the number of output channels. The size of the output feature map is formed by
    the size of the input matrix , the size of the convolution kernel , Padding, and
    Stride, which can be formulated as (5) Therefore, the time complexity of the convolution
    part could be formulated as (6) where denotes the number of convolution layers
    that the neural network has, i.e., the depth of the network. denotes the th convolution
    layer of the neural network. denotes the number of output channels of the th convolution
    layer of the neural network, i.e., the number of convolution kernels in that layer.
    For the th convolution layer, the number of input channels is the number of output
    channels of the th convolution layer. We train the proposed model using the CIFAR-10
    dataset, which consists of 60000 samples and contains ten classifications (airplane,
    car, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, boat, and truck). We train the model using
    50000 samples and test the model using 10000 samples. Each task we generate includes
    a certain number of images drawn from the 10000 test samples. 3.4. Problem formulation
    In this paper, we consider a system consisting of drones connected to aerial computing
    centers as edge servers. The aerial computing center set is . The set of drone
    terminals served by th computing center is denoted as . Each drone terminal can
    only access one edge server, and the drone terminal and the aerial computing center
    are connected via the wireless network. The aerial computing centers are connected
    by laser transmission, which forms , and the edge set represents their association.
    If two aerial computing centers are within the range of laser transmission, two
    servers are treated as adjacent. Aerial computing centers can offload tasks to
    their adjacent centers. Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
    is applied in wireless transmission to provide wireless connections for devices.
    The system operates with slotted time, and slot has the interval . Each drone
    terminal occupies a sub-channel, and the transmission bandwidth obtained by the
    drone terminal under the server at time is denoted as . The total radio bandwidth
    is denoted as . The aerial computing centers allocate radio resources and computation
    balancing decisions. In the hybrid inference framework, image tasks can be executed
    using local computing power and exit at drone terminals. Processed tasks can be
    transmitted to the edge server to utilize advanced DNNs and unprocessed tasks
    can be transmitted directly to the edge server. There are two types of resources
    in the system, computing resources and radio resources. Computing resources include
    drone computing resources and edge computing resources. Radio resources transmit
    unprocessed or processed tasks from the drones to the edges. The system uses edge
    computing power, channel bandwidth, and each drone’s computing power to process
    image tasks effectively. The system provides efficient assignment for the task’s
    processing in real-time, ensuring the system’s inference accuracy. Let denote
    the set of tasks generated by drone in edge at time slot . Each drone terminal
    collects sensor data at each time slot, generating a certain number of task packages.
    Consider a specific image processing scenario, each task package containing images.
    Each image has its true label . When the labels computed by the DNN match their
    true labels, we regard the images as correctly processed. Considering the timeliness
    of the tasks, each task has a specific latency constraint . When the processing
    time of a task exceeds the latency constraint, we treat the image processing as
    a failure, even if the inference label fits the true label. The computing capacity
    is limited at the local drone terminal. The local computing capacity of the system
    is denoted as . Due to the different sizes of DNNs stored in drone terminals and
    edge servers, the amount of computation needed for image processing varies at
    the local and edge. Local computation demand for a task is denoted as . Thus,
    the computation time for one task executed locally is (7) In the computation flow,
    tasks are processed in the order in which they are placed in the queue. Upon the
    queue reaching the task, the drone checks whether the task can be processed in
    the demand latency. If the remaining time is insufficient, the drone will exit
    the task and check the next one. Tasks entering the local computation queue but
    not completing the computing process are stored in the local pending queue and
    assigned again in the next time slot. DNNs are designed with a bottleneck construction,
    where the required uploaded intermediate data amount is less than the original
    data. The raw data of a task is denoted as . The intermediate data of a processed
    task is denoted as . The transmission rate between the drone terminal and the
    corresponding edge server is (8) where is the transmission power of the drone
    terminal. is the channel gain between the th drone terminal in the edge . is the
    power spectral density of additive Gaussian white noise. The time required to
    transmit the raw data of one task to the edge is (9) The time required to transmit
    the intermediate data of one locally processed task is (10) All successfully uploaded
    tasks enter the pending assignment queue of each edge server. In the transmission
    process, each task is uploaded sequentially in the order within the queue. If
    the radio resource cannot transmit all the pending uploaded tasks, the rest will
    be stored in their local memory and scheduled with the new coming tasks at the
    next time slot. When a task is transmitted to the edge, the task can be executed
    at the corresponding edge server. When the edge server load is high, tasks can
    be delivered to adjacent edge servers for balancing. Each server has its waiting
    computation queue. After the pending processing queue is uploaded to the edge,
    it is balanced and added to the waiting computation queue of each edge server
    to complete the image processing. The edge computing process is the same as the
    drone computing process. Tasks that enter the edge waiting computation queue but
    have not been completed are stored in the edge storage and continue to be computed
    in the next time slot. The edge computing capacity is denoted as . Edge computation
    demand for an unprocessed task is denoted as . Edge computation demand for a processed
    task is denoted as . The computation time for unprocessed and processed tasks
    executed at the edge is (11) (12) With the above process, we consider a task successfully
    processed when the drone or edge computed it within the latency constraint. For
    tasks that computed raw data locally and exited, the latency is (13) where is
    the time the task waits in the local waiting computation queue. For tasks that
    are directly transmitted raw data to the edge server, the latency is (14) where
    is the time the task waits in the transmission process. The task waiting time
    in the edge waiting computation queue is denoted as . For tasks that are executed
    locally and further offloaded to the edge, the latency is (15) Due to the different
    capabilities of the local and edge DNNs, their task inference labels and accuracy
    rates will be different. The local inference label is denoted as . The edge inference
    label is denoted as . We consider the inference valid only if the task is computed
    within the time delay limit. The indicator function for a locally processed image
    in the task can be expressed as (16) The indicator function for an edge processed
    image can be expressed as (17) The edge result is applied when an image has been
    successfully processed both at the local and the edge. The indicator function
    for system inference can be expressed as (18) The inference accuracy of the system
    can be expressed as (19) where is the total number of generated tasks at time
    slot . In the proposed framework, we focus on three sections to take effective
    actions that maximize the system inference accuracy. Local unprocessed task action:
    indicates whether the local unprocessed task should be executed by the local first
    or directly transmitted to the edge at time slot . indicates the unprocessed tasks
    should be computed locally. The task is transmitted to the edge when . Local processed
    task action: shows whether the local processed task should be exited locally or
    transmitted to the edge for further execution. assigns the processed task to be
    exited locally. indicates the processed task should be transmitted to the edge.
    Edge balancing action: denotes whether the uploaded tasks be executed at the original
    edge server or transmitted to the adjacent one. The action space of is the adjacency
    servers of the corresponding server in the adjacency matrix of , where is the
    number of the adjacent servers. The optimization problem is the drone-edge joint
    inference accuracy, which can be expressed as (20) where the constraint indicates
    the action space of unprocessed tasks at drone terminals. The constraint shows
    the action space of processed tasks at drone terminals. The constraint indicates
    the action space of uploaded tasks at aerial computing servers. Problem (20) is
    a nonlinear programming problem. In the following, we proposed a joint drone-edge
    processing framework to provide fast inference for image processing tasks. 4.
    Fast inference framework Tasks with latency constraints are executed by DNNs deployed
    at drone terminals or edge servers. In order to enable fast feedback for low-challenge
    tasks with guaranteed accuracy, we exploit the local computing power. We use radio
    resources to upload tasks to the edge servers for higher overall accuracy. The
    system aims to fully utilize the bandwidth to balance the computing load between
    the drones and edges and maximize the task accuracy under latency constraints.
    The system mainly involves action decisions in three sections: local unprocessed
    task decision, local processed task decision, and server edge balancing decision,
    respectively. Considering local-unprocessed task action assignments, each task
    has its latency constraint, and local computing provides fast feedback. Each drone
    terminal has limited computing capacity and cannot handle all tasks at high loads.
    The lightweight DNN model stored at the drone is less accurate than the advanced
    DNN model at the edge. Once a task is locally executed, we get the confidence
    of the inference result from its entropy. The local computing process consumes
    a certain amount of task latency. Considering the transmission process from drone
    to edge, if the task is not successfully transmitted in the current time slot,
    it will spend more waiting time in the waiting transmission process. For the directly
    uploaded task, no valid inference results fail the system inference execution.
    The transmitted data required for the processed task is less than the unprocessed
    task. Considering edge-processed task action assignments, there are gaps in each
    server’s specific task computing load. The task computation process might exceed
    the latency limit when it executes at the high-load edge server. We investigate
    the drone-edge joint inference framework and find the following observations.
    • When the drone computing capacity, the edge computing capacity, and the wireless
    transmission capacity are all fully sufficient, and there is no latency constraint,
    the best solution will be to transmit all the tasks to the edge server. In this
    case, all tasks will be computed by large-scale neural networks with stronger
    inference capacity to obtain the most accurate results. However, in the practical
    scenario, terminal computing capacity, wireless network resources, and edge computing
    capacity are limited. Therefore, the task assignment corresponds to the task demand
    and system processing capacity. • The inference results are not valid for the
    tasks not successfully processed within the latency requirement, leading to a
    significant decrease in system accuracy. Hence we focus on assigning tasks to
    be processed at least once at the drone terminal or edge server whenever possible.
    • Unprocessed data is assigned a higher priority than processed data. Processed
    data already has a local inference result, while unprocessed data has no valid
    processing result if it times out. In the computation flow, we address the unprocessed
    data before the processed data. • In the task computation flow, tasks are processed
    in the order they are placed in the queue. Since tasks have their latency requirements,
    tasks with urgent demands are ranked ahead in the queue, and tasks with loose
    latency demands are ranked behind in the queue. The upload process consumes a
    certain amount of time. Tasks with tight latency demands are executed locally.
    • When the system has sufficient computing power and finite radio resources, tasks
    with loose latency constraints can be executed locally and transmitted to the
    edge via wireless networks. Firstly, this fully uses the drone terminal’s computing
    power and provides an early exit for the low-challenge task. Secondly, this reduces
    bandwidth consumption during upload and uses edge computing capacity to provide
    more accurate inferences. • Due to the bottleneck design, the amount of data transmitted
    for unprocessed tasks is significantly higher than that for processed tasks. Simply
    offloading unprocessed tasks will waste local computing power, and only a limited
    number of tasks can be transmitted. Offloading only processed tasks bring enormous
    computing pressure on drone terminals. Local unprocessed tasks will keep stacking
    up in the queue, making considerable tasks fail to get valid inference results
    due to timeout. With the above observations, we optimize the system inference
    accuracy by the following policies. We assign the execution actions of the tasks
    according to the task latency, the confidence level of the local execution, the
    computing capacity of the drone terminals and edge servers, and the transmission
    capacity of the wireless network. 4.1. Local processing policy The local processing
    policy determines the actions of processed and unprocessed tasks in each time
    slot for local execution/exit and uploading. The edge servers hold more computation
    capacity and advanced DNNs than the local devices. The system utilizes wireless
    resources to transmit tasks to edge servers. Drone terminals provide local computation
    and early exits for low-challenge and tight-latency tasks. Early exit uses entropy
    to exit high-confidence tasks locally, thus reducing radio resource consumption
    and providing fast feedback. Drone terminals execute loose latency demand tasks
    reducing the intermediate data required for upload. We propose two heuristic algorithms
    based on the observations and illustrate the process on Fig. 3. 4.1.1. Prioritize
    local unprocessed task uploading We transmit the local unprocessed potential upload
    data first, then the local processed potential upload data. The local unprocessed
    data at the current time slot includes new arriving data and unprocessed data
    not uploaded or locally executed successfully in the previous time slot. The local
    computing power provides inference for tasks with tight latency requirements.
    Unprocessed tasks with latency less than enter the local computation queue. Unprocessed
    tasks with a latency greater than and less than enter the local unprocessed potential
    upload queue. For the local processed tasks, we utilize the entropy value as the
    exit threshold by the processing results of DNN inference. Tasks with the inference
    entropy less than early exit. Tasks with latency less than exit locally because
    the remaining latency is insufficient for edge inference after upload. The remaining
    unconfident tasks with a latency greater than form the processed potential upload
    queue. The unprocessed potential upload queue, the processed potential upload
    queue, and unprocessed tasks with a latency greater than together form the pending
    upload queue for the current time slot. According to the drone’s radio resources,
    we arrange the task uploads in different priorities. The tasks in the unprocessed
    potential upload queue have the highest priority. The tasks in the processed potential
    upload queue are uploaded if there are remaining radio resources. If radio resources
    are still left, unprocessed tasks with a latency greater than are uploaded. If
    the radio resources are insufficient, the tasks in the unprocessed potential upload
    queue enter the local waiting computation queue. The task in the processed potential
    upload queue enters the local storage to decide whether to upload or exit at the
    next time slot. Unprocessed tasks with a latency greater than enter the local
    waiting computation queue. We can assign local processing actions based on the
    above process. 4.1.2. Prioritize local processed task uploading We transmit the
    local processed potential upload data first, then the local unprocessed potential
    upload data. Local processed tasks require much less data to upload than unprocessed
    tasks. The inference accuracy of edge DNN is higher than the local inference accuracy.
    Compared to unprocessed tasks, more processed tasks can be transmitted to the
    edge using the same radio resources. In this case, we prioritize uploading tasks
    processed at the drone in the previous time slot to the edge. For local tasks,
    we construct the processed potential upload queue and the unprocessed potential
    upload queue by , and in the same way as previous approach. The tasks in the processed
    potential upload queue have the highest priority. If there are remaining radio
    resources, the tasks in the unprocessed potential upload queue are uploaded. If
    radio resources are still left, unprocessed tasks with a latency greater than
    are assigned to be uploaded. If the radio resources are insufficient, the task
    in the processed potential upload queue enters the local storage waiting for the
    next time slot assignment. The tasks in the unprocessed potential upload queue
    and the unprocessed tasks with a latency greater than enter the local waiting
    computation queue. Based on the above process, we can assign local processing
    actions . With the above two heuristic algorithms, we use local computing power
    to exit low-challenge tasks locally and upload high-challenge tasks from the drone
    to the edge utilizing the wireless network. Download : Download high-res image

    process. 4.2. Edge balance policy In terms of edge balancing, edge servers can
    offload tasks to adjacent servers based on the association in . We design a task
    assignment algorithm based on each server’s waiting computation queue length using
    the inverse of the task amount in the server’s queue. The servers with longer
    waiting computation queues obtain fewer task packages, and those with shorter
    queues are assigned more tasks. This approach avoids excessive processing load
    on a single edge server, leading unprocessed tasks to keep piling up in the waiting
    computation queue, making the task timeout without obtaining valid edge processing
    results. Specifically, assuming the waiting computation queue length of the server
    is . The length of the waiting computation queue for servers adjacent to the server
    is . For the newly uploaded tasks under the server at the current time slot, the
    proportion of tasks obtained by relevant server from server is (21) where and
    are the adjacent servers of server . We assign the task’s action after all the
    servers’ pending numbers have been determined. From the above algorithm, we can
    effectively assign the unbalanced uploaded tasks to the waiting computation queue
    for the corresponding servers. 5. Simulation and numerical results In this section,
    simulation results are provided to evaluate the proposed algorithms [38]. In the
    simulation, multiple drone terminals are supported by aerial computing centers.
    The DNNs based on Branchy structure and ResNet are deployed in drone terminals
    and edge servers. Advanced DNNs deployed at the edge have better inference performers
    than local lightweight DNNs for image processing tasks. DNN models at the edge
    require more computation than drone-stored DNN models. The computation demand
    for the edge model is 0.06 G operations, and the computation demand for local
    models is 0.017 G operations. We train our model with the CIFAR data set, in which
    each image contains 32*32 RGB pixels. We use Pytorch as our deep learning framework
    to build our DNN experimentation platform. For each experiment, we ran 5000 cycles,
    which were used to smooth the curve. The edges and drones are connected through
    the wireless network. The simulation scenario includes 4 edge servers with 12
    drone terminals. The computing capacity of local users is 4.8 GHz, and the computing
    capacity of edge devices is 52 GHz. The aerial computing centers utilize laser
    transmission in a line topology. The transmission delay of laser is neglected
    compared to wireless transmission delay. The transmit power of the drone terminal
    is 1 W. The path loss factor for wireless communication is set to be 3. At the
    beginning of each time slot, each drone terminal collects image data to compose
    task packages. Each user task package generation process follows a Poisson process.
    Each task package contains 5 images. The period for task generation is 0.5 s.
    The latency requirement of the task is between 0.6 s to 1.8 s. The frequency band
    is approaching to 2.5 GHz. We evaluated the system accuracy of different algorithms
    in different scenarios. In the comparison algorithm, we use the All-Local (AL),
    All-Offloading (AO), and Random Selection (RS) algorithms as the drone-side decision
    comparison algorithm. The AL algorithm refers to the policy that sets the actions
    of local unprocessed tasks to 0, leading all tasks to be executed at drone terminals
    and exit locally. The AO algorithm refers to the policy that sets the actions
    of local unprocessed tasks to 1, leading all tasks to be computed at edge servers
    and exit at the edge. The RS algorithm selects the actions for the tasks with
    equal probability. It randomly selects the tasks to be executed locally for unprocessed
    tasks at the drone terminal, and the others are uploaded directly to the edge
    servers. For processed tasks at the drone terminal, it randomly selects tasks
    to exit locally, and the others upload to the edge for further execution. 5.1.
    Available radio resource We investigate the impact of communication transmission
    on drone-edge joint inference by increasing the overall available wireless resources
    of the system in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b). Wireless resources increase proportionally
    to the overall task number, corresponding to the percentage of raw data that each
    drone terminal can upload. All the computations are performed locally in the AL
    policy, and all inferences are exited at drone terminals. Its upload ratio remains
    at 0%. Its accuracy does not vary with the available channel bandwidth. All tasks
    offload to edge in the AO policy. Its upload ratio and accuracy increase nearly
    linearly as the available wireless resources increase. The upload ratio of the
    AO policy outperforms other algorithms with sufficient channels. A high offloading
    ratio does not imply high system inference accuracy because tasks with tight latency
    constraints cannot obtain valid inference results in the AO policy. Tasks are
    randomly assigned in the RS policy to be processed locally, exited locally, or
    uploaded to edge processing. The RS policy does not effectively utilize drone
    computation power and wireless transmission resource. Tasks with tight latency
    requirements may timeout due to inefficient assignment and thus fail to obtain
    valid inference results. The system inference accuracy of the RS policy is lower
    than the AL policy when the available radio resource is insufficient. There is
    no effective exit for tasks with high local inference confidence, and continue
    uploading them to the edge. The wireless transmission and server computing resources
    are wasted on offloading processing tasks for which correct inference results
    have been obtained. Download : Download high-res image (452KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. The system performance under different available radio
    resources. We filter the potential unprocessed data with the appropriate latency
    in the prioritize local unprocessed task uploading (PLUTU). When there is no wireless
    network support, the PLUTU accuracy is the same as the AL policy, and only local
    computing resources can be utilized. When the radio resources increase, the PLUTU
    policy transmits more tasks to the edge, taking advantage of the advanced model
    at the edge to obtain higher accuracy. The upload ratio and accuracy of the PLUTU
    are higher than the RS policy but lower than the prioritize local processed task
    uploading (PLPTU). For the PLPTU policy, we prioritize transmitting local processed
    tasks. Since the processed tasks require fewer transmission data and the wireless
    transmission resources are limited, we can transmit more processed tasks to the
    edge in the PLPTU compared to the PLUTU policy, which uses the edge to compute
    more potentially inaccurate tasks and improve the system’s accuracy. The PLPTU
    policy has the best accuracy when the bandwidth is limited, and as the radio resources
    continue to increase, the accuracy and upload ratio is similar to the PLUTU policy.
    5.2. The rate of task generation Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b) illustrate the upload
    ratio and accuracy of the system with increasing task generation rate under different
    local processing policies. For the AL policy, since it allocates all tasks executed
    locally, all inferences are performed using drone terminals. Its accuracy is constant
    at low task generation rates. When the task generation rate is high, the local
    computing power cannot support the processing of all tasks locally. However, the
    AL policy cannot transmit tasks to edge processing through wireless channels.
    After the full load point, the system accuracy is reduced with the increasing
    task generation rate. There is no efficient use of local computing power under
    the AO policy since it offloads all the tasks to the edge for inference. The system’s
    transmission capacity is fixed in this scenario, and the number of tasks that
    can be transmitted to the edge is fixed. As the task generation rate increases,
    the overall task number increases, and the upload ratio and accuracy decrease.
    The RS policy randomly selects the task assignment. Comparing the RS and AL policies,
    when the task generation rate is less than 38 packages, the situation is similar
    to the latter half in Fig. 4(b). The wireless resources are abundant relative
    to the total number of tasks. The RS policy can get higher system accuracy through
    edge-server-assisted inference. When the task generation rate is greater than
    38 packages and less than 55 packages, the accuracy of the RS policy is lower
    than the AL policy because time-sensitive tasks cannot get valid inference results
    in the RS policy due to latency exceeding, which reduces the system accuracy.
    When the task generation rate exceeds 55 packages, the proportion of tasks that
    the AL policy cannot handle due to the lack of local computing power increases
    rapidly, and the RS policy relieves the computing pressure through the wireless
    network. The system accuracy of the RS policy decreases slower than the AL policy
    at the high task generation rate. Download : Download high-res image (364KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The system performance under different task
    generation rates. For the PLUTU policy, the potential unprocessed data with the
    appropriate latency is highly prioritized on upload transmission. Due to the increased
    tasks and limited channel spectrum, in contrast to PLPTU, it requires more radio
    resources to transmit unprocessed local data, reducing the number of uploaded
    tasks. Its upload ratio and accuracy decrease with the increasing task generation
    rate. For the PLPTU policy, the potential processed data within the latency is
    highly prioritized in upload transmission. When the task load increases, with
    limited radio resources, the PLPTU policy performance better accuracy than the
    PLUTU policy. The confident tasks are exited locally to avoid wasting edge computing
    power for the task already obtained correct results. It makes more efficient use
    of the wireless channel to transmit tasks to the edge, taking advantage of the
    advanced DNN at the edge. As the number of generated tasks increases from 50 packages
    to 65 packages, the PLPTU upload ratio rapidly decreases because it includes more
    processed data in wireless transmission and is more sensitive to system change.
    The PLPTU upload ratio eventually becomes smaller than the RS policy, as with
    the PLUTU and AO policies. The PLPTU policy shows the best accuracy performance,
    and like PLUTU, it transmits mainly unprocessed data after the task generation
    rate reaches 65 packages. 5.3. Drone computing capacity In Fig. 6(a) and Fig.
    6(b), we investigate the impact of local computing capacity on drone-edge joint
    inference by adjusting the drone computing capacity. Drone computing capacity
    is decreased proportionally. The AL policy assigns all tasks executed at the drone.
    Therefore the system accuracy decreases nearly linearly with the decrease in the
    drone computing capacity. The AO policy offloads data to the edge for inference.
    Since the radio resource is fixed here, the AO policy’s upload ratio and accuracy
    do not change with drone computing capacity. The RS policy cannot fully use the
    system resources due to its randomness. The accuracy is lower than the AL policy
    when the drone computing capacity is sufficient. Download : Download high-res
    image (315KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. The system performance
    under different drone computing capacities. For the PLUTU policy, the potential
    unprocessed data has priority over potential processed data in the upload transmission.
    Its upload ratio is lower than the PLPTU at first and decreases rapidly at the
    point of 75%, eventually similar to PLPTU and AO policies. Its system accuracy
    stays at around 79% when the drone computing power is sufficient. When the local
    computing capacity is reduced to 75%, PLUTU system accuracy decreases rapidly
    because the drone computing power and the wireless transmission together cannot
    handle all the tasks. The number of processed potential upload tasks decreases
    as the local computing power decreases. The PLPTU policy contains a higher percentage
    of processed data than the PLUTU policy, leading to a faster drop in upload rate.
    When the drone computing capacity and wireless transmission cannot handle all
    the unprocessed tasks, the task in the local pending queue will stack, and the
    locally processed tasks’ remaining latency gets lower and lower, finally failing
    to generate the tasks that satisfy the potential condition. Therefore, the PLPTU
    and PLUTU policies mainly upload unprocessed tasks when the drone computing capacity
    is insufficient to make the tasks get at least one inference result. Their upload
    ratio is close to the AO policy and lower than the RS policy at low drone computing
    capacity. 6. Conclusion and future work In this paper, we propose a hybrid inference
    framework based on early exit DNN deployment and improve the system’s overall
    inference accuracy by optimizing the task computing assignment of UAVs and aerial
    computing centers. In the proposed framework, tasks with latency constraints can
    be exited locally, offloaded to the edge after local execution, or directly transmitted
    to the edge servers. The decisions sections consist of drone offloading decisions
    and edge balancing decisions. Drone local decisions include the assignment of
    unprocessed tasks and the exit of processed tasks. By utilizing the CIFAR-10 data
    set, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach under a practical
    neural network implementation. The proposed algorithms can efficiently assign
    task computation to obtain high system accuracy under different task loads, radio
    resources, and drone computing capacity conditions. Latency demands for urgent
    tasks are satisfied through the early exit by drone local computing, and accuracy
    demands for challenging tasks are fulfilled through advanced DNNs in edge servers.
    Considering the topological and task load variations due to UAV movements, we
    would include mobility redundancy in future work to investigate further UAV joint
    inference in multi-agent scenarios, which includes UAV trajectory planning and
    dynamic computation offloading. Declaration of competing interest The authors

    network topology; routing transmission algorithm Graphical Abstract 1. Introduction
    In the early stages, agricultural data monitoring relied mainly on manual statistical
    methods and instrument-based monitoring [1]. However, in recent years, various
    information technologies have begun to be applied to the data monitoring of agricultural
    greenhouses [2]. Since agricultural greenhouses usually occupy a large area and
    require many monitoring nodes, and agricultural greenhouses are generally distributed
    in the suburbs [3], this requires high networking performance and the power consumption
    of data collection equipment. ZigBee technology is a wireless two-way communication
    technology based on the IEE802.15.4 protocol standard. It has the characteristics
    of a low frequency band, low power consumption and low cost [4], which can meet
    the needs of agricultural greenhouse monitoring; some scholars have carried out
    research on Zigbee or other types of technology in agricultural greenhouse monitoring
    and achieved some results. Kang BJ and other scholars [5] developed an automated
    system for greenhouses, which stores information on greenhouse temperature, moisture,
    leaf temperature and leaf moisture in a database. The system is designed using
    Zigbee to enable the collection and automated control of plant information within
    the system. T.Veeramani kandasamy and other scholars [6] used GSM and Zigbee to
    build an automatic system for monitoring agricultural water resources and crop
    growth, so as to achieve the purpose of increasing food production. Zhang Hui
    and other scholars [7] proposed a wireless communication data acquisition system
    based on Zigbee and 4G, which meets the short-distance communication and long-distance
    data transmission. Yang Wei and other scholars [8] proposed a wireless-based real-time
    monitoring environment solution in accordance with the environmental monitoring
    requirements. It is designed to monitor environmental parameters using Zigbee.
    Xiao Xiao and other scholars [9] improved the Zigbee routing algorithm according
    to the actual application environment, and optimized the data transmission process
    and node energy usage according to the characteristics of different systems. Li
    Yan and other scholars [10] improved the ZBR routing algorithm and clustered the
    entire network. When the algorithm selects the cluster head, it has various factors
    around the cluster head, the life cycle of cluster head and the remaining energy
    of nodes. Niu Yugang and other scholars [11] addressed the congestion problem
    in the Zigbee network by considering node congestion avoidance and energy consumption
    balance, but the algorithm did not consider the node load and energy issues. Shan
    Chenggang and other scholars [12] designed a multi-path selection algorithm SMSA.
    This algorithm calculates the frequency of data packet collisions in the transmission
    process, and selects the least collisions as the reference target, which can effectively
    reduce the transmission delay, but it also does not consider the remaining energy
    of the nodes in the transmission path. In the above studies, although researchers
    in various countries have conducted extensive research and made some improvements
    to Zigbee routing algorithms, most studies are aimed at general Zigbee algorithm
    improvements or the application of Zigbee in some specific environments, and few
    studies have combined the above two aspects. At the same time, most studies on
    Zigbee are mainly for outdoor crops and there are few studies on greenhouse vegetables.
    Although there are new technologies similar to Zigbee, for example, in May 2015,
    Huawei and Qualcomm jointly researched a solution called NB-CIoT (NarrowBand Cellular
    IoT) [13,14], but since the new technology has only been developed for a few years,
    it is far less mature than Zigbee. Therefore, this research uses Zigbee as the
    research object; a greenhouse monitoring system based on the improved Zigbee algorithm
    is designed, which forms the wireless sensor network through various sensor nodes,
    and improves the network topology and routing algorithm of Zigbee to achieve high-efficiency
    and the low-consumption monitoring of environmental parameters. Compared with
    the previous research, this research innovatively combines the wireless topology
    structure with the improved Zigbee routing algorithm; it not only optimizes Zigbee
    itself, but also optimizes the wireless network composed of Zigbee, and is mainly
    oriented to the vegetable and fruit scenes in greenhouses, making the research
    more realistic. 2. Design and Implementation of the Wireless Sensor Network 2.1.
    Topology Design of the Wireless Sensor Network In this research, the data required
    for crop monitoring were collected using various sensors commonly used in greenhouses
    and Zigbee in battery self-powered mode to form a wireless sensor network [15].
    Due to the large number of Zigbee nodes required in actual production, a good
    network topology is particularly important for the fast communication between
    the network nodes. There are three types of Zigbee networks, namely, star topology,
    tree topology and WMN topology [16]. By comparing the advantages and disadvantages
    of various topologies, this research designed a WMN network topology; it uses
    direct data communication between routers, which can prevent the potential failure
    of the entire network system in the star model in case a problem with the coordinator
    is caused by a single link (Figure 1 shows the Zigbee wireless network topology).
    Figure 1. Zigbee wireless network topology. The coordinator, router, and terminal
    are interconnected in layers, which expand the monitoring area and the establishment
    and later maintenance of the network. The devices communicate with one another
    in the Zigbee wireless network, and their own addresses are unique. According
    to the IEEE802.15.4 standard [17], the address of the devices consists of a 64-bit
    physical address and a 16-bit network address. However, it is worth noting that
    the physical address of all Zigbee devices is standardized at 64 bits, with nothing
    required to be carried out to the physical address or the Zigbee network structure;
    thus, the allocation of the network addresses is indeed crucial in the Zigbee
    network. The distribution of Zigbee network addresses is determined by the relationship
    between parent nodes and child nodes within the network. The parent node in the
    lower layer can establish connections with child nodes. On the other hand, child
    nodes can only connect to the parent nodes in the upper layer. 𝐿 𝑚 , 𝐶 𝑚 and 𝑅
    𝑚 are three essential values in the Zigbee network, which, respectively, represent
    the Zigbee network level, the number of child nodes that can be connected to the
    parent nodes and the number of routers in the network [18,19]. The address interval
    can be calculated. The address interval can be calculated according to Equation
    (1): C𝑠𝑘𝑖𝑝(𝑑)={ 1+ 𝐶 𝑚 ×( 𝐿 𝑚 −𝑑−1)                   𝑅 𝑚 =1 (1+ 𝐶 𝑚 − 𝑅 𝑚 −𝐶
    𝑚 × 𝑅 𝐿 𝑚 −𝑑−1 𝑚 )/(1− 𝑅 𝑚 ) (1) In a Zigbee wireless network, the network topology
    works and the network address of each device can be calculated, as shown in Figure
    2. Figure 2. Network address distribution of each device in the WMN network. Determining
    the network address of each device is of great importance for wireless sensor
    networks. If a single device is abnormal or faulty, the network address can quickly
    determine the faulty node, which can greatly facilitate the operation of wireless
    sensor networks. 2.2. Routing Protocol Design The transmission delay and the successful
    reception rate of data packets in the ZigBee network will be affected by the routing
    protocol to a large extent. In order to make the network more stable, this study
    proposes an improved ZigBee-based routing protocol EMP-ZBR after combining the
    designed WMN network topology, thereby reducing energy loss and relieving network
    congestion. First, the cross-layer mechanism is introduced on the basis of the
    original Zigbee routing protocol, in which the routing layer can obtain the queue
    buffer packets in the MAC (Media Access Control Address) layer and use the length
    of the cache queue in the node to determine the load of the node, defined as the
    queue cache group occupancy, according to the protocol built on an agricultural
    information monitoring system; the energy consumption of the node is determined
    against the total energy in the node and the energy consumed [16], and is defined
    as the energy consumption occupancy ratio. The algorithm description:  𝑄 𝑐𝑟 and
    𝐸 𝑐𝑟   is defined to represent the cache packet occupation ratio and energy consumption
    ratio of the node, respectively. 𝑄 𝑐𝑟 and 𝐸 𝑐𝑟 values are defined as Equations
    (2) and (3): 𝑄 𝑐𝑟 = 𝑄 𝑙𝑒 / 𝑄 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (2) 𝑄 𝑐𝑟 =( 𝐸 𝑖𝑛𝑡 − 𝐸 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡 )/ 𝐸 𝑖𝑛𝑡 (3) Among
    them, 𝑄 𝑙𝑒 represents the length of the cache queue at the moment of the node,
    and 𝑄 𝑚𝑎𝑥 refers to the maximum cache queue length that the node can accommodate.
    𝐸 𝑖𝑛𝑡 represents the total energy of the node at the beginning, 𝐸 𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡   represents
    the remaining energy of the node after working for a period of time and 𝐸 𝑖𝑛𝑡  𝐸
    𝑙𝑒𝑓𝑡 represents the total amount of energy consumed by the node during work. The
    routing update criterion for the Zigbee routing protocol was then improved accordingly.
    In the original Zigbee protocol, the shortest hop count is applied as the routing
    update criterion; while MP-ZBR (Multi-Link Zone Border Router) is the routing
    protocol, the new routing update criterion cost is applied. The value of cost
    will be calculated following certain rules through the energy consumption ratio
    of intermediate nodes, cache packet occupation ratio and link quality. When the
    RREQ (Route Request Packet) packet arrives at the intermediate node [20], the
    𝐸 𝑐𝑟 (the energy consumption ratio in the node), 𝑄 𝑐𝑟 (cache packet occupancy
    ratio) and the link quality LQI value are first calculated. 𝑄 𝑐𝑟   and 𝐸 𝑐𝑟   are
    calculated in Equations (4) and (5). The LQI value can be obtained by calculating
    the received signal strength RSSI value, which is an integer from 0 to 255. The
    larger the LQI value, the better the link quality. The 𝑄 𝑐𝑟 , 𝐸 𝑐𝑟 and LQI values
    are added to 𝑄 𝑐𝑟𝑠𝑢𝑚 (the sum of the node load ratio), 𝑄 𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑢𝑚 (the sum of the
    energy consumption ratio) and L_sum (link quality sum). To unify the rules, the
    L_sum value is defined as the reciprocal of the sum of the actual link quality,
    and the cost value is calculated with the following rules: 𝑄 𝑐𝑟𝑠𝑢𝑚 =∑ 𝑄 𝑐𝑟 (4)
    𝐸 𝑐𝑟𝑠𝑢𝑚 =∑ 𝐸 𝑐𝑟 (5) L_sum=1/∑𝐿𝑄𝐼 (6) cos𝑡=α 𝑄 𝑐𝑟𝑠𝑢𝑚 ℎ𝑜𝑝_𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 +β 𝐸 𝑐𝑟𝑠𝑢𝑚 ℎ𝑜𝑝_𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡
    +λ L_sum ℎ𝑜𝑝_𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 (7) where α, β and λ are the weight value and satisfy α + β
    + λ =1. The greater the weight value, the greater the influence of the node energy
    condition or the node’s buffer queue length and link quality condition on the
    routing update criterion. Since this research studies the impact of congestion
    on the network, after multiple experimental verifications, α the value of α is
    0.4 and the values of β and λ are 0.3. 𝑄 𝑐𝑟𝑠𝑢𝑚 is the sum of the proportions of
    all node cached packets experienced by the RREQ packet from the source node to
    the receiving or forwarding node, and 𝐸 𝑐𝑟𝑠𝑢𝑚 is the sum of the energy consumption
    proportions of all nodes experienced by the RREQ packet from the source node to
    the receiving or forwarding node. Also, L_sum is the sum of the link quality of
    all nodes experienced by the RREQ packet from the source node to the receiving
    or forwarding node, and Hop_count is the total number of hops experienced by the
    RREQ packet from the source node to the receiving or forwarding node [21]. cos𝑡
    is the energy consumption, queue buffer score, and link quality of the RREQ packet
    from the source node to the receiving or forwarding node. The smaller the average
    energy consumption ratio and the average cache packet occupation ratio in the
    path are, the higher the link quality is, and the lower the cos𝑡 value is, indicating
    a better comprehensive performance of the path. At this time, the established
    path will be relatively stable, and can effectively alleviate network congestion.
    Finally, this research improves the path establishment method of the Zigbee routing
    protocol, and finds an effective path for the source node to reach the destination
    node by RREQ packets during the routing discovery process [22]. Upon receipt of
    a RREQ packet, the destination node initiates the cache timer and sends the RREP
    (Residential Real Estate Project) packet back to the source node in the order
    of their arrival [23]. After the first RREP packet hits the source node, the source
    node will cache all the RREP packets that arrived during this period before the
    timer expires, and sorts these packets according to certain priority rules. The
    path with the highest priority is defined as the primary path, and the path with
    the second priority is defined as the backup path. When the main path is successfully
    established, the data are preferentially transmitted to the destination node through
    this path. When the primary path cannot continue to transfer data due to congestion,
    the previously established backup path is selected to successfully transmit the
    data to the destination node. The improved algorithm first compares the comprehensive
    performance index cost value of each feasible path in the path establishment process,
    and selects the path with the lowest cost value as the main path during data transmission
    [24]. As maintaining multiple backup paths would consume more network resources,
    this article will select only one backup path from other paths. Figure 3 shows
    the specific flow of the algorithm. Figure 3. The specific flow of the algorithm.
    3. Experimental Design and Results 3.1. Experimental Design NS2 (Network Simulator
    Version 2) is a professional simulation software specially used for network simulation
    [25]. It has very rich module components, its configuration is flexible and its
    scalability is relatively strong. It is favored by many scholars who study network
    technology. To this end, this research will randomly arrange a large number of
    sensor nodes in a certain area on the NS2 platform, imitating the actual system
    application situation, and set the node energy and packet sending rate in the
    network. Finally, in the same scenario, the proposed EMP-ZBR routing protocol
    and the traditional ZigBee routing protocol are simulated separately, and the
    performance of the two protocols is evaluated in four aspects: packet delivery
    rate, route discovery frequency, route control overhead, and end-to-end average
    delay. 3.2. Experimental Indicators The indicators to measure the performance
    of the Zigbee routing protocol are the end-to-average delay and packet delivery
    rate. This research will use the following four indicators for the comparative
    analysis of the original ZigBee routing protocol and EMP-ZBR routing protocol:
    (1) Packet delivery rate: This indicates the ratio of the number of data packets
    successfully reaching the destination node to the number of data packets sent
    by the source node. The larger the packet delivery rate, the better the reliability
    of the transmitted data [26]. Equation (8) is as follows: 𝑃𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑦 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒=
    𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑠 𝑠𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙𝑦  𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟
    𝑜𝑓 𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑎 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑠 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑏𝑦 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 (8) (2) Route discovery frequency: This
    indicates the number of route requests initiated by the source node within a unit
    time. The higher the frequency, the greater the loss of network resources and
    energy [27]. Equation (9) is as follows: 𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑒 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑦 𝑓𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦= 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙
    𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑠  𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒 (9) (3)
    Routing control overhead: This indicates the ratio of routing control packets
    to received data packets. The more routing control packets, the more energy consumed
    by the network [28]. Equation (10) is as follows: 𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑= 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙
    𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑠 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑑 (10) (4) End-to-end
    average delay: This represents the average time from the source node sending out
    the data packet to the destination node receiving the data packet in the whole
    process [28]. Equation (11) is as follows: 𝐸𝑛𝑑−𝑡𝑜−𝑒𝑛𝑑 𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦= 𝑃𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑑
    𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒−𝑃𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑆𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑠 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑑 (11) 3.3. Experimental
    Environment Settings In this study, in order to better simulate the real scene,
    a simulation area with a length of 10 and width of 30 ft × 90 ft is selected.
    A total of 60 nodes are randomly arranged in it, and 40 nodes are set to be in
    a static state. These node simulation systems have coordinator nodes and sensor
    nodes such as air temperature and moisture, soil temperature and moisture. The
    remaining 20 nodes are set as random mobile nodes. The random movement of nodes
    will make the network topology change more frequently so that the performance
    of the two protocols under different topological conditions can be studied and
    the final simulation results obtained are more authentic. Table 1 shows the simulation
    parameters. Table 1. The simulation parameters. 3.4. Experimental Results 3.4.1.
    Result Analysis under Different Pause Times of Mobile Nodes In this research,
    the CBR sending rate is always three packets/s, and the pause time of the mobile
    node is changed to 0 s, 50 s, 100 s, 150 s, 200 s, 250 s, 300 s, 350 s, 400 s.
    The node pause time will affect the network topology changes. The mobility of
    nodes in the network will weaken with the increase in the pause time, and the
    topology changes will gradually become stable [29]. (1) Packet delivery rate Figure
    4 shows the performance difference of the two routing protocols in the packet
    delivery rate under different mobile node pause times. Under the same circumstances,
    the packet delivery rate of the EMP-ZBR routing protocol is always greater than
    that of the ZigBee routing protocol, which increases the packet delivery rate
    by 1.1% on average, and improves the network congestion to a certain extent [30].
    Figure 4. Result of the packet delivery rate at different pause times. (2) Route
    discovery frequency Figure 5 shows the difference in route discovery frequency
    of the two routing protocols under different mobile node pause times. Under the
    same pause time, the routing discovery frequency of the EMP-ZBR routing protocol
    is significantly lower than that of the ZigBee routing protocol, which slows down
    the routing discovery frequency by 15.2% on average, indicating that EMP-ZBR reduces
    the number of times the source node routing requests are initiated and that the
    network is more stable. Figure 5. Route discovery frequency result with different
    pause times. (3) Routing control overhead Figure 6 shows the relationship between
    the routing control overhead and mobile node pause time. Under the same pause
    time, the EMP-ZBR routing protocol selects nodes with sufficient energy and a
    large remaining queue buffer length to establish paths, and fewer messages are
    used for routing initiation and routing maintenance. Compared with the traditional
    ZigBee protocol, the average reduction of 21% of the routing control overhead
    more effectively alleviates the impact of path congestion and link breaks on the
    network. Figure 6. Routing control overhead results for different pause times.
    (14) End-to-end average delay Figure 7 shows the relationship between the end-to-end
    average delay and mobile node pause time. Under the same pause time, the average
    delay of the EMP-ZBR routing protocol is significantly lower than that of the
    ZigBee routing protocol, and it will not pass through congested nodes during data
    transmission, which reduces the average delay in the network [31]. Compared with
    the traditional ZigBee protocol, the EMP-ZBR routing protocol reduces the end-to-end
    average delay by 8.1 ms on average, which plays a great role in alleviating congestion.
    Figure 7. End-to-end average delay results for different pause times. 3.4.2. Analysis
    of Results at Different Packet Sending Rates In this research, controlling the
    pause time of the mobile node remains unchanged (0 s), changing the CBR sending
    rate to 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24, respectively. It reflects the load level
    of nodes in the network. The faster the packet sending rate, the stronger the
    node load, and the more prone to congestion. (1) Packet delivery rate Figure 8
    shows the variation in the packet delivery rate of the two routing protocols under
    the background of different CBR packet sending rates [32]. As the packet sending
    rate increases, the packet delivery rates of the two routing protocols show a
    downward trend; however, the EMP-ZBR routing protocol always increases the packet
    delivery rate by an average of 9.8% compared to the traditional ZigBee protocol
    because it forwards the information criterion to avoid packet loss caused by some
    nodes due to heavy load, and improves network congestion. Figure 8. Packet delivery
    rate results at different packet sending rates. (2) Route discovery frequency
    Figure 9 shows the performance difference between the two routing protocols in
    route discovery frequency under different CBR sending rates. As the packet sending
    rate of nodes increases, the route discovery frequency of the two routing protocols
    gradually increases. However, the route discovery frequency of the EMP-ZBR routing
    protocol is always lower than that of the ZigBee routing protocol, which slows
    down the route discovery frequency by 19.3% on average [33]; this is because the
    IMP and ZBR routing protocol caches the backup path while establishing the main
    path. It can then use the backup path for data transmission, reducing the number
    of routing initiations, thereby reducing the energy consumption and network load.
    Figure 9. Route discovery frequency results at different packet sending rates.
    (3) Routing control overhead Figure 10 shows the difference in the routing control
    overhead performance of the two routing protocols at different CBR sending rates.
    The EMP-ZBR routing protocol improves the forwarding mechanism of the intermediate
    nodes. When forwarding data packets, it fully considers the energy of the intermediate
    nodes and the remaining status of the cache queue [34]. The frequency of route
    discovery and route maintenance saves the route control overhead; compared with
    the traditional ZigBee protocol, the route control cost is reduced by 15.7% on
    average. Figure 10. Routing control overhead results at different packet sending
    rates. (4) End-to-end average delay Figure 11 shows the differences in the end-to-end
    average delays of the two routing protocols at different CBR sending rates. As
    the CBR packet sending rate increases, the average network delay of the two routing
    protocols increases, but the delay of the EMP-ZBR routing protocol is always lower
    than that of the ZigBee routing protocol, reducing the average end-to-end average
    delay by 121 ms [35]. This is because it selects the effective path with the smallest
    average energy-occupied ratio, the average queue cache packet, and the largest
    link quality, thereby reducing the possibility of congestion. Figure 11. End-to-end
    average delay results of different packet sending rates. 4. Conclusions In this
    research, a wireless sensor network for agricultural greenhouses based on the
    improved Zigbee protocol is designed. This research uses a variety of commonly
    used sensors and Zigbee to form an agricultural greenhouse data acquisition network,
    and improves the topology networking mode and routing algorithm of Zigbee nodes.
    After NS2 simulation experiments, the improved Zigbee sensor network shows lower
    network delay. The average end-to-end delay, high packet delivery rate, small
    routing control overhead and low routing discovery frequency prove that this research
    can effectively improve the network speed and reduce congestion, improving the
    overall performance of the agricultural information monitoring system. In the
    future, we envisage combining the wireless sensor network with 5G technology,
    connecting the 5G router through the Zigbee coordinator, and transmitting the
    collected sensor data to the remote terminal faster. In addition, we envisage
    combining the Zigbee network with the agricultural greenhouse control equipment
    so that the agricultural greenhouse control equipment can perform regular operations
    according to the environmental parameters of the Zigbee sensor network, so as
    to realize automatic production and remote terminal control. Author Contributions

  description: According to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of
    the United Nations (FAO), about a third of all food produced for human consumption
    in the world is lost or wasted—approximately 1.3 billion tons. Among this, the
    amount lost during the storage stage is about 15–20% for vegetables and 10–15%
    for fruits. It is 5–10% for vegetables and fruits during the distribution stage,
    resulting in a large amount of resource waste and economic losses. At the same
    time, the global population affected by hunger has reached 828 million, exceeding
    one-tenth of the total global population. The improvement of the cold chain system
    will effectively reduce the amount of waste and loss of food during the storage
    and transportation stages. Firstly, this paper summarizes the concept and development
    status of traditional preservation technology; environmental parameter sensor
    components related to fruit and vegetable spoilage in the intelligent cold chain
    system; the data transmission and processing technology of the intelligent cold
    chain system, including wireless network communication technology (WI-FI) and
    cellular mobile communication; short-range communication technology, and the low-power,
    wide-area network (LPWAN). The smart cold chain system is regulated and optimized
    through the Internet of Things, blockchain, and digital twin technology to achieve
    the sustainable development of smart agriculture. The deep integration of artificial
    intelligence and traditional preservation technology provides new ideas and solutions
    for the problem of food waste in the world. However, the lack of general standards
    and the high cost of the intelligent cold chain system are obstacles to the development
    of the intelligent cold chain system. Governments and researchers at all levels
    should strive to highly integrate cold chain systems with artificial intelligence
    technology, establish relevant regulations and standards for cold chain technology,
    and actively promote development toward intelligence, standardization, and technology.

    Keywords: cold chain system; food preservation; digital simulation; intelligent
    agriculture 1. Introduction With the improvement of human living standards, people
    gradually begin to value the nutrition, quality, and variety of food. The demand
    for vegetables, fruits, meat, seafood, and other products is increasing, and the
    market prospect is considerable. However, equally, food is at risk of corruption
    and spoilage, which leads to great food waste and economic loss. Food loss is
    “a reduction in the quality of human edible food throughout the supply chain”,
    while food waste is “the loss of food that occurs at the end of the food chain”
    [1]. According to statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
    United Nations, up to 1.6 billion tons of food are wasted globally each year,
    with the edible portion reaching 1.3 billion tons [2,3]. In July 2022, five United
    Nations agencies jointly released the “2022 World Food Security and Nutrition
    Status” report, which stated that the global number of hungry people reached 828
    million, exceeding one-tenth of the global total. About 258 million people in
    58 countries and regions were affected by the severe food crisis, up from 193
    million people in 53 countries and regions in 2021. According to the European
    Union Statistics Office, the average person wasted 127 kg of food in 2020, 70
    kg of which was produced by households. The per capita food waste of households
    is 70 kg, accounting for 55% of the total per capita food waste, and the remaining
    45% is generated at other links of the food supply chain, among which food logistics
    and transportation waste accounts for a large proportion. According to data from
    the Food and Nutrition Development Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture
    and Rural Affairs, the average loss and waste rate of vegetables, fruits, aquatic
    products, grains, meat, milk, and eggs in China is as high as 22.7% each year,
    about 460 million tons, including 300 million tons of food loss in the production
    and circulation process. If the intelligent cold chain system is applied to food
    logistics transportation, it will greatly reduce food loss and waste in the food
    supply chain. According to statistics, there are approximately 1.3 billion tons
    of food waste produced worldwide every year [3]. Figure 1 shows the approximate
    distribution of all kinds of food waste [4], indicating that fruits and vegetables
    account for the largest proportion of food waste each year. This is because fruits
    and vegetables can still breathe after harvest, and unstable and inappropriate
    temperature and humidity increase the biological activity of microorganisms and
    accelerate their growth, leading to the increased spoilage and deterioration of
    food, which not only causes major economic losses and food waste but also increases
    the risk of food problems and foodborne diseases, thereby endangering human health
    [5]. Figure 1. Percentage of different food waste. Secondly, a major reason for
    food spoilage is packaging. Food packaging materials refers to materials such
    as plastic, fiber, glass, etc., used for packaging and holding food. Food packaging
    can prevent food products from leaking or breaking, and protects food from adverse
    effects from the external environment; it can also communicate with consumers
    through text or image information, providing greater convenience for consumers;
    and it can accommodate various sizes and shapes of products, making it easy to
    transport and handle. In addition, it can also have a protective effect, which
    can delay the spoilage of food to a certain extent [6]. Traditional packaging
    is designed to prevent fruit and other foods from being exposed to harmful environments,
    but currently, this is far from enough. With the continuous improvement of people′s
    pursuit of food quality and type, the requirements for food packaging are increasing.
    While achieving the goal of preventing environmental factors from contaminating
    food, it is also necessary to monitor food and keep it fresh at various stages,
    which ensures that the food can maintain the highest quality when it appears in
    front of people. At present, the main preservation technologies for food include
    modified atmosphere preservation, preservative preservation, coating preservation,
    irradiation preservation, etc., which cannot monitor or adjust to environmental
    factors in real time. To improve this situation, researchers have developed intelligent
    cold chain systems and freshness sensors. Freshness sensors can be analyzed according
    to some specific environmental conditions or food indicators so as to achieve
    real-time monitoring of food freshness. On the other hand, researchers have combined
    smart cold chain systems with sensors and response systems to regulate various
    environmental conditions to extend food shelf life. There have been a lot of studies
    on freshness sensors and intelligent cold chain systems in the food industry.
    With the development of Internet of Things technology, many component systems
    are connected to carry out real-time data exchange and processing; optimize food
    quality parameters in the storage and distribution process; respond to environmental
    changes in the cold chain in a timely manner; and reduce losses and waste in each
    supply chain, thus achieving the integrity and precise control of the intelligent
    cold chain system. According to reports, the total demand for cold chain logistics
    in China in 2020 was 265 million tons, a year-on-year increase of 13.69%. Under
    the situation of pandemic prevention and control, the development momentum of
    cold chain logistics in 2021 was strong, with the total market demand exceeding
    270 million tons. Intelligent cold chain systems can provide a suitable temperature
    and humidity for food production, processing, transportation, storage, sales,
    etc., and can effectively inhibit microbial activity and slow down the speed of
    food spoilage, thus reducing the risk of foodborne diseases. The intelligent cold
    chain system has been widely applied in the field of milk and dairy product preservation.
    For example, Zhang et al. [7] used the ISM method to analyze the hierarchical
    relationships between various factors of customers’ satisfaction with dairy products,
    and based on customer orientation, constructed a dairy cold chain logistics system.
    Secondly, in the field of fruits and vegetables, intelligent cold chain systems
    also have a large amount of applications. Su took subtropical fruits and vegetables
    from Guangxi as an example to study cold chain logistics in the context of Big
    data. They affirmed the advantages and importance of intelligent cold chain systems,
    and looked forward to the future development of the cold chain systems from three
    aspects: building a platform, building a new cold chain logistics mode, and strengthening
    management [8]. In the field of meat preservation, Liu used cold fresh lamb Xinjiang
    as an example to study its cold chain transportation monitoring system. They tested
    the freshness indicators of cold fresh lamb, introduced a cold fresh lamb monitoring
    system, and finally conducted a cold chain transportation simulation experiment
    on the cold fresh lamb, which highlighted the huge prospects of the cold chain
    system in meat preservation [9]. In intelligent cold chain systems, the integrity
    and closure of the cold chain should be realized, so as to avoid the large amount
    of food waste and excessive energy consumption. All links of the cold chain should
    be interrelated, and the upstream and downstream links cannot be separated to
    ensure the integrity and the closure of the cold chain. Figure 2 shows a panorama
    of the cold chain logistics industry chain. Figure 2. Panorama of cold chain logistics
    industry chain. Despite the rapid development of technology and its great potential
    in reducing food loss and waste, real-time monitoring technology based on the
    Internet of Things still faces many challenges. For example, there has been much
    research on real-time tracking and monitoring of environmental parameters using
    Internet of Things technology, but there is a lack of comparisons of specific
    environmental parameters of different foods and the selection of specific supply
    chain parameters. Additionally, the relationship between quality changes and environmental
    parameters cannot be established. As for fruits and vegetables, different products
    have different corruption dynamics and different environmental parameters related
    to preservation. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct real-time monitoring of
    various indicators of fruits and vegetables, and select different technologies
    that are based on a large amount of data to regulate different products. This
    paper aims to combine traditional preservation technologies with artificial intelligence
    technologies, so as to develop a form of sustainable smart agriculture and guide
    fruit and vegetable preservation in order to reduce the waste of food resources
    and economic loss. 2. Influencing Factors and Preservation Technology of Fruit
    and Vegetable Shelf Life Fruits and vegetables are essential foods in people′s
    daily life. Fruits and vegetables contain abundant vitamins, plant fiber, iron,
    selenium, and other essential elements to maintain human health. Additionally,
    they are low in calories, which can prevent some diseases such as obesity, hypertension,
    and hyperlipidemia. The rich anti-inflammatory and antioxidant components in fruits
    and vegetables have been proven to prevent depression and anxiety in people, and
    also reduce the risk of several chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2
    diabetes, and certain types of cancer [10,11]. However, fruit and vegetable products
    with high moisture content are extremely susceptible to decay. In order to extend
    their shelf life, we must understand their decay mechanisms and the factors influencing
    their corruption. Among them, there are many factors affecting the corruption
    of fruits and vegetables, mainly including respiration, transpiration, damage
    to appearance, and microbial action. In order to extend the shelf life of fruits
    and vegetables, there are currently many effective preservation methods, including
    low-temperature preservation, modified atmosphere preservation, irradiation preservation,
    degradable film preservation, ozone preservation, etc. 2.1. Low-Temperature Preservation
    Low-temperature preservation technology is common in daily life. By lowering the
    storage temperature, the respiration rate of fruits and vegetables will be reduced.
    At the same time, low temperature will also reduce the metabolic rate and water
    loss rate of fruits and vegetables, leading to a decrease in microbial activity
    and thus affect chemical reactions. Low-temperature preservation technology can
    improve the appearance and quality of fruits and vegetables to a certain extent,
    but if the temperature is too low, it may cause frostbite [12]. Therefore, the
    temperature is generally set at 0.5–1 °C above the temperature of the cold damage
    point of fruits and vegetables, and the relative humidity is kept at about 90–98%.
    Lowering the temperature can ensure that the enzyme activity of fruits and vegetables
    can be reduced without natural chilling injury, and the respiration rate of fruits
    and vegetables during storage can be inhibited so that the fruits and vegetables
    can enter an incomplete dormant state. Moreover, the low-temperature environment
    with high humidity can effectively inhibit the internal water loss of fruits and
    vegetables. Wang et al. found that low-temperature preservation is an effective
    way to maintain the tissue structure of fruit epidermis and pulp. Under low-temperature
    preservation conditions of −1 ℃, 1 μL/L 1-methylcyclopropene treatment can effectively
    inhibit ethylene production and respiratory rate,, inhibit the loss of soluble
    solids in hawthorn fruits, and decrease the quality loss rate and browning rate
    of fruits [13]. Zhao et al. [14] tested the soluble sugar content and metabolic
    level of nectarines at different temperatures to explore the factors affecting
    the shelf life of nectarine fruits. The results showed that fruits stored at near-freezing
    temperature (−1.4 ± 0.1 ℃) (NFT) showed no symptoms of freezing damage, and fruits
    stored at NFT exhibited a longer shelf life than those stored at 0 ℃ and 5 ℃.
    This method has been widely used in fruit and vegetable storage and cold chain
    logistics transportation. It is usually combined with other preservation technologies.
    For example, Wu et al. [15] explored the optimal preservation conditions of lotus
    roots, combined with heat treatment at 65 ℃ for 5 min, and then stored in preservative
    (0.3% CaCl2, 0.25% vitamin C, 0.3% citric acid) at −0.7–0 ℃. This process effectively
    inhibited browning, decay rate, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and sugar loss,
    while maintaining the hardness of lotus roots. Liu et al. [16] compared near-freezing
    point storage of apricot fruits with traditional low-temperature storage, and
    the results showed that near-freezing point storage was an effective method to
    maintain the apricot fruits’ flavor while extending their shelf life. These studies
    indicated that low-temperature storage is a relatively mature preservation technology
    at present, which is often used in combination with other preservation technologies
    to improve the preservation effect. 2.2. Modified Atmosphere Packaging Modified
    atmosphere packaging means that, under certain storage conditions such as humidity
    and temperature, the metabolic rate of fruits and vegetables can be reduced and
    their storage period can be prolonged by regulating the concentrations of CO2
    and O2. MAP (Modified Atmosphere Packaging), which is widely used at present,
    uses composite films to package fruits and vegetables, and establishes specific
    CO2 and O2 concentrations within the packaging of specific fruits and vegetables
    to inhibit the respiration rate of fruits and vegetables, so as to maintain their
    freshness. As a safe, pollution-free, and low-cost preservation technology, modified
    atmosphere packaging can maintain freshness in fruits and vegetables for 5–14
    days, and currently has broad development prospects in China. Xing et al. [17]
    determined the change in quality of sweet cherries by setting the gradient concentration
    of CO2 at 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% (O2 was 5% and the rest was filled with
    N2). The results showed that all the experimental groups had a certain inhibiting
    effect on the deterioration of sweet cherries. In particular, 2% CO2 concentration
    was the most effective in reducing the decay rate, maintaining hardness, and reducing
    the activities of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase. Additionally, they still
    had good hardness, nutritional value, and taste after storage for 10 days. Ali
    et al. [18] found that the use of MAP storage at low-temperature (5 ± 1 ℃) can
    effectively inhibit the activities of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase in litchi,
    delay surface browning, and maintain the good quality. The gas permeability partially
    depends on the thickness of the packaging materials. The decrease in thickness
    can improve the permeability of the film, but its strength will be reduced accordingly,
    which makes it difficult to meet the requirements of commodity storage and transportation
    [19]. Therefore, in order to optimize the technology, researchers have adopted
    microporous modified atmosphere packaging to achieve the coexistence of mechanical
    strength and freshness-maintaining properties. On the basis of effectively preventing
    anaerobic respiration of fresh food and the condensation of water vapor in the
    film, micropores help to regulate the relative contents of CO2 and O2 and the
    relative humidity inside the packaging for specific products [20]. 2.3. Irradiation
    Preservation Irradiation preservation involves directly irradiating fruits and
    vegetables with extremely-short-wavelength high-energy rays (such as γ rays, high-energy
    particle beams, infrared rays, ultraviolet rays, etc.) [21]. This technology can
    not only directly affect the molecular structure of microorganisms and the activities
    of enzymes and proteins in their bodies, inhibiting microbial activity, but can
    also inhibit the respiration rate of fruits and vegetables and prolong their maturity.
    Thus, the storage period of fruits and vegetables is prolonged, and the flavor
    and safety of fruits and vegetables are not affected [22]. Irradiation preservation
    itself belongs to the category of “non-thermal” processing technologies, with
    a good sterilization effect, no chemical residue, simple operation, safety, environmental
    protection, and other advantages. The irradiation effect will be affected by irradiation
    intensity and irradiation time. Ruan et al. used UV irradiation to preserve mangoes,
    and their results showed that UV irradiation significantly prolonged the shelf
    life of mangoes compared with the control group. Maurer et al. irradiated grapes
    with ultraviolet light, and the results showed that compared with the control
    group, the antioxidant oxidase activity, total phenol content, and anthocyanin
    content of grapes irradiated with ultraviolet light were all improved, and the
    quality of samples in the experimental group was higher than that of the control
    group after 5 days of storage [23]. Araque et al. [24] evaluated the effect of
    repeated short dose ultraviolet radiation on strawberry quality. The results showed
    that, compared to traditional single-high-dose pre-storage irradiation, the repeated
    low dose of UV radiation more effectively reduced the changes in strawberry, and
    it further reduced the amount of mold and yeast to a greater extent. However,
    when using irradiation preservation technology to preserve fruits and vegetables,
    it is necessary to consider the potential threat of this technology to human health.
    For example, when irradiating foods using γ rays, it is necessary to design thick
    walls for the site to prevent radiation leakage. During the processing, it is
    also necessary to consider the hazards of the radiation to which workers are directly
    exposed. Although irradiation preservation technology has been proven to have
    no negative impact on food quality or human health within the dose range, consumers’
    acceptance of irradiated food is relatively low [25]. According to EU regulations,
    any irradiated food must be clearly labeled as “irradiated” or “treated with ionizing
    radiation”, making it easy for consumers to see clearly and be fully aware of
    the food they purchase. 2.4. Nanotechnology Preservation Nanotechnology preservation
    has long-term sterilization and preservative abilities. It works by filling nanoscale
    antibacterial agents into the packaging material. Commonly used antibacterial
    agents include nano-Ag, nano-ZnO, nano-TiO2, etc. They have antibacterial and
    antiviral properties, have low oxygen permeability, act as a barrier to carbon
    dioxide, and have other characteristics, so they play an indispensable role in
    fruit and vegetable preservation. However, some nanoparticles will remain in the
    human body, posing a potential threat to human health. Guan et al.[26] combined
    CuO nanoparticles and ZnO nanoparticles into sodium alginate chitosan using the
    layer-by-layer method to prepare a double-layer film with antibacterial properties.
    The research results showed that the films had good mechanical, barrier, optical,
    and biodegradable properties. They had excellent antibacterial ability against
    Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Duan et al. [27] prepared a composite
    film containing konjac glucomannan (Konjac Glucoman-KGM), k-carrageenan, and TiO2
    nanoparticles and tested its preservation effect on strawberries, and the results
    showed that the film showed good photocatalytic antifungal activities, which could
    effectively prolong the storage time of strawberries. Table 1 shows the application
    of nano-antibacterial agents under the current preservation technology in food
    preservation. Table 1. Application of nano antibacterial agents in food preservation.
    However, this technology may leak Ag+, Ti2+, etc. into the fruits, vegetables,
    and external environment, which is controversial for human health and environmental
    safety. Therefore, although nanotechnology is a new and effective preservation
    technology, the safety evaluation and the development of pollution-free nanomaterials
    still needs to be further studied and perfected. 2.5. Other Preservation Technologies
    Ozone treatment has also been used for fruit and vegetable preservation in recent
    years. Its principle is that, when oxygen is exposed to ultraviolet radiation,
    it will split into a single oxygen or primary oxygen, then react with oxygen and
    generate ozone. Through the strong oxidation of ozone, it can be used for sterilization,
    disinfection, deodorization, and preservation in cold storage. This technology
    takes advantage of the instability of ozone itself, and it is more beneficial
    to apply it to assist preservation in cold storage, because the final product
    of its decomposition is oxygen, which will not leave any harmful residue on fruits
    and vegetables. Ozone has three mechanisms of action in cold storage: one is killing
    microorganisms, disinfection, and sterilization; the second is to remove organic
    smells through inorganic oxidation deodorization; thirdly, the products of metabolism
    are oxidized, thus inhibiting the metabolic process. This method also plays an
    important role in the field of quality preservation and maintaining freshness.
    Ozone preservation can prolong the shelf life of fruits and vegetables by 3–10
    times. Ozone has been recognized as a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) substance
    by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This technology was also
    combined with irradiation preservation to test its preservation effect on cabbage,
    and it was found that it could effectively extend the preservation period of cabbage
    without causing any damage to it [42]. Biodegradable film preservation refers
    to the use of biodegradable polymer materials to make films for the preservation
    of fruits and vegetables. The materials can degrade quickly in the natural environment
    without causing pollution to the environment. This method is worth popularizing
    and applying on a large scale in today′s increasingly severe environmental situation.
    The representative degradable materials are polylactic acid (PLA), polybutylene
    terephthalate (PBAT), polybutylene succinate (PBS), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), gelatin,
    and other materials. This technology can also be combined with modified atmosphere
    packaging technology, which not only increases the preservation effect, but also
    allows the packaging substrate to naturally degrade. This method reduces the environmental
    pressure, and has broad development prospects. 3. Intelligent Cold Chain System
    The intelligent cold chain systems ensure food quality and safety through the
    comprehensive real-time monitoring of food status in the food supply chain. The
    systems organically combine the sensors with Internet of Things technology. The
    sensors monitor the temperature, humidity, and the operating state of refrigeration
    equipment in the area where the food is located in real time. The data are transmitted
    to the data processing module in real time by using wireless communication technology.
    After processing and analyzing the data, the data are transmitted to the server
    and client. The server can conduct early warning and regulations according to
    the data analysis results, and the client can conduct real-time queries of food
    logistics information, food status, and food history information. To achieve the
    integrity of cold chain systems, the sensors and their data transmission are indispensable
    [43,44]. 3.1. Freshness Sensor Figure 3 shows the types of fruit and vegetable
    freshness sensors classified according to different environmental parameters.
    Figure 3. Freshness sensor classification. At present, the commonly used sensors
    in cold chain systems include temperature sensors, humidity sensors, time–temperature
    sensors, and sensors based on radio frequency identification (RFID). 3.1.1. Temperature
    Sensor In the transportation process of fruits and vegetables, if the temperature
    is too high, the freshness of fruits and vegetables will change rapidly. Temperature
    fluctuations will lead to the phenomenon of water condensation in the environment
    where fruits and vegetables exist. The water condensation will promote the growth
    of fungi, bacteria and other microorganisms, also accelerating the corruption
    of fruits and vegetables. Secondly, water condensation may also fog the outer
    packaging of fruits and vegetables, which could affect consumers′ purchasing decisions.
    In cold chain logistics, the temperature sensors will carry out real-time monitoring
    of the environmental parameters around the area where the fruits and vegetables
    are, and regulate the temperature when it exceeds the threshold. For example,
    Zhang et al. [45] firstly developed a dual-mode freshness sensor that monitors
    both ammonia and temperature to monitor seafood freshness. The results indicated
    that the prepared ammonia vapor detection gas sensor exhibits highly recognizable
    fluorescence color changes, and the color changes from white to yellow as the
    storage temperature increases under natural light. Zhu et al. [46] monitored related
    indexes of fresh garlic quality such as temperature, relative humidity, gas composition,
    and ethylene through an information acquisition system based on wireless sensor
    networks. The results showed that the visualization of environmental parameter
    data enhanced the real-time perception of fresh garlics’ storage quality from
    producers to consumers, as well as the transparency of the supply processes and
    the level of cold chain management. De Oliveira et al. studied the effects of
    temperature and relative humidity on grape shelf life during transportation in
    cold chain trucks. Through multi-location and multi-sensor monitoring, it was
    verified that grapes of the same batch would have different qualities. Therefore,
    the principle of “first expired, first out” rather than “first in, first out”
    should be adopted as far as possible in the subsequent warehousing and discharging
    process [47]. 3.1.2. Humidity Sensor Environmental humidity is also an important
    parameter that needs to be monitored. At present, capacitive sensors are widely
    used in humidity monitoring, which use the change in capacitance to monitor the
    change in humidity. The sensors consist of two parallel metal plates filled with
    a dielectric material between them, and the two parallel plates are connected
    to the voltmeter. When the humidity in the environment changes, the dielectric
    constant of the dielectric material between parallel plates changes, which causes
    the capacitance between parallel plates to change, resulting in a detectable voltage
    difference. The relative humidity in the environment is determined according to
    the following formula [48]: 𝐶= 𝑘 𝜀 0 𝐴 𝑑 (1) where C is the capacitance, A is
    the area of the parallel electrode plate, 𝜀 0 is the vacuum dielectric constant
    (8.85 × 10−12 F/m), d is the distance between the two plates, and k is the dielectric
    constant of the dielectric material between the two plates [48]. 𝑉= 𝑄 𝐶 (2) where
    V is the voltage, Q is the amount of charge on the plate, and C is the capacitance.
    When the ambient humidity changes, the capacitance of the humidity sensors changes
    accordingly, that is, when the relative humidity increases, the humidity sensitive
    capacitance increases, and vice versa. The conversion circuit of the sensors converts
    the change in humidity sensitive capacitance into a change in voltage, corresponding
    to the change in relative humidity between 0 and 100% RH, and the output of the
    sensor is a linear variation of 0–1 V. For example, Pereria et al. [49] monitored
    changes in relative humidity of packaged foods which was packaged with a gelatin-based
    nano-ZnO composite film. The dielectric properties depend on moisture content,
    and the nano-ZnO layer acts as a semiconductor that provides a detectable signal
    based on the N-type semiconductor properties. The results indicated that the impedance
    of the composite film decreases with an increase in relative humidity, and it
    has different electrical responses in environments with different relative humidity.
    As the relative humidity values change from low to high, the film exhibits a rapid
    electrical response and good stability. In addition, the accuracy of the sensors
    are also determined by relative humidity, such as ±2% RH in the medium and low
    humidity range (0–80% RH) and ±4% RH in the high humidity range (80–100% RH).
    Relative humidity is a function of temperature, which will have a serious impact
    on the relative humidity in the space. If the temperature varies by 0.1 ℃, the
    error of humidity change generates 0.5% RH. If the space cannot achieve constant
    temperature, it is difficult to obtain a highly accurate humidity measurement.
    Because the humidity will change with the change in temperature, the premise of
    humidity control is to control the temperature. Integrated temperature and humidity
    sensors are often used in daily life rather than humidity sensors. For example,
    Liu et al. [50] used multi-sensor technology (MST) to monitor the temperature,
    relative humidity, oxygen concentration (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), ethylene (C2H4),
    and other parameters in the cold chain logistics of Korla fragrant pear so as
    to evaluate the cold chain logistics system. The experimental results indicate
    that the MST technology can improve the precision of sensors’ data acquisition.
    By analyzing various parameter data, Liu et al. found that the preservation quality
    of Korla fragrant pear can be effectively improved. In most cases, if there is
    no precise means of temperature control available or if the space being measured
    is unsealed, an accuracy of ±5% RH is sufficient. For the cold chain systems which
    require accurate control of constant temperature and humidity, it is necessary
    to track and record humidity changes at any time. Generally, humidity sensors
    with an accuracy of ±3% RH or higher are selected. 3.1.3. Time–Temperature Sensor
    The time–temperature sensors are designed according to certain time and temperature
    conditions and can record the change in time and temperature. The working principle
    is based on the different reactions of two or more substances during the process
    of time and temperature change, resulting in irreversible discoloration of the
    indicator [51]. This is represented by Arrhenius’s formula in physical chemistry:
    𝑘=𝐴 𝑒 − 𝐸 𝑎 /𝑅𝑇 (3) The chemical reaction rate constant k in the solution increases
    with the increase in temperature. When the space temperature exceeds the threshold,
    a chemical reaction takes place and is ultimately manifested by the color or state
    of the solution. At present, the more common time–temperature sensors can be roughly
    divided into two types. The first is the solution diffusion type: its working
    principle is based on Brownian motion, and the substance diffusion speed increases
    with the increase in temperature. The other is the pH discoloration reaction type,
    which can be divided into polymerization reaction type and enzyme reaction type.
    Temperature change leads to polymerization reactions and enzyme-catalyzed reactions,
    and the pH indicators undergo color changes. Regardless of the principle, the
    monitoring parameters of the time–temperature sensors are basically the same,
    and include the two parameters of time and temperature. The setting of threshold
    temperature should take into account the specific corruption mechanism of different
    fruits and vegetables. Currently, time–temperature sensors are more likely to
    be used in smart food packaging systems, allowing consumers to identify product
    quality more quickly and more accurately. For example, Choi et al. designed a
    time–temperature indicator (TTI) based on a self-healing nanofiber pad that is
    intelligent, damage-resistant, and sensitive. Due to light scattering induced
    by nanofibers, the mat is opaque during refrigeration, but self-healing-induced
    interfiber fusion is prone to occur at room temperature, thus making the mat irreversibly
    transparent and providing early warning and reporting, effectively ensuring the
    continuity of refrigeration in the food supply chains [52]. Wang et al. prepared
    photoluminescent chemical TTI using the principle of heat-induced fading in the
    reverse reaction of photoluminescent compounds. The reaction rate and fading degree
    change with the accumulation of time and temperature, which can directly indicate
    the change in food shelf life [53]. Yamamoto and Isshiki developed a time–temperature
    sensor based on the Maillard reaction for food temperature monitoring, and the
    color of the sensor changes with time and temperature. The results showed that
    the device is helpful to monitor and warn of the growth of microorganisms in chicken
    [54]. 3.1.4. Sensors Based on Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID)
    Radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors. The RFID tag is an automatic identification
    technology that allows non-contact bidirectional radio frequency (RF) data communication.
    It can read and write to the recording medium (electronic tag or RF card), so
    it can identify targets and exchange data. RFID tags were originally designed
    to replace optical bar codes to achieve traceability of products in the food supply
    chains [48]. RFID tags can record the whole fruit and vegetable supply chain throughout
    the entire process, and also monitor multiple products and types of information,
    including various environmental parameters in the supply chains, product sources,
    and other information [55]. RFID tags are classified into passive tags and active
    tags. The main difference between the two types of tag is whether they have an
    internal power source; passive tags have no internal power source and rely on
    electromagnetic energy to function, while active tags have a power chip inside
    that can be self-powered, with which they can be traced. However, compared to
    passive tags, the high cost of active tags is currently a major issue that limits
    their large-scale application. Another major drawback of RFID tags is their readability
    when surrounded by products with high metal or moisture content, as well as the
    limitations in real-time data collection during transportation. At present, researchers
    are trying to combine RFID tags with Internet of Things technology to carry out
    real-time monitoring of perishable foods such as fruits, vegetables, and meat
    during the process of production, processing, transportation, and storage, so
    as to ensure that the food remains fresh when presented to consumers. By combining
    it with wireless communication technology, real-time data collection and recording
    can be realized. These systems require RFID tags with antennas and RFID scanners.
    RFID tags use wireless communication technology to transmit information and data
    about products to the central network through antennas and scanners for data storage
    and processing. In addition, RFID scanners can read multiple tags simultaneously
    and support single piece and batch scanning. For example, Alfian et al. [56] not
    only reduced the corruption of meat during transportation, but also achieved the
    traceability, information recording, and the information inquiry for meat in whole
    supply chains and prevented the circulation of fake and shoddy products in the
    supply chains. Wu et al. proposed a cold chain system that integrates the Internet,
    radio frequency identification (RFID), and General Packet Wireless Service (GPRS)
    technologies to monitor and manage cold chain vehicles. The results showed that
    the RFID-based system had advantages, such as no human involvement, no visual
    tag reading, fast data exchange, and higher resistance to humidity and environmental
    conditions. Bhadra et al. used a wireless sensor to detect fish rot. The resonant
    frequency of the sensor varied with the total volatile alkali nitrogen content
    (TVB-N) in the top space of tilapia packaging. Tilapia was tested at 24 ℃ and
    4 ℃, and the results showed that the sensor could effectively identify microbial
    information in tilapia at 24 ℃ and 4 ℃ storage conditions, indicating the potential
    of the sensor in real-time monitoring of fish spoilage [57]. Although RFID tags
    can monitor the environmental information and product information in cold chain
    systems, they cannot monitor the biochemical reactions involved in the process
    of food corruption, nor can they accurately monitor the change in food quality.
    Other food freshness sensors could be used to monitor food temperature, relative
    humidity, light, pressure, pH value, etc., combined with the environmental information
    monitored by RFID tags. Real-time monitoring of food quality and real-time prediction
    of remaining shelf life can be realized to provide important support for consumers′
    purchase decisions [58]. In addition, the production cost of RFID tags is relatively
    high, which limits their application in fruit and vegetable products, and there
    is no unified international standard for the use of RFID tags. Therefore, reducing
    the production cost of RFID tags in the future is another direction we should
    explore. 3.2. Data Transmission and Processing Technology To achieve the intelligence
    of the cold chain systems, the transmission and processing of data are very crucial.
    This requires the network layer to transmit and process the data in real time.
    Sensor devices adjust the relevant parameters of the cold chain systems by transmitting
    the collected data in real time to the network layer for analysis and processing,
    in order to achieve the optimal preservation effect. 3.2.1. Wi-Fi and Cellular
    Mobile Communication The transmission distance of Wi-Fi can reach 100 m and the
    cost is relatively low. However, Wi-Fi is easily interfered with by other devices
    using the same frequency band during its use, so the service quality of Wi-Fi
    is contingent to a certain extent [59]. However, the data transmission speed of
    Wi-Fi is much faster than that of other short-range communication technologies,
    and as a result, many devices in current cold chain systems use Wi-Fi connections
    [60]. In recent years, researchers have found that, while Wi-Fi has the advantage
    of high data transmission rate, it also has the disadvantage of high power consumption,
    which is not conducive to directly connecting to sensor devices that rely on battery
    power. Moreover, sensor devices are only used for environmental parameter monitoring
    and do not need high data transmission rates. Cellular communication technology’s
    high data transmission rate and high power consumption are similar to those of
    Wi-Fi communication, but it can support long-distance data transmission, which
    is an advantage over Wi-Fi connections [61]. At present, the rise of 5G technology
    provides great development prospects for the connection of equipment in the cold
    chain systems, and the goal of mass data transmission and low energy consumption
    may be realized by using 5G technology [59]. 3.2.2. Short-Range Communication
    Technology Short-range communication technologies include near-field communication
    (NFC), radio frequency identification (RFID), Zigbee, and Bluetooth technologies.
    Their typical travel distances range from a few centimeters to a few hundred centimeters
    [62]. NFC uses a frequency band of 13.56 MHz, and the transmission distance is
    as short as 10 cm [63]. At present, almost all mobile phones have the function
    of reading NFC, so the prominent advantage of this technology is its low cost
    and easy integration [64]. The data transmission range of Zigbee and Bluetooth
    is not very different, reaching around 100 m [64], and their cost and power consumption
    are relatively low. The difference between the two is that Zigbee is preferred
    over Bluetooth when a large number of sensor devices need to be connected [65],
    but Bluetooth is superior to Zigbee in energy efficiency [63]. For RFID technology,
    passive tags have the advantages of low cost and low power consumption, and the
    data transmission distance is about 10 m, while active tags have stronger signals
    and a larger range, and the transmission distance can reach 100 m [66]. At present,
    the ability of RFID tags to withstand harsh conditions and be installed quickly
    has attracted the attention of researchers, who combine short-range with other
    wireless communication technologies to overcome the disadvantages of short transmission
    distances. 3.2.3. Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) The low-power wide-area
    network is a network layer technology of the Internet of Things (IOT), which has
    appeared in recent years to meet the requirements of long-distance and low-power
    communication. It is characterized by a long transmission distance, generally
    more than 5 km. The low node power consumption, simple network structure, and
    low operation and maintenance cost are also advantages of LPWAN. The emergence
    of low-power wide-area network technology has laid the foundation for the larger-scale
    development of the Internet of Things. Lora, Weightless, 802.11 ah, and NB-IoT
    are all types of low-power wide-area network technologies. LoRa uses unauthorized
    frequency bands, while NB-IoT uses authorized frequency bands, which makes the
    service quality of NB-IoT better than LoRa because it has no duty cycle constraints
    [61,67]. The main advantages of LoRa are its low cost of connecting terminal equipment
    and no operational cost of data transmission [68]. However, in practical application,
    the selection of specific technology also needs to consider specific products,
    the amount of equipment, transmission distance, coverage range, and so on. 4.
    Application of Traceability Systems 4.1. Traceability Based on Internet of Things
    Technology The continuous development of Internet of Things technology has made
    it widely used in transportation, medical, security, and other fields. In the
    intelligent cold chain system, the Internet of Things technology combines freshness
    sensors, GPS (Global Positioning System) and wireless communication to achieve
    real-time monitoring of the entire cold chains. As shown in Figure 4, when the
    temperature of the refrigerated vehicle exceeds the set range, the temperature
    warning system will be triggered and send a signal to the refrigeration system,
    which will adjust the temperature and maintain the ambient temperature within
    an appropriate range [69]. The information collection methods of traditional cold
    chain systems mainly rely on manual recording or barcode scanning. The collection,
    transmission, processing, and sharing ability of the whole chain information are
    relatively poor, which means that they cannot respond to changes in environmental
    factors such as temperature and humidity in a timely manner during the distribution
    and transportation process [70]. The application of the Internet of Things technology
    in the cold chain system improves the intelligence of the cold chain system, enables
    real-time monitoring, tracking, and management of the whole chain, and greatly
    improves the integrity, transparency, security, and traceability of the cold chain
    systems. Mejjaouli et al. utilized RFID, temperature, humidity, and other sensors
    combined with GPS devices to conduct real-time monitoring of perishable food (meat
    and meat products). The sensor equipment sensed changes in external environmental
    conditions and monitored perishable food in real time through a wireless sensor
    network. If the food quality changes, the transportation route can be changed
    or the food can be sold nearby according to the actual quality and requirements,
    so as to reduce the economic losses caused by food decay [71]. Similarly, this
    method also has a wide application prospect in fruit and vegetable transportation.
    On the basis of ensuring the quality of fruits and vegetables and reducing their
    loss and waste, it can also reduce the need for manual participation and improve
    the overall integrity and intelligence of the cold chain system. Figure 4. Example
    of IoT application. RFID, GPS, wireless communication, and other IOT sensing devices
    carry out real-time monitoring of the entire cold chain system and transmit various
    parameter data such as product information and environmental factors in real time.
    This enables real-time information sharing between cold chain nodes, and provides
    corresponding decision support for manufacturers, operators, regulators, and consumers.
    Additionally, this technology solves some problems in the cold chain system, such
    as information lag and temperature overruns that affect the efficiency and integrity
    of the cold chain to a certain extent, and effectively guarantees the quality
    and safety of transportation products. However, at the same time, the system has
    high configuration costs and high energy consumption, greatly increasing the cost
    of the cold chain system, prolonging the economic return cycle of enterprises,
    and reducing the economic efficiency of related enterprises. This is also the
    main reason for the low utilization of IOT technology in the food supply chains.
    Currently, researchers are improving the manufacturing process of sensors to reduce
    the cost of individual sensing devices, or improving information sensing technologies
    and optimizing supply chain systems to reduce the number of sensor devices used,
    thereby solving the problem of high cost in cold chain systems. For example, Fang
    et al. optimized and upgraded RFID tags. They allowed for simultaneous monitoring
    of product inventory, environmental temperature, ambient humidity, and other parameters,
    and effectively improved the efficiency of RFID tags in the cold chain system
    and reduced the number of RFID tags used, thus reducing the cost of the cold chain
    system [72]. In addition, the cold chain system also integrates a large amount
    of private information, which may cause significant losses to stakeholders if
    lost or stolen. Therefore, ensuring the privacy and security of the cold chain
    systems’ data is another focus in current and future research. 4.2. Traceability
    Based on Blockchain Technology Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology.
    Due to its unique intelligent contract and consensus mechanism, blockchain has
    the characteristics of decentralization, low cost, high efficiency, traceability,
    security, and reliability. Blockchain technology can guarantee the integrity,
    transparency, and security of all transactions and data [73,74]. Blockchain technology
    supports the distributed consensus mechanism, which means creating immutable transaction
    records in the public ledger, allowing all participants to know every event and
    transaction, thereby establishing the trust relationship between entities [74].
    Blockchain technology was first applied to bitcoin encryption to maintain transactions
    and avoid double expenditure, then gradually expanded to finance, securities,
    insurance, food, and other fields [75]. When the cold chain systems use RFID tags,
    GPS, and wireless communication technology to monitor the chain, although they
    can provide valuable information for real-time monitoring and traceability of
    food quality, the client–server mode of the system has problems with centralization
    and tamperability of data. Additionally, the accuracy and security of the data
    cannot be guaranteed. These adversely affect the supervision of cold chain systems
    and food quality and safety, which significantly increases the demand of producers,
    operators, regulators, and consumers for food traceability and safety [76,77].
    In addition to ensuring the quality of food, blockchain technology can also ensure
    the validity and authenticity of data. When the product information, real-time
    location, ambient temperature, environmental humidity, and other parameters of
    each link of the cold chains are added to the blockchain systems, they will be
    permanently stored and cannot be tampered with. For example, Azzi et al. [74]
    utilized the unique smart contract and consensus mechanism of blockchain to integrate
    the intelligent cold chain systems with blockchain technology, thereby improving
    the security and reliability of data at all stages of the chain. Blockchain technology
    connects all participants throughout the whole industrial chain from the origin
    to consumers, breaks the information barriers between all links, which achieves
    high-speed data transmission through the Internet. Additionally, it ensures the
    authenticity and effectiveness of data through smart contract technology and consensus
    mechanisms. It puts forward effective strategies to solve problems, such as privacy
    protection, data falsification, and information tampering [78]. Producers, operators,
    regulators, and consumers can obtain food information in real time through data
    query, which greatly improves the traceability and safety of cold chain products.
    Torky et al. [79] used RFID, WSN, near-field communication, compressed sensing,
    and other information technologies to collect and transmit food-related information,
    and verified the acquired data through blockchain to ensure the accuracy and integrity
    of data collection. Although the tamper-resistant feature of blockchain ensures
    data security in the cold chain system, the system has poor fault tolerance and
    requires an accurate data input system [78]. As for the food preservation cold
    chain systems, the life cycle of food is long, the chain from the origin to the
    consumer is too long, the information varies greatly, and the scene is complex,
    so it is difficult to express the situation in code, and there are contradictions
    and conflicts between the data privacy and transparency in the blockchain system.
    Therefore, the government and relevant regulatory agencies should formulate different
    standards and agreements for different products, and develop corresponding laws
    and regulations so as to ensure the minimum business standards, the rationality
    and security of data disclosure, which could reduce the information asymmetry
    between the two sides of the transaction, and improve the work efficiency of the
    supply chain [80]. Powell et al. developed the Beef Ledger platform, which combines
    blockchain technology with Internet of Things technology to store and encrypt
    data across the entire beef supply chain. Staff from producers to consumers can
    query historical beef data through the platform, but the data cannot be tampered
    with, which ensures the authenticity and traceability of data [81]. 4.3. Traceability
    Based on Digital Twinning Technology In order to improve and optimize the efficiency
    of intelligent cold chain systems and minimize the impact of the cold chain environment
    on food quality, it is necessary to strictly analyze the corruption mechanism
    of food and the change in environmental parameters throughout the process of food
    production and circulation. This means that different food categories require
    different regulation of environmental parameters. In practical life, testing different
    food groups may cause a waste of resources and energy. Through digital twin technology,
    researchers can effectively realize efficient digital modeling and the simulation
    of cold chain systems, establish a virtual cold chain, and then conduct digital
    simulation and analysis of the food corruption mechanism. By combining the life
    cycle of food with the virtual cold chains for comprehensive evaluation, the cold
    chain systems can be optimized under the premise of effectively reducing energy
    consumption. This method can reduce food consumption, and the storage and transportation
    efficiency of the supply chain can be improved with this method [82,83,84]. Digital
    twin technology is an innovative technology derived from the concept of simulation.
    It realizes real-time mapping, interaction, integration, and data fusion between
    a physical entity and digital models by virtualizing and digitizing the physical
    entity and establishing mathematical models related to it. The real-time monitoring,
    diagnosis and prediction of a physical entities’ state can be realized through
    the technologies of situation simulation, actual testing, and data processing,
    so as to regulate and optimize the entities [82,84]. Digital twin technology organically
    combines physical entities with a virtual model, simulates the whole process of
    the physical entities through sensor equipment, and returns data to the central
    server for storage and processing. On this basis, the whole processes of physical
    entities are regulated and optimized. Researchers have applied it to intelligent
    cold chain systems by establishing a virtual cold chain to simulate and regulate
    the whole cold chain logistics systems of fruits, vegetables, and meat products,
    so as to solve the problems of the high cost of cold chain systems and unstable
    product quality. For example, Agalianos et al. established a virtual model of
    meat products through computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and simulated its supply
    chain entity before practical application so as to optimize and regulate its industrial
    processes [85]. Coimbra et al. adopted digital twining technology based on CFD
    to digitize the broiler carcass precooling process, which could effectively predict
    the temperature distribution inside the carcass, so as to optimize the precooling
    condition configuration, improve the precooling efficiency, shorten the precooling
    time, and reduce energy consumption [86]. Merai et al. utilized CFD to model and
    simulate the cooling process of a pork carcass to explore the internal temperature
    distribution. The results showed that properly raising the initial temperature
    of pork carcass during transportation can shorten the entire precooling time in
    the cold chain system by nearly 10 h, which can reduce the energy consumption
    and cost of precooling, and realize the optimization and regulation of the meat
    supply chain [87]. Wu et al. combined the life cycle assessment with the virtual
    cold chain. They established a virtual cold chain and used computational fluid
    dynamics (CFD) to track and monitor the thermal history and mass attenuation of
    the citrus cooling process in the entire cold chain system. Then, they evaluated
    the citrus quality related to the cooling process and provided information on
    the temperature-dependence of citrus quality evolution. This paper explored the
    changing relationship between air vent design and citrus quality, and contributed
    new strategies and ideas for the combination of whole life cycle evaluation and
    virtual cold chain, which is conducive to the selection of the optimal scheme
    for citrus cold chain logistics. In addition, it is helpful for the regulation
    and optimization of logistics energy consumption in the cold chain [88]. As a
    fruit with a short shelf life, strawberries are easily affected by mechanical
    damage, microbial decay, and water loss, and thus decrease in value, resulting
    in a certain amount of waste and economic losses. As a result, strawberries require
    very strict temperature management. With proper temperature control, microbial
    activity, water loss, and strawberry respiration processes can be reduced. Nalbandi
    et al. used experimental and modeling methods to design new packaging and cooling
    systems for strawberry precooling. The CFD model was used to visualize the airflow
    path and distribution in depth, thus achieving faster and more uniform cooling
    of strawberries [89]. Han et al. simulated the heat and mass transfer characteristics
    of fresh tomatoes by establishing a computational fluid dynamics model. In doing
    so, they dynamically predicted the spatio-temporal distribution of temperature
    and water content of packaged tomatoes in the whole cold chain, and quantitatively
    evaluated the cold chain break (CCB) parameters (such as temperature, relative
    humidity, effect of airflow rate, and duration) on temperature fluctuations and
    tomato mass loss. Research has shown that reducing the temperature of CCB and
    increasing the relative humidity are the best methods to reduce the temperature
    fluctuation and water loss of tomatoes under the CCB scenario, followed by reducing
    the duration of CCB and airflow rate [90]. Mukama et al. used CFD simulation to
    improve the vent design of the existing commercial carton of pomegranates, and
    reconstructed the vent of the carton, minimizing the airflow path obstruction,
    which significantly improved the cooling rate and cooling uniformity [91]. Hoang
    et al. modeled the temperature distribution of chickens in the precooling process
    through CFD and explored the influencing factors of various parameters in the
    precooling process on chicken quality so as to achieve the regulation of the precooling
    process [92]. Verboven et al. pointed out that, in the context of industrial digitization
    and the emergence of the Internet of Things, multi-scale, multi-phase, and multi-physical
    field-coupled models based on CFD digital twinning technology improve the process
    and design of the food supply chain, rather than being limited to a specific part
    or scale of the process. Through the simulation of the whole food supply chain,
    the exploration of food corruption mechanisms, the optimization of the food supply
    chain, and the improvement of cold chain logistics, food quality and shelf life
    are maximized, energy utilization efficiency is enhanced, and economic losses
    are reduced [82]. Therefore, cold chain models based on digital twinning technology
    enable researchers to carry out complex conceptual designs and analyses of the
    whole food supply chain, so as to regulate and optimize each link. This technology
    saves the experiment time and cost, and has important practical significance for
    improving food quality control efficiency and cold chain system optimization [93].
    Table 2 shows the application of a smart cold chain. Table 2. Application of a
    smart cold chain. 5. Outlook and Challenges The intelligent cold chain systems
    connect regulators, producers, and consumers, provide them with dynamic environmental
    parameter control, fault warning, real-time information sharing, real-time display
    of food quality and shelf life, real-time traceability of product locations, and
    other information throughout the supply chain. Therefore, China attaches great
    importance to the development of intelligent cold chain systems and has introduced
    relevant policies to support their development, so as to improve the efficiency
    and benefit of the industry. In 2020, a document issued by the Central Committee
    said that China should increase the construction of cold chain system modernization
    and intelligent system construction, and accelerate the construction of modern
    cold chain system industrial parks. Other countries have also introduced relevant
    policies to vigorously develop the cold chain industry. However, there is still
    a lack of standards regarding cold chains throughout the world, and the globalization
    of cold chain system standards still has a long way to go. The rapid development
    of Internet of Things technologies has facilitated wireless real-time environmental
    parameter monitoring in the supply chain of fresh fruits and vegetables. This
    increases the possibility of reducing the amount of product lost and wasted in
    the supply chain. Monitoring systems based on the Internet of Things can be used
    to gain insight into current product status, perform weakness analysis on parameter
    profiles, and strengthen process control. The interruption of any link in the
    intelligent cold chain system (such as temperature interruption) will accelerate
    the deterioration of food and shorten the shelf life of food. At present, the
    intelligent cold chain systems have problems such as poor stability, high error
    rate, poor dynamic perception of product quality, slow cold chain data transmission
    and processing speed, and lacking the unified management standards and laws and
    regulations. The rapid development of the Internet of Things effectively improves
    the real-time monitoring efficiency of parameters such as environmental temperature
    and humidity in the intelligent cold chain system of fruits and vegetables. Moreover,
    it can analyze the weakness of the parameter configuration file and strengthen
    the process control, which greatly improves the reduction of food loss and waste
    in each link. In addition, the combination of Internet of Things technology and
    digital simulation helps to optimize the parameters of storage and logistics chains
    [99]. For example, the goal of reducing product waste and loss can be achieved
    by applying FEFO (first past expiration, first out) rather than the traditional
    FIFO (first in, first out) principle in smart warehousing [100]. Multiple sensor
    devices, data compatibility, interoperability, and the standards related to data
    formats, data exchange, and technical equipment are major challenges for IoT-based
    systems [101]. The existence of blockchain technology solves these problems. Through
    untampered and shared data, participants use consistent standards to realize information
    sharing and traceability among multiple devices, increase the collaboration among
    participants of all links, and improve the overall efficiency of the cold chain
    system [102,103,104,105]. With the continuous development and deep integration
    of computer technology and artificial intelligence, intelligent cold chain systems
    are becoming more digital, intelligent, and efficient, which is also the main
    direction of innovation and optimization of intelligent cold chain systems in
    the future [106]. Secondly, while developing the intelligent cold chain system,
    researchers should update the components of the intelligent cold chain systems.
    While improving the performance, they should reduce the cost of the components,
    and actively promote the large-scale application of the cold chain system across
    the country. 6. Conclusions This article provides a comprehensive overview of
    the research status, shortcomings, future trends, and challenges of cold chain
    systems from the perspectives of traditional preservation technologies, intelligent
    cold chain system components, and system regulation and optimization. This is
    meaningful for improving the efficiency of the cold chain system, improving the
    integrity of the cold chain system, ensuring product quality and safety, and reducing
    food waste and loss. The rapid development of computer technology provides new
    ideas and innovation points for the preservation of fruits and vegetables. At
    present, there are supply chains for specific fruits and vegetables, but the combination
    of cold chain systems and communication technologies lacks simulation for general
    fruits and vegetables, and also lacks specific standards. In the future, the degree
    of integration of cold chain systems and artificial intelligence should be increased
    to promote cold chain systems towards the direction of low energy consumption,
    low cost, high preservation, and high intelligence. At the same time, governments
    at all levels should formulate corresponding unified standards, and producers
    and operators at all levels should strictly implement and abide by rules. This
    can establish a truly transparent cold chain system with consumers, establish
    trust relationships between entities, which can improve the efficiency of existing
    cold chain systems, and truly achieve resource-saving and sustainable smart agriculture.

    African AgricultureSensorsSustainability 1. Introduction The Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations reported that the world’s population would
    reach over 9 billion by 2050. This growth will primarily happen in Africa and
    Asia, with many food insecure people but dwindling natural resources, including
    water and land (Hall, 2017). To further complicate this, the rapidly changing
    climate adds pressure and increases the vulnerability of economically disadvantaged
    people in Africa and Asia. Africa''s population will reach nearly 2.5 billion
    by 2050 (Dadush et al., 2017). Despite being rich in natural resources, approximately
    346 million people in Africa are affected by food crises (Kemmerling et al., 2023).
    The lack of enough food is due to low agricultural productivity and yield levels.
    Some African countries, for example, Rwanda, have made considerable progress in
    increasing productivity and reducing hunger, malnutrition, and poverty (Garcia,
    2023). However, continued population growth, urbanization, and changing diets
    are putting pressure on food systems to provide more food and make diverse and
    nutritious foods available and accessible. African agricultural productivity,
    which is now far from its peak, has the potential for a drastic increase. Agriculture
    remains the dominant sector in Africa, contributing mainly to the continent''s
    economy, employing most of the population, and accounting for 15% of the gross
    domestic product in sub-Saharan Africa (OECD, FAO, 2016). Agriculture also interacts
    with many other relevant enterprises and sectors, such as energy. Africa''s agriculture
    has, over time, improved and expanded in scale, speed, and productivity through
    the use of advanced machinery, leading to more efficient cultivation of more land
    and food production. However, to avoid continued mass hunger and attain food security,
    farm productivity in Africa must take a significant turn in large-scale farming.
    This would require significant labor force, time, and cost to implement. Productive
    large-scale farming systems call for digitalization and smart agriculture. Digitalization
    of agriculture is simply leveraging digital tools to enhance agricultural processes,
    which is suggested to be the pathway to a transformational future for smallholder
    farming and livelihoods (Tsan et al., 2019). The broader concept of digitalization
    is that it is a potential game changer. Building climate resilience for smallholder
    farmers to boost productivity; improve access to finance to increase profitability
    along the value chain; and addressing social inclusion gaps for youth, women,
    and other marginalized groups are some of the areas that digitalization can be
    effectively deployed in building sustainable and efficient food systems. The objective
    of this study is to examine the role of digitalization as a potential game changer
    and an impetus for a transformational future for large-scale and smallholder farming
    and livelihoods through driving technological and methodological innovation and
    automation in Africa. A perspective on the potential benefits of digitalizing
    African Agriculture as well as systems and tools for digitalizing (including Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms and models, sensing technologies,
    and data from stakeholders and big data analytics) are presented. Challenges to
    digitalizing African agriculture, current adoption and its barriers, and replacement
    and maintenance are also addressed. With the advancement in digital technologies
    and rapid population growth, Africa has enormous potential to transform its agriculture
    and drive economic growth. The changing climate and the coronavirus disease 2019
    pandemic have worsened agricultural challenges confronting African countries,
    making the agricultural sector even more critical in ensuring food security and
    creating new jobs. 2. Why digitalize African Agriculture? Potential benefits Digitalization
    has been described as a transformative and disruptive innovation in agriculture,
    and its adoption in Africa would result in numerous cross-cutting effects and
    benefits (Andreoni, et al., 2021, Raheem et al., 2019, Balogun, 2022). The ongoing
    evolution of the global agriculture sector justifies the inclusion and adaption
    of the most recent digital technologies (Raheem et al., 2019, López-Morales et
    al., 2020). The automated use of high-throughput phenotyping using sensors and
    other on-farm technologies, for example, has created a flood of interpretable
    and crucial big data in developed countries, prompting a fusion of the agricultural
    and animal sciences with data science. Using digitalized tools and models to manage,
    record, and analyze data and generate knowledge revolutionizes modernized agriculture.
    Modernized. Agriculture in Africa has much to gain from the quick spread of digital
    and automated technologies. Digitalization of agriculture, or the use of digital
    tools to improve agricultural operations, has the potential to alter smallholder
    farming and livelihoods in Africa (Fig. 1). These services range from providing
    modest guidance to smallholder farmers via mobile phones to high-end usage of
    drones and satellites for precision agriculture management on farms. Because of
    their capacity to increase efficiency and give users access to essential resources
    and services, these technologies are capable of enhancing the quality of life
    in rural areas (Balogun, 2022). Download : Download high-res image (274KB) Download

    digitalization. The adoption of information and communication technology (ICT)
    is a necessary condition for modern agriculture. Farm management information systems,
    soil and moisture sensors, accelerometers, wireless sensor networks, cameras,
    drones, and inexpensive satellites are just a few examples of ICT. The adoption
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) will introduce a wide range of digitalized instruments
    and systems into the agricultural sector. Using IoT significantly impacts agriculture
    because sensors can continuously measure various quantities. By utilizing cloud
    computing power, it is possible to develop models to assess processes like crop
    development and soil resources, water management for precision irrigation, livestock
    well-being trait prediction, and automated phenotyping technologies to support
    the decision-making process and automation in precision agriculture (Atzori et
    al., 2010). Such models can assess for example, soil properties and their dynamics,
    evapotranspiration, or even water demands in paddy areas. They can also monitor
    spatiotemporal variables and evaluate evapotranspiration. When data from a crop
    is collected by IoT sensors and combined with data from other IoT devices, including
    drones and remote sensing equipment, it is feasible to correlate a wide range
    of characteristics that aid in a more comprehensive understanding of the crop
    and a more effective method of approaching the crop growth dynamics (Monteleone,
    2022). The IoT sensing technologies make room for innovative ways to better manage
    the rapidly dwindling natural resources in the continent, such as water for irrigation,
    control pests and disease, monitor the spatial variation of crop condition and
    yield, and effectively manage livestock breeding and well-being through improved
    monitoring. The agricultural industry in Africa must adapt to new technologies
    and materials, such as smartphones, computers, robots, and drones. The same goes
    for using digital systems like the internet, artificial intelligence, big data,
    and cloud computing to develop new services and solutions to problems faced by
    farmers, such as connections to wholesalers and distributors of inputs, shared
    economies for mechanization, pay-as-you-go irrigation, and digital connections
    to both inputs and markets. The emergence of new equipment and services would
    alter the agricultural future on the continent. For example, mobile-based price
    notifications may mean that farmers would need to adjust when and where they sell
    their products. Smallholders may no longer physically transport their produce
    to markets due to the advent of digital marketplaces and connectivity, instead
    relying on platforms, system connections, and purchasing outlets in communities
    (Balogun, 2022). The introduction of digitally enabling input connections also
    allows farmers to access mechanization using applications on their smartphones
    without owning such equipment. Implementing such services necessitates the availability
    and accessibility of the resources that make them possible, such as digital and
    social infrastructures. Most digital systems are data-driven and are embedded
    with internal memory that would accumulate data over time. This big multimodal
    data could be further used in several aspects, including policy formulation, improved
    smart decision-making from event patterns, and needed requirements and interventions
    for farmers. Smart decision-making supported by digital devices ultimately improves
    farm yields. Other potential benefits are given below. • Strengthening food security
    on the continent and globally through productivity increases • Productivity increases
    leading to economic benefits • Prevention of pre-and post-harvest losses and mitigating
    agricultural risks • Provision of data-based and real-time management and optimization
    of agricultural systems • Enabling data-driven policies, management, diagnosis,
    interventions, and decision-making • Creation of new jobs, thereby attracting
    youth to agriculture and reducing migration from rural to urban areas • Improvement
    in environmental stewardship • Prediction of future outcomes to provide farmers
    with early warning systems that would promote resilience 3. Principles of systems
    and tools for Digitalizing African Agriculture Digital agriculture involves the
    use of software and hardware, which includes large data sources in conjunction
    with advanced biological systems and environmental analytical tools to help farmers
    adopt the right management practices at the right locations, times, and rates
    to achieve both economic and environmental targets. Digital tools help to better
    monitor agricultural production by collecting and analyzing data on farming conditions,
    pest and disease threats, rainfall, and best crop and livestock management practices.
    From sensing technologies that provide agricultural monitoring to the enormous
    data derived from such surveillance and the models and algorithms trained and
    developed with the pool of data, digitalized systems and associated tools will
    be instrumental in transforming agricultural practices in Africa to be more sustainable
    and efficient. The systems and tools and their applications are addressed below.
    3.1. Sensing technologies Digitalizing African agriculture can significantly benefit
    from the integration of various sensing technologies. These technologies can provide
    real-time data and insights to farmers and enable them to make informed decisions
    to optimize their agricultural practices. In African agriculture, several sensing
    technologies are currently being used to improve farming practices and enhance
    productivity. These technologies vary in their adoption and availability across
    different regions and farming systems (Ly, 2021, Owino, 2023, Raj, 2021, Lee,
    2005). These include weather stations equipped with sensors for measuring temperature,
    humidity, rainfall, and wind speed (Misbah, 2022, Forkuor, 2015, Chivasa et al.,
    2017). These are widely used in agriculture on the continent and provide essential
    weather data that helps farmers make informed decisions about planting, irrigation,
    and crop management. Soil moisture sensors are increasingly being adopted in Africa
    to monitor soil moisture levels. These sensors assist farmers in optimizing irrigation
    schedules, preventing waterlogging, and ensuring efficient water use in crop production.
    Mobile weather applications and SMS-based weather advisory services are popular
    tools used by farmers to receive weather forecasts and updates. These applications
    help farmers plan their activities, make informed decisions, and mitigate risks
    associated with extreme weather events. Satellite imagery, such as that provided
    by platforms like Google Earth and drones equipped with sensors and cameras, are
    increasingly utilized to monitor crop growth, detect vegetation stress, and estimate
    crop yield potential. This remote sensing technology aids in precision agriculture
    and enables farmers to target interventions in specific areas of their fields.
    Drones are increasingly being used in African agriculture and provide opportunities
    to capture better high-resolution images than satellite images. Drones are particularly
    beneficial in large-scale farming operations and remote areas (Forkuor, 2015,
    Onyango, 2021). It''s important to note that the adoption and usage of sensing
    technologies may vary depending on infrastructure, affordability, technological
    literacy, and local agricultural practices. Efforts are being made to promote
    the accessibility and affordability of these technologies in African agriculture
    to enhance productivity and sustainable farming practices. There are still many
    sensors that would provide more opportunities to improve the productivity of agriculture
    on the continent that still need to be added to the content. Sensing technologies
    that can contribute to the digitalization of agriculture in Africa include the
    following: i. Crop Health Sensors: Sensors designed to assess crop health can
    provide valuable information on plant stress, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies.
    These sensors can detect early signs of plant health issues, enabling farmers
    to take prompt action, prevent crop loss, and optimize the use of pesticides and
    fertilizers. Airborne multispectral and hyperspectral sensors have been used to
    monitor crop conditions and yield because they provide a finer spatial resolution
    and real-time monitoring capacity. It has been demonstrated that aerial imaging
    is just as functional as high-resolution satellite imagery for tracking spatial
    variations in crop conditions and production (Hudak and Wessman, 1998). Crop condition
    data might be quickly extracted from remotely sensed pictures acquired during
    the growing season for management purposes. Additionally, yield maps created using
    these data might be utilized separately or in combination with harvester-generated
    yield maps. High spatial resolution satellite photography can analyze fertilizer
    applications and offer information on crop and soil conditions for management
    adjustments. ii. Livestock Tracking Sensors: Precision livestock farming, which
    employs methods to track the health of animals in real-time, spot warning signs,
    and boost productivity, help in the improvement of animal well-being and overall
    productivity (Džermeikaitė et al., 2023). Animal behavior is the most used indicator
    for animal well-being because it is affected by diseases, emotions, and environmental
    conditions, all of which can potentially affect physiological responses. Microphone
    systems, cameras, accelerometers, and other sensors are commonly used to detect
    behavioral changes. Sensors and tracking devices can monitor livestock health,
    behavior, and location. This information helps farmers optimize feeding regimes,
    detect illness or distress, prevent livestock theft, and improve overall animal
    management practices. Sensors for IoT devices leverage variable physical quantities
    such as temperature, sound, and humidity as a means of sensing factors which help
    reduce the cost of repetitively checking each animal. iii. Water Quality and Moisture
    Sensors: Water management is already complex in sub-Saharan Africa, where groundwater
    sources are used for irrigation, and precipitation only meets a portion of the
    total crop evapotranspiration requirements (Ashton and Turton, 2009, Braune and
    Xu, 2010). Water quality sensors are essential for monitoring the quality of water
    sources used for irrigation, livestock watering, and aquaculture. These sensors
    measure parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and
    turbidity to help provide insights into water suitability and identify potential
    contamination risks. Moisture sensors are used to measure the moisture content
    in the soil, which is vital for efficient irrigation management and plant health.
    These sensors provide real-time information on soil moisture levels, enabling
    precise and targeted irrigation practices. This can help the continent inefficient
    water management practices, improved crop productivity, and better environmental
    stewardship. iv. Pest Detection Sensors: Some sensors are equipped with image
    recognition and machine learning capabilities (Wang, 2019) that can detect and
    identify pests and diseases affecting crops. Others include insect traps equipped
    with sensors that attract and capture specific pests, acoustic sensors that can
    detect and analyze the sounds or vibrations produced by pests, and biological
    sensors that utilize biological indicators or organisms to detect the presence
    of pests. These sensors can help farmers take timely actions to control outbreaks,
    reduce crop losses, and minimize the use of chemical pesticides. v. Nutrient Monitoring
    Sensors: Nutrient monitoring sensors (Kashyap and Kumar, 2021) can measure nutrient
    levels in water or soil, allowing farmers to optimize fertilizer application and
    ensure proper nutrient management. These sensors are often integrated into data
    logging systems or connected to remote monitoring platforms. These systems collect
    and store the sensor data, allowing for analysis, visualization, and interpretation
    of nutrient levels over time. These sensors enable precise and targeted fertilization,
    minimizing environmental impacts and reducing input costs. Integrating these sensing
    technologies in African agriculture can lead to improved productivity, resource
    use efficiency, and sustainability. However, it is essential to consider affordability,
    accessibility, and local contextualization when implementing these technologies
    to ensure their practicality and effectiveness in the African agricultural landscape.
    3.2. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms and models Machine
    learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence, offers enormous potential
    to address many difficulties in developing knowledge-based farming systems (Benos,
    2021, Kreuzberger et al., 2023, Parmar, 2023, Uyeh, 2019, Uyeh et al., 2022, Gorczyca
    and Gebremedhin, 2020). In general, ML algorithms aim to maximize performance
    by taking advantage of prior knowledge. Machine learning algorithms can reconstruct
    knowledge architecture and reveal effective relationships between data inputs.
    The higher the quality and quantity of data, the better the performance of an
    ML algorithm. Machine learning algorithms have had applications in agriculture,
    including identification of crop diseases and weeds, crop recognition, making
    yield predictions, and monitoring animal well-being (Benos, 2021, Liakos, 2018,
    Sharma, 2020, Mekonnen, 2019). The identification of crop diseases usually requires
    deep technical expertise and field scouting based on visual assessment, which
    takes time. A sizable dataset of photos of healthy and diseased plants is required
    necessary for precise image classifiers for disease identification. Such automated
    procedures can be paired with autonomous vehicles in the context of large-scale
    cultivations to detect phytopathological issues through routine inspections. The
    zones on the farm where the infection has spread can also be shown on spatial
    distribution maps of the plant disease. With recent technological advancements,
    commercially available sensing systems can identify unhealthy plants before the
    symptoms appear. However, there is substantial unexplored potential for using
    AI and ML to promote African agriculture (Ly, 2021, Gwagwa, 2021). Weeds typically
    develop and spread invasively across huge field areas quickly because of their
    prolific seed production and lifespan, competing with crops for resources like
    space, sunlight, nutrients, and water availability. Intensive use of herbicides
    is expensive and bad for the environment, especially if applied uniformly without
    considering the spatial distribution of the weed. A contemporary method uses unmanned,
    satellite, aerial, and ground vehicles with sensors mounted for remote or proximate
    sensing (both ground (UGV) and aerial (UAV)) (Benos, 2021, Pajares, 2015, Bhardwaj,
    2016). Machine learning algorithms combined with imaging technologies or non-imaging
    spectroscopy can enable real-time weed differentiation and localization, allowing
    for the precise application of herbicides to specific zones rather than the entire
    spraying fields. Crop recognition has received considerable attention in several
    scientific fields, including plant taxonomy, botanical gardens, and the discovery
    of new species (Raja, 2019, Stankiewicz, 2006, AlShahrani, et al., 2018). Analyzing
    numerous elements of the crop, such as leaves, stems, fruits, flowers, roots,
    and seeds, enables the identification and classification of different plant species.
    The most popular method of identifying plants is based on the features of individual
    leaves, such as color, shape, and texture. Crop classification by remote sensing
    has grown in popularity due to the increased usage of satellites and other aerial
    vehicles to detect attributes. Crop quality significantly impacts the market and
    is influenced by soil and climate conditions, cultivation practices, and crop
    characteristics. Combining ML algorithms with imaging technologies can yield promising
    results. One of the most significant and complex subjects in agriculture is yield
    prediction (Oikonomidis et al., 2023, Vaishnnave and Manivannan, 2022). It requires
    a basic understanding of the connection between interacting elements and yield.
    Discovering these relationships necessitates extensive datasets and powerful algorithms.
    These datasets are currently lacking in Africa. Better soil management is very
    important to crop yield because of problems like soil erosion, soil nutrient imbalance
    brought on by excessive fertilizer use, and land degradation (loss of biological
    productivity). Conventional soil assessment techniques are expensive, time-consuming,
    and laborious. Remote sensing and mapping sensors can offer a simple and low-cost
    approach to investigate soil spatial variability, while ML methods can be used
    to complete the task reliably and affordably. Animal production has historically
    adopted various models to raise and feed animals as efficiently as possible. However,
    the large amounts of data involved necessitate machine learning techniques. Machine
    learning algorithms have become essential to modern livestock farming to capitalize
    on large amounts of data to improve production efficiency. Models can be developed
    to define how a biological system works by relying on causal relationships and
    utilizing this awareness to generate predictions and recommendations. Applications
    explored in African agriculture include crop diseases and yield predictions and
    credit risk evaluation (Mupangwa, 2020, Aworka, 2022, Mhlanga, 2021, Belhadi,
    2021). For example, researchers at Penn State University and the International
    Institute of Tropical Agriculture (Leonelli, 2022) trained an AI algorithm using
    200,000 images of sick cassava stalks captured with cameras, spectrophotometers,
    and drones at cassava field sites in western Kenya and coastal Tanzania. The AI
    algorithm automatically classifies five cassava diseases, has been modified into
    a smartphone app using TensorFlow, and is field-tested in Tanzania. Machine learning
    algorithms were used to predict maize yield in Southern and Eastern Africa, while
    ML was used to assess the behavior of consumers to analyze credit risk. Despite
    the remarkable progress, there is a massive gap with other important food security
    crops. 3.3. Data from stakeholders and big data analytics The application of big
    data in agriculture is based on using the information to produce food sustainably
    while meeting the nutritional needs of a growing global population. In some sectors
    of the livestock industry, such as the milk recording sector, big data has been
    used to describe large data gathered by automated or high-throughput systems for
    more than 40 years (Koltes, 2019). This started in developed countries and has
    great potential for expansion in Africa. An in-depth literature search revealed
    the absence of big data in African agriculture for meaningful analysis and use.
    Small farm owners are the primary stakeholder groups in Africa for generating
    big data. When analyzed and layered together with all sourced data within the
    repository of assembled data, big data may help agriculture stakeholders make
    better decisions across the entire agricultural production space. Increased demand
    by stakeholders for sustainable practices would result in increased efforts to
    monitor environmental parameters (soil, air, and water quality). 3.4. Smartphone
    technologies Smartphones offer a powerful tool for farmers to access information,
    services, and digital platforms to enhance their decision-making and productivity.
    For example, mobile phone applications and services provide farmers with nearly
    accurate and timely weather forecasts. By knowing upcoming weather patterns, farmers
    can plan activities, such as planting, irrigation, and crop protection measures,
    and thereby, effectively adapt to changing weather conditions. Various mobile
    applications and platforms also provide farmers with crop management information
    and advisory services. These services offer guidance on optimal planting dates,
    crop nutrition, pest and disease management, and other agronomic practices tailored
    to specific crops and regions. Digital extension services, where farmers can receive
    expert advice, training, and support on agricultural best practices, can also
    be accessed using smartphones. Training materials are usually available in text,
    image, audio, and video formats. These services help improve farmers'' knowledge
    and skills and enhance their productivity. Mobile phone software applications
    and platforms facilitate direct market linkages between farmers and buyers. Farmers
    can showcase their products, negotiate prices, and arrange logistics for selling
    their products through e-commerce platforms or social media networks, thereby
    reducing or eliminating intermediaries, and improving market access. The use of
    smartphones among African farmers has gained significant momentum in recent years
    (Sidibé, 2021, Hartmann et al., 2021). Farmers in Africa can adopt digitalization
    with their smartphones by leveraging mobile applications to access information,
    manage their farms, and access markets, credit facilities, and digital payment
    systems. More details are given below. i. Monitoring and Data Collection: Smartphones
    can be used for on-field data collection, including monitoring crop growth, pest
    infestations, and soil conditions. Mobile phone software applications and tools
    can enable farmers to record and analyze data, thereby providing insights for
    decision-making and supporting precision agriculture practices. ii. Farmer Networking
    and Knowledge Sharing: Mobile phone applications and internet platforms connect
    farmers, allowing them to network, share experiences, and learn from one another.
    Internet communities and forums enable knowledge sharing, promoting peer-to-peer
    learning and fostering collaboration among farmers. iii. Digital Payment Solutions:
    Mobile money services facilitate secure and convenient digital payments for agricultural
    transactions. Farmers can receive payments for their products directly into their
    mobile wallets, reducing the risks associated with handling cash and improving
    financial inclusion. iv. Access to Training and Education: Smartphones can provide
    access to extension services and internet-based training courses, educational
    materials, and videos. Farmers can upgrade their skills, learn about new technologies,
    and access agricultural resources through e-learning platforms, enhancing their
    capacity and knowledge base. 4. Challenges to digitalizing African agriculture
    and food value chain The major causes for the lack of implementation of agricultural
    innovations in Africa are systemic. These include scarce funding, underdeveloped
    infrastructure, relatively low technological know-how, lack of contextual relevance,
    data management and privacy, policy and weak regulatory environment, and limited
    information about new technologies (Ogunniyi, 2017). Many farmers in Africa need
    access to essential technologies such as smartphones, computers, and internet
    connectivity. However, high hardware, software, and data services costs can hinder
    the adoption of digital technologies and limit their potential impacts. Lack of
    familiarity with digital tools and platforms, as well as insufficient training
    and support can impede the effective use of technology in agriculture.Therefore
    digital literacy and technical skills among farmers and other actors in the agricultural
    value chain is needed. Inadequate infrastructure, including limited electricity
    supply and poor internet connectivity, poses significant challenges to the digitalization
    of agriculture. With reliable electricity supply, farmers can access and utilize
    digital tools and platforms more effectively. In general, limited access to technology
    hinders the adoption of digital tools and platforms, preventing farmers from benefiting
    from digital solutions. Many existing digital solutions need to be designed with
    the specific needs and contexts of African farmers in mind. Solutions developed
    for other regions may need to adequately address the challenges and constraints
    faced by African farmers so as not to limit their usefulness and adoption. Interoperability
    may be a challenge when importing or developing solutions, as the fragmentation
    of digital solutions and incompatibility among different platforms and technologies
    pose challenges to integration and seamless data exchange. Ensuring compatibility
    and interoperability among various digital tools is crucial for maximizing their
    potential impact. Effective digitalization relies on data collection, sharing,
    and analysis. However, data ownership, privacy, and security concerns can inhibit
    farmers’ willingness to share their data. Addressing data management and privacy
    concerns is crucial for building trust and encouraging data-driven agriculture.
    The general lack of standardization and governance related to agricultural data
    (Kamilaris et al., 2017) is also a barrier that needs to be addressed. Inconsistent
    policies and regulatory frameworks related to technology adoption, data management,
    and digital platforms can hinder the digitalization of agriculture. Clear and
    supportive policies are necessary to encourage investment, innovation, and collaboration
    in the agricultural technology sector. Successful digital agriculture initiatives
    have been demonstrated at the pilot levels, but scaling up remains challenging.
    Sustainable business models, financial viability, and long-term support are needed
    to ensure the continued use and benefits of digital solutions in agriculture.
    4.1. Resources for digitalization of African agriculture and barriers to adoption
    The core resources needed for digitalization would include big data, hardware,
    and software. The big data needed for digitalizing African Agriculture will include
    production-related information such as weather and edaphic (soil) conditions,
    agronomic inputs, pest and disease surveillance, farmer registries, and farmer
    transactions. The hardware and software, such as drones, satellite/Geographic
    Information Systems, sensors, and data analytics tools would also be critical.
    Parallel investments in physical infrastructure (e.g., roads and electricity)
    are needed to deliver inputs to farmers and products to market before digitalization
    can become effective. Big multimodal data are vital for developing machine learning
    and artificial intelligence models and present Africa with a major challenge in
    agricultural digitalization. As high-fidelity sensory devices become more accessible,
    data records are accumulated. This opens opportunities for tackling food security
    problems more effectively and inclusively. Big data applications in smart farming
    are also related to socio-economic challenges (Wolfert, 2017). a. Telecommunications
    and electricity infrastructure The state of telecommunications and electricity
    infrastructure in Africa varies widely from country to country, but in general,
    the continent lags behind much of the rest of the world in terms of access to
    these essential services. In most African countries, there is a considerable gap
    in electricity and telecommunication network facilities across rural and urban
    areas. While the unavailability of power grids in rural communities poses challenges,
    other energy sources like solar are not affordable. Africa has made significant
    progress in expanding its telecommunication infrastructure in recent years, with
    high penetration of mobile phones in many countries. There is still however, a
    considerable gap between urban and rural areas, with many rural communities still
    lacking access to basic telephone services. In terms of internet connectivity,
    Africa also lags behind other regions of the world, with only around 43% of the
    population having access to the internet as of 2021 (Mehrabi, 2021, Cariolle,
    2021). This is partly due to a lack of infrastructure, as well as high costs and
    low levels of digital literacy. Access to electricity is also a major challenge
    in many parts of Africa. As of 2021, around 600 million people on the continent
    still lack access to electricity, and in some countries, less than 20% of the
    population has access to grid-connected electricity (Conteh, 2021, Bhattacharyya
    and Palit, 2021). This lack of access to electricity has a significant impact
    on economic development and quality of life, and makes it difficult for digitalization
    to be achieved. There are also some promising developments in this area, with
    a growing number of African countries investing in renewable energy infrastructure
    such as solar and wind power. These technologies have the potential to provide
    reliable and affordable energy to even the most remote communities and could help
    to bridge the electricity gap in many parts of the continent. b. Human capital
    resource Next to technological advancements, business models should be sufficiently
    attractive for solution providers and stakeholders. Stronger collaborations must
    be secured among stakeholders with adequate attention to improving resource availability
    to support agricultural innovations. These would include multilateral institutions,
    governments, and private-sector investors. Human capital is an important resource
    for any country or region, and Africa is no exception. While the continent is
    home to a large and diverse population, with a growing wealth of skills and expertise
    across a range of fields relevant to agriculture digitalization there are still
    significant challenges when it comes to human capital in Africa, including education,
    brain drain, and good health. Many African countries struggle to provide high-quality
    education to their population, which can limit the development of human capital.
    This is particularly true in rural areas where access to education can be limited.
    Some countries with resources are teaching digital skills key to the jobs of the
    future, while others are still trying to play catch up with the past. Many highly
    skilled Africans that have the chance to learn digital skills leave the continent
    to seek better opportunities elsewhere. This can limit the development of human
    capital within Africa, as it reduces the number of skilled professionals available
    to support economic and social developments. Poor health outcomes can also limit
    the development of human capital in Africa, as illness and disease can impact
    a person''s ability to learn and work. Additionally, limited access to healthcare
    can mean that preventable illnesses go untreated, further impacting human capital
    development. Despite these challenges, there are also many examples of strong
    human capital development in Africa, with innovative programs and initiatives
    focused on improving education, health, and workforce development. Additionally,
    the continent''s young and growing population (60 % are under 25 years old) is
    seen as a potential source of strength, with the potential to drive economic growth
    and development in the years to come (Signé, 2020). 4.2. Barriers to the adoption
    of agriculture digitalization In some African countries such as Rwanda and Nigeria,
    digital technologies are already being used. These include mobile information
    services for farmers, early warning systems for hunger or disasters, and warehouse
    receipt systems (Kadi Kadi, 2011, van Ginkel and Biradar, 2021). Generally, however,
    adoption has been low due largely to resource constraints and societal barriers.
    Thirty-four case studies of a range of big data analytics applications in agriculture
    across the globe (Kamilaris et al., 2017) concluded that big data analysis had
    not yet been widely applied in agriculture and was still at an early development
    stage. Out of the 34 cases, only four were related to Africa. Smallholder farmers
    in Africa, who make up the majority, are generally more concerned about providing
    food for their families and generating income that would sustain their needs.
    They are not open to technological advances because of the low-scale production
    and potentially high risks. Adopting digitalization for these rural farmers would
    need critical thinking on promotion strategies. Most farmers in the rural areas
    of African countries lack digital skills because of their relatively low- education
    levels and acclimation to traditional farming practices. The issue of telecommunication
    network coverage has discouraged most farmers in rural areas from having interests
    in digitalization. In addition to this, the cost of internet access is high in
    Africa (Kenny, 2000). Mid-income or low-income farmers may find it difficult to
    afford telecommunication devices and internet coverage. Mobile smartphones and
    sensors are also expensive and out of reach for the ordinary farmer. Smart farming
    for the future will require smart digital decision infrastructure. Harnessing
    mobile digital technologies can significantly help farmers access important information
    and data required to address specific farming management systems and overcome
    underlying constraints. African governments would need to take commendable measures
    to promote widespread literacy on the fundamentals of digitalization in agriculture
    among farmers. Literacy programs would be needed on technical and operational
    knowledge for the adoption of digital technologies. Such efforts can improve the
    continent''s digital technology literacy leading to higher productivity and food
    security. Decision and policymakers must support rural communities in adopting
    modern digital technologies suitable for precision agriculture. Stronger collaborations
    must be secured among stakeholders with adequate attention to improving the productivity
    of agricultural innovations. These would include multilateral institutions, governments,
    and private sector investors. 5. Replacement and maintenance Replacement and maintenance
    of equipment in Africa is a significant challenge, particularly in rural and remote
    areas. Limited funding and access to spare parts, lack of technical expertise,
    and poor road infrastructure are part of the major reasons for this. Many African
    countries have limited budgets for infrastructure development and maintenance,
    which can make it difficult to replace or repair equipment. In many cases, spare
    parts for equipment may not be readily available in Africa, particularly for new
    systems coming on the market. This can make it difficult to repair or replace
    equipment that has broken down. As discussed earlier, a shortage of skilled technicians
    and engineers in many parts of Africa, particularly in rural areas can be a major
    barrier to the replacement and maintenance of equipment. This can make it difficult
    to maintain and repair complex equipment. In many rural areas, poor road networks
    can make it difficult to transport equipment to and from remote locations. These
    can also make it challenging to replace or repair equipment in these areas. 6.
    Concluding thoughts Digitalization of agriculture in Africa would result in numerous
    cross-cutting effects and benefits. Challenges, including limited availability
    of reliable infrastructure and lack of human resources and expertise, need to
    be overcome to realize these benefits. Efforts must include contributions by the
    private and public sectors, particularly in innovation. The following key points
    can be highlighted in this paper: (1) Digitalization is an impetus for technological
    and methodological innovation and automation and consists of four elements: sensors
    (in situ or remote), wireless transmission of data, artificial intelligence (AI)
    for analysis of big data, and transmission of recommendations or diagnoses to
    the end user. (2) Digitalization allows real-time continuous monitoring, diagnosis
    management, and decision-making of soils, crops, water, and livestock via sensors,
    artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. (3) Digitalization enables
    a shift from generalized (herd or lot-based) management to highly optimized and
    individualized, real-time, and data-driven management. (4) The use of information
    technologies can contribute significantly to improving productivity, profitability,
    and sustainability of agriculture and natural resources management through labor
    saving, timely decisions, and more accurate predictions. (5) Digitalization could
    effectively be used, for example, in (a) identification of animals in heat, (b)
    management of animal thermal comfort, (c) matching nutritional requirements with
    growth and reproduction stages, (d) environmental control in vertical farming
    systems (e) timing of nutrient application for plants, (f) irrigation scheduling,
    etc. (6) Technological innovations could be imagined in the areas of (a) modifying
    crops, animals, and food products, (b) developing of efficient, “smart” and self-replicating
    production technologies and inputs, (c) developing of tools and systems for identification,
    tracking and monitoring livestock, (d) autonomous operatation of farm machinery,
    ( e) growing plants and vegetables without soil, etc. (7) To address challenges
    with sustainable digitalization, there is a need for increased investment in infrastructure
    development and maintenance across Africa. This may include increasing funding
    for equipment replacement and repair, improving access to technical expertise
    and spare parts, and investing in road networks and other infrastructure to improve
    access to remote areas. Additionally, public-private partnerships may be an effective
    way to address these challenges by leveraging private sector expertise and resources
    to support infrastructure development and maintenance in Africa. Declaration of

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Sensor networks, as a special subtype of wireless
    networks, consist of sets of wirelessly connected sensor nodes often placed in
    hard-to-reach environments. Therefore, it is expected that sensor nodes will not
    be powered from the power grid. Instead, sensor nodes have their own power sources,
    the replacement of which is often impractical and requires additional costs, so
    it is necessary to ensure minimum energy consumption. For that reason, the energy
    efficiency of wireless sensor networks used for monitoring environmental parameters
    is essential, especially in remote networking scenarios. In this paper, an overview
    of the latest research progress on wireless sensor networks based on LoRa was

    efficient application of wireless sensor networks in agricultural processes contributes
    positively to the sustainable development of the economy based on agriculture
    and food production. The effects of these activities also have a positive impact
    on the ecology. The processes of monitoring ecological and agronomic parameters
    that enable a precise assessment of the physiological state of crops enable the
    timely adjustment of agrotechnical measures to reduce the impact of climate change
    on agricultural production. Wireless systems based on the usage of sensor nodes
    make processes in agriculture more intelligent because they become more precise,
    data-oriented, and greatly automated [1]. The broad usage of microprocessors and
    microcontrollers, which include small sensor nodes that can be self-modifiable,
    low-cost tooling, and scalability, demonstrates that wireless sensor networks
    can be used in the digitization of agriculture [2]. As they join a large number
    of sensor nodes into a network, wireless sensor networks represent the base for
    an extremely heterogeneous IoT environment in which there are many different technologies
    and communication standards. Such a heterogeneous environment enables optimal
    adjustment to different areas of sensor application. Every field of sensor application
    requires a suitable selection of communication systems and parameters to achieve
    reliable and energy-efficient communication. The aim of the implementation of
    wireless sensor networks in test environments is to connect sensor nodes, deployed
    at different remote locations, to servers used to store and process data in a
    reliable and energy-efficient manner. To enable applied research aimed at increasing
    the efficiency of implemented wireless sensor networks, the communication processes
    that occur within the networks are subjected to testing for the selected scenarios.
    The analyses include the specifics of communication in different scenarios regarding
    the need for continuous monitoring of network parameters and real-time communication.
    The source of energy required for the activities of the sensor nodes is primarily
    a battery. The sensor nodes can operate from several months up to several years.
    The battery cycle is affected by numerous different stress factors including temperature,
    discharge current, charge current, and state of charge ranges. Since the sensor
    node’s battery life cycle is one of the most severely limited resources in the
    network, for the implementation of the wireless sensor network especially in areas
    that are more difficult to access and areas that can be accessed less often, which
    is a typical example in digital agriculture, it is important to consider the optimization
    of energy consumption and to achieve the maximum possible energy savings. Therefore,
    in this paper, the configurations of wireless sensor networks concerning the optimization
    of the consumption of energy are analyzed. Optimization is analyzed in terms of
    the choice of adequate star-of-stars topology typical for LoRaWAN networks, data
    collection, as well as the set-up of network radio parameters. As already confirmed
    by other sources, for example [3,4], the sizes of the packets sent contribute
    significantly to energy consumption. Unlike in other studies conducted in this
    field, for example in [3,4], in this paper, special emphasis is given to finding
    the optimal packet size with regard to transmission rate in order to find the
    most energy-efficient size of the packet to be used in precision agriculture.
    For that reason, unlike other articles, this article gives an example of the contents
    of a packet that can be used in precision agriculture in order to prove that the
    6-bit packet is sufficient for efficient collection of parameters from the environment
    and higher energy-efficiency of communication, in contrast to the 11-bit packets
    used in standard commercially available equipment. The content and contributions
    of the paper are outlined in the following way: In Section 2, a review of the
    literature in the field of application of LoRa wireless sensor networks is presented,
    and the developments in the field carried out in this work are highlighted. In
    Section 3, the research methodology of issues related to the energy efficiency
    of LoRa sensor networks is presented, which includes the presented model of energy
    consumption of the LoRa sensor node, the defined parameters of wireless communication
    in LoRa networks, the selection of appropriate parameters for LoRa communication,
    the analysis of aspects of wireless communication based on LoRa with regard to
    the choice of appropriate volume of traffic in the LoRa network, proposed structure
    and format of LoRa packets, limitations based on LoRa time-on-air communication,
    as well as an explanation of unconfirmed and confirmed data transfer processes
    in the LoRa network. Furthermore, in Section 4, the evaluation and the optimization
    of energy consumption in LoRa sensor networks are analyzed in detail in selected
    scenarios, and the results of the collected measurements from the field as well
    as the results collected based on simulations are presented. The simulations are
    carried out on the basis of all collected parameters, which were previously shown
    by field measurements to guarantee energy-efficient communication. Finally, in
    Section 5, the most important remarks related to the selection of solutions that
    provide adequate energy efficiency of LoRa-based communication are highlighted.
    2. Literature Review The sensors intended to control the cultivation of agricultural
    crops can monitor environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity,
    soil temperature, soil moisture, chemicals in the soil, leaf wetness, air flow,
    insolation, luminosity, and solar radiation. The application of IoT solutions
    is increasingly common in precision agriculture in greenhouses, orchards, and
    vineyards [5,6,7,8,9]. In order to optimize the parameters of wireless communication,
    it is necessary to carry out analyses of various communication aspects. Therefore,
    the optimization of parameters should be carried out to achieve reliable communication
    with minimal energy consumption, which is the subject of research in this article.
    An important criterion in the selection of appropriate technologies is low energy
    consumption, so that the battery-powered nodes achieve a sufficiently long autonomy
    and multi-year life cycle expectancy. Therefore, technologies from the group of
    Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technologies, high-range low-power wireless
    technologies, are suitable for application in precision agriculture scenarios
    [10]. The specifics of LPWAN technologies are a long communication range for sending
    information over greater distances and low power consumption. These features make
    LPWAN technologies very practical for open-area IoT implementations. There are
    many LPWAN technologies and new ones are constantly emerging and improving, but
    currently, LoRa, Sigfox, and Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) are leaders in the field
    [11,12]. The advantage of the application of these technologies in networking
    relates to the fact that the end devices working with these technologies are designed
    to consume energy efficiently and minimally [13]. Low power and narrow bandwidth
    allow for very low power consumption used in operation [14]. Its low power associated
    with long-range communication makes LoRa the most prominent among LPWAN technologies
    [15]. Of all LPWAN technologies, LoRa has probably involved consideration of most
    scientific studies concerning problems, current solutions, and open issues [13,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38].
    A significant number of surveys has been conducted with the aim of analyzing requirements,
    deployments, and challenges of LoRa technology [13,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,37,38].
    Therefore, available surveys [13,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,37], from 2019–2023
    are listed and briefly described hereafter. In [39], a systematic literature review
    of published studies on LoRa applications was conducted using articles from 2010–2019.
    The study [16] presents an overview of LoRa networking, covering the technological
    difficulties in setting up LoRa infrastructures, such as connection management,
    allocation of resources, consistent communications, and security. In [17], a comprehensive
    survey of LoRa from a systematic perspective is given. It includes analysis of
    LoRa communication processes, security, and its enabled applications. In [18],
    the landscape of available simulators for IoT and wireless sensor networks is
    explored and their performance is compared. Moreover, LoRa networking performance
    metrics, including range, throughput, energy usage, and security is studied in
    [13,19]. In [20], the literature survey presented in the paper describes LoRa
    performance under different scenarios and a few implementation obstacles of this
    technology. Furthermore, in the papers [21,22], a discussion of the advantages
    of LoRa over the existing technologies used in IoT is presented. Also, in [23,24],
    a detailed description of the LoRa technology is given with regard to existing
    security and reliability mechanisms. Also, in [38], a survey of Machine Learning
    techniques for wireless sensor networks is presented. Finally, in [37] a review
    of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented and a comparison was conducted
    among different wireless technologies or protocols, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,
    ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G, LoRa, and SigFox. None of these surveys considered the methods
    of energy efficiency of LoRa implementations in precision agriculture based on
    the amount of network traffic and the size of sent packets with regard to transmission
    rate, which is the subject of research in this article. The majority of the research
    conducted on LoRa and LoRaWAN has been focused on features such as coverage, range,
    network capacity, throughput, delay, scalability, and robustness, for instance
    in [25,26,27,28,29,30,40,41,42]. However, limited consideration of features such
    as energy consumption has been given, unlike the considerations in this article.
    It is essential because many LoRa devices are not powered by the grid. Prompted
    by the challenges of energy consumption, some recent works have focused on the
    power dissipation of sensors within wireless sensor networks [15]. Although the
    analyses in the majority of the proposed papers suggested to estimate the amount
    of energy consumed by a sensor node, LoRa technology was not directly included
    in their energy models [43]. Thus, for instance, in [44], an energy model for
    ultra-low power consumption of sensor nodes was presented. However, the radio
    frequency module used in the study did not include LoRa technology. Another model
    of energy estimation was presented in [45] aimed to achieve low energy consumption
    of sensor nodes. In order to save energy, it was concluded that the microcontroller
    and the communication module must be idle as long as possible when they are not
    active. Although these papers provide useful results, LoRa technology was not
    considered in the performed analysis, as is the case in this article. Furthermore,
    some other studies which took LoRa communication into account did not study the
    optimization of the consumption of energy of LoRa sensor nodes. For instance,
    in [46], a comparison of LoRaWAN classes was presented and their energy consumption
    models were proposed. Although the obtained results are based on real measurements,
    the paper did not study the effects of LoRa parameters such as communication range,
    coding speed, and transmission power level on the total energy consumed, which
    is the subject of research in this article. The analyses presented in [31] deal
    with this topic to a limited measure, providing only incomplete estimates on parameters
    related to LoRaWAN energy efficiency. However, they did not consider the practical
    behavior of the hardware of the LoRaWAN device, nor the effect of the main LoRaWAN
    mechanism settings and parameters, which is also the subject of research in this
    article. Moreover, only a few works provided data relevant to the current consumption
    of LoRa and LoRaWAN devices, obtained from a manual or by experimental measurements
    [31,32,33,34,36,47]. Such details correspond to device states of sleep, transmission,
    as well as reception [47]. Although the developed models enable the characterization
    of lifetime and energy costs of LoRaWAN device, these models do not include, for
    instance, energy consumption used within the processing state of sensor units,
    which is also the subject of research in this article. In addition, based on the
    information relevant to transmit, receive, and sleep states of a LoRa/LoRaWAN
    device, a few analytical models of LoRa and LoRaWAN energy consumption have been
    published, for example, in [31,36]. They include the lifetime of sensor nodes
    and the energy cost of data delivery. However, these models are also very basic
    since consideration needs to be given to several other states for a LoRa and LoRaWAN
    device that exist and are involved in communication. These include, for instance,
    a detailed calculation of time for message transmission, provided only in [48].
    It is important to note that the aforementioned study only examines LoRa, and
    therefore does not model the use of acknowledgments and retransmission which are
    important mechanisms of the MAC layer defined in LoRaWAN, which is set to be the
    subject of research in this article. Although some studies show the energy consumption
    of sensor nodes based on both LoRa and LoRaWAN communication, the presented values
    are obtained from a data table or empirically [49,50,51,52,53,54,55]. However,
    the studies in question did not consider an energy model that can thoroughly estimate
    and optimize the energy consumption of sensor nodes, which is also the subject
    of research in this article. Considering the results of the research studies provided
    so far, as well as the aforementioned deficiencies in those studies, in this article
    a detailed analytical model of energy consumption of sensor nodes and energy cost
    of data delivery is provided. The model considers the hardware behavior and mechanisms
    of real LoRaWAN devices, as well as their physical and MAC layer parameters. The
    proposed energy consumption model is based on Class A, as the most energy-efficient
    LoRaWAN class. Based on the literature review, it can be concluded that this paper
    is among the first to specify a detailed analytical model of energy consumption
    and simulation of the energy cost of data delivery of sensor nodes. It considers
    both the real hardware behavior of LoRaWAN devices and real-case tests of data
    packet delivery in different specific fields of LoRa deployment scenarios. While
    the actual hardware behavior of LoRaWAN devices includes, for instance, their
    levels of power consumption in different modes of operation, the real-case tests
    of data packet delivery conducted in different specific LoRa field deployment
    scenarios enable decision making on whether a packet delivery confirmation is
    required in a particular application scenario or not. The defined energy model
    is supplemented by the optimization of LoRaWAN parameters important for the reduction
    in energy consumption of sensor nodes, such as spreading factor, coding rate,
    and bandwidth, as well as the generated traffic volume. It is necessary to emphasize
    that the impact of LoRaWAN parameters such as payload size, acknowledged transmission,
    coding rate, spreading factor, and communication range on the sensor node consumption
    is also studied in [15]. In contrast to the analyses in [15], in this paper, special
    emphasis is placed on the analysis of optimization of energy consumption with
    regard to packet transmission rate considering different sizes of data packets
    which are not all very common in commercial devices, as well as energy consumption
    aspects in different scenarios of LoRa network deployment. Furthermore, unlike
    the analyses carried out in [52], in which the battery lifespan is calculated
    without the use of acknowledgments, this paper presents the possibility of using
    acknowledgments to estimate the lifespan of batteries more precisely. Furthermore,
    the impact of deficiency of data delivery caused by degradation on the energy
    performance of LoRaWAN was considered. For actual analysis, the simulated models
    are derived based on measurements conducted in the real testbeds. The possibility
    of using acknowledgments or omitting them is also analyzed, based on the results
    collected by real measurements, in order to select the best case for the optimization
    of energy consumption. In addition, the models used in this paper also study the
    impact of collisions on LoRaWAN energy performance. Moreover, unlike the analyses
    in [53], in which the focus is placed on the optimization of the fixed LoRaWAN
    setup communication with only a single considered data rate, this paper analyzes
    the use of different available data rates to select the best method for the optimization
    of energy consumption. The model considers the possibility of the use of an adaptive
    data transmission rate, as presented by results of conducted simulations. Finally,
    unlike the analyses conducted in [3,4], which considered large-scale LoRa network
    deployments with up to 100 densely distributed sensor nodes, in this paper, analyses
    are conducted for precision agriculture application scenarios in which deployments
    of up to 20 optimally distributed sensor nodes are sufficient for the monitoring
    of environmental parameters. In addition, unlike the energy profile used in [3,4],
    the selected energy profile used in the simulation process is based on the estimated
    energy consumption of a transceiver [54] due to its energy efficiency and application
    in the conducted field measurements. All the procedures for modeling the energy
    aspects of LoRa communication processes applied in the model presented within
    this paper enable a more precise assessment of the optimal combinations of parameters
    to achieve a reduction in the energy consumption in the selected specific use
    cases, whereby a special emphasis is placed on the analysis results of the optimization
    of energy aspects related to defining the optimal packet size with regard to traffic
    rate. 3. Methodology 3.1. Energy Consumption Model of Lora Sensor Node The energy
    consumption modeling process represents an essential consideration when designing
    sensor nodes to monitor a specific application. For most applications, such as
    the ones presented in [55], the communicating sensors should perform the following:
    sense events, process the local information of sensed events, and transmit packets
    to the access point [56]. Each task consumes power over a given period. Therefore,
    an accurate energy consumption model of the sensor node is essential to estimate
    the sensor lifetime, as proven in [15,57]. Furthermore, the energy model allows
    the power consumption optimization of the sensor node. In order to study the sensor
    node autonomy, it is necessary to model the different operating modes of the sensor
    node. Then, the consumed energy of each mode can be determined, and the consumption
    energy model can be defined. Most of the time, the sensor node is put into sleep
    mode. That is a low-power mode, but the energy consumed in this mode can also
    impact the total energy consumption of the sensor node. The total consumed energy
    E_Total of the sensor node for one cycle is: E_Total = E_Active + E_Sleep, (1)
    where E_Sleep and E_Active represent the dissipated energy by the sensor node
    in the sleep mode and the total energy consumption during the active mode of the
    node microcontroller, respectively [15]. The duration of the sleep mode should
    be ≥99%, and the duration of the active mode should be ≤1% [15]. In addition,
    E_Sleep is expressed as: E_Sleep = P_Sleep · T_Sleep, (2) where P_Sleep and T_Sleep
    are the power consumption and the time duration in the sleep mode, respectively
    [15]. The total energy consumption in active mode E_Active is calculated as the
    sum of the energy consumption used for the operation of each part of the sensor
    node. Therefore, it is given by the following equation [15]: E_Active = E_WU +
    E_M + E_PROC + E_WUT + E_Tx + E_WUR + E_Rx, (3) where the consumed energies that
    should be considered are the ones for the system wake-up, data measurement, microcontroller
    processing, the wake-up of the transmitter, the transceiver’s transmission, the
    wake-up of the receiver, and the reception of the transceiver, respectively [15],
    as presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Energy consumption states of the sensor node.
    Energy consumption in specific operating modes can be determined regarding the
    current consumption of LoRa/LoRaWAN transceiver modules, as declared in the specifications
    and affirmed by conducted measurements, presented in Table 1. As can be seen,
    the sleep current ranges from 0.1 μA to 34 mA. Sleep current for the hardware
    platforms is up to several orders of magnitude greater than sleep current of their
    transceivers [58], which can be near 1 μA, or even lower than that [47]. In addition,
    the power consumption can be determined from the transceivers’ electrical specifications
    under the stated supply voltage conditions, as presented in Table 2. Table 1.
    Transceiver current consumption. Table 2. Transceiver power consumption. The output
    power is sensitive to the power supply voltage, and their performance is typically
    expressed at 3.3 V [64]. For instance, the HopeRF RFM95/96/97/98(W), used in the
    field measurements whose presentation is given in Section 4 of the paper, has
    a minimum output supply voltage of 2.4. V and a maximum of 3.7 V, which applies
    to the high-power +20 dBm operation [54]. According to [54], the following can
    be quoted: (a) Transmit mode of operation of the transceiver In transmit mode,
    the power consumption, presented in Table 2, is optimized only when packet data
    needs to be transmitted by enabling the following blocks: RF, PLL (used for calibration
    of the receiver), and PA (amplifier capable of yielding RF power) [64]. The transceivers
    feature three different RF power amplifiers [54]. Two of these, connected to RFO_LF
    and RFO_HF, can deliver up to +14 dBm and are not regulated for high power efficiency
    [65]. The third, PA, connected to the PA_BOOST pin, can deliver up to +20 dBm
    via a dedicated matching network [58]. The low-frequency PA_LF covers the lower
    bands (up to 525 MHz), while the high-frequency PA_HF covers the upper bands (from
    860 MHz). Finally, the high-power PA_HP, connected to the PA_BOOST pin, covers
    all frequency bands the transceiver addresses. (b) Listen mode of operation of
    the transceiver In this mode, the circuit spends most of the time in an idle state,
    during which only the RC oscillator is on. Then, periodically, the receiver wakes
    up and looks for an incoming signal. If a signal is detected, the receiver is
    kept on, and the data are analyzed. Otherwise, if there is no signal for a defined
    period of time, the receiver is switched off until the following receive period
    [64]. The radio stays mainly in a low-power mode during the listen mode. This
    fact results in very low average power consumption. (c) Receive mode of operation
    of the transceiver The receiver automatically restarts after a packet collision
    or after receiving a valid packet. In receive mode, the transceiver can detect
    packet collisions and restart the receiver. Collisions are detected by a sudden
    rise in received signal strength. This functionality can be useful in network
    configurations where many asynchronous slave nodes attempt periodic communication
    with a single master node [64]. Depending on the application and the environment,
    there are various ways to implement listen mode: wake on a Preamble Detect interrupt,
    wake on a SyncAddress interrupt, or wake on a Payload Ready interrupt [64]. 3.2.
    Energy Profile of LoRa Sensor Nodes Each sensor node is characterized by an energy
    profile and LoRa parameters. The node’s behavior is designed as specified by [70,71,72,73],
    as presented in Table 3. The energy consumption model based on LoRa, which estimates
    the consumed power of different states of sensor nodes, is used. The default energy
    profile used in the simulation process, whose presentation is given in Section
    4 of the paper, is based on the energy consumption of [54], due to its energy
    efficiency and application in conducted field measurements. Therefore, the energy
    consumption values of the selected transceiver listed in the specifications [54]
    are used. However, the simulations are not solely constrained to a single energy
    profile, since a comparison was made of the selected transceiver with other transceivers
    referenced in the literature relevant to the research area. The power consumption
    optimization in the selected scenarios is conducted by adopting specific power
    reduction settings of communication parameters. For instance, a reduction in the
    power consumption of the radio frequency (RF) mode is applied. As a result, it
    minimizes the total power consumption of sensor nodes since RF modules (for Tx
    and Rx) use considerable power. Table 3. Energy profiles of the sensor nodes.
    During the simulation process, different energy profiles are allocated to nodes,
    imitating various nodes, whereby the average values of energy consumption in different
    states are used. The different energy states of the simulated nodes are summarized
    in Table 3 according to sources in the cited literature and the technical report
    of the transceiver used in the conducted field measurements. A similar experiment
    has been conducted in [3], but there are differences between the energy profile
    in transmit and receive modes. As can be observed from Table 3, the power states
    that are considered are transmit, receive, sleep, and processing, as well as waking
    up and setting up the radio. The simulation process assumes that all nodes have
    an initial transmit power of 14 dBm, which conforms to the LoRaWAN specification.
    This power level, which corresponds to the low-power operation mode, enables lower
    energy consumption than the high-power operation mode, but also sufficient signal
    coverage of the area, which was previously proven by field measurements. Moreover,
    only the operations in the channels required by the LoRaWAN specification are
    considered, i.e., 868.1 MHz, 868.3 MHz, and 868.5 MHz. As already proven, optimizing
    the LoRa parameters such as SF, CR, and payload size are crucial in reducing the
    sensor node’s consumed energy. A spreading factor SF12 should be used in the second
    receive window [70]. However, in this work, a confirmed message was sent with
    SF10. A lower spreading factor results in a faster reception, yielding lower energy
    consumption at the node. The spreading factor SF10 is favored since the areas
    in the selected scenarios are well covered by the LoRa signal, which can be concluded
    according to the previously presented field measurements [52]. Moreover, a lower
    spreading factor results in faster data reception, which causes a lower node energy
    consumption. However, since the LoRa gateway handles a downlink channel by allowing
    for a higher duty cycle and higher transmit power operation, a loss of packets
    due to lowering the spreading factor can be resolved by transmitting data at higher
    power, as also stated in [74]. Therefore, within the simulation process, it is
    assumed that the downlink message scheduled for the first receive window (Rx1)
    uses the same frequency and data rate as the uplink messages. In the second receive
    window (Rx2), a fixed predefined frequency and data rate (for SF10) are used.
    3.3. Selection of Adequate Parameters for LoRa-Based Communication The LoRa-based
    access networks implemented in open spaces connect sensor nodes in different remote
    locations to centrally located storage and data-processing servers. The range
    of communication is an essential parameter when considering the effectiveness
    of implemented solutions regarding the implementation of sensor networks in remote
    areas to monitor environmental and agronomic parameters. In most cases, the high
    data transfer rate is not so significant. However, it is necessary to ensure the
    energy-efficient transmission of data over relatively long distances. The parameters
    described hereafter affect LoRa transmission range and energy efficiency [54].
    LoRa operates in the sub-GHz unlicensed frequency bands. The LoRa systems operate
    at the ISM frequency bands, and the carrier frequency (CF), the center frequency
    used for the transmission band, is 863 MHz to 870 MHz in Europe. Moreover, there
    are also some regulatory constraints in most countries on the permissible occupied
    bandwidth (BW) [54]. Increasing the signal bandwidth (BW) allows a higher effective
    data rate to be used, thereby reducing the transmission time at the expense of
    reduced sensitivity of the receiver. It is possible to choose between 125 kHz,
    250 kHz, or 500 kHz. However, in the multi-data-rate channel mode, the gateway
    is limited to a 125 kHz bandwidth with typically eight channels, even though the
    maximum bandwidth of LoRa is 500 kHz. Therefore, if there is a need for a high
    data transfer rate, the best choice is the value of 500 kHz. On the other hand,
    if it is necessary to achieve a long communication range, it is necessary to choose
    the bandwidth value of 125 kHz. The greater the bandwidth, the shorter the time-on-air
    value, and the sensitivity of the receiver is better. However, a higher time-on-air
    value will also mean higher energy requirements. The spreading factor and error
    correction rate allow the optimization of the trade-off between occupied bandwidth,
    data rate, link budget improvement, and immunity to interference. The spread spectrum
    LoRa modulation is performed by representing each bit of payload information by
    multiple chirps of information. A chirp is a sinusoidal signal whose frequency
    monotonically increases (upchirp) or decreases (downchirp) [60]. A chirp is a
    pulse that sweeps from fLow(−BW/2) to fHigh(+BW/2) [60]. The number of chirps
    forms a symbol. For instance, if a symbol value is between 1 and 128, the number
    would be one of the combinations of 27 = 128 chirps. The Spreading Factor (SF)
    represents the number of chirps per symbol. Its value is an integer number between
    6 and 12. The values of SF from 6 to 12 represent 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048,
    and 4096 chirps/symbol, respectively. The greater the SF value, the more ability
    the receiver has to remove the noise from the signal. Thus, the greater the SF
    value, the more time is taken to send a packet, but a higher range will also be
    achieved because the receiver’s sensitivity is better. For example, if the expansion
    factor is minimal, i.e., SF = 6, a higher speed can be achieved, but with a reduction
    in the possible range. SF = 6 presents a particular use case for the highest data-rate
    transmission possible with the LoRa modem. The spreading factor must be known
    in advance on both transmit and receive sides of the link, as different spreading
    factors are orthogonal to each other. Generally, according to the LoRaWAN specifications,
    the spreading factor control is limited to 6 unique spreading factors going from
    spreading factor 12, or the lowest data rate, to spreading factor 7, for the highest
    data rate. This means up to six sensor nodes can transmit data simultaneously
    on the same channel. Due to interference, some of the data bits can be lost, so
    the error correction bits are used to recover the original lost data bits. LoRa
    uses Forward Error Correction (FEC) techniques to increase the robustness of radio
    communication links. FEC requires error correction bits, redundant bits, to be
    added to the data. Thus, error coding incurs a transmission overhead. Although
    FEC reduces the data throughput, it increases the receiver’s sensitivity. LoRa
    defined a set of values which are referred to as Code ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} to calculate
    the Coding Rate (CR) based on the following equation [67]: CR= 4 4+Code (4) Hence,
    CR = {4/5, 4/6, 4/7, 4/8}, and it denotes that every four useful bits are encoded
    by 5, 6, 7, or 8 transmission bits, while the overhead ratio is 1.25, 1.5, 1.75,
    and 2, respectively. The coding rate could maximize the data rate if fewer code
    bits are used. The smaller the coding rate is, the higher the time on air is to
    transmit data, but the prolonged data transfer time will also affect the battery
    consumption. The packet header can be optionally included in the coding rate for
    use by the receiver. However, if more redundant bits are sent to the receiver,
    LoRa will consume more power. Therefore, in response to channel conditions, the
    coding rate and the robustness to interference can be changed. In addition, the
    relationship among LoRa transmission parameters is also relevant for energy consumption.
    If the bandwidth of LoRa is constant, the chirp rate differs according to the
    SF [67]: R c =BW· R s = B W 2 2 SF  [chirps/s] (5) For each SF, the orthogonality
    of the chirp prevents interference with any other [62]. Thus, when two or more
    transmitters use the same channel to transmit data with different SFs simultaneously,
    the packets do not interfere with each other [68]. With knowledge of the key LoRa
    parameters, bandwidth, and the spreading factor, the LoRa symbol rate can be controlled
    [54]: R s = BW 2 SF  [symbols/s] (6) SF= log 2 ( R c R s ) (7) Moreover, depending
    on the SF in use, LoRa bit rate ranges [54]: R b =SF· [ 4 4+CR ] [ 2 SF BW ] ·1000
    [b/s] (8) Data rate (DR) can also be expressed considering LoRa transmission parameters
    [54]: DR=SF· BW 2 SF ·CR [b/s] (9) The higher the SF and the lower the channel
    bandwidth, the lower the data rate is and, thus, the longer the data transmission
    time is [68]. The analysis of the effect of different values of SF and CR LoRa
    radio parameters on the consumed energy and range is performed in [69]. According
    to the presented results, the following can be concluded. When the SF value is
    high, the time necessary for data transmission increases. This means that the
    sensor node consumes more power to transmit data. The reason for setting a high
    SF value is to maximize the transmission range as one of the most critical factors
    in field deployment, as also proved in [15]. Furthermore, when the coding rate
    increases, the data transmission time and the consumed energy decrease. Therefore,
    when a long range needs to be ensured, energy consumption can be regulated by
    the CR factor. By increasing the CR value from 4/8 to 4/5, the energy consumption
    can be reduced while maintaining the maximal range enabled by the high SF parameter
    value [69]. However, this depends on the radio conditions because it could imply
    more retransmissions which would cause more energy consumption. 3.4. Choosing
    the Adequate Volume of Traffic in the LoRa Network The aim of analyzing the impact
    of the amount of transmitted network traffic within the network on the energy
    consumption for one-hop star topology scenarios is analyzed in [69], as quoted
    within this chapter. First, the scenario where all nodes send data at the same
    time interval, a typical case in rural scenarios for sending data collected from
    the field, is analyzed. It is concluded that node placement in a star topology
    presents a vital determinant of sensor node lifetime. However, although adequate
    signal coverage of the area must be achieved, the nodes should be as close as
    possible to the gateway to reduce energy consumption. Moreover, regarding the
    energy depletion of individual nodes, it is concluded that the star topology is
    more suitable for application to sensor networks than the cluster topology, in
    which the energy of cluster head (CH) nodes is depleted the fastest. Since CH
    nodes are difficult to replace, this causes the loss of functionality of the entire
    cluster, while in the star topology, the depletion of energy of an individual
    node does not cause such a loss in data delivery from the area it covers with
    its signal. In addition, it is concluded that in scenarios where sending a more
    considerable amount of data is unnecessary, as in the case of monitoring the state
    of yield, energy savings should be achieved by sending an adequately determined
    smaller volume of data from sensors. Finally, it is concluded that significantly
    less energy consumption can be noted within the same time interval when sending
    data with higher delay, i.e., less frequently. Thus, from the presented results,
    applying LoRa technology is an adequate solution in IoT scenarios where fast transmission
    of large amounts of data is not required, as in precision agriculture. In precision
    agriculture, additional energy savings can be achieved by sending smaller data
    sets over extended periods between transmissions. Considering these conclusions,
    optimizing energy consumption in a LoRa network requires consideration of the
    optimal packet size. To save energy, sending as little total traffic as possible
    is necessary. Therefore, optimizing packets to maximize information transfer in
    the minimum number of bits is vital [75]. Sending the highest value information,
    with the right balance of redundancy, compactness, and timeliness, should provide
    the best results in applying a sensor network based on LoRaWAN for monitoring
    environmental and agronomic data essential for precision agriculture. The LoRaWAN
    specification, defined for each worldwide region, provides for a maximum data
    payload size N. This maximum payload size varies by data rate (DR) because of
    the maximum on-air transmission time allowed for each regional specification.
    For example, for EU863-870, the maximum payload size for DR0-DR2 is 51 bytes,
    for DR3 it is 115 bytes, for DR4-DR7 it is 222 bytes, while for DR8-DR15 it is
    not defined [75]. If DR limits are restricted only to higher values, for instance,
    never below the chosen DR, this also limits how far away signals can be received,
    so this should be considered when choosing a packet length. Moreover, while 51
    bytes in the payload in Europe may not be very restrictive, in the regions that
    operate in the 900 MHz ISM band, the lowest DR is restricted to 11 bytes [75].
    However, for all DRs other than DR0, the available maximum packet size is equal
    to or greater than the EU863-870 region. Therefore, if the same packet format
    should be used in all regions, and DR0 is chosen to be supported (since a lower
    DR typically means a more extended range), the maximum payload length for any
    packet would be 11 bytes. If the sensor node is restricted to operate above the
    DR0, the maximum payload becomes 51 bytes. Since the sensors can monitor parameters
    related to both the environment and the state of the crops, the data in the packet
    payload is used to transmit measured values, for example, temperature, humidity,
    pressure, solar radiation, and rain. When sending data packets, it is crucial
    to maximize the transfer of useful information. Hence, it must be considered that
    the payload contents are used to maximize the transfer of useful information with
    minimal transmission bandwidth. Therefore, a critical aspect of data transmission
    planning refers to the processes for determining the necessary update rate of
    information to make a minimum number of samples. A reasonable sampling rate should
    be used to capture the original data. Moreover, for highly periodic measurements,
    as is the case for monitoring of most parameters related to precision agriculture,
    an adequate sampling rate will result in an accurate representation of the measured
    values. Thus, more frequent data delivery is necessary for monitoring data related
    to the amount of precipitation essential for irrigation procedures, especially
    in the rapid occurrence of short-term storms. In these cases, it is necessary
    to take several samples per hour to assess the current state as accurately as
    possible. It is logical to group all readings into the same packet in the case
    of sensors with multiple sensor elements that have synchronized measurements.
    In the case of group readings, bits are often arranged in registers of a fixed
    size. However, in this case, there is an unnecessary waste of resources allocated
    for unused bits. For example, some sensors have 10- or 12-bit resolution, while
    LoRaWAN provides slots of 8 bits (or multiples of 8) for transmission, where it
    is possible that some of these bits remain unused. Therefore, optimizing the data
    transfer between devices is necessary to maximize the transfer of useful information
    in the minimum number of bytes. In a group reading, the process of maximizing
    data transfer in the fewest bits, i.e., the process of bit packing, takes advantage
    of binary payload data transmission where payload bits are sent one after the
    other to ensure a compact flow of information. An example of such a message format
    as can be found at the commercially available all-in-one sensor weather stations
    is presented in Table 4. The values presented in Table 4 represent the collected
    data and contents of the actual packet with a payload of 11 bytes. Table 4. Packet
    payload of 11 bytes. However, an essential aspect of bit packing is ensuring the
    appropriate scale and precision of the data. Many physical measurements can be
    compressed into smaller data representations, so sending more bits than required
    for the same data is inefficient. For example, for transferring information about
    environmental temperature, an 8-bit representation can be used instead of the
    11-bit. It enables the representation of a temperature range from −40 °C to +87.5
    °C, sufficient to display the required temperatures with high accuracy. The same
    applies to other environmental parameters monitored by sensors, such as the relative
    humidity sensor, which can measure environmental humidity or soil moisture at
    different depths, and the pressure sensor or rain gauge which is used to determine
    the maximum instantaneous rainfall rate. Irrigation planning based on monitoring
    current conditions in the environment carried out by sensor nodes represents a
    relevant example of the increasingly necessary application of sensor networks
    in precision agriculture, especially regarding the necessity of optimal water
    utilization, which is essential in the face of increasingly frequent water shortages.
    The proposed 6-byte payload format shown in Table 5 corresponds to the optimal
    data set for monitoring environmental parameters essential for the crop irrigation
    process, which provides the same amount of useful information as the previously
    shown 11-byte payload, but within the reduced packet size. Table 5. Packet payload
    of 6 bytes. 3.5. Time on Air Constraints of Communication Based on LoRa To optimize
    the overall energy consumption in the network, LoRaWAN facilitates the control
    of the air time and data rate [3]. To effectively manage the regulatory constraints
    of time on air and receiver sensitivity, it is necessary to be able to calculate
    the total on-the-air transmission time of a LoRa packet for a given configuration
    of communication parameters, i.e., spreading factor (SF), coding rate (CR) and
    signal bandwidth (BW), as defined hereafter. For calculating the time on air,
    it is convenient to define the symbol duration Tsymb. The symbol duration of a
    LoRa symbol is defined as [76]: T symb = 2 SF BW , (10) This is the time taken
    to send chirps at the chirp rate, recalling that the bandwidth defines the chirp
    rate. The symbol duration is based on the spreading factor (SF) and the bandwidth
    (BW). Each LoRa symbol comprises 2SF chirps, each covering the entire bandwidth.
    Every LoRa packet consists of a preamble and data. The preamble contains only
    upchirps, while the data part comprises upchirps with discontinuities (the position
    of the discontinuities in frequency is what encodes the transmitted information).
    Therefore, LoRa packet duration can be calculated as the sum of the duration of
    the preamble and the transmitted packet. The preamble length is calculated as
    follows [54]: T preamble =( n preamble +4.25) T symb , (11) where npreamble is
    the number of programmed preamble symbols. The payload duration depends upon the
    header mode enabled, implicit (headerless) or explicit (with header) modes. The
    number of symbols that make up the packet payload and header are given by [54]:
    payloadSymbNb=8+max(ceil( 8PL−4SF+28+16−20H 4(SF−2DE) )(CR+4),0), (12) with the
    following dependencies: the number of payload bytes PL, the spreading factor SF,
    the header (H = 0 when header is enabled, and H = 1 when no header is present),
    the data rate optimization (DE = 1 when the low data rate optimization is enabled,
    DE = 0 when it is disabled), and the coding rate CR (from 1 to 4). If the time
    on air requires reduction, and the packet length is known in advance, then the
    header information can be removed once the destination of the packet is known.
    The payload duration is then the symbol period multiplied by the number of payload
    symbols [54]. T payload =payloadSymbNb·Tsymb, (13) Then, the time-on-air, or packet
    duration, is simply the sum of the preamble and payload duration [54]: T packet
    = T preamble + T payload , (14) LoRaWAN devices must comply with the regulations
    imposed in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands in which
    they operate [3]. These regulations include a limitation in the duty cycle of
    transmission and excited transmit power [77]. The duty cycle indicates the fraction
    of time a resource is busy. LoRaWAN enforces a per-band duty cycle limitation.
    In Europe, duty cycles are regulated by Section 7.2.3 of the ETSI EN300.220 standard.
    Since every radio device must comply with the regulated duty cycle limits, this
    applies to sensor nodes and gateways. For example, ETSI regulations limit the
    duty cycle over one-hour intervals, whereas LoRaWAN enforces compliance with such
    limitations over the interval between transmitting a message and the next one.
    Moreover, on The Things Network’s public community network, a Fair Use Policy
    applies, which limits the uplink air time to 30 s per day per node and the downlink
    messages to 10 messages per day per node. If private networks are used, these
    limits do not apply, but the governmental and LoRaWAN limits apply. To stay within
    these limits, the easiest way to do this is to calculate how much air time each
    packet consumes to choose a good transmit interval. For instance, as presented
    in Table 6, the calculator [48] is used for the chosen packet payload size (the
    maximum of which is 51 for low data rate (SF12), up to about 222 bytes for the
    best conditions (SF7)), the chosen packet header size (which is at least 13 bytes
    for the header for regular uplinks, or a total of 23 bytes for a Join Request),
    the chosen coding rate (from 4/5 to 4/8, where higher values mean more overhead),
    the chosen number of preamble symbols (which is 8 for all regions but can be different
    using plain LoRa),the chosen bandwidth (which is typically 125 kHz, but can be
    250 kHz or 500 kHz), the chosen spreading factor (where “higher” means more range
    and better reception, but also more air time), and the chosen total air time to
    send the entire packet (in ms). Therefore, as presented in Table 6, the calculated
    values include the TTN Fair Access Policy-based number of average messages/day
    and average messages/hour when sending all day, as well as the duty-cycle-based
    time between the start of the next packet in the same sub-band. ETSI regulations
    limit the duty cycle to one-hour intervals so as not to crash its servers by generating
    excessive traffic, and not to directly improve energy savings. Table 6. Maximum
    number of packets according to duty cycle. As can be seen from the conducted calculations
    presented in Table 6, by complying with the TTN Fair Access Policy, since more
    messages/hour can be sent for smaller packets, for a maximum packet size of 51
    bytes, a total of 10 packets/hour cannot be exceeded. The control of the air time
    is achieved by adapting the data rate, i.e., by changing SF values. Also, the
    values are presented for the three chosen values of packet application payload
    sizes. As the presented values show, the decrease in the spreading factor results
    in a lower air time. However, a higher air time allows the receiver to demodulate
    the message better. Instead of defining a specific data rate, LoRaWAN specifies
    the data rate as a combination of a spreading factor and bandwidth [47,78]. It
    can be seen that DR3 uses SF9, while DR2 uses SF10. Hence, with DR3, a double
    amount of data can be sent simultaneously, compared to DR2 [4]. Similarly, since
    the symbol time for DR3 is half the symbol time for DR2, there will also be half
    the energy per bit if the same transmit power is used. Likewise, this is also
    true for SNR [4]. 3.6. Battery Lifespan Choosing the optimum SF parameter, which
    enables the highest possible transmission speed, leads to a longer battery life
    [48]. Despite the better range, a sensor node will consume more energy when transmitting
    with a higher spreading factor [3]. Therefore, in addition to modifying the spreading
    factor value, the transmission power can be altered to increase the range further
    or decrease the energy consumption. Considering the limitation in the duty cycle,
    after transmitting a message, every sensor node needs to wait Toff seconds before
    transmitting data again in that band (periodicity) [54]: T off = T air T dc −
    T air , (15) In the case of sending a message with a payload size of 51 bytes
    and a spreading factor of 12 while respecting a duty cycle limit of 1% (which
    dictates that the time for data transmit/hour is 36 s), the time off is 4 min
    and 57 s. Since the LoRa gateway utilizes a downlink channel allowing for a higher
    duty cycle and higher transmit power operation, a loss due to lowering the spreading
    factor can be resolved by transmitting at a higher power [4]. However, an optimal
    combination of energy consumption regarding limited battery life should be achieved.
    To achieve a longer sensor node battery lifetime, e.g., in the order of years,
    the LoRaWAN nodes need batteries with greater capacity than typical button cell
    batteries, e.g., of AA type, but these are more expensive [47]. The results presented
    in [47] show that an appropriately configured LoRaWAN sensor node powered by a
    battery of 2400 mAh can achieve a 1-year lifetime if sending a message every 5
    min and a theoretical lifetime of 6 years for infrequent communication. Moreover,
    an energy consumption of 0.05–0.44 mJ and a battery lifetime between one and 13
    years, respectively, are obtained for a device running on two AA batteries when
    transferring data from 1 to 10 times per hour [53]. For the chosen packet payload
    sizes, the calculator [79] is applied to estimate the differences in energy consumption
    for several types of batteries which can supply sensor nodes, as presented in
    Table 7. The assumptions considered are processing power of 15 mW for 5 ms, confirmed
    reading of a sensor value per each period, and sleep mode consumption of 10 µW.
    The worst-case results have been calculated for the usage of SF12, transmission
    power of +14 dBm, and with the acknowledgment in the second Rx window. The best-case
    results have been calculated for the usage of SF7, transmission power of +2 dBm,
    and with the acknowledgment in the first Rx window. As can be seen from the comparison
    of the collected results, a substantial energy consumption reduction can be achieved
    by transmitting smaller data packets. Table 7. Battery lifespan. Since sensor
    nodes are supplied with cell batteries upon delivery, purchasing a solar panel
    initially represents an additional cost in contrast to the sensor nodes, which
    are only battery-powered. The cost of a set of cell batteries represents approximately
    12 times the cost of a cheaper sensor or approximately 2 times the cost of a more
    expensive sensor [80]. Additionally, the cost of a solar panel represents 8 times
    the cost of a cheaper sensor, or 4/3 times the cost of a more expensive sensor.
    For instance, while temperature and luminosity sensors are cheaper, humidity and
    atmospheric pressure sensors are examples of more expensive sensors. In the case
    when the duration of the battery’s lifetime is short and frequent battery changes
    are required, the application of solar power supply represents an effective solution
    in the long term. However, due to the limited capacity and lifetime of batteries,
    they need to be replaced after a particular time, even if solar power is used.
    However, in sensor networks where more sensor nodes are implemented, the energy
    consumption per sensor node for the exact total generated network traffic in the
    same period becomes lower than when fewer sensor nodes are implemented. Thereby,
    the battery life per each sensor node is extended, and the battery needs to be
    changed less often, which demands less energy from the solar collector. In Table
    7 data related to battery consumption are presented in cases where different packet
    sizes, different numbers of messages, and different network parameters, such as
    SF, are used. As presented, the longest battery life is achieved when smaller
    packets are sent, when packets are sent less often, and when SF7 is used, and
    not SF12. 4. Results and Discussion 4.1. Evaluation of Communication Range and
    Channel Attenuation Modeling Different scenarios are selected to analyze, in actual
    conditions, the propagation of LoRa signals at different distances and in different
    environments. The propagation of LoRa signals in rural environments (with and
    without obstructions such as a forest), suburban environments, and urban environments
    are considered. Two stations, transmitting and receiving, are examined, providing
    point-to-area and point-to-point communication services. The environments in which
    line-of-sight is impossible due to obstructions are taken into consideration in
    the conducted analyses. Some realistic case study scenarios are considered, in
    which the distance between the receiver and the transmitter is less than 100 m,
    500 m, 2 km, 5 km, and 7 km, respectively. Therefore, the chosen distances between
    the receiver and the transmitter are much lower than the theoretical and experimental
    range described in the literature [81], which refers to open environments under
    line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. In the rural LOS scenario, the transmitter antenna
    is placed above a grove of trees. In contrast, in the considered NLOS scenarios,
    the transmitter antenna is positioned so that the signal is partially propagated
    through trees or the signal propagation is partially obstructed by buildings.
    In the analyzed cases conducted in this research, the gateway is placed at the
    height of approximately 65 m above the ground. The field experiments are conducted
    using hardware prototypes based on LoRa devices to determine the state and range
    of communication links. In real testbeds, measurements are made using an RFM95/96/97/98(W)
    LoRa module to determine how parameters such as transceiver antenna gain, spreading
    factor, and coding rate influence communication. Different parameters are used
    to measure signal strength and signal-to-noise ratio at various distances between
    the transmitter and receiver and to determine whether it is possible to achieve
    reliable communication in different areas, and under what conditions. The conducted
    study considers operation in the European region, in the EU863–870 ISM band, where
    three default channels are defined: 868.10, 868.30, and 868.50 MHz. Each of these
    channels has a bandwidth of 125 kHz, uses LoRa modulation, and must allow data
    rates from 0.3 kbps to 5 kbps (DR0 to DR5), depending on the SF value set. Considering
    the compromise between range and interference immunity, and energy consumption,
    two transmission power modes, a low-power (LP) mode and a high-power (HP) mode,
    are compared, and their impact on the communication range is analyzed. The LP
    mode with the transmission power of +14 dBm considers high efficiency and low
    current consumption (25 mW). The HP mode with the transmission power of +20 dBm
    considers a more extended range and robustness but has a higher current consumption
    (100 mW). The duty cycle of transmission at +20 dBm is limited to 1%. Although
    the transceiver supports transmit power of up to +20 dBm, according to frequency
    regulations, such power is permitted only for one frequency channel. However,
    any of the six channels can use +14 dBm. The LoRaWAN protocol is used for long-distance,
    low-power communication. A common problem that occurs in for instance, remote
    rural areas, as well as in some other specific deployments, such as in forests
    [82], is the lack of a seamless power source that allows the installation of gateways
    near an area that needs to be covered by the LoRa signal. Also, this causes the
    occasionally complex interconnection of gateways with the infrastructure of the
    core network. In these cases, it is necessary to use a more extended communication
    range. While communication over long distances of multiple kilometers is used
    for IoT, the narrow bandwidth can make it unreliable, and there may be significant
    losses in the delivery of sent packages. Moreover, since the line of sight is
    not always free of obstacles from vegetation or buildings, this imposes NLOS conditions
    that impair transmission quality. The performance metric used is packet delivery
    percentage. Therefore, the conclusions about the transmission quality, according
    to measured packet delivery percentage, and the combinations of communication
    parameters that give the best results are presented hereafter, as well as in Figure
    2 and Figure 3. Figure 2. Delivery rates of packets with the maximal size. Figure
    3. Delivery rates of packets with a minimum size. As presented within the NLOS
    scenarios, some unsuccessful transmissions of packets are noted. The number of
    unsuccessful transmissions is more significant with a greater distance and less
    visibility between the transmitter and the receiver. During the measurement and
    data-collection process, the LoRa signal’s bandwidth was set to 125 kHz. Moreover,
    the transceiver is configured to use different values of spreading factor, two
    of which are selected for more detailed analyses. These are SF = 7 (minimum value)
    and SF = 10 (optimal energy consumption if a more extended range needs to be ensured).
    Furthermore, the LP mode with the transmission power of +14 dBm for low current
    consumption (25 mW) and the HP mode with the transmission power of +20 dBm with
    higher current consumption (100 mW) are chosen. Table 8 shows the amount of delivered
    packets compared to packets sent with different configurations of SF and CR network
    parameters in different scenarios. Accordingly, 100% indicates that all sent data
    has been received. Circled values are those in which the most efficient data transfer
    was achieved in each of the scenarios, considering the combination of network
    parameters that represents a more energy efficient solution. Table 8. Measured
    packet delivery ratio. The presented results indicate that, among all considered
    scenarios, the most critical packet deliveries are in remote suburban and rural
    areas with no direct optical visibility since NLOS conditions impair transmission
    quality. Therefore, data with the best values for a particular scenario were selected
    among the obtained data. In doing so, the differences in the obtained results
    should be considered with regard to the selected packet sizes. The selected packet
    size values were Pmax = 51 bytes and Pmin = 11 bytes. As shown in Table 8, during
    the scenario selection process, the selected scenarios (the ones with the white
    background) are those in which the percentage of successful transmissions is the
    highest among all collected results within each particular scenario. However,
    when several options have the same percentage of packet delivery, the combinations
    of communication parameters that enable lower energy consumption are chosen within
    the selection process. According to previously conducted analyses, they include
    combinations in which smaller transceiver power values are selected (LP mode,
    compared to HP mode) due to lower energy consumption, a lower value of the SF
    parameter (7, compared to 10), if possible, considering the quality of communication
    (the higher percentage of packet delivery), and the higher value of the CR parameter
    (4/5). The presented results reveal that there is no packet loss up to a distance
    of 500 m, regardless of the NLOS conditions. Moreover, within 2 km and at a more
    extended range from the transmitter, in the case of NLOS (non-line-of-sight blocked
    by some obstacles and possible interference from other radio systems), there are
    situations where a complete loss of communication occurs. However, the number
    of delivered packets can be increased with adequately selected communication parameters,
    as, for instance, higher SF and, if necessary, lower CR values since combinations
    with minimum CR are more susceptible to noise. Moreover, the following must be
    observed. Despite some sources, the packet delivery level increases with the amount
    of data sent. Also, with a shorter packet length, the percentage of packet delivery
    is higher in some cases. Therefore, even in NLOS conditions at distances over
    5 km, it is possible to achieve communication, while it is necessary to consider
    the usage of higher SF values. In further analyses of the quality of communication,
    the performance metrics used on the receiving end are the Received Signal Strength
    Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). The conducted analyses consider
    the power received at the end of the symmetrical half-duplex communication link
    between the transmitter and the receiver. Measurements of received signal strength
    (RSSI) and noise impact on the signal (SNR) enabled conclusions about the transmission
    quality concerning the achieved packet delivery rate, as presented hereafter,
    with the highlighted combinations of communication parameters that produce the
    best results. The RSSI measures the incoming signal power at the RF input port,
    evaluated within the receiver bandwidth. This value is absolute in units of dBm
    and with a resolution of 0.5 dB. The RSSI value is usually used to determine the
    most significant possible distance between the transmitter and the receiver since
    the signal strength decreases as the distance between the transmitter and the
    receiver increases [52]. However, the signal strength also depends on the interference,
    i.e., the noise level. Therefore, the RSSI can sometimes indicate incorrect positioning
    of equipment [83]. In order to minimize the effects of obstacles on communication
    between the receiver and transmitter as much as possible, during all measurements,
    the gateway was placed at a height slightly above 60 m. Nevertheless, even then,
    direct visibility between the sensor node and the gateway was not enabled because
    the sensor node, considering its purpose, was placed too low to receive the most
    valuable results of the measurement. Moreover, the value of signal versus noise
    represents the comparison of the signal strength to the noise power. It is denoted
    as SNR, and its unit of expression is dB. SNR is the best indicator of obstacles
    in signal transmission. A positive SNR value means the signal is stronger than
    the noise, and a negative SNR means that the noise overpowers the signal [84].
    For the listed combinations of communication parameter settings, measurements
    of RSSI and SNR values are carried out using the RFM95/96/97/98(W) LoRa module.
    For the signal strength at shorter distances, higher RSSI values are obtained.
    The obtained RSSI values are around −80 dBm at distances less than 100 m, at distances
    of 500 m between −100 and −110 dBm, and at greater distances from −110 to −130
    dBm. Moreover, with increasing distance between the transmitter and the receiver,
    the values of the SNR parameter decrease. In NLOS scenarios, the influence of
    obstacles on the SNR levels can be noted as well. The SNR values become negative
    at distances ≥2 km, which means that the received signal operates below the noise
    floor. In addition, the moderate success of the collected transmissions within
    each scenario is calculated for the measured range of RSSI and SNR values, and
    some unsuccessful transmissions are noted. Finally, as presented, the number of
    lost packets is recorded for the RSSI parameter values less than −110 dBm and
    the negative SNR parameter values. According to the specifications of the transceiver
    used in the measurements [54], under an extended range mode of operation, and
    in the case of 125 kHz bandwidth, the following RF sensitivity levels can be realized:
    −118 dBm for SF = 6, −123 dBm for SF = 7, −126 dBm for SF = 8, −129 dBm for SF
    = 9, −132 dBm for SF = 10, −133 dBm for SF = 11, and −136 dBm for SF = 12. A message
    is received if the signal strength is higher than the receiver’s sensitivity.
    During the measurements, the LoRa signal’s bandwidth was set to 125 kHz, and the
    transceiver was configured to use the different values of spreading factors. As
    presented in Figure 4, obtained from the analysis of the collected results, this
    enabled receiver sensitivity of up to approximately −130 dBm. Figure 4. Limits
    of reliable data transmission. (a) Original picture after conducted measurements;
    (b) Retouched version of original picture with the displayed rectangle within
    which confirmations of packet delivery are required, and black line on the left
    of which packets have not been delivered. The results presented in Figure 4 and
    Figure 5 were obtained from approximately five hundred conducted measurements
    of SNR and RSSI values, as described in more detail in [52]. Several spots with
    missing values were found in Figure 4, evident after analyzing the collected data
    from Figure 5 and from all additional sets of SNR and RSSI values with SF7-SF10
    [52]. The spots were then filled and values were calibrated. Therefore, Figure
    4 was updated from scratch and presented in this form after the retouching process
    to obtain a complete view of the values. According to the collected results about
    the unsuccessful transmissions, it can be concluded that for SNR[dB] < 0, for
    the purpose of a reliable data transmission, confirmations, i.e., acknowledgments,
    are also necessary. The results of the conducted research in this paper are first
    collected for all measurements in all scenarios to obtain Figure 5 presenting
    the limits of reliable data transmission. Based on it, it is possible to check
    whether the measurement results obtained in real time fit into the areas where
    an acknowledgment of packet delivery is required or not. If the measurement data
    is within the framed area (i.e., if values of RSSI are between −120 dBm and −110
    dBm), there is a higher probability that a packet delivery confirmation is required
    and it can be sent. For RSSI values lower than −120 dBm (i.e., if values are between
    −130 dBm and −120 dBm) the loss of packets occurs and confirmation of its delivery
    is necessary. Figure 5. Comparison of measured RSSI and SNR values. The values
    of SNR at which transmission errors, i.e., BER, occur within the communication
    process depend on the value of the SF parameter and, to some extent, on the CR
    values as well [76,85,86]. To quantify this, it is assumed that all losses are
    caused by channel gain variability [86]. To reduce data transmission losses in
    LoRa communication, it is possible to use the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) mechanism
    for optimizing data rates, air time, and energy consumption in the network. The
    ADR mechanism controls a sensor node’s spreading factor, bandwidth, and transmission
    power to optimize device power consumption while ensuring that messages are still
    received at the gateways. Generally, the sensor nodes close to gateways should
    use a lower spreading factor and a higher data rate, while sensor nodes further
    away should use a high spreading factor because they need a higher link budget.
    When ADR is in use, the network server is capable of increasing the data rate
    and can indicate to the sensor node that it should reduce its transmission power,
    while the node can use an automatic data rate reduction when it detects that it
    is not receiving any response from the network. It is important to note that ADR
    should be enabled only if a sensor node has stable RF conditions. The network
    server takes the 20 most recent uplinks as the input for the optimal data rate,
    starting when the ADR bit is set. These measurements contain the frame counter,
    SNR, and the number of gateways that received each uplink. The maximum SNR of
    the last 20 received uplink messages is used to determine the quality of the link
    between the node and gateway. If the SNR is lower than required (e.g., if BW =
    125 kHz is considered, for SF = 6: SNR = −5 dB, for SF = 7 (DR5): SNR = −7.5 dB,
    for SF = 8 (DR4): SNR = −10 dB, for SF = 9 (DR3): SNR = −12.5 dB, for SF = 10
    (DR2): SNR = −15.5 dB, for SF = 11 (DR1): SNR = −17.5 dB, and for SF = 12 (DR0):
    SNR = −20 dB), the network server tries to decrease the data rate or increase
    the transmit power [4]. According to the obtained results of the conducted measurements
    shown in Figure 4, it can be seen that the area where increased packet losses
    occur due to signal weakening is located precisely in the area of SNR values specified
    as marginal for the application of ADR. The most significant losses occur at SNR
    values lower than −5 dB if the RSSI values are lower than −110 dBm. Furthermore,
    it is also evident that, in the case when the SNR values are lower than −5 dB
    and the RSSI values are in the range from −110 dBm to −120 dBm, data delivery
    still occurs, while in the case when the RSSI values are lower than −120 dBm,
    the result is a complete packet loss. 4.2. Evaluation and Optimization of Energy
    Consumption in Simulated LoRa Networks Considering everything stated so far, a
    prime focus of the conducted research in the following part of the paper is on
    a detailed analysis of the impact of payload size on energy consumption based
    on simulation process conducted using simulator [87]. Input values used in the
    simulation are the ones presented in Section 3.2 describing energy profile of
    LoRa sensor node, as well as all parameters presented in Section 3 and Section
    4.1. The selected payload sizes correspond to real-life applications related to
    monitoring environmental parameters used in precision agriculture. Therefore,
    the maximum possible payload size of 51 bytes, an average size of 11 bytes (used
    in most commercially available applications), and a minimum size of 6 bytes (proven
    optimal for the chosen precision agriculture application) are considered. Thus,
    the analyses are conducted to quantify the impact of relevant LoRaWAN parameters
    and mechanisms on energy consumption in the scenarios in which different packet
    payload sizes are used. In order to save energy, non-time-critical data can be
    accumulated. Furthermore, by increasing the payload size, the overhead related
    to header information decreases, and the number of retransmissions in a stable
    propagation environment reduces. For this reason, it was assumed that the grouped
    measurements of different parameters are sent within the same packet for the analyses
    conducted in this paper. Typical applications of sensor networks in precision
    agriculture for environmental monitoring are time-related. Collecting current
    data is essential to obtain more detailed information about specific agrometeorological
    parameters, for example, the amount of precipitation, such as rain, in specific,
    more frequent periods. Hence, it is vital to provide a considerable amount of
    helpful information. As opposed to the default transmission rate (λ) of 0.02 bits
    per second, equivalent to transmitting a 9-byte message every chosen hour, for
    instance, in [3], the data transmission rate is adjusted to the quantity of data
    that should be transmitted, i.e., to the actual packet size, as well as the packet
    transmitting interval. The interval is set to 10 min. This means the packet is
    transmitted every 10 min, so six packets are transmitted per hour. Moreover, the
    overhead data are considered for assessing the accurate transmission rate, as
    presented in Table 9. Unlike the previously conducted analyses [3,4], in which
    the transmission rate does not match the size of the packet and is set to a fixed
    rate of 0.19 × 10−3, this approach considers the actual packet size in determining
    the transmission rate. This is the main difference between the previously conducted
    analyses in [3,4], and the analyses conducted in this work, which result in more
    precise results of the subsequent simulation procedures. Table 9. Packet payloads.
    One of the possible energy efficiency mechanisms is reducing the total volume
    of sent data and an adaptive data sampling process. With less frequent data transmission,
    the overhead of starting and initializing a transmission is also lower. As already
    proven, approaches based on reducing the number of packets transmitted can improve
    the success rate of packet delivery. According to the TTN Fair Access Policy,
    for a maximum packet size of 51 bytes, a total of 10 packets/hour cannot be exceeded.
    Therefore, the transmission interval is set to 10 min, which means that data is
    transmitted every 10 min, so six packets are transmitted per hour. Although the
    sampling period of 10 min is more extended than the minimum of approximately 5
    min, determined by considering duty cycle regulations, it is still short when
    energy savings are considered. However, it is coordinated with the necessary data
    related to measuring the amount of precipitation, especially in the case of short-term
    intense precipitation, after which the need for irrigation can be significantly
    reduced. The network’s capacity is reduced, not only due to transmissions in the
    downlink but also due to the off-period time following these transmissions. 4.3.
    Overview of Simulation Results The performance of the network and individual sensor
    nodes is evaluated based on the number of uniquely received packets and the mean
    ratio of the number of uniquely received packets on the gateway to the uniquely
    transmitted packets per node, i.e., the data extraction rate. This indicates how
    reliably the intended payload bytes are received by the gateway. Moreover, this
    differs from the packet delivery success ratio because it does not include retransmissions
    in the calculation. Hence, the main objective is that the intended payload is
    received by the gateway, while the number of retransmissions necessary to achieve
    this goal is of secondary importance. The collected results of the simulation
    process are presented and compared hereafter. According to the results presented
    in Figure 6, it can be observed that the substantial energy in the transmit (Tx)
    and receive (Rx) states can be reduced by disabling confirmed messages. In addition,
    since analyzing energy consumption optimization regarding the reduction in acknowledged
    transmissions, the impact of the duty cycle limit on the downlink capabilities
    of the gateway is also considered. The gateway cannot acknowledge all confirmed
    messages if only the default channels are utilized. Consequently, the number of
    retransmitted packages increases. Regarding the collected results for the deployed
    LoRaWAN sensor network scenarios, it can be concluded that the number of acknowledged
    frames must be minimized as much as possible to avoid capacity and energy drain.
    Figure 6. TxRx energy consumption per unique packet of one sensor node. The communication
    channel variance, measured in dB, concerning the average path loss, i.e., path
    loss variance (PLV), is a consequence of varying propagation characteristics of
    the signal in space and time. As presented, the channel dynamics significantly
    impact the performance of a LoRaWAN network and the energy efficiency of the nodes.
    In general, the following can be stated. First, the ADR mechanism attempts to
    achieve a robust signal while considering energy consumption. This is achieved
    by lowering the data rate when the channel conditions worsen and increasing the
    data rate when the SNR conditions improve. According to the results presented
    in Figure 7, it is evident that ADR should be used in the analyzed scenarios since
    substantial energy savings can be achieved by enabling ADR. ADR reduces the energy
    consumption of the sensor nodes. First, it optimizes the LoRa parameters in such
    a way that nodes do not transmit with more power than needed. Secondly, this inherently
    diverges the utilized spreading factors, yielding fewer collisions. This demonstrates
    the importance of including ADR in assessing and optimizing transmission parameters
    in LPWANs to ensure a long battery life of sensor nodes. Figure 7. Consumed energy
    per byte for different packet payload sizes. However, ADR reacts slowly in situations
    with many devices or when a significant channel variance is present. The current
    ADR mechanism is unable to adjust for rapid channel variances. This effect is
    negligible if confirmed messages (i.e., retransmissions) are employed to ensure
    receiving each intended message. If no acknowledgments are used, the data extraction
    rate decreases when the channel variance increases. The nodes are unable to adapt
    adequately to the channel. Concerning the data extraction rate, it is better not
    to enable an adaptive data rate when not using confirmed messages. However, this
    results in higher energy consumption. Despite the beneficial effects of increasing
    the payload size, sending more bytes per packet increases the total number of
    bytes sent redundantly. After receiving 20 uplink messages, the network will respond
    with adequate ADR parameters to accommodate non-optimal propagation [88]. For
    larger payload sizes, this implies that more bytes have been sent before the LoRa
    parameters are adjusted to the channel. In addition, ADR changes the parameters
    in steps, which causes an even slower adaption to the propagation environment
    for larger payload sizes. This effect is notable when observing the energy consumption
    of nodes with a slow data transmission rate. This results in higher energy consumption.
    Therefore, LoRa devices should send smaller packets to adapt to the channel faster
    since this will reduce air time and energy consumption for packets sent with non-optimal
    parameters. The energy per useful bit is a function of the maximum range and different
    payload sizes. With high SF values and an increase in the payload size, the energy
    per useful bit decreases. Also, with low SF values, the payload variation does
    not substantially affect energy per bit. In extension to these analyses, the analyses
    carried out as part of this work consider fixed, predefined payload sizes when
    estimating the transmission rate values. Therefore, the corresponding transmission
    rate calculated is used for each scenario related to the estimation of energy
    consumption based on the selected packet size. The conclusions based on the obtained
    results fulfill those obtained in [3,4,15], and indicate that, regardless of SF
    values, if the payload size decreases, the energy per useful bit also decreases,
    as well in the chosen scenarios of optimal packet sizes in bytes for the given
    case study. Delivering a large number of packets in a short time by a more significant
    number of nodes causes bursts of collisions, as presented in Figure 8. Figure
    8. Percentage of bytes that collided out of the total number of bytes sent. In
    LoRaWAN, the reliability of packet delivery is achieved through the acknowledgment
    of packets in the downlink. However, sending confirmation increases the energy
    consumption in the network. Therefore, when there is a certain tolerance for packet
    loss, as is the case when sending not so time-critical data, for instance, data
    related to the state of the environmental and agronomic parameters, it is possible
    to omit sending confirmations. This is especially appropriate in cases of implementing
    sensor networks with a smaller number of nodes and sending data less often, where
    the frequency of possible collisions is reduced. Moreover, this is also appropriate
    in cases where high signal quality is ensured and there are no significant losses
    during packet transmissions. Considering what has been stated, it can be concluded
    that in some cases, acknowledgments of packet delivery are not sent due to savings
    in energy consumption. However, to ensure the successful delivery of the amount
    of data needed to gain insight into the value of environmental and agronomic data
    necessary for crop condition assessment, it is recommended to use packet sequence
    numbers nevertheless. In this way, the server could check the received traffic,
    and in the critical case of a more considerable difference between the sequential
    numbers of the two successively received packets, it can inform the sensor node
    that ADR should be applied and continue sending data according to its recommendations.
    The LoRa network server can monitor the detailed radio information from all gateways
    that receive a given frame. These data include information about the gateway,
    extended unique identifier (EUI) of the networking devices (sensor node), server
    timestamp, acknowledgment flag as set by the device, frame counter (FCnt), and
    encrypted data payload. In addition, some extended radio information such as the
    radio frequency, spreading factor, bandwidth, coding rate, the gateway’s Rx UTC
    and GPS time, and the gateway’s position (latitude and longitude) can also be
    added. According to this information, the network server can control the sequence
    number of the particular packet received from the selected sensor node. A standard
    comma-separated value (.CSV) file which is presented to the receiving end contains
    the following columns: EUI, timestamp, FCnt, frequency, data rate, RSSI, SNR,
    gateway EUI, port, data E.g.,: 0004A30B00FFEF62,1655557243123,161,868500000,SF11

    BW125 4/5,-115,-7.8,024B0BFFFF0310B2,1,693e8001bd3e58000000ff ⋯ Therefore, it
    is evident that, based on continuous monitoring of the counter (FCnt), an insight
    into its changes can be gained to define an arbitrary maximum deviation from two
    consecutive counter values before the application of ADR is requested. In the
    case that the application server contains some data, for instance, about ADR usage,
    which it needs to transmit to a specific sleeping sensor that sends data periodically,
    when that sensor is a Class A device, the application server must wait for an
    uplink from the sensor before it can send its data [72]. The application server
    immediately transmits the downlink once the uplink is received. Upon receipt of
    the downlink, the sensor goes back to sleep. This way, even if some overhead is
    present, energy savings can be achieved. Furthermore, as can be concluded from
    the collected results presented in Figure 9, the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx)
    state energies are the most significant contributors to total energy consumption.
    However, the sleep mode energy has a more significant share in the total energy
    if ADR is used while the confirmations are omitted, as presented in Figure 10.
    The results show that optimizing the LoRa parameters such as SF, CR, and payload
    size is a crucial element in reducing the consumed energy by the sensor node.
    The total consumed energy per useful bit is a function of the payload at different
    spreading factors (SF). For the more excellent value of SF, more time is taken
    to send a packet, so more consumed energy is needed to transmit data. Moreover,
    when the coding rate (CR) decreases, the time on air and, consequently, the consumed
    energy increases. Furthermore, there is a trade-off between the LoRaWAN communication
    range, the spreading factor, and the transmission power. The range is a function
    of SF at different transmission powers. If the SF increases, the LoRaWAN range
    increases as well. Moreover, the LoRaWAN range increases with increasing transmission
    power. It can be concluded that the theoretical maximum range that can be achieved
    at the determined power level is obtained with the highest SF. Figure 9. Percentage
    of TxRx energy in the total consumed energy. Figure 10. Total consumed energy

    Confirmed packets with and without ADR. Saving electricity is one of the fundamental
    priorities in all aspects of modern life [89,90,91]. The results of this work
    show the saving of electricity in precision agriculture. Limitation of the proposed
    study relate to the fact that only data for three carefully selected sizes of
    packets that contain data essential for precision agriculture are presented in
    the paper. However, these sizes correspond to one of the smaller, average and
    the largest packet that can be sent over the network. Moreover, it was shown that
    a 6-bit packet is sufficient for transferring the same amount of data as an 11-bit
    packet. 5. Conclusions and Recommendation This paper analyzed the energy-efficient
    operation of a LoRa-based wireless sensor network intended for precision agriculture.
    This type of sensor network may be used for crop condition monitoring by measuring
    essential environmental parameters. The paper proposed a concise presentation
    of information in the packet payload (a 6-byte payload format, which provides
    the same amount of useful information as the 11-byte payload used with commercially
    available devices). The given example of the selected smaller packet size is a
    more suitable solution in terms of energy saving. Furthermore, the difference
    in the analyses carried out in this paper compared to the analyses carried out
    in the literature so far lies in the definition of an adequate transmission rate.
    While the analyses carried out so far have assumed fixed values of the transmission
    rate, in this paper it was assumed that the transmission rate changes with each
    sending, considering the amount of data in the sent packets, i.e., the size of
    the packet. This affects the results, because in this paper it was proven that
    for better energy efficiency of communication, it is important to adjust the transmission
    speed to the actual size of the packet. So, the high transmission rate can be
    more energy-efficient method when sending smaller packets. By testing LoRa communication
    modules in real case study conditions, the results collected through field measurements,
    simulations, and laboratory tests were compared. An optimized energy model for
    LoRa sensor nodes was presented. It was shown that the consumed energy changes
    with different parameter settings. Optimizing LoRa parameters, such as SF and
    CR, regarding the required long-range communication is crucial in reducing the
    energy consumed by the sensor nodes in the case study areas. However, it is proven
    that, regardless of SF values, if the payload size decreases, the energy per useful
    bit decreases as well. Moreover, it is evident that ADR should be used in the
    analyzed scenarios since substantial energy savings can be achieved by enabling
    ADR. After receiving 20 up-link messages, the network will respond with adequate
    ADR parameters to accommodate non-optimal propagation. Therefore, LoRa devices
    should send smaller packets to adapt to the channel faster since this will reduce
    air time and energy consumption for packets sent with non-optimal parameters.
    Finally, it was concluded that receiving a transmission acknowledgment consumes
    energy, which considerably reduces the sensor node lifetime. Therefore, another
    contribution of the paper is the graph showing the limits of reliable data transmission.
    According to the obtained graph, it is possible to identify areas within which
    it is not necessary to send acknowledgments, which can significantly reduce energy
    consumption based on the last measured SNR and RSSI values. Moreover, the selection
    of the frequency of sending acknowledgments must also be compliant with the ETSI
    and LoRaWAN standards, which also apply to gateways. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    has been effectively used in a wide range of industries to enhance the performance
    of the network [1]. WSN-based systems are employed in a variety of sectors, including
    commercial, governance, and the private sector, and even farming and healthcare.
    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a vital part of smart agriculture schemes.
    Consequently, one of the most significant problems in WSNs has been power usage
    [2]. To develop a WSN based information platform to perform an additional significant
    part in agricultural manufacture, the wireless sensor nodes ‘restrictions on energy
    efficiency should be overcome. Due to their ability to increase farmers’ awareness
    of crop conditions, resource usage, and environmental variables, WSN technologies
    have attracted significant interest and have a promising future [3]. Communication
    technology helps farmers increase agriculture production by sending farmers vital
    information regarding planting, seed production, and improving soil quality [4].
    Smart agriculture can collect a variety of data on the farmland, such as the soil''s
    pH, CO2 concentration, and greenhouse climate and humidity, through the usage
    of WSNs [5]. This knowledge can be analysed in real-time, which can maximise agricultural
    production. A huge number of sensor nodes should be installed in order to implement
    farming methods [6]. Performance Agriculture was described along with the different
    approaches that are available to maintain and control the appropriate environmental
    parameters for the specific crop [7]. The proposed algorithm utilises the evaluation
    of probability values [8]. In WSNs, the most popular routing protocols are hierarchical
    systems because they are considered to be the most energy-efficient [9]. The network
    is divided into groups called clusters by any of the algorithms, and each cluster
    has a head, or base station, called Cluster Head (CH). Meta-heuristics like genetic
    algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization
    (PSO) algorithms and etc. Are frequently employed in a number of scientific disciplines
    to find the shortest path [10]. Data is gathered by the CH prior to transmitting
    them to the hub, and Cluster Members (CM) are notified [11]. Researchers suggest
    Energy Efficient and Reliable Routing based on Deep Learning and Fuzzy Logic as
    a solution to this problem (EERR-RLFL) [12]. Deep learning-based techniques for
    atrial fibrillation identification have greater discriminative power to find informative
    features compared to classic feature extraction-based methods [13]. So it makes
    perfect sense to use deep learning technology for atrial fibrillation automatic
    detection [14]. In this research, a relay selection method for energy usage minimisation
    is developed using a classification technique constructed based on a Naive Bayesian
    algorithm. It is important to find abnormalities in a sensor network in order
    to make conclusions from the data gathered. The Naive Bayes classifier calculates
    the CH conditional probability, and the CHs are chosen in accordance with this
    prediction. To maintain the effective security of the network, a hybrid optimization
    approach dubbed Monarch Cat Swarm Optimization is suggested. This research analyzes
    three well-known base algorithms, Multilayer Perceptron, Support vector machine
    (SVM) as well as K-Nearest Neighbours. Three diverse versions of the Naïve Bayes
    machine learning classification technique as, Bernoulli Nave Bayes, Multinomial
    Nave Bayes and Gaussian Nave Bayes. In many different application scenarios, the
    Naive Bayes-based categorisation method is a very effective machine learning technique.
    Develop an outlier detection strategy for identifying the outliers present in
    the network using Feed forward neural network (FFNN) based deep learning approach.
    To establish a routing system that is secure and energy-efficient in order to
    reduce energy usage. A chaotic Moth-flame optimization (MFO) algorithm-based CH
    selection method is being proposed. Relay Node (RN) selection mechanism is done
    based on a probability based Naïve Bayes (NB) approach. This article is structured
    as follows: Related works are discussed in Section 2. The proposed methodology
    of this research work is provided in Section 3. The experiments and results are
    presented in Section 24. Additionally, Section 27 presents the findings of the
    study and recommends future investigation. 2 RELATED WORK Recently various energy
    efficient and reliable routing protocol had developed in WSN. Among them outlier
    detection is a major challenge while performing data transmission. Some of the
    articles regarding in this proposed work is listed as follows. Fu et al. [15]
    designed to provide reliable information to everyone in challenging situations
    through an environment-fusion multipath routing protocol (EFMRP). Using a hybrid
    potential field that takes into account depth, residual energy and environment,
    EFMRP makes routing decisions. The main idea is to instruct data packets on which
    routes provide the routing survival trade-offs, best latency and energy-saving.
    When the environmental field is created and updated using the sensing capability
    of WSN itself, constructed routes can avoid travelling through risk zones to maintain
    the paths safe. Specific maintenance, traffic distribution, and retreating procedures
    are recommended to enhance the functioning of the EFMRP. The Butterfly Optimization
    Algorithm is employed to choose the ideal CH from a group of nodes according to
    a design by Maheshwari et al. [16]. The CH is chosen taking into account the remaining
    energy of the nodes, distance to the base station, distance to the neighbours,
    node centrality and node degree. The optimum route between the CH and the base
    station is chosen using ACO, which considers node degree, distance and residual.
    The efficiency of this suggested method is evaluated in terms of data packets
    received, dead nodes, energy consumption and alive nodes by the Base Station (BS).
    To balance energy consumption and path stability ratio this study introduced the
    dynamic Multi-hop Energy Efficient Routing Protocol (DMEERP) established by Nivedhitha
    et al. [17]. In the first section, assumptions were made about the network model,
    cluster formation, and multi-hop route establishment. All CH and cluster member
    records are stored and kept current by the Super Cluster Head. If the current
    CH fails, a new one will be obtained using the node activation and weight factor.
    The path reliability ratio is estimated in the second section to expedite packet
    routing while reducing packet loss. The third portion implements an energy model
    based on a channel capacity model. Chowdhury et al. [18] introduced an energy-efficient
    SEMantic CLustering (SEMCL) model to address the high energy consumption problem
    in a clustered WSN. By utilising significant intra-cluster data similarity and
    geographical data correlation, our technique generates clusters that are energy
    efficient. To offer precise data prediction with minimal mistakes, designers use
    the Robust and Efficient Weighted Least Square approach (REWLS). We present a
    distinct technique, called Genuine Outlier Detection, in order to identify between
    true and false outliers in the REWLS approach in order to further improve the
    Quality of Service (QoS) on data correctness (TOD). To further improve the QoS
    in communications, a stable backbone network based on the link quality of the
    data forwarding path has been established. Ayadi et al. [19] have created a novel
    method for identifying and detecting outliers to complement the hardware reliability
    and limit checking methods already in usage. To get past these problems, this
    method introduces a WSN based on Combined Kernelised Outliers Identification Technique
    for defect detection in water pipelines. First, sensors placed outside the pipes
    are used to collect data on training pressure measurement. Then, in order to create
    discriminant vectors, these data are fed through the Kernel Fisher Discriminant
    Analysis data reduction technique. The One Class Support Vector Machine algorithm
    was used to classify the feature sets that were retrieved using the provided method
    by using these vectors as inputs. Combining the advantages of these devices was
    the main objective of this work in order to increase the efficiency of the water
    pipeline monitoring system. The classification accuracy of our combined kernelised
    outlier detection system was analysed and compared with various other approaches.
    Dattatraya and Rao [20] devised a new mechanism for selecting cluster heads to
    extend the network lifetime as well as improve energy efficiency. This work also
    presented an innovative fitness-based glowworm swarm with the fruitfly algorithm,
    which combines the Fruitfly Optimization algorithm (FFOA) and Glowworm Swarm Optimization
    algorithm to choose the best CH in WSN. The effectiveness of the designed Fitness
    based Glowwarm swarm with Fruitfuly (FGF) Algorithm is compared to other existing
    techniques such as Cuckoo Search, Group Search Ant Lion with Levy Flight, Genetic
    Algorithm, Artificial Bee Colony and PSO, Ant Lion Optimization and FFOA. They
    have the capability to function normally in any peculiar or evil environment that
    individuals are unable to close. However, due to a number of delicate variables,
    effective data transfer between nodes is nearly impossible. A dependable and energy-efficient
    routing protocol (REERP) to extend network lifetime was presented by Shukla and
    Tripathi [21]. Three distinct phases make up this research. A hierarchical cluster
    structure for network deployment constitutes the first stage. The second section
    describes an effective RN selection scheme that takes into account the cluster''s
    node density, the shortest distance between nodes when choosing an RN, and the
    RN communication range when choosing the next RN. An efficient routing method
    that satisfies the demands of the suggested model is the final step. Therefore,
    these networks'' issues and challenges are different from WSNs. The WSN-Assisted
    IoT network, which consumes limited and non-rechargeable energy resources, is
    not complete without the sensor nodes. Wireless sensor networks are typically
    used in unsupervised situations and are characterised by energy sensitivity and
    low cost, making their performance susceptible to the effects of the internal
    and external environment. Existing routing protocols tried to improve energy efficiency
    and routing dependability from the perspective of the network itself, but they
    neglected to consider the influence on the environment from the outside, making
    them unable to respond quickly to the dynamic changes of the surroundings (e.g.,
    wildfire). The routing protocols'' ability to survive in hostile conditions is
    thus under doubt. Because the WSN nodes run on batteries, they eventually run
    out of energy. The network''s life expectancy is impacted by this energy restriction.
    3 PROPOSED METHODOLOGY This paper proposed an outlier detection using FFNN for
    energy efficient routing during transmission in WSN based smart agriculture. Technologies
    for smart agriculture are effective techniques for raising farm productivity and
    sustainability. They produce numerous streams of spatial, temporal, and time-series
    data that can point to a number of problems with agricultural productivity and
    efficiency. In this situation, the identification of observations that differ
    from the norm might be assisted by the detection of anomalies. A large group with
    a great amount of source of energy sensor nodes is often involved in WSN-based
    agricultural technology. The cluster formation and data aggregation are achieved
    through by minimising energy efficiency. The management and monitoring of farm
    production in terms of plants, weather, freshwater use, etc. Has also benefited
    greatly from wireless sensor nodes. The WSN has developed into a significant study
    area for variables such as power usage, an efficient process for finding cluster
    heads, a routing protocol, networking strength, packet delay, energy loss or other
    factors. As a consequence, the proposed scheme develops an outlier detection based
    energy efficient and trustworthy routing protocol utilising deep neural network
    technology for use during transmission. Figure 1 shows the Architecture of the
    proposed model. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Architecture of the
    proposed model. The proposed methodology consists of three phases such as outlier
    detection, CH selection, and RN selection. Outlier detection consists of node
    deployment, data gathering, preprocessing, feature Reduction and detection of
    an outlier. The first process is n number of sensor nodes are randomly deployed,
    base station, sink node and sensor node components are present within the network.
    Each sensor is located an equal distance to make a network. Identify the outlier
    from normal nodes which provide reliable data for decision makers. Data cleaning,
    shuffling, and normalisation are the methods involved in the preprocessing stage.
    The preprocessed data is given to the input of the Linear Discriminant Analysis
    to the dimensionality of features reduction. Hence having two nodes normal and
    attack node feed-forward neural networks is used to detect outliers. Normal nodes
    are further considered for the reliable and energy efficient route selection.
    This routing protocol is designed based on CH selection and RN selection. Cluster
    Head selection is achieved using a chaotic MFO algorithm for attaining energy
    efficiency. Then RN selection is performed for attaining reliable routing by using
    NB based probability approach. 3.1 Node deployment The initial process is sensor
    node deployment in the farmland area. Based on the considered land area there
    are two hundred sensor nodes are initially deployed, within the area of 100 m
    × 100 m. The sink node, as well as the base station, are included in the selected
    cultivation region, each sensor is located at an equivalent distance to make a
    network. After node deployment, the outliers or anomalies in the network are detected
    in order to prevent malicious attacks and identify sensors with outlier data to
    provide reliable data for decision-makers according to the packet features of
    the sensor nodes. 3.2 Outlier detection in wireless sensor network based smart
    agriculture The outlier detection process consists of three phases such as preprocessing,
    feature reduction and detection. The steps involved in this phase are described
    as follows. 3.2.1 Preprocessing Several preprocessing methods are applied before
    the detection of outliers in order to improve the classification accuracy. Data
    cleaning Each dataset contains a number of records. Before training the model,
    a dataset must be examined for blank and undefinable records. All undefined records
    were changed into empty records in order to clean up these datasets. In this method,
    all empty records were eliminated from the datasets after undefined values were
    converted to empty. Shuffling This technique is used to shuffle dataset tuples.
    To improve the performance of the model and for better testing, it required shuffled
    data. The shuffling method was used to shuffle all of the data in a random fashion.
    Normalisation The process of normalisation involves scaling numerical values between
    typical scale ranges and removing anomalies from the dataset. In order to organise
    the input data inside specific ranges throughout the normalising process, a linear
    normalisation strategy is used. One of the most well-known and frequently used
    data preprocessing techniques, Min-Max normalisation, is applied in this proposed
    model. It is a procedure that linearly modifies the variables, where min and max
    are the minima and maximum values of x, and x is the gathering of x''s observed
    values. (1) Where represent the new value from the normalised results and shows
    the old value, Max (X) displays the maximum value in the dataset, and Min (X)
    displays the minimum value in the dataset. 3.2.2 Feature reduction This method
    employed an Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for feature reduction. To reduce
    the dimensionality of the data, the preprocessed data is provided as the method''s
    input. A dimensionality reduction method that is frequently used for supervised
    classification problems is linear discriminant analysis, also known as normal
    discriminant analysis or discriminant function analysis. It is used to represent
    group differences by dividing groups into two or more classes. The features in
    a higher dimension space are projected into a lower dimension space using this
    technique. The LDA technique has been applied in various applications because
    of the large number of characteristics or dimensionality. Agriculture application
    is a term used to denote a few LDA techniques and their various applications.
    Using computational models, an unknown sample can be categorised into a predefined
    species in agriculture applications. The goals of the LDA technique require the
    projection of the original data matrix onto a lower dimensions space. This objective
    required the completion of three steps. The first step is to identify the in-between
    variance, also referred to as the between-class matrix or the separability between
    various classes. The second step is to determine the within-class variance or
    within-class matrix, which is the difference between the mean and the samples
    of each class. Development of a lower dimensional space that maximises between-class
    variance and minimises within-class variance is the final phase. The number of
    samples of the class is represent as , the total number of samples is define as
    , the sample of class is represented by column vector . LDA looks for a projection
    vector to shorten the distance between samples that belong to the same class and
    lengthen the distance between samples when compared to samples from different
    classes. The next Fisher criterion is used by LDA to determine this projection
    vector. (2) Here and represent in between including within scatter matrices, respectively.
    The following formulas are used to calculate and are calculated as follows. (3)
    (4) Where denotes the mean characteristic of samples of the class, the mean feature
    of all samples is defined as . The following optimization issue is provided in
    Equation (5). (5) From Equation (5), a small positive constant is represent as
    λ. From Equation (4) is solved we can see that eigenvector corresponding to the
    minimal eigenvalue of is the best projection vector, or a. The ability to discriminate
    between many classes with a single projection vector is typically insufficient.
    Mainly, in real-world applications, we choose one set of projection vectors that
    satisfy the ideal Fisher criterion. For multi-class classification for multi-class
    classification. Projection matrix A is selected as a set of eigenvectors corresponding
    to the first k smallest eigenvalues of . Let be the set of the selected k eigenvectors,
    we obtain a discriminative feature vector of each sample by . 3.2.3 Detection
    of outliers through Feedforward neural network The dimensionality reduced features
    is further sent as an input into supervised learning algorithm for predicting
    the outliers in the network. The classifier detect whether a node is normal or
    attack node [22]. The Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), an inference model, modifies
    its inputs using a set of parameters and optimization methods. The weights are
    originally trained on a collection of instances using the formula , whose training
    labels or classes are well-known [23]. The training labels are binary vectors
    in dimensions with the type , where (6) From Equation (6), class true as an input.
    A likelihood-like distribution M classes, and a t time of is the result of the
    FNN. (7) Where a vector of weights and f (.) is any function and a weight vector.
    By minimising a cost function J, specifies the input samples. By minimising a
    cost function , over input samples, weights are estimated by inversion. (8) With
    linear activation , such as unity , FNN transforms into a linear regression for
    a single set of weights . (9) (10) When the weight matrix is constrained to ,
    the answer for the Weight class is, (11) Assume that the FNN can be trained with
    just one example from each class, resulting in Corresponding to t, and . Depending
    on the weight, differentiating, (12) From Equation (12), controls the regularisation
    and the ideal FNN weights from Equation (7) such that . 3.3 Cluster Head selection
    In this suggested strategy, use the chaotic MFO algorithm to choose the most effective
    cluster. Cluster Head selection is performed among the nodes in the cultivation
    area based on the cumulative parameters. In terms of distance, node degree, and
    centrality factor, these parameters determine which node will become a CH. The
    nodes and sink nodes are used to choose the initial CH. After CHs have been identified,
    cluster formation begins. The cluster allocation is used to decrease energy waste
    and increase the lifespan of the sensor node network. As a result, each sensor
    node is controlled and monitored by the CH. As a result of using cluster-head
    analysis methods, energy efficiency can be enhanced. The main node''s non-cluster
    head main node transmission and communication distances will be shortened if a
    cluster forms. 3.3.1 Energy level Assuming that WSN nodes must rely on their batteries,
    energy efficiency is a primary issue. (13) Where is residual energy, shows energy
    rate of node and is initial energy. 3.3.2 Distance In this proposal, the distance
    is determined by Received Signal Strenght Indicator (RSSI) during measuring node
    deployment in the network. Distance is an object''s overall movement, regardless
    of direction. The formula is used to calculate the RSSI value at a specific distance.
    (14) Where is the received signal strength at a distance of 1 m, RSSI is the received
    signal power, and is the route loss index, which relates to the environment. After
    selecting the highest RSSI number, we use the provided formulas to change it to
    distance. The highest possible value of the RSSI, known as RSSImax, can be obtained
    after evaluating the RSSI values. (15) Where, among all the RSSI values, RSSI
    max denotes the strongest received signal strength. A is the strength of the signal
    that was received at a distance of one-m n is the path loss index and environmental
    factor. 3.3.3 Node degree This results from the CH selection process''s careless
    disregard for node degree. Cluster heads are chosen based on their node degree
    centrality, and battery life, while super cluster heads are chosen according to
    their battery life, mobility and centrality. In the clustering process, a sensor
    node with the greatest number of CM is usually selected as the CH. Node degree
    can define as follows as described in Equation (16) (16) Here is cluster member
    of the cluster and m is a number of cluster heads. 3.3.4 Centrality factor One
    of the most popular index based on network data are centrality metrics. While
    calculating a network node importance, eigenvector centrality takes into account
    the importance of its peers. (17) From Equation (17), a scaling factor is define
    as , which is set to normalise the score, reflects the extent to which you weight
    the centrality of people ego is tied to and displays the adjacency matrix, is
    the identity matrix and one is matrix of all ones. 3.3.5 Moth-flame optimization
    Moth-flame optimization is the most recent optimization used in the suggested
    swarm intelligence method. The transversal orientation mechanism used at night
    by moths to navigate across flames is effectively simulated by the proposed method.
    Using a unique flame assigned to each moth, the Based classification better balances
    exploring and exploiting of the target region. A matrix is used to describe a
    group of moths in order to simulate the moths'' spiral: (18) Where represent the
    quantity of dimensions and is the number of moths. For each moth, it is assumed
    that the relevant fitness values are kept in an array, as in Equation (2). (19)
    Flames are the other essential elements in the suggested method. It is made to
    look like the moths'' matrix: (20) If there is an array that can be used to sort
    the flames according to the value of the goal function. (21) Flames are where
    moths are best positioned, as search agents travel about the search area. Three
    tuples of approximate functions, which are described as follows, make up the general
    structure of the MFO method. (22) A random population of moths along with their
    proper fitness values are generated by Equation (22), which define that is a function.
    Following is Equation (23) signifies the function of . (23) In order to relocate
    the moths throughout the search space, a key component of the MFO is specify as
    . This function takes a matrix of as an input and returns a new . (24) The function
    responds with true or false depending on whether the stop condition is met or
    not. On satisfying the terminating requirement, the function returns true; otherwise,
    it returns false, that is provided as the following Equation (25). (25) Equation
    26-28 are used in the P function to update the position of each moth in relation
    to its associated flame: (26) (27) (28) From the above equations, the spiral function
    is define as of flame, stands for the separation between the moth, refers to moth,
    indicates, flame and is a constant in order to define the spiral function. Equation
    (28) represents the spiral flight of a moth mathematically. The spiral equation,
    which describes how the moths shift locations all around flames but not necessarily
    in the area between them, is the key component of the MFO algorithm. As a result,
    it''s possible that this algorithm will continue to maintain the trade-off between
    exploring and using the search process. Figure 2 shows the flow chart of a chaotic-moth
    Flame algorithm. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flow chart of a chaotic-moth
    Flame algorithm. 3.3.6 Chaotic moth-flame optimization A chaotic MFO algorithm
    is applied for finding the optimal energy level, distance, and node degree and
    centrality factor. The fitness function is to minimise the distance between sensor
    nodes, energy level, distance, node degree, and centrality factor for this multi-objective
    optimization problem. The conventional heuristic methods, as everyone is aware,
    create initiation points at chance and operate under the premise of uniform distribution.
    This might cause each unit to be located far from the ideal location and raise
    the level of uncertainty. Therefore, the beginning location of this algorithm
    may, to some measure, have an impact on the MFO features. Swarm intelligence optimization
    techniques that have great initial population orientations will quickly convergence
    and produce good results. Chaos is a dynamic activity that is unexpected and sensitive
    to beginning states with ergodicity and stochasticity. Logistic maps are one of
    the most well-liked chaotic sequences. The MFO population has been selected in
    chaotic maps in order to initialise. In equation, logistic maps are displayed
    (12). (29) When the parameter , which determines the level of chaos, has a value
    of 4, the system is entirely chaotic. Given that chaotic processes have been effectively
    used in a variety of real-world computational problems, it is logical to assume
    that they offer a significant amount of opportunity for initial optimization.
    The steps of MFO initialisation process is given below. Step 1: Set the initial
    moth''s location at random. Step 2: To map the additional moth positions using
    the logistic maps, beginning with the first location. Step 3: Determine each moth
    fitness. Step 4: In order of fitness, sort the moth. Step 5: As the beginning
    swarm, keep the approximate number of moth in front of the sorted order. Step
    6: Finalise initialisation. 3.3.7 MFO optimization for cluster head selection
    In the present study, we propose a chaotic-moth flame techniques by incorporating
    chaos maps into the MFO algorithm to enhance its performance. The primary innovation
    of the proposed technique is the identification of a hybrid phase that exists
    between both exploration and exploitation. Considering the node degree, the distance,
    residual energy level as well as centrality factor, these parameters determine
    which node will become a CH. Step 1: Initialisation Under this swarm intelligence
    system, the starting phase is viewed as a statistical method. In this initial
    phase, the sensor nodes are initialised. (30) When denote number of sensors nodes
    in the considered network. Step 2: Fitness Function In this multi-objective optimization
    process, the fitness function is to minimise the distance between sensor nodes,
    energy level, node degree and centrality factor. (31) The simulated chaos system
    is used to assess each node''s fitness. In order to choose the best CH, these
    four parameters are minimised to attained optimal CH. Step 3: Updating In order
    to determine the ideal CH within the sensor node, the values of distance, energy
    level, node degree, and centrality factor associated to nodes are updated for
    each iteration. Step 4: Termination Once the required information is identified,
    the selection procedure is ultimately concluded. This CH selection strategy reduce
    the inner cluster node degree, residual energy level, distance, as well as centrality
    factor by identifying the head node to be placed in the optimal position. 3.4
    Relay node selection Any energy-efficient routing method must take into account
    the best relay nodes candidate among the available collection of network nodes.
    There is some potential for the network''s nodes to serve as relay nodes, which
    could result in data packet duplication at the receiving end. The probability-based
    approach known as NB is used to choose the relay nodes in order to get around
    these problems among the candidate nodes. 3.4.1 Overview of Naïve Bayes The Bayes
    theorem is the foundation of the naive Bayes classifier, also known as the basic
    Bayesian classifier. It is simply a straightforward Bayesian network (BN), and
    it works best when the inputs are highly dimensional. Figure 3 displays BN as
    a specific example of the naive Bayes classifier''s structure. FIGURE 3 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Structure of naïve Bayes classifier. Assume that a collection
    of samples is provided, as well as the class labels where . Assume also that the
    samples contain the n characteristics . In order to determine the label for any
    future sample x, a naïve Bayes model must be learnt using the samples. In order
    to calculate the probability of the categorisation variable c based on the feature
    variables a basic BN classifier calculates the posterior using the Bayes rule
    as shown in: (32) Estimating the combined likelihood function in Eq. (31). By
    adding two assumptions on Equation (32) it is frequently simplified as the naive
    Bayes classifier. The first is the so-called class-conditional independence assumption,
    which states that, given the classification variable c, all traits are sovereign
    of one another. It is expressed as follows mathematically: (33) As a result, the
    combined conditional probability is the sum of all the minimal conditional probabilities.
    The second premise says that all features are purely dependent on the classification
    variable c. The naive bayes classifier can be obtained as follows if the two assumptions
    are applied to the general BN classifier: (34) The conditional probability of
    given c (that is, and the prior of c (that is, can be acquired from the classification
    process by using training dataset to build the model. Additionally since is typical
    for a particular sample, it can be disregarded during the classification process.
    We can therefore arrive at the following model as a result. (35) This can be used
    to determine the sample''s class. When applying it, Equation (34) is frequently
    changed to its logarithmic form as seen below: (36) 3.4.2 Naïve Bayes for rely
    node selection through estimating probability For reliable route selection the
    relay nodes are selected using probability based approach with some node features
    like, distance, residual energy, packet reception ratio, and etc. Choosing the
    RN with the best trust value and likelihood of becoming a RN. The trust value
    is computed according on several packet features of the nodes like, forward packets,
    acknowledgement and energy level. Nodes are designated as relay nodes by the willingness
    to transfer data if the probability is greater than or equal to the minimal trust
    value. In order to select the RN some features are considered such as, packet
    reception ratio, energy level and distance for selecting the best probability
    through NB. In this proposed model, the probability value of the packet reception
    ratio is taken as high and energy level is taken as less and distance is taken
    as less. According to these conditions, the relay nodes are chosen for reliable
    routing. The process for selecting RN is given as follows. Packet reception ratio
    of each node is estimated by using the following equation. (37) , and displays
    total number of transmission packets, number of packets misrouted and number of
    packet dropped. Energy level of each node is estimated by using the Equation (13).
    Distance of each node is estimated by using the Equation (15). 3.5 Naïve Bayes
    algorithm Let''s examine it using an illustration. This is a list of possible
    target variables and sensor nodes for training. Therefore, based on the state
    of the sensor node, we classify whether the possibility of a sensor node is real
    or not. Let''s perform it by following the steps listed below. Step 1: Create
    a frequency table from the dataset. Step 2: Using probabilities such as the packet
    delivery ratio of 0.33 and the probability possibilities of 0.46, develop a likelihood
    table. Table 1 illustrate the features Sample, Table 2 illustrate the Frequency,
    Table 3 illustrate the Probability. Step 3: In order to determine the posterior
    probability for each class, utilise the Naive Bayesian equation. The result of
    a prediction is the class with the highest posterior probability. Possibilities
    will possible if the feature is packet delivery ratio. If this statement is correct,
    this can solve it using above discussed method of the posterior probability. Here
    we have 3/7 = 0.42, 5/15 = 0.33 7/15 = 0.46. Now, 0.46/0.33 = 0.58, which has
    higher probability. A similar approach is used by Naive Bayes to forecast the
    probability of various classes based on various attributes. This probability is
    used to choose the relay nodes for dependable routing. Once discovered the energy
    efficient and reliable route the data can be transfer in a secure manor. 4 RESULT
    AND DISCUSSION The proposed Outlier Detection based Energy Efficient and Reliable
    Routing Protocol (OEERRP) using deep learning algorithm in WSN based smart agriculture.
    The proposed model is tested on MATLAB software with a variety of system configurations
    including an Intel (R) Core Processor with an i5-330s CPU @ 2.70 GHz, 8.00 GB

    packets/sec Energy 10 J The initial process is node deployment, in this research
    deploy 200 sensor nodes in the cultivation area of . Moreover, the deployed nodes
    not in motion which are static. 10 J of energy range is comprised in each sensor
    nodes. Then according to the packet features of the nodes in the network the attack
    nodes are separated from the normal nodes. Packet transmission rate, Hop count,
    Number of mis-transmitted packets and Number of packets delivered and etc. Are
    the considered packet features. Therefore, in this research concentrated to perform
    outlier detection using a deep learning approach. The sensor node related information
    is gathered from [24]. This outlier detection is done through three process, the
    first one is pre-processing which includes data cleaning, shuffling and normalisation.
    Then the second process is feature reduction, here LDA perform the feature reduction.
    The third process is detection of outliers through FFNN that can predict whether
    a node us outlier that is, attack or not. After this detection, 100 nodes are
    categorised as normal nodes these nodes are considered in the further process
    which is shown in Figure 4. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Normal nodes
    from outlier detection. Figure 5 shows the cluster formation. The normal nodes
    only considered in this cluster process which is highlighted in various colours.
    Each colour scheme in the chart denotes a different group of these deployed nodes,
    which are grouped in clusters. The heart of the smart environment is also where
    the entire network is positioned. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Cluster
    formation. Figure 6 displays CH selection through chaotic-moth flame optimization
    algorithm. Figure 3 represents the CH selection for each group member that compose
    the CH. To have an efficient set of CH in the given solution, use the chaotic-Moth
    flame optimization algorithm. The CH selection utilises a variety of elements,
    including energy level, distance, node degree, and centrality factor. While every
    node transmits information to the cluster heads immediately to extend the network''s
    lifetime, power is lost. The platform''s nodes are grouped into clusters to address
    these issues, which can extend node lifespans and save energy. FIGURE 6 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Cluster Head (CH) selection. Figure 7 shows how to select
    a secure routing protocol with rely nodes using an NB-based probabilistic approach
    method. The RN is selected following the identification of a CH to provide the
    most secure route. Distance, CH level, and energy level are factored in when locating
    the relay nodes. Specific requirement sets for choosing relay nodes are generated
    using these three input factors. Data is prepared to send through the path using
    the suggested outlier detection once the energy-efficient and secure route has
    been determined. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Relay Node (RN) selection.
    4.1 Performance analysis of the outlier dectection model The outlier present in
    the network are identified through the proposed FFNN classifier. The performance
    of the proposed FFNN classifier is evaluated according to the performance metrics
    such as, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, error, precision, false positive
    rate, F1_score, kappa are the taken performance metrics. Feed forward neural network,
    SVM, K-nearest neighbour, Red forest (RF) and NB are the performance techniques.

    Outlier Detection based Energy Efficient and Reliable Routing Protocol protocol
    The performance of the recommended OEERRP protocol is tested with several metrics
    such as, packet delivery ratio, packet loss, average residual energy, throughput,
    delay. Outlier Detection based Energy Efficient and Reliable Routing Protocol,
    EFMRP, DMEERP, SEMCL, Reliable and energy efficient routing protocol (RERP) are
    recognized as existing routing protocols. Several protocol evaluations are reviewed,
    and the results are clearly explained as below. Figure 16 shows the suggested
    and existing WSN-based methods that rely on the Packet Delivery Ratio (%). The
    graphical description is based on several WSN techniques and the value of packet
    delivery ratio in percent on both the X and Y labels, respectfully. The offered
    WSNs solution is found to have a higher ratio of packet delivery. When compared
    to other approaches, the proposed method''s packet delivery ratio is found to
    be 0.91% higher. The results show that the EFMRP is 0.86%, DMEERP is 0.82%, SEMCL
    is 0.75%, and RERP is 0.73%. The suggested and existing WSN-based techniques that
    rely on packet loss (%) are illustrated in Figure 17. The graphical visualisation
    is based on several WSN techniques and the percentage value of packet loss on

    WSNs technology. The packet delivery ratio of the suggested protocol is observed
    to be 0.08% lower as compared to other methods. Depending on the figures, the

    method consists of three steps such as outlier identification, CH selection, and
    RN selection. In the deployed nodes, outlier detection was used to identify the
    attack nodes from the normal nodes. Outlier identification, feature reduction,
    preprocessing, and data gathering were included in this level. The network''s
    base station, sink node, and sensor node components are all present in the initial
    step, which comprises randomly distributing a number of sensor nodes. To form
    a network, each sensor was equally spaced from the other sensors. Detected the
    outlier from the normal nodes that provide reliable information to the outcome.
    To reduce the size of attributes, the preprocessed data was entered into the linear
    discriminant analysis. In order to recognise anomalies, a feed-forward neural
    network comprising two normal and attack nodes was used. To use a chaotic MFO
    technique, the CH selection was carried out based on the residual energy level,
    distance, node degree, and centrality factor. These criteria determine which node
    will become a CH. After that, a reliable routing protocol was created using a
    probability technique based on NB for RN selection. The proposed routing protocol
    was tested on MATLAB software to estimate its effectiveness. Outlier Detection
    based Energy Efficient and Reliable Routing Protocol algorithm attained a 0.91
    (%) Packet Delivery ratio, 0.08% packet loss, 0.91% Average residual energy, 2.8
    (Mbps) of throughput, and 26 (sec) Delay. Moreover, the proposed algorithm attained
    7.4 (sec) of execution time which is better than the prior methods. The proposed
    routing algorithm is applicable for providing security in both server-to-device
    and device-to-device scenarios. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors declare that no funds,

  description: In recent years, several applications of Internet of Things (IoT) have
    been observed in various areas including environmental monitoring, healthcare
    systems, cognitive smart agriculture, industrial control, smart homes, intelligent
    transportation systems, and traffic management. For such applications, wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs) are generally deployed to gather the sensed data from the
    targeted application field. In order to transfer the sensor node data to the gateway
    (sink node), novel routing protocols need to be developed, leading to reduced
    data transmission delay, high data throughput, and improved energy efficiency
    across the network. In this context, geographical routing protocol has been considered
    as a promising approach for the path selection in WSNs. This approach is full
    of scalability and multi-hop routing is performed using local decisions. However,
    geographical routing protocols suffer from the void node problem (VNP) i.e., a
    region where active nodes are not available in the direction closer to the destination.
    Numerous protocols have been designed to get recovery from VNP in 2D networks
    which cannot be directly applied to 3D networks. The 3D routing includes the networks
    deployed in the hilly area, high buildings, airborne region, underground, underwater
    and so forth. On applying the 2D routing protocols on complex 3D topology, the
    network may face additional problems like packet looping, routing failure, ambiguity,
    or increased data latency due to longer path. Further, the majority of geographical
    routing protocols follow the boundary of void which leads to a longer path. In
    order to address the aforementioned challenges, this paper presents a novel anchor-based
    void detouring routing (AVDR) protocol where anchor node is treated as a sub-destination
    which provides the direct smaller path between source and gateway nodes. The proposed
    method bypasses the void boundaries and directly connects source to anchor, anchor
    to destination, or two successive anchors. Further, anchor information is distributed
    to the desired region to reduce the periodic anchor advertisement process. The
    effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested over both, real field data
    set and simulated testbed with OMNET++ simulator. The results obtained over real
    field data set claim that the proposed method takes only 29.09 ms (ms) for transferring
    the data on an average. However, this value is 32.37 ms, 34.32 ms, 33.61 ms, 37.20
    ms, and 38.73 ms, respectively, using A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D, BSMH, and RPL methods.
    Moreover, it is also noted that the proposed method achieves an improvement of
    8.2%, 7.54%, 7.66%, 8.49%, and 8.22%, in routing stretch when compared to aforementioned
    methods, respectively. This improvement with respect to network overhead is 30.25%,
    57.45%, 51.05%, 75.56%, and 58.89% using the proposed method.

    in industries, the transformation of the business system has increased through
    the use of the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT solutions offer connectivity
    anytime and anywhere through a huge network of IoT devices containing sensors
    or softwares. Sensors are crucial part of IoT network where a large number of
    sensing devices are responsible for monitoring the application field [1]. The
    IoT network is a network of several connected IoT devices where each device is
    composed of a mandatory sensing unit, processing unit, communication unit and
    an optional positioning unit. It is responsible for sensing, processing, collecting
    and delivering the sensed data to the gateway (sink node) for further processing.
    The gateway provides connectivity between local sensor network and global network
    (Internet). In order to achieve the vision of interconnecting the devices, there
    is a requirement for a suitable routing approach to enable communication among
    sensing devices. The routing protocol is responsible for communication between
    gateway and sensing devices where gateway may not be available in the direct transmission
    range of the current sensor [2], [3]. Location based protocols are shown as promising
    approaches for efficiently handling such types of conditions. Geographical routing
    protocols (GRPs) consider the geographic locations of wireless nodes where location
    is supported by global positioning system (GPS) or location-aware protocols [4],
    [5], [6]. The GRPs rely on local geographic information and perform multi-hop
    routing with the help of local decisions. These protocols are also known as position-based,
    location-based or geometric routing protocols. GRPs start with greedy mode and
    switch to recovery mode on the occurrence of void node problem (VNP) [7], [8],
    [9]. The VNP is a big issue of geographic routing schemes where a node cannot
    find a neighbor that is closer to the destination. The face routing based approach
    provides a deterministic path toward the destination in connected 2D networks.
    This approach follows a longer path through boundary nodes to detour the network
    void region [10], [11]. However, most existing geographical route selection schemes
    are designed for two dimensional networks, but these schemes cannot be directly
    employed in practical three-dimensional networks. While going through the communication
    from source to the sink that has a void in the intermediate path, it has been
    observed that each packet is required to travel a longer path, i.e., following
    the path around the void. However, for communication from another source, it is
    again required to search the path even if another source is nearer to the previous
    one. The communication with longer distance searched path incurs a noticeable
    amount of search time overhead, which may suffer multiple backtracking. As a result,
    it consumes a lot of energy. This observation can be seen in the example given
    in Fig. 1. Consider the case where node 1 wants to send the data to the sink node.
    Here, communication starts from node 1 and the packet is stuck at node 5. There
    is no directly focused forwarding node available towards the sink. As a result,
    it has to select node 12 and start following the path around boundary. Further,
    it can be seen that while communicating from node 5 to node 7, it is moving toward
    the source. Node 7 is closer to the source and can be reached from source node
    1 via node numbers 6, 8 requiring length 3 hop count. Thus, there is a need for
    direct communication between a source node and node 7 for next time without following
    the longer path. It will avoid additional searching time for node 7 via node 5.
    Further, for the source node 23, the packet is required to backtrack then, forwarding
    the packet to node 16. Here, node 16 can be reached from node 23 via node 29 with
    the length of 2 hop count. Further, previously gathered information can be used
    to get the path without involvement of new searching. In this case, node number
    7 and node 16 can be used to avoid searching for a particular segment. These nodes
    may act as intermediate nodes for a group of source nodes and their information
    is available in each node of the group. Another case is shown in Fig. 2 where
    real field data is taken from of testbed available at FIT-IoT Lab [12], Strasbourg,
    France. This network considers 3D topology where source node 74 transfers data
    packet to sink node 47. Fig. 2(a) represents the problem caused by the void in
    the network. Here, packet is stuck at void node 19 and starts following the void
    boundary nodes through node 18 or node 56. In both of the cases packet has to
    travel the longer path. However, the path length may be minimized through utilizing
    the concept of anchor nodes. The concept of anchor node is presented in Fig. 2(b)
    where node 18 and node 56 are considered as anchor nodes. The source node directly
    approaches the anchor nodes which reduces the path length between source and sink
    pair. Thus, it is observed that direct approaching the anchor nodes will be more
    effective for reducing the route length in case of void in IoT network. Download

    Route with following boundary nodes of void region and backtracking in case no
    other local alternative. The current trend of IoT networks is not limited to the
    territory, these networks are also required at high buildings, hilly areas, underground
    or underwater [5], [13], [14]. In such networks, the location of nodes is represented
    by a three-dimensional (3D) coordinate system. Traditional 3D GRPs also have provision
    to get a recovered path from VNP problem, but the packets have to follow the boundary
    nodes of the void region. This type of recovery strategy unnecessarily increases
    the path length where an alternate smaller path might be possible. The anchor-based
    methods focus on minimizing the path length in the larger volume of IoT network
    with sufficiently increased void in the network. Moreover, these methods are more
    suitable for multi-hop routing in broad geographical region e.g., disaster prone
    hilly areas, step farming fields, and multi-floor buildings, among others. In
    this work, we have addressed the problem of the longer path during detouring the
    void and proposed a novel anchor-based void detouring routing protocol (AVDR)
    for three-dimensional IoT networks. This work is focused on locating and advertising
    intermediate nodes that play vital roles in reducing the path length. These nodes
    act as intermediate source nodes as well as local destinations, also termed anchor
    nodes. The major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (i) We
    have proposed a novel method for locating the anchor node(s) in the large scale
    3-dimensional networks. First, we construct a plane by using source node, destination
    node and void node’s 3D coordinates. Then, we create a perpendicular plane with
    respect to the said plane to divide the desired part of the network. Subsequently,
    we apply an orthogonal distance based procedure in each sub-part of the network.
    (ii) We have developed a novel method to determine the scope of anchor nodes to
    avoid repeated anchor discovery process. Here, we adaptively identified a group
    of nodes which lies inside this scope. Further, we distribute the anchors’ location
    to the identified group of nodes. The nodes from this group may utilize the location
    of already discovered anchor nodes for subsequent communication. Additionally,
    each node adaptively selects the suitable anchor from available anchor nodes.
    Therefore, this method helps in reducing the path length, avoiding unnecessary
    searching of the path, and minimizing the network overhead and overall energy
    consumption. (iii) A novel energy measurement model is developed corresponding
    to the energy consumption by investigating the practical scenarios for the data
    transfer over the developed IoT networks. The rest of the paper is organized as
    follows: Section 2 describes related research work done in the literature. The
    modeling and assumptions related to the proposed method are given in Section 3.
    Section 4 presents the detailed description of the proposed anchor based protocol.
    Further, experimental work, along with its analysis, is given in Section 5. The
    experimental work includes simulated testbed and real field testbed. Finally,
    the paper’s conclusion is available in Section 6. Download : Download high-res

    work The geographical routing protocols rely on local decisions where packets
    follow a greedy forwarding approach to reach the destination node [15], [16],
    [17], [18]. There is a possibility of unavailability of a suitable forwarding
    node which satisfies the greedy approach criteria [19], [20], [21]. This condition
    causes VNP problem [22]. The researchers have made an effort to fix the VNP problem
    with face routing and proposed Greedy-Face-Greedy (GFG) [23], Greedy Perimeter
    Stateless Routing (GPSR) [19] and other variants [24], [25]. These protocols rely
    on the planarity of the network [5], [26] which may not be possible in practical
    complex 3D topology [4], [13], [26]. These protocols follow the longer paths in
    practical scenarios due to boundary based void recovery methods and lack of consideration
    of the third dimension in 3D networks. The path length followed by packet affects
    overall energy consumption. Many efforts have been made to get recovery from VNP
    in 3D networks [4], [5]. Taking care of the third dimension, GDSTR-3D [27], Multihop
    Delaunay Triangulation (MDT) [28], WEAVE [10], 3D real-time geographical routing
    protocol (3DRTGP) [7], OnionMap [13], GPSR-3D [29] and some other protocols came
    into the picture. Zhou et al. [27] proposed GDSTR-3D where each node keeps two-hop
    neighbor information and sets up convex hull tree to route the packet around the
    void nodes. The maintenance of two hop information is quite memory consuming.
    Simon S. Lam and Chen Qian [28] have extended S4 algorithm in 3D network and introduced
    MDT routing protocol. MDT protocol uses virtual links to handle the VNP problem
    and dynamic topology changes. The MDT produces a good packet reception ratio and
    routing stretch, but the end-to-end delay is very high. The WEAVE [10] protocol
    used the concept of checkpoints and waypoints to route the packets in large-scale
    2D and 3D networks. Most of these approaches use periodic beacons to ensure connectivity.
    In reality, maintaining connectivity all the time is not a good idea in any ad
    hoc or sensor network. A node requires the next hop only when it has data packets
    to transmit. Further, the comprehensive survey on 3D routing protocols is given
    in [4], [5], [30] where it has been observed that packets follow void boundary
    nodes to reach the sink node [19], [24], [25], [31], [32]. As a result, boundary
    nodes get overloaded and each packet has to go through a longer path, whereas
    some other alternative may be available [33]. Considering this problem, researchers
    have proposed intermediate sub-destination based protocols [11], [34], [35], [36],
    [37]. The intermediate sub-destination is also termed as anchor node where packets
    may follow several anchors to avoid the void boundary and minimize the path length.
    The main issue with the anchor-based approach is to find a suitable anchor node
    that could optimize the average path length. An effort has been made to find suitable
    anchor nodes in the literature [4], [11], [34], [37]. The idea of projected distance
    based approach has been proposed in EAGR [34], EMGR [37] and EDGR [11] routing
    protocols. In case of network void, the anchor discovery packet traverses around
    boundary of the void and monitors the projected distance on source to sink connecting
    line. Initially, projected distance starts increasing and reaches at peak node
    before decreasing. This peak node is considered as an anchor node. The protocols
    use a reactive approach to find the anchor list prior to starting the communication.
    The reactive approach unnecessarily utilizes the network resources every time.
    The EDGR is an anchor based dual path routing protocol where two anchor nodes
    are to be discovered based on projected distance. In this protocol, the source
    node starts anchor discovery process and then switches to data forwarding after
    identifying the anchor nodes. Each source node has to perform an anchor discovery
    process before data forwarding, which causes a high initial delay. Further, it
    relies on periodically beacon exchange, which creates overhead. As a result, this
    protocol suffers from initial delay as well as additional packet transmission
    overhead. It is also mentioned that EDGR protocol considers 3D network topology.
    However, it uses a 2D plane, ignoring one dimension during the anchor discovery
    process. Ignorance of one dimension may cause actual longer path in practical
    3D networks. The protocol is restricted to the ideal conditions where left and
    right side anchors are available, but in real networks, void area may touch network
    boundary where such anchors may not be available. Nguyen et al. proposed RVMH
    [38] protocol to deal with routing path length issues. Further, it is improved
    in the BSMH protocol [33] and divided the entire approach into three parts. In
    the first part, apply tent rule to detect the void boundary nodes of entire network
    and create convex polygons. In second part, propagate the polygon information
    to the entire network which reduces overall network overhead of repeated polygon
    creation. After getting the void boundary locations, in the third part, the packet
    forwarding has been started. However, approach achieved better routing stretch
    and minimized network overhead, but it still has some functional limitations.
    Creating and maintaining the void convex polygons in practical 3D networks is
    very difficult. Further, each node requires a lot of memory to store the polygons’
    information. Apart from routing strategies, routing protocols rely on certain
    baseline model based on current technology. In this context, Routing Protocol
    for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) [39], [40] provides a baseline model for
    energy constrained IoT networks. RPL has been considered as de-facto routing model
    for IoT networks which offers IPv6 addressing scheme atop of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC
    for Low-Power and Lossy Networks. This model can quickly create a primary route
    using a proactive approach, share routing information and efficiently adapt the
    topology. The literature survey indicates that addressing the void node problem
    is the biggest challenge of any geographical routing protocol. In case of 2D topology,
    this can be deterministically solved using face routing approach by traversing
    the boundary nodes left-hand side or right-hand side. In case of 2D plane, two
    anchor nodes are sufficient to handle void node problem. One anchor node on left
    most side and another anchor for right most side of void boundary can handle the
    connectivity. On the other hand, there is no such deterministic left or right-side
    boundary present in 3D networks. Thus, the identification of anchor node(s) is
    a challenging task in 3D IoT networks. Further, it becomes more challenging while
    ensuring no packet looping, no routing failure, minimized network overhead, unambiguous
    routing with minimized data latency. To fill these gaps, in this work, we shall
    develop a novel anchor-based void detouring routing (AVDR) protocol to improve
    the performance of 3D IoT network. The applicability and effectiveness of the
    proposed method are illustrated over both simulated and real field data sets.
    3. Network model The AVDR routing protocol is used to route a packet from a source
    to a gateway using the concept of local forwarding. The local forwarding is governed
    by constraints available at local node. These constraints include direction of
    the next node, availability of forwarding node, selection of more effective forwarding
    node. Here, first of all, we shall discuss the assumptions considered while modeling
    the proposed protocol. These assumptions are based on the literature [41]. 1.
    The network consists of three dimensional static randomly deployed sensor nodes
    where node location after its deployment in remains fixed. 2. There is a destination
    node, known as gateway/sink node, and its location is known to each node in the
    network. Gateway and sink keywords are used interchangeably. 3.1. Terms used In
    this section, we discuss the terms and symbols used in the paper. First, we provided
    a list of terms along with their description and then, we prepared a table for
    special symbols. All the special symbols are given the Table 1 followed by their
    brief description. Sensor node: It is a node consists of a set of embedded sensors,
    along with limited resources (e.g., computing, memory, battery and GPS, etc.)
    and communicates via wireless channel (e.g., Wi-Fi, ZigBee, UVB, Bluetooth etc.).
    Location of sensor node: The location of sensor consists of their parameters (X,
    Y, Z) where X, Y and Z are longitude, latitude and altitude of location where
    sensor node is deployed. Sensor network: It consists of sensor nodes, i.e., ,....,
    , sensor nodes where a th node have location , communication range , capable of

    deploying number of randomly distributed sensor nodes in 3D space specified by
    latitude, longitude and altitude. The volume of network space where sensor nodes
    are deployed in X Y Z volume. X, Y and Z are the respective maximum difference
    in latitude, longitude and altitude among the coordinates of the network space.
    A node on its deployment, knows its own position and position of sink node. These
    positions are measured in terms of 3D coordinates. Further, it computes the network
    density and network density is stored at each deployed node. The network density
    is the ratio of number of nodes deployed to the total volume of the deployed network
    i.e., network density . The network density measures probabilistic availability
    of next available node as next hop. More density is more chance for availability
    of many forwarding nodes, whereas only fewer number node availability is possible
    in core of sparsely deployed network. The non availability of network forwarding
    node is creating the void. Further, network model and base protocol (A3DR) are
    taken from previous research work [41]. 3.3. Energy consumption model The energy
    needed to send -bit data from node i to one-hop neighbor node j can be calculated
    using the energy consumption model, which is similar to the models given in [11],
    [34], [42]. The major portion of energy consumption needed during (a) data transmission
    at sender node i, (b) data reception at nodes available in the transmission range
    of node i and, (c) data processing at i and j nodes. The energy needed to transmit
    the -bit data with data-rate bits/second, considering path loss in the channel,
    is . Here, is the distance-relative constant of energy consumption and is the
    euclidean distance between node i and node j. The is path loss constant, generally
    between 2 and 6, that depends on the transmission environment [43]. Further, transmitted
    data is received by all the listener nodes in the transmission range of node i,
    so total energy consumption during data reception is proportional to the number
    of nodes in the transmission range of node i. Therefore, the proposed protocol
    adjusts the maximum power according to selected next hop, which minimizes the
    occurrence of other nodes in transmission region of the sender node. Each listener
    utilizes power during transmission time and consumes energy to receive the transmitted
    data. The one-bit receiving energy consumption by the nodes in the neighborhood
    is , where is the average network density in terms of number of nodes per unit
    volume and is the volume of transmission region covered by sender node . The data
    is processed to the intended next hop only and other nodes simply discard it.
    So, data is processed to sender node and receiver node only, which consumes constant
    energy, i.e., . Finally, total energy consumption in one packet transmission is
    given in . (1) A node i receives data from the previous sender, process it and
    forwarded to node j then its energy consumption is equivalent to the sum of all
    three components. It can be computed using formula provided in . (2) 4. Proposed
    anchor based void detouring routing (AVDR) protocol Utilizing the sub-destination
    node concept, the objective here is to reduce the path length by removing the
    redundant path segments and their availability for future course of communication
    to the sink node. Future communication may include data transfer between same
    source to sink or another source node to the sink. The proposed protocol used
    an orthogonal distance based approach while discovering its communication path
    to the sink node. In the beginning, no node knows about the void in network. When
    a node starts communicating with sink node, it may get stuck with void. At this
    point, the current node starts anchor discovery process which requires finding
    a suitable sub-destination node. The number of anchors may vary according to network
    structure, position or size of the void. The anchors’ information needs to be
    advertised to other nodes, which are in the scope of anchors, upon discovering
    the anchor node(s). The anchor advertisement process minimizes the overhead of
    repeated anchor discovery. There is a provision of sharing anchors’ information
    with other nodes in the scope of anchors. So, these nodes could utilize the anchors’
    information. The protocol is distributed in nature where the entire algorithm
    is available at all nodes. Depending on the current condition, any node may work
    as source, destination or intermediate. The current node react on specific events
    and takes appropriate action on receiving the packet. In next subsections, we
    first discuss the anchor discovery process in detail followed by anchor advertisement.
    4.1. Anchor discovery In the beginning, a source node transmits the packet focusing
    on the sink node using A3DR protocol. The packet may be stuck at a node where
    it has to increase its angle repeatedly but did not find any neighbor in the forwarding
    direction. The neighbor may be available at higher value of angle where next selected
    forwarding node has more distance from sink than the previous node. A node is
    said to be void node from where distance to the sink node starts increasing. The
    void node is responsible for starting anchor discovery process, finalizing the
    anchors and broadcasting the anchors’ information to the scope of anchor nodes.
    The anchor discovery process is based on computation of orthogonal distance between
    current node and straight line joining void node and sink node. Suppose the coordinates
    of current node (C ), void node (V), source node (S) and sink node (D) are , ,
    and respectively. The mathematical formulation for orthogonal distance is shown
    in Eq. (3). (3) where and are 3D vectors. The cross product of two vectors ( and
    ) is as below in Eq. (4) (4) The magnitude of these two vectors are: (5) and (6)
    substituting the values of Eqs. (5), (6) in Eq. (3) (7) where Download : Download

    distance demonstration. Example 4.1 The demonstration of orthogonal distance is
    represented in Fig. 3 where nodes D, V, C and C with their coordinates are node
    15 (800, 400, 0), node 5 (350, 430, 0), node 12 (320, 480, 0) and node 19 (250,
    540, 0) respectively. The straight line between node 5 and node 15 is VD line
    and dotted line represents its continuation. The orthogonal distance from node
    12 and node 19 (represented using red lines) can be computed using Eq. (7). The
    computed orthogonal distances are 154.32 m from node 12 and 209.53 m from node
    19. Anchor Discovery Process: In case of void, forwarding nodes are selected around
    the boundary of void, where orthogonal distances of each node keep increasing.
    It means that we are moving away from the sink node. During this selection, a
    node with the highest orthogonal distance from other nodes, selected around the
    boundary of void. The node with the highest orthogonal distance is termed as an
    anchor node. This anchor node is also known as intermediate destination toward
    sink from the source node. The orthogonal distance starts decreasing after reaching
    the anchor node while traversing the void boundary. This can be seen in Fig. 4
    where node 9 has the highest orthogonal distance whereas node 5 has least orthogonal
    distance. Download : Download high-res image (367KB) Download : Download full-size

    image Fig. 4. Projection on source–sink line. The anchor discovery process starts
    with forwarding of packet contains discovery and direction fields to denote the
    status of packet. The discovery field is initially set to false and it will be
    true on the occurrence of void node. Further, it becomes false on allocation of
    node as anchor node. Algorithm 1 demonstrates the procedure to check the occurrence
    of void node. After detecting the void node, start searching anchor nodes in four
    directions. These four directions are given as top-left, top-right, bottom-left
    and bottom-right for 3D routing protocol. For clarity, we first discuss anchor
    discovery process for 2D plane where we can choose directions as left and right.
    The direction is calculated based on equation of VD line i.e., line joining void
    node and sink. The equation of VD line is given in Eq. (8). The value is returned
    as positive number or negative number when substituting the X, Y coordinates of
    current node in this equation. The positive value indicates the left direction,
    whereas the right direction to the line for negative value. This can be seen in
    Fig. 4 where on moving left direction path, we have reached node 9 via nodes 12,
    19, and 7. Out of these nodes, node 5 has least orthogonal distance, while node
    9 has maximum orthogonal distance. Other nodes have distances between these two
    extremes. (8) Further, it is made clear that on following right direction path
    from node 5, one has to backtrack up to node 3 and then start searching for another
    anchor node that is node number 17 via node 39, 24, 29, 16. Thus, we have two
    anchor nodes corresponding to void node number 5. The above process of finding
    out anchor nodes is given in Algorithm 2. In three dimensional coordinate system,
    one has to search the anchor nodes at top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right
    directions. These directions can be obtained by considering two planes where one
    plane is plane coordinates: source node, void node and sink node, as shown in
    Fig. 5. Another plane is perpendicular to this plane, passing through the line
    VD. The mathematical equation of the plane passing through source node, void node
    and sink node is given in Eq. (9). Download : Download high-res image (276KB)

    source, sink and void nodes. The anchor discovery process is again extended to
    cope coordinates. The extension includes condition selecting four directions,
    i.e., top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right, for packet forwarding
    to discover the anchor nodes on the occurrence of void node. The equations of
    base plane, containing source node, void node and sink node, and its perpendicular
    plane are given in Eqs. (9), (12), respectively. The values returned as four combinations
    of positive/negative numbers on substituting the current node’s X, Y, and Z coordinates
    in these equations. The outcome of both equations may be positive–positive, positive–negative,
    negative–positive or negative–negative, representing top-left, top-right, bottom-left
    or bottom-right directions, respectively. (9) The equation of perpendicular plane
    is derived as below: The normalized form of equation of plane can be written as
    (10) Therefore, comparing Eq. (9) with Eq. (10) we have: So, the equation of perpendicular
    plane is the dot product (11) The simplified equation of plane, which is perpendicular
    to the plane with source, sink and void nodes, is given as Eq. (12). (12) Algorithm
    2 considers two cases at the end of anchor discovery process. Case 1: Discovered
    suitable anchor node in specific direction. Case 2: The packet reaches and traverse
    the network boundary in specific direction but does not find anchor node. In case
    1, anchor node transmits arep (anchor reply) message to the void node. The arep
    contains the anchor node’s details, e.g., location and direction. In case 2, a
    node that detects the network boundary transmits the aerr (anchor error) message
    to the void node. The aerr contains direction of void. The void node collects
    the arep/aerr messages and proceeds with anchor advertisement process. Once the
    anchor nodes are detected, their use for other sources, which may communicate
    to the destination node, must be ensured. This is achieved by advertising the
    anchor node details to the other nodes in the anchor node’s communication zone.
    This is discussed in next subsection. 4.2. Anchor advertisement The proposed protocol
    minimizes the packet transmissions using anchor advertisement process. All other
    nodes do not need the anchor discovery process. The anchor information is judicially
    shared with other nearby nodes that may face void node problem. For such nodes,
    anchors are intermediate destinations toward the sink node. Further, these source
    nodes are said to be nodes lying in the scope of anchor nodes. The decision about
    these nodes is done by means of (i) Projection lines in case of 2D coordinate
    system and (ii) Projection plane in case of 3D coordinate system. For 2D, lines
    joining the anchor node and sink node decide the anchors’ scope. The equation
    of these lines are given in Eqs. (13), (14). We put the X, Y coordinate of a node
    in the line equation to check the relative position of the node with respect to
    the line. If the output value is positive, the node lies on one side of line and
    negative output for another side. Therefore, from both line equations, the output
    (positive–positive, positive–negative, negative–positive & negative–negative)
    can be combined as four directions. To ensure the availability of node in the
    scope of anchor nodes, the direction of the candidate node should be same as the
    direction of the source node. (13) (14) It can be seen in Fig. 6 that some nodes
    are lying in the projection of these lines toward the considered source node.
    These nodes are candidates for advertisement of anchor nodes’ information, i.e.,
    node numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34,
    35, 36, 37, 38, 39 are supposed to be user of anchor nodes. First of all void
    node collects the information of anchor nodes. Then, it starts advertising this
    information to the nodes between these two lines. Anchor advertisement procedure
    is summarized as Algorithm 3. In case void node receives aerr message from all
    directions, it means network is disconnected and communication is not possible.
    This message is forwarded to all connected nodes and stop routing process for
    disconnected segment. Download : Download high-res image (242KB) Download : Download
    full-size image This method can be extended to the case where we have four anchor
    nodes for 3D coordinates. Here, we choose four planes: (i) plane containing top-left
    anchor, top-right anchor and sink node, (ii) plane containing top-left anchor,
    bottom-left anchor and sink node, (iii) plane containing bottom-left anchor, bottom-right
    anchor and sink node, and (iv) plane containing top-right anchor, bottom-right
    anchor and sink node. All nodes (towards the source node) that lies within the
    scope of these four planes will be candidate for advertisement. One node is detected
    as anchor node, and it is required to backtrack from anchor node to source node
    via void node: when packet is backtracking, it releases the resources captured
    during the forward movement and frees all resources occupied between anchor nodes
    and source node. Further, source node start path searching with one anchor node
    has least path length. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Nodes in anchor forwarding zone. Example 4.2 This can
    be seen in Fig. 6 where nodes source, anchor , anchor and sink node (D) with their
    coordinates are node 1 (0, 450, 0), 9 (280, 640, 0), 17 (270, 230, 0), 15 (800,
    400, 0) respectively. Here, we have two lines: (i) line joining left anchor node
    and sink node (i.e., node 9 & node 15) and (ii) line joining right anchor node
    and sink node (i.e., node 17 & node 15). substituting the coordinates of node
    9 and node 15 in Eq. (13), the equation of line joining anchor and sink node will
    be: (15) Similarly, the equation of line joining anchor and sink node will be:
    (16) putting the X, Y coordinates of node 1 in Eq. (15) and putting the X, Y coordinates
    of node 1 in Eq. (16) Here, we found positive value with respect to line joining
    anchor and sink node and negative value with respect to line joining anchor and
    sink node. Let us check for node 36 (200, 500, 0) the output of equation of line
    joining anchor and sink node and the output of equation of line joining anchor
    and sink node At node 30, the same pattern is followed and we got positive value
    for line joining anchor and sink node and negative value with respect to line
    joining anchor and sink node. Thus, it is in the scope of anchor nodes. Let us
    again check for node 39 (400, 470, 0) the output of equation of line joining anchor
    and sink node and the output of equation of line joining anchor and sink node
    At node 39, the same pattern is followed and we got positive value for line joining
    anchor and sink node and negative value with respect to line joining anchor and
    sink node. Thus, it is also in the scope of anchor nodes. Let us check for node
    10 (360, 630, 0) the output of equation of line joining anchor and sink node and
    the output of equation of line joining anchor and sink node In node 10, the same
    pattern is not followed and we got negative values in both of the cases. Thus,
    this is not also in the scope of anchor nodes. Now, the nodes in scope of anchors
    got the information about anchor nodes. So, the nodes within the scope of anchors,
    want to communicate with the sink, compute the relative distance to sink via all
    anchors. An anchor with minimum distance is treated as sub-destination node. Above
    examples made it clear that the proposed method addresses the void node problem
    in sufficiently large volume of IoT network. If void region is very small then
    the proposed method works like a traditional greedy geographical routing approach.
    In such cases, overhead of anchor selection and anchor advertisement processes
    gets reduced. Moreover, the proposed method is more suitable for multi-hop routing
    in broad geographical regions e.g., disaster prone hilly area, step farming fields,
    and multi-floor buildings, and other large fields. In next section, we discuss
    the performance evaluation through results generated using simulated testbed and
    real field testbed. 5. Performance evaluation Performance evaluation of the proposed
    method is carried out using simulation study and real testbed results. The results
    concerning route length are obtained in terms of routing hop stretch. Hop stretch
    is the ratio of measured path length and minimum possible path length between
    source and destination. The measured path length is computed using proposed method
    which is a measure of hop count. The stretch factor always becomes more than 1.0,
    but it should be close to 1.0 for a good routing protocol. Further, its effect
    on other quality of service (QoS) parameters is accessed using packet delivery
    ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay (E2ED) and routing overhead. The PDR is ratio of
    total number of packets received at the sink to the number of packets sent from
    source node. End-to-end delay is the time difference between packet generated
    at source node and delivered by the sink node. It is used to evaluate the timing
    performance of the protocol. Overhead is evaluated in concern with transmission
    ratio. The transmission ratio is the ratio of total packets transmitted in the
    entire network over data packets generated from all source nodes. The number of
    packets becomes an overhead if a protocol requires additional packets due to beacons,
    longer path and re-transmissions. In the simulation study, number of transmitted
    packets are fixed (i.e., according to the packet rate), so the traffic overhead
    is computed according to the average number of transmissions occurred with respect
    to one packet from source node. The proposed AVDR protocol is an extension of
    A3DR, so the performance of proposed protocol is compared with A3DR [41]. Additionally,
    to have in-depth performance analysis, it is also compared with other existing
    methods including EDGR [11], GPSR-3D [29], BSMH [33] and RPL [39], [40]. 5.1.
    Experimental conditions The proposed protocol has been implemented on the INET
    framework under the OMNET++ simulator by considering diversified simulation environment.
    OMNET++ is a discrete event simulator for Internet/network systems which is primarily
    used for research purposes. It provides real wireless network environment to perform
    the experimental work where network layer protocol stack is implemented. The parameters
    taken for simulation work are given in Table 2. One thousand IoT devices are randomly
    distributed in a 3D region of . The void zone is created at center of the network.
    Cubical and spherical void structures are considered for the experimental work.
    The sink node is fixed at one side of the network while source nodes are selected
    in such a way that each source has to pass the packet through the void zone. Moreover,
    each node can directly communicate in its communication range which radiates spherically.
    Further, considering the practical scenario, the communication range of each node
    may vary due to its own environmental/physical conditions, so the communication
    range of each node varies between 40 and 100 m. The average and median of the
    communication range are near 70 m. Following three basic simulation scenarios
    are designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol: Table 2. Experimental
    parameters. Parameter Value Simulator OMNET++ [44] (INET 3.6.3 framework) MAC
    IEEE 802.11 (ad hoc mode) Data packet size 32 bytes (UDP datagram) Simulation

    (average and median near to 70 m) Number of nodes 1000 randomly deployed Number
    of source nodes 3 to 24 Void type (1) Cubic void with edge varies between 60 and
    200 m. (2) Spherical void radiating between 30 and 100 m Packet rate 4 packets/s/source
    (i) Number of source node scenario: Here, number of source nodes varies from 3
    to 24 and a cubical void with 200 m edge is fixed at center of the network. The
    coordinates of center of void are set to (200, 200, 150). Other nodes may participate
    in the routing process. (ii) Void volume scenario: The number of source nodes
    is set to 10 and center of spherical void is fixed at center of the network having
    coordinates (200, 200, 150). The void radius varies from 50 to 120 m with an interval
    of 10 m. (iii) Multiple void scenario: The number of source nodes is set to 10
    and two spherical voids with radii varying from 30 to 100 m. Two spherical voids
    are placed so that both voids are separated on shorter radii while these intersect
    each other on longer void radius. The coordinates of centers of both of the voids
    are set to (150, 200, 150) and (250, 200, 150), respectively. In the simulation
    study, each scenario is tested on 10 different random networks (for same number
    of nodes) by changing 10 seed values. Further, for each network three repeated
    executions are carried out. So, each reported result is an average of 30 outputs.
    5.2. Number of source node scenario In the proposed AVDR protocol, one source
    node discovers the location of anchor nodes and forwards this information to other
    nearby nodes. The boundary of these nearby nodes is decided by the position of
    anchors and sink, which consists only nodes that may suffer from void node problem.
    Therefore, the anchor discovery process requires only once and is not affected
    by number of sources. On the other hand, EDGR protocol requires anchor discovery
    with respect to each source node so performance varies according to the number
    of source nodes. BSMH protocol discovers and propagates void boundary nodes to
    the entire network prior to data transmission. The packet rate is set fixed and
    the number of source nodes is increasing linearly, so the total number of packet
    transmissions is also increased. Such a scenario may cause congestion in the network,
    resulting in packet loss, delay in packet delivery, retransmissions, overhead
    etc. This effect is represented in Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10. Fig. 7 depicts
    the delivery ratio of packets under number of source nodes. When the number of
    sources increases, the packet delivery rate of proposed A3DR protocol remains
    constant and provides guaranteed message delivery. There are four anchors available,
    so traffic divides significantly and could not create congestion. Meanwhile, the
    A3DR protocol follows the void boundary so initial packets are dropped due to
    the expiry of packet lifetime during covering the longer path. The delivery ratio
    is still more than 98%. The GPSR3D protocol is showing a downward trend but still
    maintaining a good delivery ratio of about 95% in the worst case. EDGR and BSMH
    protocols rely on beaconing process and report high packet loss due to collision
    on high network traffic. Here, it can be seen that AVDR is providing 0.67%, 7.4%,
    2.13% and 13.66% more delivery ratio over A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols,
    respectively. The following paragraph shows the impact on path length. The routing
    stretch depends on route length traveled by the packet. It is a ratio of measured
    path length traveled by packet and minimum possible path length in terms of hop
    count. It is also affected by increasing number of source nodes in view of higher
    congestion in the network. The higher congestion causes an alternative longer
    path which leads to additional overall energy consumption. The hop stretch of
    AVDR is minimum and varying between 1.10 and 1.15 because packets are traveling
    through the shortest possible path. The 3D anchors bypass the void boundary traversal
    and provide direct shortest path between source and sink. Some initial packets
    travel through longer path during anchor discovery process so it is slightly higher
    than 1.0. The A3DR and GPSR-3D protocols follow void boundary so it covers slightly
    longer path, which results higher route stretch. The EDGR protocol uses 2D plane
    by ignoring one dimension during anchor discovery process. The ignorance of one
    dimension produces longer path which results greater path length. BSMH protocol
    assumes 2D network topology and traverses the void boundary so it is reporting
    highest routing stretch. The routing stretch of AVDR protocol is minimum and it
    is 10.89%, 13.42%, 12.07% and 21.89% better than EDGR, A3DR, GPSR-3D and BSMH
    protocols, respectively. This can be seen in Fig. 8. Next, we shall discuss about
    the effect of number of source nodes on network overhead. Download : Download

    of source nodes on packet delivery ratio. Data transmission amount is a good estimation
    of average energy consumption. It considers that most of the energy is consumed
    in data transmission. The number of packet transmitted is directly proportional
    to the number of sources because every source node generates the network traffic.
    To cope with more number of packets, additional packets are also needed in terms
    of beacons, control packets, re-transmissions etc. This effect is shown in Fig.
    9. When number of source nodes were set to 3, total of 3588 packets were generated
    from all the sources. As per AVDR protocol, it requires 8 to 10 hops to deliver
    the packet. Hence, 34,912 packets are transmitted over the network to deliver
    these 3588 packets with an average of 9.73 transmissions per packet generated.
    The transmission ratio is reduced to 9.11 on 24 source nodes. It happened because
    anchor discovery and anchor advertisement is one time process and independent
    of number of sources. There is very small additional traffic reported during initialization
    process. A3DR protocol uses void boundary nodes without any periodic communication
    overhead. For three sources, the A3DR protocol transmitted 43,995 packets to the
    network with packet transmission ratio of 12.26. This ratio becomes 12.81 on 24
    source nodes. Here, trend is growing slowly because number of re-transmissions
    is increasing due to congestion. Download : Download high-res image (243KB) Download

    of number of source nodes on end-to-end delay. In case of EDGR protocol, when
    number of sources is set to 3, it generated a total of 175,849 packets which included
    42,813 data packets and 100,000 beacons in the simulation time with the rate of
    1 beacon per 3 s per node. Additionally, 33,036 are extra transmissions due to
    anchor discovery, anchor list preparation and re-transmissions etc. It generated
    49.05 average transmissions per source data packets during entire communication.
    When number of sources becomes 24 then packet transmission ratio decreases to
    20.16 because beacons are fixed. GPSR-3D protocol also follows the same style
    as EDGR but unlike EDGR, it does not rely on creating and maintaining anchors.
    Therefore, it has relatively smaller overhead. BSMH protocol uses too many control
    packets (HELLO packets) exchanged to construct the void boundary. The construction
    and maintenance of void boundary results in excessive overhead. During the initialization
    phase, the packets get congested and dropped in midway which causes re-transmissions.
    According to simulation results available in Fig. 9, AVDR has an average 25.24%,
    65.93%, 41.14% and 72.68% less overhead than A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH, respectively.
    The end-to-end delay consists of propagation delay, network congestion delay and
    processing time. The processing time is fixed and propagation delay and processing
    time are affected by route length. The network congestion depends on number of
    sources as well as overhead. The effect on end-to-end delay is represented in
    Fig. 10 where results considered the delay of delivered packets only. Here, network
    congestion increases with increasing the number of source nodes. In case of AVDR
    protocol, the path length is minimized because of anchor nodes. The congestion
    delay is also minimum which is slightly growing with number of source nodes. As
    per simulation results, it has been observed that each source demands about 9
    to 10 hops to deliver the packet and an average one hop travel time is about 5
    ms with minor congestion or queuing delay. Further, the average per hop travel
    time is slightly increasing with respect to number of source nodes. Therefore,
    end-to-end delay varies from 46 ms to 53 ms on variation of number of source nodes.
    The A3DR protocol has to travel through boundary of the void so it requires an
    average of 12 hops to deliver the packet, which results in higher end-to-end delay.
    On the other hand GPSR-3D, EDGR and BSMH protocol suffers from higher congestion
    delay because of overhead of periodic beacons, longer path and other control packets.
    Additionally, BSMH protocol suffers from high initial setup delay. Fig. 10 infers
    that AVDR protocol is performing better than other existing protocols in context
    of end-to-end delay with respect to varying numbers of source nodes and its performance
    is 11.03%, 17.84%, 15.08% & 22.08% improved over A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D & BSMH protocols
    respectively. Here, it can be concluded that AVDR protocol is performing better
    than other protocols. It has very less impact of increasing number of source nodes
    on performing parameters delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, stretch and network
    overhead. 5.3. Void volume scenario In this subsection, we have evaluated the
    effect of increasing void volume size. We fixed the number of source nodes 10,
    packet rate 4 packets per second per source and manually set a void with various
    sizes (radius) from 50 to 120 m in center of the network. The packet takes longer
    path to deliver at sink node as void size increases. Unlike Section 5.2, here
    we have considered spherical void structure to check the effect of various void
    shapes. Further, performance of a protocol depends on void type and behavior of
    recovery policy. The effect of varying void size is shown in Fig. 11, Fig. 12,
    Fig. 13, Fig. 14. The void recovery from spherical structure is relatively easier
    because routing path is smoother than other void structures. Fig. 11 demonstrates
    the packet delivery ratio where packets from different source nodes are sent to
    the sink node. While void size increases, the remaining area of the network becomes
    denser as number of nodes is fixed. Therefore, each packet has to cross the void
    in the network. Thus, it is clearly seen that the AVDR protocol produces guaranteed
    message delivery and there is no impact reported higher void volume. On the other
    hand, existing protocols reported a trend of packet loss on increasing the void
    volume. A3DR and GPSR-3D protocols offer a good delivery ratio facing a slight
    packet loss on increasing void size. A3DR and GPSR protocols lose some packets
    during initial phase. AVDR protocol has achieved an average of 4.1% and 11.9%
    improvement over EDGR and BSMH protocols, respectively. The larger void zone causes
    longer path length, which results packet loss due to expiry of lifetime of the
    packet. The expansion in network density along with periodic beaconing increases
    the chance of collision, which results high packet loss in EDGR and BSMH protocols.
    On applying BSMH protocol, additional losses are reported due to heavy congestion.
    Further, the boundary discovery process in spherical void is relatively costlier
    than cubical void shapes. Download : Download high-res image (252KB) Download

    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 14. Effect of void radius size on end-to-end
    delay. In general, the hop distance increases with increasing the void size which
    affects routing stretch. As per results depicted in Fig. 12, it is clearly shown
    that AVDR is producing minimum routing stretch among existing geographical routing
    protocols. After completion of the 300 s of simulation, it varies between 1.07
    and 1.12 for AVDR protocol because it is able to conquer the shortest possible
    path. It has been observed that AVDR is offering 11.83%, 7.63%, 10.66% and 18.2%
    improvement over A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols, respectively. The network
    overhead is calculated in terms of ratio of total packets transmitted in the network
    during the simulation on total data packets generated from different sources.
    The path length is always increased on expanding the void size, which results
    more packet transmissions. Apart from the path length, the control packets also
    affect the overhead. This effect is depicted in Fig. 13. The plot shows the ratio
    for proposed AVDR protocol and its comparison with existing A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D
    and BSMH protocols where proposed protocol offers 17.95%, 67.26%, 49.6% and 75.01%
    improvement, respectively. The increment in void size reflects longer path which
    results greater delay. The condition becomes worse for the protocol, which follows
    the void boundary. Additionally, boundary nodes get congested because overall
    traffic passes through the void boundary, which creates extra end-to-end delay.
    The timing performance of AVDR protocol along with other existing protocols can
    be seen in Fig. 14. The results indicate that anchor based protocols are able
    to follow smaller path lengths, but network congestion may affect overall delivery
    delay. As per simulation results, the AVDR protocol produced 36.18 ms delay when
    void radius was 50 meters and increased to 46.57 ms on void radius of 120 m. The
    A3DR is following boundary of void and producing end-to-end delay of 40.54 ms
    to 56.12s ms when void radius increases from 50 to 120 m. The EDGR protocol has
    shorter path length but suffered from congestion delay because of limited anchors
    and periodic control packets. Thus, AVDR is producing an average of 19.42%, 14.19%,
    22.68% and 25.37% less end-to-end delay over EDGR, A3DR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols
    respectively when void radius length is increasing from 50 to 120 m. Here, it
    can be seen that AVDR protocol is outperforming other existing approaches. It
    is working smoothly and has relatively smaller impact of increasing void volume
    on stated parameters. 5.4. Multiple void scenario We have analyzed the simulation
    results calculated on single void in the network. The network may have multiple
    voids in two conditions: (i) multiple separated voids (ii) consecutive overlapped
    voids. Considering both of the cases, we have created a new simulation scenario
    where 10 source nodes are transmitting the packets to the sink node with packet
    rate of 4 packets per second per source. Two consecutive spherical voids are placed
    inside the network. The distance between centers of both voids is 100 m. The radius
    of void is varying between 30 and 100 m. When void radius is 30, 40 or less than
    50 m, the voids are separated while void boundary is touching each other on 50
    m radius and overlap on larger radius size. In this way, all three cases have
    been tested in this simulation scenario. The performance based on varying multiple
    void size is plotted in Fig. 15, Fig. 16, Fig. 17, Fig. 18. Fig. 15 displays the
    packet delivery ratio of proposed protocol and other existing protocols with different
    void sizes in overlapping and non-overlapping mode. The delivery ratio is decreasing
    on larger size of void radius in case of non-overlapping mode. On the other hand,
    overlapping void depicts single view of void where delivery ratio is significantly
    increasing. Further, after certain points, it decreases with the effect of very
    larger voids. This trend is followed by all of the approaches but variation depends
    on nature of protocol. The proposed AVDR protocol has minimal impact of such diversified
    conditions and able to maximize the delivery ratio. The main reasons for packet
    drops are congestion due to (i) periodic/setup control messages and (ii) tendency
    of following the same path. The proposed protocol poses freedom from both of the
    problems. It does not rely on huge control packets and also divides the traffic
    among four different anchors. Thus, data collisions decrease to achieve a better
    packet delivery ratio. The results indicate that the packet delivery ratio of
    AVDR fluctuates comparatively less than A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols.
    It exploits separated paths, which are passing through different regions of the
    voids, to deliver data with fewer collisions. Compared to A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D
    and BSMH, the proposed approach has an average of 1.61%, 8.25%, 5.72% and 16.01%
    higher packet delivery ratio, respectively, due to less data collisions. Download

    Effect of radius size of two consecutive voids on routing stretch. When void radius
    size increases, it transforms from non-overlapping to overlapping form. It creates
    a type of deep valley structure by combining two voids in overlapped manner (as
    shown in Fig. 2). In the results, routing stretches are computed based on 2400
    routes between each source and to the sink node. We have observed that the routing
    stretch of AVDR is the lowest and slightly lower than that of EDGR for every void
    size. The boundary based protocols traverse the entire boundary and follow a longer
    path around the boundary whereas anchor based protocols directly connect the extreme
    nodes of different voids. The AVHR and EDGR protocols are anchor based hence reported
    good routing stretch. Further, EDGR relies on 2D based structure, hence, it may
    not cover optimal paths in real 3D networks. In comparison, the average routing
    stretch in AVDR is substantially higher, especially for longer voids radius. Fig.
    16 shows that the routing stretch of A3DR protocol is very high because of traversal
    of void boundary and it is highest on radius of 50 m. The overall performance
    of AVDR is improved by 18.52% from A3DR, 6.24% from EDGR, 20.30% from GPSR-3D
    and 31.99% from BSMH protocols. Fig. 17 shows the effect of different sizes of
    various voids on network overhead. The boundary traversing protocols follow longer
    paths, which cause more packet transmissions per source packet. Further, overhead
    of periodic control messages also plays a vital role in generating the overhead.
    The proposed protocol follows a shorter path via anchor nodes and it does not
    consider any periodic control message. The average packet overhead for different
    void sizes is less in our proposed scheme because other protocols either follow
    void boundary or suffer from control message transmissions. This effect can be
    seen in figure where our proposed scheme performs 16.27%, 36.06%, 29.49% and 39.11%
    better than A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols respectively, in terms of average
    packets transmitted per source data packet. Download : Download high-res image

    (271KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 18. Effect of radius size of
    two consecutive voids on end-to-end delay. On increasing the void size, the packets
    have to follow the longer path, which increases end-to-end delay. This fact is
    supported by results plotted in Fig. 18. The figure indicates the delivery delay
    of AVDR, A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH with two consecutive voids on different
    sizes. The results show that the end-to-end delay of proposed approach is 12.04%,
    10.60%, 21.34% and 28.09% lower than A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols, respectively,
    as the voids size increases. The AVDR and EDGR are anchor based protocols and
    minimize path length, which causes shorter end-to-end delay. The EDGR projects
    3D network to 2D so, due to posture errors. It does not always find an optimal
    anchor node. As a result, it could not minimize delivery delays. On the other
    hand, the A3DR follows void boundary and suffers from high delivery delay. Here,
    we can observe that there is a sudden increase in end-to-end delay of A3DR protocol
    when void radius is moving from 40 m to 50 m. This happened because of beginning
    of the void overlapping, which creates deep valley type structure for packet traversing.
    Additionally, A3DR protocol does not generate any periodic overhead, so it delivers
    data with minimum delay. When voids radius increases continuously, then we can
    visualize these voids as single one. In this case, there will be less difference
    in anchor and non anchor based approaches and majority part of delay will be affected
    by network congestion. This effect is depicted beyond radius 80 m in Fig. 18.
    In the simulation, we tested the proposal on different network structures under
    various network conditions. It is important to note that a delay of 36.18 ms is
    observed using proposed method when void radius is 30 m and it increases to 46.57
    ms on void radius of 100 m. Hence, it is concluded that the end-to-end delay using
    proposed method is approximately 14.18%, 19.42%, 22.68% and 25.37% less than A3DR,
    EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols, respectively. Moreover, it is also observed
    that proposed approach claims an improvement of 11.83%, 7.63%, 10.66% and 18.20%
    in routing stretch and 17.95%, 67.26%, 49.60% and 75.08% in network overhead over
    A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D, and BSMH protocols, respectively while maximizing the delivery
    of data. In comparison with existing protocols, we found that the overall performance
    of proposed AVDR protocol is better than related protocols on given parameters.
    5.5. Real field testbed results The results are also obtained using real field
    data set [12]. The details of real field data set in form of testbed are available
    at FIT-IoT Lab, Strasbourg, France. In this work, the data set has been generated
    using the information available in [12], [45]. It utilizes IPV6 based addressing
    scheme and routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) as baseline
    protocol [39], [40], [46]. We have considered 88, IoT devices for experimental
    work deployed over 120 m 100 m 30 m of volume in ICube building at Strasbourg.
    A detailed description of the real testbed used in this work is given in [47].
    All of the IoT devices use Arduino-compatible microcontroller platform architecture
    Zigduino board, and IEEE 802.15.4 radio chip ATmega128RFA1. For simplicity, the
    nodes’ actual 3D locations are normalized to the network dimensions such that
    x, y, z coordinates of all nodes lie between (0, 0, 0) and (120, 100, 30). The
    experimental work is carried out under two different test cases. The first test
    case is depicted in Fig. 2 where node 74 is considered as source and node 47 is
    the sink. The first test case focuses on void creation and anchor discovery process.
    However, the second test case considers the varying number of sources while sink
    is fixed at node 74, shown in Fig. 19. This test case illustrates the anchor advertisement
    process and represents the effect of varying sources on network performance. Similar
    to the simulation work, the experimental results are also obtained in terms of
    packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, routing stretch and routing overhead.
    The numerical values of the experimental results are presented in Table 3, Table
    4. Each source generates 2 packets per second and results are collected for 300
    s of data transmission. In first test case, 3D coordinates of sink node 47 are
    fixed at one end at (111.21, 75.36, 12.6) of the network, whereas source node
    74 is configured at another end with 3D coordinates (8.9, 11.54, 21.20). The source
    node initiates the data packet and forwards it towards the sink node. Initially,
    packet follows the greedy approach and passes through nodes 85, 84, 37 and then
    stuck at node 19. However, node 19 does not have any neighbor nearer to the sink
    node, it creates void in the network and node 19 becomes a void node. This scenario
    is depicted in Fig. 2(a). At this point, proposed method starts anchor discovery
    process and packet follows the void boundary nodes. The boundary nodes compute
    orthogonal distance over line connecting void node and sink node. A node with
    longest orthogonal in a specified direction becomes an anchor node. Following
    such procedure, node 81 and node 18 are declared as anchor nodes. On completing
    the anchor discovery process, source node approaches anchors rather than sink
    node. Further, anchor node forwards the packet to the sink node. This procedure
    is illustrated in Fig. 2(b). Table 3. Variations in the packet delivery ratio,
    end-to-end delay, routing stretch, and overhead with varying one source–sink pair

    1.49 35498 RPL [39], [40] 98.16 45.81 1.51 21746 The source node generates 2 packets
    per second and total communication duration is 300 s. Initial communication for
    one second time is ignored for anchor discovery process hence, we collected the
    data of 299 s. A total of 598 packets were initiated from the source node. The
    proposed method is able to deliver all of the packets at the sink node whereas
    other methods have certain packet loss. Further, the proposed method delivers
    the packet after going through 8 hops but using manual process, data can be delivered
    in 7 hops. Hence, average routing stretch of the proposed method is 1.14 (i.e.,
    8/7). Other existing methods are delivering data using more than 8 hops and have
    bigger value of routing stretch. Moreover, path length also affects the end-to-end
    delay. The average time consumed per hop is about 4 ms. Hence, proposed method
    consumes an average of 34.14 ms of time to deliver the packet at sink node. This
    delay is smaller than other existing routing protocols. Additionally, proposed
    method consumes very less number of additional transmissions for data delivery.
    Thus, the network overhead is minimized. The beacon based methods suffer from
    network overhead. So, it can be concluded that proposed method outperforms existing
    geographical routing protocols in the first test case. Download : Download high-res

    test case illustrates the effect of varying number of source nodes on routing
    performance. This test case is depicted in Fig. 19(a). In this test case, 3D coordinates
    of sink node 74 are fixed at one end at (8.9, 11.54, 21.20) of the network where
    as six source nodes are configured at another end of the network. A void is available
    between source and sink such that each source packet has to pass through void.
    Initially, node 50 initiates the data packet and is stuck at void node 28 in the
    route of the sink node while following the greedy approach. This can be seen in
    Fig. 19(a). The anchor discovery process starts at this point. The discovery process
    discovers node 7 and node 17 as anchor nodes for upcoming communications. Further,
    the location of these two anchors is advertised to the other nodes in scope of
    these anchors. Here, anchor advertisement process completes and other sources
    get the information of available anchors. Now, all the sources utilize the anchor
    information to find out direct route from source to anchor and anchor to the sink
    node. This scenario is illustrated in Fig. 19(b) where network void does not affect
    the communication between source and sink. In this test case, the proposed method
    achieves more than 99% delivery ratio in the best case and it is more than 98%
    when number of source nodes increases to 6. Here, a few packets are lost in the
    beginning due to anchor discovery and anchor advertisement process. However, it
    is noted that the performance of the proposed method increases by 0.74%, 4.83%
    3.90%, 9.48% and 4.38% when compared to A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D, BSMH, and RPL protocols,
    respectively. In addition to the delivery ratio, it is also noted that the proposed
    AVDR protocol has reported the least average end to end delay when compared to
    other existing geographical routing protocols. The proposed method has an average
    end-to-end delay about 31 ms when all sources are transferring the data simultaneously.
    However, the average end-to-end delay in case of conventional A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D,
    BSMH and RPL routing protocols is greater than 35 ms under similar conditions.
    The reason for the improved end-to-end delay of the proposed method is due to
    its ability to select the direct path through anchor nodes during data delivery
    to the sink node. It is lacking in the conventional geographical routing and existing
    two dimensional based anchor discovery methods. Recall that the proposed method
    takes into account path length as one of the parameters and minimizes the data
    transmission delay during the data transfer. The proposed method obtains 10.12%,
    15.25%, 13.44%, 21.80% and 24.89% improved results over existing A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D,
    BSMH and RPL methods. The average routing stretch for all the packet transmissions
    over the testbed is also given in Table 4. A closer examination of the experimental
    results shows that the proposed method achieves routing stretch of 1.14 in the
    best case. This is possible in case of less number of source nodes as very less
    traffic is generated in the network. When number of sources increases, the respective
    traffic also increases which degrades the path length performance. Also, the average
    routing stretch is less than 1.22 in all other cases using proposed method. Hence,
    the proposed method is able to deliver the data using the shortest path length
    when compared to other existing methods. The proposed method achieves more than
    5% and 12% average improvement over existing anchor based and traditional non-anchor
    based approaches, respectively. This study also considers the effect of varying
    source nodes on the network overhead. The overhead increases due to additional
    packets e.g., beacons, control packets and re-transmissions. This effect is illustrated
    in Table 4. A total of 598 packets are sent from source when only one source is
    generating the data packets. Existing protocols EDGR, GPSR-3D, BSMH and RPL protocols
    require more than 14,500 transmissions to deliver these packets. On the other
    hand, A3DR and proposed AVDR protocol require near to 6000 transmissions. When
    number of source nodes increases to 6 then total 3588 packets generate for data
    delivery. In this case, proposed method utilizes 25,959 transmissions but non-anchor
    based methods needed more than 39,700 transmissions due to longer path. On the
    other hand, the beacon based methods require more than 53,000 transmissions including
    beacons, control packets and re-transmissions. Further, it is noted that the network
    overhead analysis is also important because it affects the average energy consumption.
    Each transmission and reception consume energy of IoT devices. Therefore, the
    discussion on energy consumption and its comparative analysis are given in next
    paragraph. As part of energy consumption analysis using different methods, BSMH
    method reports higher energy consumption and lesser network lifetime. This method
    wastes a lot of energy to deal with network overhead due to packet loss, re-transmissions
    and longer paths. The RPL method also utilizes more energy but less than the BSMH.
    Further, EDGR and GPSR-3D methods consume relatively less energy because these
    methods are anchor-based methods and require smaller paths during void conditions.
    A3DR also consumes moderate energy because it does not rely on periodic beacons
    but follows a longer path around the boundary of the void. The path length, overhead,
    and losses are minimized in the proposed novel AVDR method. As a result, the novel
    AVDR method performs better than existing geographical routing methods. Hence,
    it can be treated as an energy-efficient one. 6. Conclusion In this paper, a novel
    anchor-based void detouring routing (AVDR) method is proposed to detour the void
    with reduced path length and improved data transmission delay. The method utilizes
    anchor nodes towards routing of data packets in a 3D IoT network. The anchor node
    selection is based on orthogonal distance between anchor candidate and line joining
    between void node and sink node. The anchor nodes are judiciously distributed
    to other nodes lying inside the scope of anchor nodes. Therefore, all source nodes
    do not require anchor discovery process again and again which helps in minimizing
    the overall network overhead. The performance of the proposed method has been
    illustrated with diagrams, mathematical analysis, examples, test cases, simulated
    and real testbed results. The simulation results are obtained using INET framework
    under OMNET++ simulator. The performance of the proposed method is also validated
    using real field datasets in different test cases. The results illustrate that
    the AVDR protocol efficiently enhances the performance of packet delivery ratio,
    path length in terms of routing stretch, network overhead and end-to-end delay.
    Multiple experimental scenarios have been considered on various void conditions
    in the network. The proposed scheme is efficiently able to detour the network
    void and follows smaller path in shorter duration. Thus, it has been proven that
    the experimental results of the proposed AVDR protocol is outperforming other
    existing anchor-based and non anchor-based geographical routing schemes. CRediT

    INTRODUCTION From the recent past, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are explored
    as a physical infrastructure for implementing the technology of the Internet of
    Things. These WSNs have wide applicability in a number of fascinating applications
    that aids the human world to get connected and maintain communication in the physical
    world.1 To attain the accomplishments of WSNs, clustering plays a vital role in
    handling the battery source limitations of sensor nodes that prevents them from
    sustaining the network lifetime.2 In WSNs, clustering is the potential approach
    essential for maintaining energy stability and network lifetime in the network.
    This clustering process completely organizes the nodes of the network into small
    groups termed clusters and selecting a specifically potential node as the cluster
    head.3 The problem of efficient clustering is identified to be a well-known NP-hard
    optimization problem in the area of WSNs. In the clustering technique, the whole
    network is divided into potential groups called clusters. In each cluster, a designated
    sensor node termed as cluster head (CH) plays a predominant role in establishing
    connections among cluster members and also to the base station (BS).4 It is the
    process of grouping in which specifically selected CHs are solely accountable
    for transmitting the aggregated data received from the sensors to the BS. Clustering
    is vital for the implementation of a hierarchical network.5 It deals with assigning
    additional roles to the sensor nodes present at the top level of network architecture.
    Clustering in WSN improves the likelihood of offering efficiency and optimized
    energy consumption.6 It also enhances the lifespan of the network. The nodes in
    the cluster protocols exhibits two roles, namely, cluster member nodes and CHs.
    The rate of energy consumption of the CHs is more rapid compared to the cluster
    member nodes, as they are loaded with more computational tasks and accountability
    to forward messages to farther distances.7 In general, most of the clustering
    algorithms are proposed without any pre-determined classification. 1.1 Motivation
    Several clustering schemes were propounded in the literature for the objective
    of prolonging the network lifetime.8 However, CH selection algorithms are considered
    to influence the cumulative energy consumptions of the network to the utmost level.9
    In this context, the selection of CH through swarm intelligence algorithms are
    determined to be highly suitable and predominant, as it facilitates the option
    of preventing worst sensor nodes from being selected as CHs in the network.10
    In this field, diversified number of computational intelligence approaches that
    include swarm intelligent algorithms such as PSO and ACO, evolutionary algorithms,
    and artificial immune system is considered to play an anchor role in effective
    clustering that aids in attaining energy efficiency, stability, and prolonging
    network lifetime to the acceptable level.11 But the existing CH selection schemes
    have their own benefits and limitations. Some of the algorithms either are good
    in exploration or perform better in exploitations.12 Thus, the majority of the
    algorithms were not able to handle the rate of exploitation and exploration to
    the sufficient level.13 At this juncture, Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GHOA)
    is considered as one of the predominant meta-heuristic approaches that arose in
    the recent years and finds its applicability and suitability in the process of
    clustering due to its adaptive and reliable characteristics.14 GHOA is one of
    the recently proposed evolutionary algorithms, which is inspired based on the
    foraging behavior of grasshoppers in different stages of their lifecycle. GHOA
    facilitates high efficiency in handling diversified design problems of engineering
    such as the CH selection problem, which pertains to an NP-hard problem. In specific,
    GHOA is featured by more merits than limitations compared to the other recently
    contributed meta-heuristic algorithms. It is excellent in maintaining the balance
    between exploration and exploitation, on par with the majority of the algorithms
    that has the scope of determining a global optimum compared to the local point
    of optimality.15 The rate of convergence facilitated by GHOA is generally excellent
    than the recent and well-known optimization algorithms such as PSO, GA, ACO, ABC,
    and EHO algorithms. However, tuning some controlling parameters of GHOA is highly
    difficult. In this context, Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm (CSOA) has the scope
    of fine-tuning the parameters and operators of GHOA algorithm, which need to be
    updated per iteration for exhaustive search of possible search space and enhance
    its potentiality in identifying global solutions. Moreover, the hybridization
    of GHOA and CSOA16 motivated the possibility of utilizing it in the process of
    CH selection to increase network lifetime and maintain energy stability. But search
    efficiency equation included in the traditional GHOA algorithm is determined to
    be insufficient due to its requirement of mandatory control parameters and comparatively
    poorer exploitation cycle. Hence, the hybridization of GHOA with suitable algorithm
    is essential for the purpose of improving the search equation that aids in balancing
    the degree of exploitation potentialities in an optimal way. This hybridization
    is also essential for enhancing the rate of global convergence, which in turn
    establishes the trade-offs between the exploitation and exploration rate. 1.2
    Major contributions The major contributions of the proposed Hybrid Grasshopper
    and Improved Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm (HGICSOA)-based clustering scheme
    is presented as follows. It is proposed with the capabilities of Opposition-based
    Learning (OBL)-improved GHOA and Improved Cat Swarm Optimization Algorithm (ICSOA)
    for attaining optimal CH selection and sink mobility-based data transmission with
    balanced trade-off between intensification and extensification during the clustering
    process. It specifically adopted OBL-based GHOA for optimal CH selection using
    the objective function formulated through the fitness parameters of node density,
    residual energy, and distance between sensor node and sink. It further utilized
    the benefits of ICSOA with a predominant local search strategy that plays an anchored
    role in achieving better sink mobility-based data transmission. Experimental investigations
    confirmed its predominance in terms of energy stability, network lifetime, network
    throughput, and energy consumptions independent to different sensor node densities
    and rounds used for implementation. The remaining section of the paper is structured
    as follows. Section 4 presents the comprehensive review of the existing state-of-the
    art hybrid CH selection and sink mobility approaches contributed to the literature
    over the recent years. Section 6 details the complete view of GHOA-based CH selection
    and ICSOA-based sink mobility with its merits and predominant role in sustaining
    energy stability and network lifetime. Section 22 concludes the paper with major
    contributions and future scope of enhancement. 2 RELATED WORK A Hybrid PSO and
    HSA-based clustering approach was proposed by Anand and Pandey17 for enhancing
    the network lifetime and energy stability in the network. This PSO–HSA approach
    facilitated the introduction of gateway nodes and selected global optimal CH for
    minimizing the rate of energy consumptions that reduced the frequent selection
    of CH in the network. This minimization of energy of CH occurred during the process
    of transmitting aggregated data to the BS. It also included local search strategy-improved
    HSA for determining the best optimal path from the gateway nodes to the BS. Then,
    Firefly Algorithm and Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm (FASFLA)-based CH scheme
    was proposed by Barzin et al18 for sustaining energy stability and network lifetime.
    This FASFLA approach was proposed as an adaptive application-oriented clustering
    protocol formulated using the multi-objective function that integrated cluster
    load, overlap, distances from the sink, residual energy of nodes, and inter- and
    intra-cluster distances into account. It was proposed with the merits of adaptive
    tunable parameters associated with SFLA in both the phases of multi-hop and clustering
    phases to attain energy stability in the network. The simulation results of FASFLA
    approach confirmed improved mean network lifetime by 30%, 68%, and 182%, compared
    to the stand-alone FA, ERA, and LEACH algorithms used for comparison. Further,
    Hybrid Monarchy Butterfly and ABC (HMBABC)-based clustering scheme was proposed
    by Rambabu et al19 for effective searching of potential sensor nodes that prevents
    frequent selection of CHs in the network. It is a semi-distributed scheme wherein
    clustering is performed at the BS based on the remaining energy and location of
    nodes and their neighbors. This distributed data routing is performed by building
    clusters and selecting CHs by constructing a set of candidate CHs depending on
    the position and remaining energy. It further used MBOA algorithm for allocating
    nodes to a CH and build clusters. It employed multi-hop TDMA based on B-MAC for
    facilitating a sleep/wake-up scheme is designed to convey the collected data to
    the conforming CH, either in a single hop or multi-hop based on the cluster density
    and position of the CH. It also made each sensor member to initiate route discovery
    that aids in constructing the reliable path to the CH. Squirrel and Harmony Search
    Optimization Algorithm (SHAOA)-based clustering was proposed by Lavanya and Shankar20
    for facilitating optimal CH selection that results in potential energy stability
    in the network. It adopted the fitness function that evaluated the parameters
    of energy distance during each round for the objective of optimal CH selection.
    It was proposed with energy efficiency, thereby prolonging the death of first
    node and last node in the network through the balance of exploration and exploitation
    in the search space. Moreover, the proposed SHAOA confirmed phenomenal improvements
    of 85.69% and 31.02% on par with the benchmarked schemes with respect to the evaluation
    parameters of residual energy and throughput. A Yellow Saddle Goat Fish (YSGF)-based
    energy-efficient clustering protocol was proposed by Rodriquez et al21 for minimizing
    energy consumptions and intensity the network lifetime. This YSGF utilized the
    set of CHs and BS for the construction of clusters for assigning the sensor nodes
    to its close proximity CHs in the network. It further determined the selection
    of optimal CHs and CHs count based on the inclusion of Goat Fish optimization
    algorithm. The simulation experiments of this YSGF confirmed minimized energy
    consumption with quantifiable enhancement in prolonging stability period and network
    lifetime. Another energy clustering protocol named Elephant Herd Optimization
    and Camel Series was proposed by Lavanya and Shankar5 for concentrating the data
    transmission that considered long distances between the nodes and the BS towards
    CH selection. It combined EHO with Camel Series (CS) for reducing the distance
    through which the amount of energy consumed in the network is significantly minimized
    to the maximized level. It estimated the position of the BS, size of population,
    and number of runs by applying CS on the network, such that CHs that are in proximity
    to the BS collect the data from the CHs and forward it to the sink. An Integrated
    GA and PSO (IGAPSO)-based dynamic clustering algorithm was proposed by Sahoo et
    al22 for determining the optimal positions for CHs that concentrates on improving
    the consumptions rate of energy. It adopted the genetic operators of selection,
    mutation, and crossover for the objective of identifying potential. This algorithm
    generates an ideal number of clusters with CHs with considerable reduction in
    the amount of energy consumed and used for policing network traffic. It also adopted
    a linear ranking-based scheme for fitness assignment, such that a generation gap
    of 0.95 is achieved. It also included the benefits of stochastic general sampling
    for ensuring global optimization with continuous variables. A clustering-based
    routing approach using Hybrid Red Deer Salp Swarm (HRDSS-CP) was proposed for
    maintaining energy stability and augmenting network lifetime.23 This HRDSS-CP
    utilized the fitness function formulated based on the parameter of expected transmission
    cost, delay, memory, and packet loss. Further, the multi-objective function is
    developed with the objective of generating diversified set of optimal solution
    that aided in attaining better balance between the factors considered for fitness
    evaluation. The simulation results conducted with optimization test functions
    and network grid confirmed the effectiveness of this energy-efficient protocol.
    Moreover, the comparative investigation also revealed the better performance of
    HRDSS-CP towards the facilitation of best optimal routing path on par with the
    competitive CH selection approaches. 2.1 Extract of the literature The existing
    works of the literature (presented in Table 1) have the following limitations.

    the best optimal path from the gateway nodes to the BS The energy stability was
    the major problem, and it was not able to handle the problem of hot-spot problem
    that are more common near the position of the sink Barzin et al18 FA-SFLA It was
    proposed with the merits of adaptive tunable parameters associated with SFLA in
    both the phases of multi-hop and clustering phases to attain energy stability

    considerable improvement Rambabu et al19 ABC + MBOA It estimated the position
    of the BS, size of population, and number of runs by applying CS on the network
    through adaptive inclusion of MBOA and ABC, such that CHs that are in proximity
    to the BS collect the data from the CHs and forward it to the sink It completely
    depends on sampling population and may result in improper balance between local
    and global search in CH selection Lavanya and Shankar et al20 HSA-SQOA It adopted
    the fitness function that evaluated the parameters of energy distance during each
    and every round for improving energy efficiency that extends the death of first
    node and last node in the network through the balance of exploration and exploitation
    in the search space The complexity involved in determining the complete set of
    optimal CH nodes is high Rodriguez et al21 YS-GF It utilized the set of CHs and
    BS for the construction of clusters for assigning the sensor nodes to its close
    proximity CHs in the network. It further determined the selection of optimal CHs
    and CHs count based on the inclusion of GHOAtfish optimization algorithm It highly
    impacts network performance due to unequal energy consumptions of nodes Lavanya
    and Shankar5 EHO-CS It combined EHO with CS for reducing the distance through
    which the amount of energy consumed in the network is significantly minimized
    to the maximized level It was not able to handle the problem of hot spot in the
    network. The degree of balance between intensification and diversification is
    also minimal Sahoo et al22 GA-PSO It adopted the genetic operators of selection,
    mutation, and crossover for the objective of identifying potential. It generated
    ideal number of clusters with CHs with considerable reduction in the amount of
    energy consumed and used for policing network traffic Increase in the threshold-based
    functions correspondingly increases the overhead in CH selection Ambareesh et
    al23 HRDSS It focused on minimizing packet loss, memory, delay, and expected transmission
    cost by generating different optimal solution set that aids in balancing the trade-off
    between objectives The process of establishing an optimal network structure is
    highly challenging i) The majority of standalone meta-heuristic CH selection schemes
    were either good in exploration or exploitation, but not both. ii) Most of the
    meta-heuristic CH selection schemes suffered in balancing the trade-off between
    the rate of exploitation and exploration delayed convergence and trapping into
    a local point. iii) A hybrid meta-heuristic CH selection scheme-based on the hybridization
    of GHOA and CSOA was not proposed to the best of our knowledge. iv) The existing
    schemes also were not capable enough in guaranteeing energy stability and network
    lifetime to the acceptable level; the scope of improvement is still visible. v)
    The state-of-the-art approaches could not tackle the dynamic change in CH selection,
    as they scarcely handled the issue of worst sensor nodes selected as CH and preventing
    frequent clustering process. 3 PROPOSED HGICSOA-BASED CLUSTERING SCHEME In this
    section, initially, the network and energy model considered for implementing the
    proposed HGICSOA-based clustering scheme is presented. Then, the detailed view
    of the proposed HGICSOA with the implementation steps is demonstrated with suitable
    justifications. 3.1 Network and energy model The network model considered for
    implementing the proposed HGICSOA-based clustering scheme possesses the following
    assumptions, which include: The sensor nodes in the network are deployed randomly
    in the square area. In each simulation, the sink position is considered to change.
    Sensor node deployed in the network is capable of sensing and aggregating the
    data independent to its location. Sensor nodes in the field possesses different
    levels of energy. The sensor nodes are initially clustered based on k-means algorithm.
    The network consists of a stationary sink with random distribution of nodes. The
    probability of CH selection is initially assigned to 0.1. The number of CHs in
    the network is determined to 10% of the complete number of nodes. The node is
    dead whenever the nodes'' energy depletes during the simulation process. The energy
    model used for energy consumption by the proposed HGICSOA-based clustering scheme
    during data communication is the free space propagation model. In this free space
    propagation model, two energy consumption calculation are performed depending
    on the distance termed as threshold distance ( ) as mentioned in Equation (1).
    (1) where and represent the energy incurred by the sensor node during the utilization
    of free space and multipath propagation model. In specific, the value of and is
    assigned to and , respectively. Thus, the value of distance threshold ( ) is set
    approximately to 87.7. At this juncture, Equation (2) is used for attaining energy
    consumption calculation using free space model, when the estimated distance is
    less than or equal to the distance threshold ( ). (2) On the other hand, multipath
    model is adopted for calculating energy consumption when the estimated distance
    is greater than the distance threshold ( ) as specified in Equation (3). (3) Likewise,
    the energy spent by the sensor for reception of data packets ( ) is estimated
    based on Equation (4). (4) 3.2 GHOA GHOA is a swarm-based meta-heuristic algorithm
    proposed based on the inspiration derived from the foraging characteristics of
    grasshopper swarms. The grasshopper swarms consist of millions of grasshoppers,
    which causes high damage to the crops.17 The grasshopper lifecycle is partitioned
    into three phases that includes (i) egg phase, (ii) nymph phase, and (iii) adult
    grasshopper phase. The nymph phase of grasshopper is featured by small step size
    that attribute toward short-distance slow movement. In contrast to the nymph phase,
    the adult grasshopper phase is characterized by abrupt movements and has the capability
    of traveling long distances. This characteristic nymph and grasshoppers'' movements
    represent the exploitation and exploration process of the meta-heuristic algorithm.
    Moreover, they possess a superior capability in seeking the food source present
    in their environment. At this juncture, the movements of nymphs and grasshopper
    determined based on its food foraging characteristics are mathematically presented
    in Equation (5). (5) where and represent the position of each individual grasshopper
    (search agent) and social interaction degree possible between grasshoppers (cooperation
    degree determined between search agents during exploitation and exploration) as
    presented in Equation (6). Moreover, and highlight the force of gravity and wind
    advection corresponding to each individual grasshopper (search agent). (6) where
    and represent the Euclidean distance and unit vector distance estimated between
    any two individual search agents (grasshoppers). Then, “ ” representing social
    force strength is defined based on Equation (7). (7) where and represent the scale
    of attractive length and attraction intensity, respectively. Moreover, the value
    of and presented in Equation (1) is defined in Equation (8). (8) where and represent
    the gravitational and drift constant with and as the unity vector corresponding
    to the earth center and wind direction, respectively. But, searching equation
    presented in Equation (5) cannot be employed directly for determining the problem
    of CH selection. Hence, the search equation is transformed using ref. [24] as
    represented in Equation (9). (9) where and represent the lower and upper threshold
    considered in the search space during the process of CH selection. Moreover, represents
    the value of best solution determined until the previous iteration with “ ” defined
    already in Equation (7). In Equation (9), is considered to converge toward with
    completely discarded from the search equation. Moreover, refers to the coeffieicnt
    of decrease for converging the zone of attraction, repulsion, and comfort as defined
    in Equation (10). (10) where and highlight the maximum and minimum value corresponding
    to .In this proposed GHOA-based CH selection, the value of and is set to 0.00001
    and 1, respectively. and refer to the maximum number ofiterations and current
    iteration, respectively. 3.3 OBL This OBL strategy is included into GHOA-based
    CH selection for exploring the feasible current solution with its opposite solution
    such that exploitation can be systematically improved. This comparison between
    a feasible current solution with its opposite solution is facilitated to check
    whether any significant change in the current solution could be perceived during
    the process of CH selection. Tizhoosh proposed the OBL strategy by considering
    the opposite value of with respect to each value of as expressed in Equation (11).
    (11) This definition of OBL strategy can be generalized to n-dimensional solutions
    through the utilization of Equation (12). (12) where represents the vector opposite
    to the real solution vector . Moreover, the solutions and representing the current
    and opposite solutions are compared for determining and storing the best among
    the feasible solutions. In addition, the pseudocode of the proposed GHOA-based
    CH selection is presented as follows. Algorithm 1: Opposition learning-based GHOA
    for CH selection Initialize the parameters such as size of population representing
    the number of search agents, fitness parameters such as, , and . Generate a random
    population . Initialize the current iteration as . While ( ) do Compute the fitness
    function based on Equation (18) Select the best solution (CH sensor nodes- ) using
    OBL strategy defined in Equation (11) and (12) Use Equation (6) to update the
    value of . For do Normalize the distance between the solutions over the interval
    defined through . Update solutions based on Equation (5) End for End while Return
    the optimal solution representing CH selected sensor node The above-mentioned
    Opposition Learning-based GHOA is utilized for CH selection in the network depending
    on the factors of residual energy, node centrality, node degree, inter-cluster
    distance, and intra-cluster distance. The process of CH selection is achieved
    using the fitness function specified in ref. [25]. 3.4 ICSOA-based sink mobility
    In this section, ICSOA-based sink mobility approach adopted for determining the
    optimal points of deployment to which each sink need to be moved for attaining
    better packet delivery to the sink is presented. The ICSOA adopted in this strategy
    of sink mobility is an improved version of the classical CSOA proposed by Chu
    and Tsai24 depending on the resting and hunting key characteristics of Cat. The
    capability of Cat in resting mode completely spends more time in slowly moving
    to different positions in the search space with maximized alertness. In the hunting
    mode, cats focus on moving objects due to its strong curiosity characteristics.
    At last, the cat rapidly captures the prey by utilizing maximum energy when a
    specific target is identified. Inspired by the resting and hunting potentialities
    of Cat, CSOA algorithm was proposed for solving complex optimization problems
    like sink mobility process with maximized capability of exploitation in the search
    space. The mathematical model of CSOA representing the seeking and hunting mode
    of CSOA is presented as follows. 3.4.1 CSOA mode of seeking This phase of CSOA
    mimics the Cats'' resting potential in which it remains alert even when they have
    the possibility of moving to different locations in the search space. This seeking
    mode of CSOA refers to the exploitation phase of solution determination. The important
    variables and steps considered during the employment of seeking mode are detailed
    as follows. The first variable is the Change in Dimension Count (CDC), which represents
    the number of dimensions that need to be exploited during the mutation process
    for determining the optimal CHs in the network. Then the second variable named
    Selected Dimensions of Seeking Range (SDSR) is utilized for representing the difference
    between the previous and current dimension that need to be exploited during mutation
    process. Finally, the third variable termed Pool of Seeking Memory (PSM) is used
    for specifying the number of search agents that need to be replicated for facilitating
    the process of efficient CH selection. The typical steps adopted into the CSOA
    mode of seeking (process of global optimization) is depicted in the following
    steps. Step 1: Define the number of CSOA search agents (PSM) that need to be initialized
    and replicated during the process of CH selection. Step 2: Execute the following
    steps based on the parameter of CDC. Step 2.1: Add or subtract SDSR values randomly
    from the current location of CSOA search agents. Step 2.2: The old values associated
    the current solutions are completely replaced based on PSM. Step 3: Calculate
    the fitness value of the solutions determined in the search space. Step 4: Select
    the optimal candidate solution and locate them at the current position determined
    by CSOA search agents. 3.4.2 CSOA mode of tracing This CSOA mode of tracing represents
    the exploitation (local searching) process, which aids in determining the optimal
    points over which the sink node can be moved for transmission data from the CH
    to the movable sink. This CSOA mode of tracing is adopted depending on the inspiration
    derived from the hunting capability possessed by cats. The position and velocity
    of search agents (cat) is updated whenever it wants to determine the position
    of the mobility sink depending on the position of the CH from which the data need
    to be transmitted. In this context, the major difference between the old and new
    position of search agents is made highly feasible through this phase of exploitation.
    In this phase of exploitation, the position ( ) and velocity ( ) of search agent
    for the objective of determining mobility sink in the -dimensional space are defined
    as and , respectively, under the condition . At this juncture, the best position
    of the search agents towards mobility sink is represented using . Further, the
    updated position ( ) and velocity ( ) of search agent in determining mobility
    sink in the -dimensional space are depicted in Equations (13) and (14). (13) where
    highlights the updated velocity of search agent (cat) in the dimension with referring
    to the factor of weight that ranges between 0 and 1. Further, represents the old
    velocity related to the search agent (cat) with and as the user defined constant
    and random number that varies between 0 and 1. Furthermore, and depict the best
    position and current position as determined by search agent (cat) in the ( ) dimension.
    (14) where and portray the updated position and current position of search agent
    (cat) in the dimension with as the velocity associated with it. Finally, the CSOA
    mode of seeking (exploration) and tracing mode (exploitation) is integrated using
    an important factor termed ratio of mixture (RM). It plays an anchor role in estimating
    the number of search agents involved in the modes of seeking and tracing. 3.4.3
    Steps involved in the implementation of CSOA The steps involved during the implementation
    of CSOA are presented as follows. Step 1: Initialize the number of search agents
    (cats) and the number of sensor nodes (preys) placed randomly to facilitate the
    process of CH selection. Step 2: Utilized the factor of RM to determine the number
    of searches considered in the tracing and seeking modes (exploitation and exploration
    phases) with the support of the complete set of comprehensive user-defined parameters.
    Step 3: Calculate the function of fitness associated with the search agents toward
    the selection of CH and memorize the position of best sensor node in every iteration.
    Step 4: Depending on the flag value, employ seeking mode or tracing mode process.
    Step 5: Repeat the process of utilizing the factor of RM to determine the number
    of searches considered in the tracing and seeking modes. Step 6: Iterate the Steps
    3–5, until the condition of termination is satisfied. However, the primitive CSOA
    is identified to suffer from the problem of premature convergence due to its poor
    diversity. It fails in exploring potential solution due to its inadequacy in deriving
    potential information related to the global best position of search agents during
    the process of CH selection. But the search agents'' position need to be updated
    in CSOA regularly with respect to its current velocity and position for concentrating
    on the process of attaining sink mobility. In order to handle the aforementioned
    limitations, the merits of inertial weight and the following modifications are
    employed over the classical CSOA during the mobility sink achievement process.
    3.4.4 Improved CSOA The ICSOA used for determining the optimal points of sink
    node mobility has four improvements over the traditional CSOA. In the first improvement,
    the global best position related to search agents need to be adopted to determine
    the search agents (cats) position in the tracing mode for improving the rate of
    convergence and explore most potential solutions in the search space, Thus, the
    modified search equation including the global best position of search agent is
    utilized in the tracing mode operation of CSOA algorithm as specified in Equation
    (15). (15) In the second improvement, the position of search agents in the tracing
    mode is updated based on its previous position and velocity vector. This is mainly
    due to the impact of velocity vector imposed over the search agents'' updated
    position. Thus, the new velocity updating process involved during the process
    of tracing mode is determined based on Equation (16). (16) where and represent
    the parameters of acceleration with as the uniformly distributed random vector,
    which ranges between 0 and 1 for guiding the search agents'' position toward their
    global and local best positions. Moreover, highlights the search agents'' best
    position. The third improvement is the adoption of acceleration parameters and
    , which plays an anchor role as the control parameters responsible for establishing
    the trade-off between the processes of exploration and exploration. In specific,
    the accelerating factor serves as an increasing function, while parameter acts
    as an decreasing function. The values of acceleration parameters and are made
    adaptive and calculated based on Equation (17). (17) where and represent the maximum
    and minimum values pertaining to the first and last iterations, respectively.
    Further, and depict the current and maximum number of iterations. In particular,
    is included for the purpose of improving the capabilities of the global exploration.
    Moreover, the large value of this parameter strengthens the search agents'' global
    best position and attributes toward the refinement of the solution. In the final
    improvement, the method of local search imposed into CSOA for improving the solution
    quality derived during the process of sink mobility. This local search method
    is specifically employed into the tracing phase of the primitive CSOA algorithm
    to guide the direction of search and obtain optimal solution. The core essentiality
    of this local search method targets on determining the optimal solution in the
    search space that guides the direction of search, and utilizing the merits of
    neighborhood information to prevent the issues of local optima. The search mechanism
    applied over the neighborhood among the best solution and the current global best
    solution is defined based on Equation (18). (18) where and refer to the population
    size and neighborhood boundary with representing the global best solution. In
    this improved CSOA approach, the candidate solution possible in the search space
    is defined as , where . In this case, “ ” represents the maximum number of iterations
    utilized in the adopted method of local search. This included local search has
    the capability of visiting the maximum population size of , such that satisfies
    the condition . At this juncture, the global best solution related to sink mobility
    is determined based on Equation (19). (19) Then, the best search agent determines
    the global best solution (mobility sink node) based on the defined candidate solution
    that could be possibly derived from the search space through Equation (20). (20)
    In the subsequent subsection, the role of improved CSOA algorithm toward the achievement
    of mobility sink is presented as follows. Implementation of the improved CSOA
    algorithm for sink mobility is as follows: Step 1: Initialize the parameters related
    to the adopted improved CSOA algorithm such the maximum number of search agents,
    the number of sensor nodes that are randomly deployed in the search space, structure
    of the neighborhood, SDSR, PSM, , . Step 2: Initialize the velocity and the position
    of search agent into the d-dimensional search space during the determination of
    mobility sink. Step 3: Calculate the fitness value of the sensor nodes as determined
    by the search agents, such that these fitness values are stored into the memory
    for further investigation. Step 4: While ( ) do Step 5: Distribute the search
    agent randomly to initiate them to operate into their seeking and tracing modes
    depending on the value of the flag ( ) calculated in each individual iteration.
    Step 6: If ( ) Step 7: The search agent is made to operate into its seeking mode.
    Step 7.1: Generate multiple copies of search agents for better exploitation Step
    7.2: Utilize SDSR for calculate the shifting bit value for each search agents
    deployed in each cluster Step 7.3: Add the value of shifting to the search agent
    Step 7.4: Calculate the function of fitness related to each new position of search
    agents. Step 7.5: Compare the fitness value of determined in seeking mode of search
    mode with The fitness value determined initially during the phase of exploration.
    Step 7.6: End For Step 8: Else, the search agent operates in the mode of tracing
    Step 9: Employ the process of tracing over each search agent Step 9.1: Update
    the position and velocity of the search agent based on Equations (12) and (14)
    Step 9.2: Calculate fitness function value related to newly generated search agents''
    position Step 9.3: Compare the fitness value of determined in tracing mode of
    search mode with the fitness value determined initially during the phase of exploration.
    Step 9.4: End For Step 10: Update the search agents'' position and identity its
    best position to attain sink mobility Step 11: If ( ) then Step 12: Employ the
    method of local search (explained under modification 4) Step 13: Again update
    the search agents'' position to identity its best position that aids in better
    sink mobility Step 14: End If Step 15: Step 16: End While Step 17: Determine the
    end solution In additional, Figure 1 demonstrates the steps involved in the process
    of ICSOA-based sink mobility. In the initial step, the number of search agents
    according to the number of sensor nodes deployed in the search agents are initialized.
    Then, the selection of some search agents toward sink mobility is attained based
    on the evaluation of fitness function defined in Equation (21). (21) where , ,
    , , and represent the rate of energy consumption, residual energy possessed by
    each sensor node, distance between the sensor nodes and the sink, nodes'' mean
    energy, and number of neighboring nodes in the surrounding, respectively. FIGURE
    1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The steps involved in the process of ICSOA-based
    sink mobility. In the next step, the optimized sink mobility is achieved by determining
    the fitness parameters that are useful for selecting the potential CHs from the
    network. This process of sink mobility is executed until the criteria of termination
    are satisfied. Further, position and velocity of the search agents are updated
    depending on the values of the fitness. Furthermore, the subsequent movement of
    the sink is obtained through the determined optimized position. Finally, the local
    and global best solution is derived using the computations of PSO algorithm. The
    proposed HGICSOA protocol operates in two stages that includes the setup stage
    and steady stage. In this step, the heterogeneous sensor nodes with different
    levels of energy termed as normal, intermediate, and advanced are randomly deployed
    at the start. The location of the initial deployed nodes is modified during the
    employment of the proposed algorithm from the second iteration onward depending
    on the steps of ICSOA included into OBL-based GHOA. Then, decision maker is responsible
    for selecting the configuration to be updated in the subsequent process of the
    algorithm. In this algorithm, the sink node or base station is placed at the center
    of the deployed network. Further, CHs are selected after the setup stage to form
    clusters, such that CHs are allocated to suitable cluster member nodes depending
    on the fitness function evaluated during the implementation of the algorithm.
    In specific, integration of ICSOA and OBL-based GHOA is performed for CH selection.
    In the second stage termed steady-state stage, the algorithm is run for some specified
    number of rounds in every iteration. In this stage, the distance threshold value
    is compared with the estimated distance between the sensor nodes and the sink
    for facilitating communication. This stage is essential for making the decision
    that aids in identifying whether the communication happens through single-hop
    or multi-hop nodes. The CHs plays an anchor role in data processing and forwarding
    the data to the sink when they receive the data from the sensor member nodes of
    the clusters. Further, the sensor nodes'' energy is explored for its inherent
    energy. If the energy possesses by the sensor node is less than or equal to zero,
    the sensor nodes are identified as dead node. The sensor nodes are termed as dead
    nodes in this stage as they do not participate in the process of communication.
    3.5 Computational complexity In this section, the computational complexity incurred
    by the proposed HGICSOA during the implementation of a single iteration is presented
    as the number of search agents with respect to GOA and ICSOA method dynamically
    varying with uncertainty during the process of evolution. The computational complexity
    of the proposed HGICSOA is computed based on the cost incurred for position updating
    and evaluation of objective function as presented in Equation (22). (22) where
    and represent the search agent considered for position updating depending on the
    employment of ICSOA and GOA during an iteration of implementation. Further, is
    considered as the size of the population depending on the given problem dimension
    . Moreover, is considered as the function evaluation cost with referring to the
    selection and crossover cost operations of ICSOA. In this proposed HGICSOA approach,
    the entire population is portioned into two significant portions depending on
    the value of mean fitness, even though the computational complexity of these two
    parts is completely different. In GOA, the computational complexity involved in
    position updating is approximately equal to , since the search agent is responsible
    for calculating distance between them and the degree of social interaction. During
    the inclusion of ICSOA. the computational complexity is approximately equal to
    . 4 SIMULATION RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The simulation experiments of the proposed
    HGICSOA-based clustering scheme and the benchmarked HRDSA, CSPSO, IGAPSO, and
    HMBABC schemes are conducted using MATLAB R2016a. The same experimental settings
    are considered for achieving fair comparison of the evaluated CH selection algorithms
    with respect to energy stability and network lifetime. The extensive simulations
    are conducted in the network areas of 200 × 200 m2 in which 400 sensor nodes are
    deployed randomly throughout the entire network.26-28 The simulation experiments
    are run for 30 times, and the mean results are used for plotting the graphs of
    the proposed HGICSOA-based clustering scheme and competitive schemes used for
    comparison.29-32 The simulation parameters that are vitally used in the implementation
    of the proposed HGICSOA-based clustering scheme and the baseline CH selection
    scheme is listed in Table 2. TABLE 2. Simulation parameter considered for implementing
    HGICSOA. Parameters Value Number of sensor nodes 400 Number of rounds 3000 Location
    of BS in the network (0,0), (50,50), (100,100), and (150,150) Network size 200 × 200 m2
    Packet length transmitted from CH to the BS 6400 bits Message length transmitted
    from node to CH 2800 bits Probability of CH selection 5% Energy incurred in data
    aggregation phase 5 nJ/bit Length of control packets 50 bytes Initial energy of
    sensor nodes 2.0 J 4.1 Comparative analysis of HGICSOA with respect to the number
    of rounds after First Node Death (FND) with different number of sensor node densities
    In the first part of investigation, the proposed HGICSOA and the benchmarked HRDSA,
    CSPSO, IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes are compared based on number of rounds (network
    lifetime) determined with different sensor node densities (100, 200, 300, and
    400). In this investigation, the BS location is considered as (50,50) and the
    nodes energy equal to 2.0 J deployed in the network area of 200 × 200 m2. Figures
    2-5 present the number of rounds of the proposed HGICSOA and the benchmarked HRDSA,
    CSPSO, IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes with respect to different percentages of CHs
    (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25%) in the presence of 100, 200, 300, and 400 sensor
    nodes, respectively. The proposed HGICSOA scheme independent to the percentage
    of CHs in the network performs well, since it utilizes improved local search potential
    of ICSOA mechanism for partitioning the population into two subpopulations to
    balance the trade-off between local and global optimization process. The proposed
    HGICSOA scheme improved the energy stability at the levels of CH selection and
    optimized route determined process, thereby resulting in better network lifetime.
    It used a potential switching probability that aided in better transition between
    exploration and exploitation, such that worst sensor nodes are completely prevented
    from being selected as CH in the network. With 100 sensor nodes, the number of
    rounds (network lifetime) facilitated by the proposed HGICSOA is improved by 8.32%,
    10.78%, 12.71%, and 15.52%, better than the benchmarked HRDSA, CSPSO, IGAPSO,
    and HMBABC schemes. With 200 sensor nodes, the number of rounds (network lifetime)
    facilitated by the proposed HGICSOA is improved by 14.32%, 17.18%, 19.19%, and
    21.76%, better than the benchmarked HRDSA, CSPSO, IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes.
    The number of rounds (network lifetime) facilitated by the proposed HGICSOA with
    300 sensor nodes is improved by 13.42%, 16.768%, 18.92%, and 20.91%, better than
    the benchmarked HRDSA, CSPSO, IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes. Moreover, the number
    of rounds (network lifetime) facilitated by the proposed HGICSOA with 400 sensor
    nodes is improved by 10.84%, 13.72%, 16.39%, and 18.21%, better than the benchmarked
    HRDSA, CSPSO, IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    to the number of packets received at BS with different position of BS In the second
    part of investigation, the proposed HGICSOA and the benchmarked HRDSA, CSPSO,
    IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes are compared based on the number of packets received
    at BS with different position of BS such as (0,0), (50,50), (100,100), and (150,150).
    In this scenario, the network area considered for experimentation is 200 × 200 m2
    with deployed sensor nodes (energy: 2.0 J) varied as 100, 200, 300, and 400 under
    the number of CHs set to 10%.33-35 Figures 6-9 demonstrate the number of packets
    received at BS achieved by the proposed HGICSOA and the benchmarked HRDSA, CSPSO,
    IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes with respect to different position of BS in the network.
    The proposed HGICSOA scheme achieved better performance in terms of number of
    packets received at BS over the baseline approaches as it incorporated better
    energy-efficient clustering process. This inclusion of better clustering strategy
    aided in enhancing the network lifetime with minimized energy consumption that
    proportionally increase the number of packets received at the BS. It is noted
    that the number of packets received at the BS is completely influenced by the
    position of BS. In specific, maximum number of packets received at BS is identified
    when the BS is positioned at (100,100), which is the center of the network area.
    However, it decreases when BS is located far from the network center as the energy
    consumed by CHs for transmitting the aggregated data to the BS proportionally
    increases. The adoption of mutualism mechanism prevents frequent selection of
    CHs in the proposed HGICSOA on par with benchmarked schemes. The number of packets
    received at the BS guaranteed by the proposed HGICSOA with 100 sensor nodes is
    improved by 10.21%, 13.82%, 15.64%, and 18.95%, better than the benchmarked HRDSA,
    CSPSO, IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint HGICSOA:
    number of packets received at BS with 100 sensor nodes. FIGURE 7 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint HGICSOA: number of packets received at BS with 200 sensor nodes.
    FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint HGICSOA: number of packets received
    at BS with 300 sensor nodes. FIGURE 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint HGICSOA:
    number of packets received at BS with 400 sensor nodes. Further, the number of
    packets received at the BS confirmed by the proposed HGICSOA with 200 sensor nodes
    is improved by 9.32%, 11.98%, 14.51%, and 17.62%, better than the competitive
    CH schemes. The number of packets received at the BS under 200 nodes is improved
    due to the following reasons: (i) It balances the energy consumption in the entire
    network and minimizes the frequency of reconstructing clusters by permitting each
    node to play the role of CH at different times depending on the residual energy
    of that sensor node, (ii) it adopted collecting CH (CCH) to collect the sensed
    data for preventing prevent the transmission of large amounts of data over longer
    distances, and (iii) it minimizes the number of active nodes as the CH itself
    can cat as the monitoring nodes and the manager, (iv) it incurred minimized clustering
    setup time such that the waiting time period for CHs selection is comparatively
    reduced, and (v) it is developed with less computational clustering and network
    structure complexity for minimizing the clustering setup time and construct the
    hierarchical cluster structure. Furthermore, the number of packets received at
    the BS confirmed by the proposed HGICSOA with 300 sensor nodes is improved by
    9.04%, 10.86%, 13.28%, and 15.42%, better than the baselines approaches. Moreover,
    the number of packets received at the BS confirmed by the proposed HGICSOA with
    400 sensor nodes is improved by 8.46%, 10.86%, 13.21%, and 15.98%, better than
    the benchmarked schemes. 4.3 Comparative analysis of HGICSOA with respect to number
    of alive nodes with different sensor node densities In the third part of investigation,
    the proposed HGICSOA and the benchmarked HRDSA, CSPSO, IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes
    are compared based on number of alive nodes with different sensor node densities
    set to 100, 200, 300, and 400, respectively. In this scenario, the network area
    considered for experimentation is 200 × 200 m2 with deployed sensor nodes (energy-2.0
    J) varied as 100, 200, 300, and 400 under the number of CHs set to 25%. Figures
    10-13 depict the performance of proposed HGICSOA with respect to number of alive
    nodes by varying the number of sensor nodes as 100, 200, 300, and 400, respectively.
    This proposed HGICSOA scheme incorporates re-clustering process and adaptive transition
    between exploitation and exploration for attaining better fitness evaluation of
    the sensor nodes, in contrast to the baseline approaches considered for analysis.
    During the death of a CH, it associates the sensor nodes to the other CHs in the
    network. On the contrary, the dead CH nodes become completely useless, and the
    aggregated data will never reach the destination completely hindering the reliable
    data transmission in the baseline approaches. It adopted uniform distribution
    of CHs that systematically decrease the residual energy for sustaining more alive
    nodes in the network. It also included a novel fitness function that performs
    efficient CH selection, resulting in reduced workload to the BS for preventing
    the problem of sink hole. The number of alive nodes confirmed by the proposed
    HGICSOA with 100 sensor nodes is improved by 16.78%, 19.34%, 21.21%, and 24.59%,
    better than the benchmarked HRDSA, CSPSO, IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes. Further,
    the number of alive nodes sustained by the proposed HGICSOA with 200 sensor nodes
    is improved by 15.68%, 17.82%, 20.12%, and 23.48%, better than the competitive
    CH schemes. Furthermore, the number of alive nodes maintained by the proposed
    HGICSOA with 300 sensor nodes is improved by 14.12%, 16.74%, 19.05%, and 21.54%,
    better than the baselines approaches. Moreover, the number of alive nodes ensured
    by the proposed HGICSOA with 400 sensor nodes is improved by 13.28%, 15.29%, 17.29%,
    and 19.52%, better than the benchmarked schemes. FIGURE 10 Open in figure viewer

    FIGURE 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint HGICSOA: number of alive nodes under
    300 sensor nodes. FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint HGICSOA: number of
    alive nodes under 400 sensor nodes. 4.4 Comparative analysis of HGICSOA with respect
    to network throughput and network residual energy with different number of rounds
    In the final part of investigation, the predominance of the proposed HGICSOA and
    the benchmarked HRDSA, CSPSO, IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes are compared based on
    network throughput and network residual energy with different number of rounds.
    In this scenario, the network area considered for experimentation is 200 × 200 m2
    with deployed sensor nodes (energy-2.0 J) and CHs set to 400 and 20% with position
    of BS as (100,100). Figures 14 and 15 portray the network throughput and network
    residual energy achieved and sustained by the proposed HGICSOA with systematically
    increasing number of rounds. The network throughput of the proposed HGICSOA scheme
    is potentially enhanced as the included clustering process played an anchor in
    preventing worst sensor nodes from being selected as CH and facilitated significant
    re-clustering process that never wasted the service of existing number of CHs.
    On the other hand, network residual energy is considerably maintained in the network,
    since the fitness evaluation toward CH selection is done rigorously without the
    compromisation of any specific factor that attributes toward CH selection process.
    Thus, the network throughput of the HGICSOA scheme is maximized by 14.32%, 16.96%,
    19.21%, and 21.89%, better than the baselines approaches. In contrary, the network
    residual energy sustained by the proposed HGICSOA with different rounds is also
    maximized by 16.34%, 18.85%, 20.42%, and 23.29%, better than the benchmarked HRDSA,
    CSPSO, IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes. FIGURE 14 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    HGICSOA: network throughput with different number of rounds. FIGURE 15 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint HGICSOA: network residual energy with different number
    of rounds. In addition, Figure 16 presents the success probability in tackling
    dynamic CH selection achieved by the proposed HGICSOA with scalable number of
    sensor nodes in the network. The proposed HGICSOA tackled dynamic CH selection
    through the estimation of comprehensive number of factors that attribute toward
    better clustering process. Moreover, it guaranteed balanced local and global rate
    of optimization during the process of CH selection compared to the competitive
    CH approaches. It is identified that maximized success probability is attained
    during the process of selecting CH in a dynamic manner, since it facilitates high
    energy efficiency, adaptive balance of energy consumption, and data collection
    efficacy. At the first level, maximized energy efficiency is achieved by dynamically
    selecting the CH at the cluster edge to play the roles of the CH and the monitoring
    node. At the second level, when the lifetime of the CH expires, new CH is selected,
    while the previous CH gets transited into a cluster member node, since each CH
    possesses different lifetimes in terms of communication costs and residual energy.
    Moreover, each individual CH node after receiving the sensed data from its cluster
    members sends the data to the collecting CH (CCH) rather than through relay nodes.
    This process of forwarding the data through CCH aids in receiving the aggregated
    data as earlier as possible and reducing the energy cost and workload incurred
    during data transmission. Moreover, the success probability in tackling dynamic
    CH selection confirmed by the proposed HGICSOA with scalable number of sensor
    nodes in the network is improved by 12.52%, 15.74%, 18.21%, and 195.98%, better
    than the benchmarked schemes. From Figure 17, it is confirmed that the proposed
    HGICSOA approach balanced the load of the network in a predominant manner by constructing
    large clusters near the sink and small clusters away from the sink node. Thus,
    the load balancing degree achieved by the proposed HGICSOA technique is also enhanced
    by 13.42%, 12.39%, 11.92%, and 10.18%, better than the benchmarked HRDSA, CSPSO,
    IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes with different number of sensor nodes in the network.

    analysis of the proposed HGICSOA scheme In this section, statistical analysis
    results of the proposed HGICSOA approach and the baseline HRDSA, CSPSO, IGAPSO,
    and HMBABC schemes with respect to residual energy are presented. In specific,
    Tables 3 and 4 depict the statistical analysis results of the proposed HGICSOA
    approach and the baseline HRDSA, CSPSO, IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes with 100 and
    200 sensor nodes, respectively. In this statistical validation, each clustering
    scheme is analyzed for significant number of times for accomplishing minimal residual
    energy, since metaheuristic schemes are stochastic and fair evaluation need to
    be substantiated. TABLE 3. Statistical analysis results of the proposed HGICSOA
    approach with the compared CH selection schemes using residual energy under 100
    sensor nodes. Mechanisms Best Worst Mean Median Standard deviation (SD) Proposed
    HGICSOA 0.007 0.584 0.234 0.173 0.189 HRDSA 0.003 0.593 0.214 0.158 0.195 CSPSO

    0.591 0.211 0.162 0.194 TABLE 4. Statistical analysis results of the proposed
    HGICSOA approach with the compared CH selection schemes using residual energy
    under 200 sensor nodes. Mechanisms Best Worst Mean Median Standard deviation (SD)
    Proposed HGICSOA 0.010 0.597 0.226 0.178 0.187 HRDSA 0.0003 0.598 0.224 0.185
    0.193 CSPSO 0.001 0.599 0.215 0.164 0.194 IGAPSO 0.007 0.599 0.217 0.163 0.192
    HMBABC 0.006 0.598 0.216 0.166 0.196 In Table 3, the proposed HGICSOA approach
    confirmed minimal residual energy values of −0.00054 for the best case of 100
    sensor nodes. On the other, Table 4 confirmed that the proposed HGICSOA approach
    confirmed minimal residual energy values of −0.00041 for the best case of 200
    sensor nodes. This significant performance of the proposed HGICSOA approach with
    the compared CH selection schemes using residual energy is mainly due to the improved
    energy evaluation strategy and the sink mobility scheme adopted for attaining
    better delivery of packets from the CHs to the sink nodes. 5 CONCLUSION The proposed
    HGICSOA-based clustering scheme achieved optimal CH selection and sink mobility-based
    data transmission by maintaining the trade-off between intensification and extensification
    during the search process of energy-efficient sensor nodes. It adopted OBL-based
    GHOA using the objective function that integrated the fitness factors of node
    density, residual energy, and distance between sensor node and sink facilitated
    optimal CH selection. It included a potential local search strategy improved CSOA
    and attained predominant sink mobility-based data transmission. It prevented worst
    sensor nodes from being selected as CH by adopting balanced trade-off between
    the rate of exploration and exploitation during the searching process. The simulation
    results confirmed that the network throughput of the HGICSOA scheme is maximized
    by 14.32%, 16.96%, 19.21%, and 21.89%, better than the baselines approaches. Moreover,
    the network residual energy sustained by the proposed HGICSOA with different rounds
    is also maximized by 16.34%, 18.85%, 20.42%, and 23.29%, better than the benchmarked
    HRDSA, CSPSO, IGAPSO, and HMBABC schemes. As the part of future plan, it is planned
    to formulate a Grasshopper and Differential Evolution-based CH selection scheme
    and compare it with the proposed HGICSOA for determining the difference between
    the two in terms of network lifetime and energy stability. CONFLICT OF INTEREST

    India SECTION I. INTRODUCTION Many are interested in the latest developments in
    wireless sensor networks because of the many possible uses in civilian and military
    settings [1]. With constrained resources like memory, processing speed, power,
    and bandwidth, a WSN can contain hundreds— if not thousands—of sensor nodes. Due
    to their small size, limited functionality, and placement in unsupervised locations,
    sensor nodes are vulnerable to a wide range of threats. It would be impractical
    to keep tabs on and defend each node individually. An attacker doesn''t need physical
    touch to propagate harmful software over networks; they can use several ways.
    For example, if an attacker has access to a specific node, they can use it to
    launch assaults using a variety of malicious software [2]. They might try to disrupt
    the network''s routing by spoofing, changing, or replaying routing information.
    Additionally, malicious actors may infiltrate the network with false data in an
    effort to squander its limited resources. Consequently, in order to guarantee
    accurate network operation by the WSNs, it is now crucial to implement security
    measures that offer non-repudiation, data integrity, secrecy, authentication,
    and other security goals. Densely distributed networks of small, inexpensive,
    multi-functional sensors can monitor phenomena, follow an item, or regulate a
    process; this technology is known as a wireless sensor network (WSN) [3] [11].
    WSNs find usage in a wide variety of fields, from home automation and other personal
    applications to sales tracking and other corporate uses, architectural and control
    applications in industry, and even military use, such as tracking enemy targets.
    The Internet of Things is a novel idea that might comprise the next generation
    of WSNs. It proposes that, in the near future, every item in human existence would
    be fitted with sensors that can interact with one another, forming a network that
    would greatly simplify human life. As part of the Internet of Things (IoT), sensor
    nodes dynamically connect to the internet and work together and execute activities
    using the internet''s infrastructure [4] [12]. Researchers in the fields of networking,
    systems with embedded information processing, distributed systems, and signal
    processing have all taken an interest in WSNs. Data mining, routing protocols,
    sensing hardware design, information processing, security as well as privacy are
    just a few of the many fields that have developed from this [5] [13]. Energy,
    memory, the bandwidth, and communication limitations are on top of the problems
    caused by these sensors'' shortcomings. Approaches to WSN Security: WSN is prone
    to several types of assaults. Wireless sensor networks have significant security
    challenges owing to characteristics such as their medium, transmission range,
    energy availability, hostile environments, and ad hoc deployment. There are two
    approaches to sensor security in WSN : prevention-based and detection-based. Methods
    that Focus on Prevention: Preventative measures are the first sequence of protection
    against security breaches in WSN. Cryptography is a key component of prevention-based
    techniques, which necessitates greater computational power and time. Hence, this
    method is not recommended for WSN. Identification by Detection: Detection-based
    approaches are better since they utilize fewer resources and time to discover
    abuse, signatures, or anomalies. Identity and Misuse Monitoring: A set of previously
    observed anomalies in the network''s behavior is defined. The next step is to
    search for assaults that the method has already identified. Therefore, new attacks
    could not be detected by signature-based detection as the approach is only familiar
    with the behavior of already specified attacks. Anomaly Detection: In contrast,
    the anomaly detection method builds a model of typical network even ts by observing
    and learning from the typical environment. Any data or incident that doesn''t
    fit the usual pattern is considered an anomaly. By comparing the observed data
    or occurrences to a standard set, anomaly detection can identify outliers. Therefore,
    even previously unseen threats might be detected using this form of variance detection.
    Anomaly detection has a substantial detection rate; however it has a significant
    false alarm rate. SECTION III. RELATED STUDY Among the most notable technologies
    for enhancing healthcare services, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) are emerging
    as part of the Internet of Healthcare Things idea [6]. By gathering and transmitting
    physiological data, WBANs allow healthcare providers to evaluate a patient''s
    criticality and act appropriately, therefore improving the quality of life for
    patients. Healthcare providers need accurate and trustworthy data that reflects
    the actual situation so they can make quick and informed choices. An area of study
    known as anomaly detection has emerged as a means to safeguard the integrity of
    acquired data by identifying suspicious patterns that could emerge from a variety
    of sources, including faulty sensors, inaccurate readings, or even intentional
    misconduct. The WBAN has been approached using a number of different anomaly detection
    strategies. When faced with enormous data streams and new context abnormal patterns
    in WBAN, however, current detection methods - largely based on machine learning
    and statistics - become ineffectual [6]. This paper [6] therefore presented a
    model that uses the correlations in the various physiological data attributes
    in conjunction with the capability of hybrid Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory
    techniques to identify contextual anomalies in the big data stream of WBAN in
    addition to simple point anomalies. When tested on several datasets with various
    participants, the suggested model attained an average of 99% accuracy and 98%
    F1-measure, compared to 64% for CNN and LSTM individually [6]. The smooth operation
    and resource restrictions of Wireless Sensor Networks are significantly affected
    by the dependability of their data [7]. A WSN''s base station receives data aggregated
    from sensor nodes that are part of a cluster and processes it. In order to guarantee
    consistency when data is aggregated, Anomaly Detection (AD) looks for outlier
    data. Data integrity with minimal energy consumption has been an important research
    subject in WSNs due to major resource restrictions in terms of energy consumption
    as well as sensor node lifetime. AD is expected to address this issue. Therefore,
    scientists are focused on finding ways to enhance the precision of data processed
    while taking into account the limitations of WSNs. This research presents a model
    for enhanced and energy-efficient anomalous instance detection using Feed-forward
    Auto encoder Neural Networks (FANNs). To further its goal of reducing false alarms,
    the suggested model doubles into a False Positive Reducer [7]. Its performance
    on real-time datasets has been evaluated against those of other leading unsupervised
    algorithms in terms of resilience and other important parameters. Our suggested
    approach helps to enhance accuracy while reducing false alarms, which in turn
    supports a WSN that can last [7]. Installed WSNs, or wireless sensor networks,
    have been proliferating at an astounding rate in recent years. Many sectors are
    embracing WSN for their numerous applications because of its tiny size and cost-effectiveness
    [8]. Among many other areas, environmental monitoring, building security, as well
    as precision agriculture are only a few examples. Many methods are suggested to
    safeguard data privacy during transmission from sensors to a base station in order
    to provide safe processing of data in the WSN. An important part of keeping the
    network and its data safe is detecting attacks, which is what this project is
    all about. To guarantee the safety of wireless sensor networks and avoid harmful
    assaults, anomaly detection is an important problem. Researchers have recently
    employed a variety of machine learning approaches to identify outliers using offline
    learning methods. However, there is a lack of comprehensive coverage of online
    learning classifiers in the existing literature [8]. An intrusion detection model
    that works with WSN features is our goal. An online Passive Aggressive classifier
    and an information gain ratio form the basis of this model. First, in order to
    extract useful information from the sensor data, the information gain ratio is
    applied. Another point is that many types of Denial of Service assaults are taught
    to the online Passive Aggressive algorithm. The dataset used for the experiment
    was the WSN-DS, which stands for wireless sensor network detection system. With
    a 96% detection rate, the ID-GOPA model can tell you if a network is safe or vulnerable
    to an attack. In addition to 99% for typical traffic, the detection accuracy for
    scheduling, gray hole, flooding, and blackhole assaults is 86%, 68%, 63%, and
    46%, respectively. These findings demonstrate that our offline learning approach
    may, in some situations, substitute online learning and provide the WSN with effective
    anomaly detection [8]. The reliability and quality of the data gathered by sensor
    nodes in wireless sensor networks might be compromised due to limited resources
    and challenging deployment circumstances. This, in turn, affects the accuracy
    of the analysis as well as decisions made in these networks [9]. Hence, the nodes''
    acquired data needs anomaly detection. In order to effectively identify outliers,
    support vector data description based on spatiotemporal as well as attribute correlations
    might be utilized. This study proposes a new optimization approach called N-STASVDD
    that is based on STASVDD. When the data vectors gathered in WSNs are independent
    and have the same distribution, the suggested technique takes this into account.
    However, outliers might happen in each attribute separately. In order to decrease
    the energy consumption of resource-constrained WSNs, the suggested solution employs
    the idea of core-sets to simplify the computational difficulty of the quadratic
    programming issue in STASVDD. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the distributed
    technique has greater performance compared to the centralized detection strategy
    of this method, which is likely due to the fact that it alleviates the communication
    overhead [9]. Extensive trials were conducted using datasets of both simulated
    and actual WSNs. From what we can see, N-STASVDD manages to accomplish both low
    time complexities and good detection accuracy [9]. An unprecedented deluge of
    sensor data is being produced at an unprecedented rate due to the extensive deployment
    of the Internet of Things using wireless sensor networks, leading to extremely
    enormous quantities of explicit as well as implicit information [10]. Detecting
    anomalous occurrences as well as individual anomalous behaviors is of utmost relevance
    when analyzing sensor data. The majority of prior work, however, has ignored correlations
    in favor of anomaly detection. The fact of how the anomaly condition of sensor
    data varies over time is typically ignored, even in systems that account for relationships
    between abnormalities. This article presents a method for detecting contextual
    anomalies in the Internet of Things (IoT) using wireless sensor networks without
    the need for supervision. Using their geographical and temporal neighbors as background,
    our technique takes into consideration both the current anomaly state and any
    relationships between them [10]. Then, using an anomaly detection model, we show
    that the suggested strategy works. This technique can efficiently and correctly
    detect both individual anomalies and anomalous occurrences, according to the experimental
    results [10]. SECTION III. METHODOLOGY Among the many important functions of WSNs,
    anomaly detection aids in the identification of out-of-the-ordinary occurrences
    and actions in the data being sensed. Immediate and proper action is required
    in the event of an anomaly since it may reveal a failure in the system''s sensors,
    equipment, or security. Because of the difficulty in designing predetermined rules
    for complicated WSNs system with high-dimensional data, conventional rule-based
    anomaly detection methods may not work well with WSNs. In order to identify anomalies
    more effectively and with more accuracy than the current Random Forest (RF) technique,
    the Advanced Learning based Anomaly Detection Protocol (ALADP) is suggested. In
    a wireless sensor network, a collection of independent electronic devices, that
    are linked together to gather information about their immediate surroundings.
    Several instances of data sources are electric current, voltage, power, light,
    noise, humidity, and temperature. It is common practice to link wireless sensor
    networks to cloud services over the Internet. To store and handle the massive
    amounts of data produced by sensors, cloud platforms offer the computational and
    storage infrastructures that are essential. The issue of automatically detecting
    anomalies in sensor data is a difficult one to study. The literature uses the
    phrase \"anomaly detection\" in a wide sense, meaning that it describes the process
    of finding things that make you suspicious. Numerous other military operations
    have already made use of WSNs, including environmental monitoring, target detection,
    and surveillance. The following figure Fig. 1 shows that these sensor networks
    often include of a large number of tiny, cheap nodes spread out across a large
    region. When it comes to WSNs, anomalies are defined as anything out of the ordinary
    that happens in the stream of sensor data collection and does not follow the regular
    patterns. Mistakes in the sensors, changes in the surrounding environment, hostile
    actions, or random variations in the detected data generated by external, asynchronous
    occurrences on the terrain are all potential sources of anomalies. There are three
    main kinds of anomalies: noise, events, as well as attack anomaly sources. The

    and why it must be reduced: Based on the features of the phenomena, sensor data
    is classified as either univariate or multivariate data, depending on its dimensions.
    Distinct sensors on the same node, or even distinct nodes, could provide samples
    for multivariate data. Due to the radio communication cost associated with each
    variable, it is evident that transmitting multivariate data would raise sensor
    energy usage. Consequently, the primary cause of the rapid energy consumption
    by sensors is the transmission of data between their individual nodes and more
    central places, including cluster heads as well as base stations. Mode of Operation:
    When originally designed, WSN anomaly detection models didn''t take online data
    anomaly detection into account. Rather, the WSN application architecture dictated
    that detection should occur after certain time frames. Offline detection models
    use less power, but they need more memory to store data batches for that time
    period. And because of that detection latency period, data integrity can be compromised.
    Thus, in order to minimize the wait time and guarantee data integrity, online
    detection is the way to go. Another consideration that impacts the utilization
    of online detecting mode involves the computational cost of detection algorithms.
    Model Structure: Current anomaly detection models use one of tree common structural
    types: local, centralized, or distributed. There is no inter-node communication
    or coordination when using an anomaly detector in a local structure. The anomaly
    detection procedure occurs in a central location, such as the base station or
    cluster head, in a centralized structure, once all the data has been transferred
    there. Exploiting Data Correlation: There is a significant degree of connection
    between attribute, geographic, and temporal data in sensor measurements of nearby
    neighborhoods. One way to make detection models more efficient is by using attribute/feature
    correlation to reduce data dimensions. If there is a relationship between readings
    taken at different times, we say that there is temporal correlation. SECTION IV.
    RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS One unit for sensing, one for processing data, one for
    power, and one for transmitting data make up the primary parts. Two parts make
    up the sensing unit: the sensor itself, which takes readings from the field, and
    the analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which transforms the sensor''s analogue
    signal into a digital format usable by the processing unit. A little storage medium
    is utilized by the processing unit to store data that is required for processing
    tasks. The node''s ability to communicate with other nodes and the base station
    is dependent on the transceiver unit. An energy generator, which provides the
    sensor with more power sources, a mobile node, which can help the sensor nodes
    move around, and a position finding system, which finds out where the nodes are
    right now, are three more units that might be part of the sensor structure depending
    on the application. One distinguishing feature of WSN architecture is the use
    of a separate layer design strategy for each of the network''s physical layers.
    The physical layer, for instance, offers a plethora of options for source encoding
    techniques. Channel programming and propagation of signals are also up for grabs,
    as are pulse code modulation and delta modulation, depending on the designer''s
    preference. Many options for an appropriate structure''s design are there at the
    Medium Access Control layer. Two primary approaches exist in the media access
    control layer: contention-based and contention-free. Networks with low data speeds,
    limited energy sources, and short distance interactions often use the IEEE 802.4
    protocol as the predominant specification for the physical and MAC layers. Since
    sensor data can be destroyed and damaged for several causes, including reading
    mistakes, malfunctioning sensors, or hostile attacks, providing data dependability
    and quality is one of the most significant motives for identifying anomalies in
    Wireless Sensor Network Anomaly detection may be built into WSNs for a variety
    of reasons, including event reporting. Many WSNs are now being used to monitor
    weather changes and fire detection, among other things. When used for event detection,
    anomaly detection aids in the early discovery of disasters and other major problems,
    allowing for more informed decision-making. In addition, scientists may find an
    incident interesting enough to warrant more investigation. A further compelling
    reason to develop anomaly detectors is the threat of malicious sensor nodes that
    might be infiltrated by certain attackers in WSNs. Attackers with this kind of
    access and control over a subset of the network''s nodes can then begin coordinated
    efforts to compromise data integrity or deplete the network''s limited resources.
    Consequently, erroneous conclusions might be drawn from this data in the future.
    In order to identify these types of assaults and take appropriate response, several
    works have taken on this topic and are using anomaly detection. We present an
    exhaustive review of WSN intrusion detection techniques. Data streams, which can
    include massive amounts of actual environmental observations, are the primary
    format for sensing data collection. There are WSNs that are purpose-built to gather
    specific kinds of data, including temperature, light or humidity. We refer to
    this type of information as univariate data and it is the goal of the proposed
    Advanced Learning based Anomaly Detection Protocol (ALADP) model to facilitate
    the simultaneous collection of many forms of field data, sometimes known as multi-variate
    data, in a WSN context. In these networks, each node typically has many sensors,
    allowing it to gather various kinds of data simultaneously. Each piece of information
    is referred to as a feature or attribute in the context of multivariate data.
    If a sensory data measurement exhibits unusual behaviour in at least one way,
    we say that it is anomalous. Anomaly identification is a breeze with univariate
    data; all it takes is seeing how one data attribute stands out when compared to
    the properties of other information occurrences. It is difficult to discover anomalies
    in multivariate WSNs because certain qualities might not behave abnormally on
    their own, but when combined they might. The identification of anomalies on multi-variate
    data yields good accuracy when the links between distinct qualities are cleverly
    utilized, despite the computing expense of multivariate data processing. There
    are temporal and geographical correlations in sensing data as well. When data
    from two different time periods are connected to one another, we say that there
    is temporal correlation. Because of spatial correlations, it is reasonable to
    assume that nearby node measurements will be connected with one another. The following
    figures, Fig-3 and Fig-4 represents the Anomaly Prediction accuracy ratio of the
    proposed scheme and the F1-Score of the proposed scheme in clear histogram perception,
    in which the same is cross-validated with the conventional Random Forest (RF)

    In order to detect malicious nodes in non-homogeneous WSNs, this research presented
    a model that uses real-world datasets. Through the implementation of an anomaly
    monitoring mechanism within the model, the proposed approach ALADP guaranteed
    the information consistency within sensor nodes and basestation. The findings
    demonstrate that by utilizing real-world data and our measured value, we may attain
    maximum detection rates in our ALADP model. The suggested method performs better
    than the competition when measuring the genuine alarm rate. The selection of the
    threshold value is affected by the detection ratio. Better anomaly detection may
    be possible after determining the optimal threshold, according to our findings.
    In instance, our findings validate that the suggested approach can sustain satisfactory
    anomaly detection accuracy using only half of the initial data. The main problem
    with our experiment is that the data levels include unknown harmful components.
    When conducting our experiment, we relied on trial and error to determine the
    appropriate threshold values for anomaly detection. We may improve this work in
    the future to detect and remove inaccurate values from the sensor nodes; this
    would assist cut down on unnecessary energy consumption caused by sending inaccurate
    readings to the base station. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More

    Location: Rabat, Morocco SECTION I. Introduction Due to the growth of AI and network
    technologies that complement the Internet of Things (IoT), the IoT market is gradually
    growing and the supply of IoT devices is expanding. Compared to other wireless
    communication technologies such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, Low Powered Wide Area
    Network (LPWAN) specializes in transmitting small amounts of data to a large area.
    It is split into two categories based on the frequency band used to transmit data.
    Narrow Band-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) and Sigfox [1] are representative technologies
    that utilize licensed and unlicensed frequencies, respectively. The reliance of
    the IoT on LoRa among LPWAN which is available in unlicensed frequency bands is
    expanding due to its features, including long-lasting batteries and long-distance
    data transmission. LoRa is a technology that provides low-power, long-distance
    communication adopting a modified Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) technology that
    monitors frequency alterations [2]. LoRaWAN is an open networking protocol on
    top of LoRa [3] and is applied in healthcare, public safety, precision agriculture
    [4], and so on [5]. However, despite the growing market share of LoRaWAN, security
    threats still exist and corresponding countermeasures are insufficient. LoRaWAN
    has been confirmed to be vulnerable to jamming attacks [6]. Since LoRa is based
    on CSS, attackers are able to disrupt communication by exploiting the chirp frequency.
    LoRaWAN employs predetermined frequencies, which makes LoRaWAN more vulnerable
    to wideband jamming attacks [7]. This weakness results in human and property damage
    since several data in high-risk industries transmitted over LoRaWAN are susceptible
    to information loss. For example, LoRaWAN applied in the medical area needs to
    monitor patients continuously who require real-time and always-on systems that
    are dangerous if packet loss occurs. In addition, agricultural production will
    suffer if farmers receive inaccurate soil and water data information. Therefore,
    this research focuses on measuring the jamming effect according to the distance
    from a LoRaWAN gateway to jamming devices and from a LoRaWAN gateway to end nodes
    by intimating the actual environment. This paper evaluates the performance of
    LoRaWAN against intentional and unintentional Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
    by conducting experiments in both outdoor and indoor environments. Furthermore,
    these experiments demonstrate that a jamming attack poses a potential risk to
    the security of LoRaWAN. SECTION II. Literature Review In this chapter, the advantages
    and use cases of LoRaWAN are introduced. The architecture of LoRaWAN from a security
    perspective and prior studies on analyzing network performance and jamming LoRaWAN
    are discussed next. A. The advantages of LoRaWAN LPWAN has features of low-power
    and long-distance communication, which is essential for the IoT industries. LoRa,
    in particular, is implemented in numerous applications to connect IoT devices
    and is well known for its long battery life. LoRaWAN is deployed in outdoor and
    indoor environments such as agriculture and medical industries. The use cases
    of LoRaWAN in medical LoRaWAN is generally utilized in the medical field since
    it is effective compared to cellular communication links, which are relatively
    more expensive to install and operate in the area where the Internet is unavailable
    [8]. For instance, infrared temperature sensors based on LoRa are employed to
    decrease the spread of COVID-19 by monitoring health data among neighboring cities
    [9]. In addition, LoRaWAN is applied to oversee the transfer of critical patients
    to the ward in a complex building by tracking their location [10]. Furthermore,
    it is used to examine the postures of seniors to detect falls and notify protectors
    in urgent situations [11]. By employing LoRaWAN, the medical industry is able
    to simplify the healthcare workflow while responding to emergencies in a flexible
    manner based on reliable and accurate data. The use cases of LoRaWAN in agriculture
    The usage of IoT in precision agriculture or smart farms is growing to increase
    production by monitoring and receiving information such as nutrients and moisture
    levels in the soil in real time [12]. The network requires a long-distance wireless
    connection at a reasonable price since it has to cover a wide area. Battery usage
    of the end device is also one of the essential factors, as it is practically impossible
    to change the batteries of widely spread sensors on the farm. The features of
    LoRaWAN, which are low-power and long-distance data transmission at a low price,
    solve these problems. LoRaWAN enables agricultural automation that yields more
    products by connecting widely distributed sensors. B. The architecture of LoRaWAN
    The architecture of LoRaWAN consists of end nodes, gateways, and three servers:
    network server, application server, and join server [13]. The end node sends sensor
    data to the network server through the gateway. Since the end node is registered
    to the network server rather than a specific gateway, the network server deletes
    duplicate messages from multiple gateways. The application server processes data
    received from the network server, and the join server allows the end node to authenticate
    and sends a join acceptance message. Before the end node transmits a message,
    it needs to be activated in one of two ways: Over-The-Air-Activation(OTAA) or
    Activation by Personalization(ABP). In OTAA mode, LoRaWAN guarantees security
    through the join procedure which checks whether the end node is registered with
    the network server [2]. The end node that tries to connect to the network sends
    ajoin request message to the join server. Thejoin server sends a join acceptance
    message to the end node if it is a legitimate device and delivers session keys
    to other servers to secure the traffic between the end node and the servers. However,
    ABP mode uses a fixed device address and session keys making the network insecure
    [14]. C. Prior study related to network performance analysis of LoRaWAN Mdhaffar
    et al. [15] installed a LoRaWAN gateway in the middle of a densely populated city
    to ascertain the coverage range of the network by transmitting health data collected
    through medical sensors in rural areas. For comparison of the network performance,
    experiments were conducted outdoors to measure coverage by driving the car around
    the building while transmitting data from the end node and indoors to forward
    data from the end node located inside the building near the place where the gateway
    is established. This experiment confirmed that the power consumption of the monitoring
    system employing LoRaWAN is relatively economical and suitable since it is more
    cost-effective than long-distance cellular systems such as 3G and 4G. Erbati et
    al. [16] experimented to assess the network performance in both indoor and outdoor
    with multiple obstacles. They verified how the values of the physical layer setting
    affect the coverage and reliability of LoRaWAN. Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) was
    employed as evaluation indicators. Among various methods used to measure network
    performance such as Packet Loss Rate, latency, and jitter, this paper measures
    network performance according to jamming attacks employing PDR which is widely
    utilized in previous studies. To evaluate the impact of jamming attacks on the
    LoRaWAN, this research carried out indoor and outdoor experiments that reflect
    real-world industries. D. Jamming on LoRaWAN Jamming is a technology that prevents
    the use of specific frequencies or radio waves by emitting Radio Frequency (RF).
    Accordingly, packet transmissions using the corresponding frequency are completely
    blocked by jamming. It is a fundamental problem of wireless networks that has
    been researched in various radio technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee,
    et cetera. As LoRaWAN in the United States uses a predetermined US915 band [17],
    anyone including attackers is available to transmit data in this frequency band
    without permission. Additionally, LoRa is based on the CSS which makes LoRaWAN
    more vulnerable to jamming attacks. Ajammer is able to sweep the same chirp frequency
    at the same speed, which makes data communication failure if the jammer finds
    the tuning slope of the chirp frequency. Even though narrowband jamming can be
    prevented since the jammer affects the chirp receiver for a short period, it is
    still vulnerable to wideband jamming [18]. SECTION III. Methodology Two different
    experiments are designed to prove the vulnerability of LoRaWAN that is applied
    in the industries to jamming attacks, both intentional and unintentional. The
    indoor and outdoor experiments of jamming between the gateway and the end node
    are designed in order to verify the data transmission capability of LoRaWAN at
    specific locations under a jamming attack. A. Indoor Experiment The indoor experiments
    aim to prove the possibility of damage in medical facilities induced by the jamming
    attack. Figure 1. The blueprint of a floor of the building where the indoor experiments
    were conducted Show All Figure 2. The blueprints of all floors where the indoor
    experiments were conducted Show All Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show the blueprints of the
    building, indicating the locations of the indoor experimental equipment. The red
    mark shows the location of the gateway, and the blue marks indicate the locations
    of the end nodes. The green marks represent the jammers for intentional scenarios.
    The orange marks represent the 900MHz network devices for the unintentional scenario.
    The indoor experiments are divided into whether the end nodes are placed on the
    same or different floor and whether the attack is intentional or unintentional.
    The intentional attack means disrupting the gateway with jammers placed side by
    side in ten centimeters. The unintentional attack means that the 900MHz network
    devices communicate with each other from a longer distance which affects the gateway
    inadvertently. El, E2, E3, and E4 are placed on the third floor as shown in Fig.
    1. Three additional end nodes, E5, E6, and E7, are placed at the same position
    as E2, which is located on the third floor, from the second floor to first basement
    floor, respectively to make a difference in the number of floors. The first scenario
    is a close-in attack implemented on A in Fig. 1. to simulate an intentional attack.
    The close-in attack means the attacker is physically in proximity to the target
    gateway. Four end nodes are placed, as shown in blue marks in the Fig. 1, to make
    a difference in the distance and the number of obstacles such as walls. Ajammer
    is located 20 centimeters next to the gateway to the LoRaWAN gateway at position
    A in the Fig. 1 to interfere with LoRaWAN communication. This scenario is designed
    to simulate when attackers are able to access the location of the gateway and
    assumes that all packets delivered to the gateway from end nodes are blocked.
    The second and third scenarios are intentional attacks implemented on B and C
    in Fig. 1. Four end nodes are placed on the same floor as a close-in attack experiment.
    Three additional end nodes, E5, E6, and E7, are placed to make a difference in
    the number of floors. A jammer attacks the LoRaWAN gateway at position B. Position
    C implements the same process as B, but farther from the gateway, approximately
    10 meters, to examine how the distance from the gateway to the jammer affects
    the network performance. The last scenario is designed to examine how much data
    transmission of LoRaWAN is affected by an unintentional attack. The seven end
    nodes are placed at the same positions in previous scenarios. This scenario assumes
    that 900MHz network devices are communicating with each other. The device on Dl
    in Fig. 1, a client, sends radio signals to the device at D2 in Fig. 1, which
    serves as a server. Due to the diffraction and reflection of the obstacles, the
    position of Dl and D2 is the maximum distance the two devices are able to communicate
    with each other. B. Outdoor Experiment LoRaWAN is subjected to unintended jamming
    attacks since 900MHz network devices are used to communicate outdoors, such as
    in a wide field or farm. The outdoor experiment aims to demonstrate whether the
    LoRaWAN gateway for outdoor IoT commercial deployment is interrupted by unintentional
    jamming attacks. The reason for experimenting on the farm is to simulate the external
    environment where LoRaWAN is utilized in precision agriculture, one of the applications
    where LoRaWAN is widely used outdoors. By selecting a farm that is not disturbed
    by buildings or people, the data transmission capability of LoRaWAN is measured
    with fewer variables. Fig. 3 shows the outdoor experimental diagram. The jamming
    effect is measured by differentiating the distance of the jammers and fixing the
    variety of distance of the end nodes from the gateway. The experiment attempts
    to jam the gateway which is fixed in the center by moving the jammer away from
    the gateway horizontally, as shown in Fig. 3. The distance between the LoRaWAN
    gateway and jammers varies from 10m, 50m, and 100m. The three end nodes are placed
    according to the distances of 100m, 200m, and 500m in the vertical direction between
    the jammer and the gateway. Figure 3. Diagram of the outdoor experiment Show All
    SECTION IV. Implementation Experiments are designed in order to confirm how jamming
    attacks influence the data transmission of LoRaWAN in the real world, like medical
    and agricultural fields, which are prevalent industries using LoRaWAN. A. Experiment
    Setup The experiments were carried out employing the following equipment to construct
    LoRaWAN. The gateway called ‘KONA Micro IoT Gateway (KONA)’ [19], which transmits
    at 27dBm with integrated antenna, was used for indoor experiments. ‘RAK7249 WisGate
    Edge Max (RAK)’ [20], which transmits at 27dBm with 3dBi fiberglass antenna, were
    used for the outdoor experiment. ‘Heltec WiFi LoRa32 V2 (ESP32)’ [21], which transmits
    at 19.5 dBm with 3dBi antenna, were set as end nodes that transmit packets repetitively
    to the network server through the gateway. The Things Network (TTN) and Chirpstack,
    platforms for LoRaWAN, were used to register gateways and end nodes to identify
    packets being forwarded. The reason for using the following gateways and end nodes
    is to control other factors and measure the impact of jamming attacks by building
    LoRaWAN with devices employed in outdoor and indoor industries. ‘Motorola Canopy
    9000SMC (Canopy)’ devices serve as jammers. A Canopy device is a wireless communication
    system that enables communication through RF signals in places where the Internet
    access is unavailable [22]. Canopy device used in the experiment is based on the
    frequency bands from 906MHz to 923MHz, which are included within the frequency
    bands used by LoRa. The output power of the Canopy device is 26dBm. Canopy device
    is used with the Maxrad XtremeWave 900MHz 9.1dBi Panel Antenna [23]. Assuming
    the cable loss is ignored, ERP of the Canopy device and antenna used in the experiments
    is derived by: ERP= T p + A g −2.15 (1) View Source (unit: dBm) Where T p is the
    RF power of the device in dBm, and A g is the antenna gain in dBi. Hence the ERP
    of the experiment is 32. 95dBm, and with the milliwatt conversion: mW= 10 dBm
    10 (2) View Source ERP in milliwatts is equivalent to 1972. 42mW. Since the radio
    signal strength of the Canopy device is high, referring to the regulation of the
    900MHz unlicensed bands [24], it acts as a jammer that interferes with the packet
    transmission of LoRaWAN. In order to simulate a radio backhaul link under heavy
    load, iperf [25] is used on TCP with 16 simultaneous connections. As Access Point
    (AP) assigns a time slot to the Subscriber Module (SM) to avoid time between slot
    allocation, AP is used as a client, and SM is used as a server in the experiments.
    The experiments were conducted with a pair of AP and SM which is set as 906MHz
    since the jamming attack is performed by interfering LoRa uplink frequency from
    902MHz to 915MHz. B. Metric The results of the experiments were analyzed by calculating
    Packet Delivery Ratio(PDR). PDR informs data transmission capability of the LoRaWAN.
    This paper demonstrates the vulnerability of LoRaWAN by jamming attacks through
    Jamming Effect (JE) introduced in this paper. T avg is the average time for sending
    100 packets from the end node to the gateway for three cycles without jamming,
    and N norm is the number of packets sent from the end node. T j is the duration
    of ajamming attack, and N exp is the expected number of packets during the T j
    . The proportional expression for T avg , N norm , T j , and N exp is: T avg :
    N norm = T j : N exp (3) View Source N norm is fixed to 100 in all experiments.
    N exp is computed as (3) in order to derive assumed PDR. Where PD R norm is a
    PDR without jamming and N ac t − norm is the number of packets delivered to the
    gateway without a loss, PD R norm is acquired by: PD R norm = N ac t − norm N
    norm (4) View Source which is a ratio of the N norm and N ac t − norm . PDR while
    jamming is computed as: PD R j = N act_j N exp (5) View Source where PD R j is
    PDR while jamming and N act_j is the actual number of packets delivered to the
    gateway without a loss while jamming. JE is calculated as: JE=1− PD R j PD R norm
    (6) View Source JE is one if any packet is not delivered to the gateway due to
    the jamming attack. JE is zero if LoRaWAN is not affected by jamming attacks at
    all. These metrics are introduced to calculate the PDR of wireless networks that
    diverge signals without a destination. LoRaWAN devices do not recognize whether
    packets are delivered correctly. Therefore, assumed PDR is required since the
    packets sent while jamming cannot be observed. In addition, as wireless networks
    like LoRaWAN already have a packet loss, JE is introduced to calculate how much
    the devices are affected by jamming. C. Indoor Experiment The indoor experiment
    is conducted at the building at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, US. It
    is a four-story building with a large moving population and consists of several
    laboratories and lecture rooms. A KONA gateway, a pair of Canopy devices, and
    ESP32 devices were employed in the experiment. TTN, the platform that serves cloud-based
    LoRaWAN, is used to register the devices. Table I The Result of Close-in Attack
    Scenario in Indoor Table I shows the close-in attack experiment that places the
    Canopy devices right next to the KONA gateway with four ESP32 devices placed at
    the specific locations described in Fig. 1 on the same floor. It shows that the
    gateway did not receive any packet from all end nodes, as JE is one for all devices.
    This result proves the vulnerability of LoRaWAN in close-in jamming attacks. Table
    II The Result of Intentional Scenario on the Same Floor Table II is the result
    of experiments that simulate intentional attacks at close and far distances from
    Canopy devices to the gateway, respectively, with the ESP32 devices placed at
    a specific location on the same floor described in Fig. 1. Table II shows that
    the JE is reduced in all end nodes when the Canopy devices are far from the gateway.
    It confirms that the location of the jammer affects the jamming attack considering
    that the JE decreases as the location of the jammers gets farther away from the
    gateway. Through the tables, the E4, the farthest end node from the gateway, has
    the highest JE, while the other end nodes near the gateway appear to have lower
    JE in both scenarios since there are many obstacles between the end node and the
    gateway. Nevertheless, it is a critical attack in places that do not allow errors,
    such as hospitals. It is recommended to place at least two gateways per floor
    to be prepared for jamming attacks. Table III The Result of Intentional Scenario
    on the Different Floor Table III is the result of experiments that simulate intentional
    attacks at close and far distances from Canopy devices to the gateway, respectively,
    with the ESP32 devices placed at a specific location on different floors described
    in Fig. 2. Table III shows that E7, the farthest end node, cannot receive any
    packet, as JE is one when the jammer is close to the gateway. It also shows that
    the data transmission of the end nodes on the different floors is interrupted
    rather than the end node on the same floor. The results demonstrate that other
    variables, such as refraction and scattering, besides the obstacles, such as the
    floor, affect LoRaWAN when jamming attacks occur. Table III shows that the jamming
    effect decreases as the locations of the jammers get farther from the gateway.
    Table IV The Result of Unintentional Scenario on the Same Floor Table V The Result
    of Unintentional Scenario on the Different Floor Table IV and Table V are the
    results of experiments that simulate unintentional attacks on the same floor and
    different floors, respectively. Both tables show that the PDR is close to 0 and
    the JE is close to 1. The communications in the 900MHzRF near the gateway significantly
    affect the LoRaWAN. D. Outdoor Experiment The outdoor experiment was conducted
    on the farm located at 13455 S525W, Romney, IN 47981, USA. The experiment was
    performed on a flat meadow to conduct the experiment in a completely open environment.
    A RAK gateway, a pair of Canopy devices, and three ESP32 devices were employed
    in the experiment. The local LoRaWAN based on the Chirpstack was used since the
    Internet is not working on the farm. Figure 4. The map of the location using Google
    Earth [26] where the outdoor experiment was conducted Show All Fig. 4 marks the
    locations of devices for outdoor experiment. The red pin indicates the location
    of the RAK gateway, and the yellow pins represent the positions of the ESP32 devices,
    which are the end nodes fixed at 100m, 200m, and 500m from the gateway. The blue
    pins indicate the locations of Canopy devices in the vertical direction of the
    line connecting the end node and the gateway. Experiments were conducted by varying
    the Canopy devices with distances of 10m, 50m, and 100m on both sides from the
    gateway. Table VI The Result of Outdoor Experiment Table VI shows the result of
    the outdoor experiment. The first component of Distance is the distance from the
    gateway and the end node. The other component is the distance from the gateway
    and one side of a jammer. Table VI shows that most LoRaWAN communications are
    blocked whether the end node and jammer are close or far from the gateway. Since
    there are fewer obstacles than indoors, JE is higher compared to the indoor experiments,
    even at longer distances. A method that protects LoRaWAN from being disrupted
    should be proposed since 900MHzRF devices are widely used outdoors where the Internet
    is unavailable. SECTION V. Conclusion This research aims to evaluate the performance
    of LoRaWAN against jamming attacks and to inform the security vulnerability in
    the physical layer, with both intentional and unintentional attacks. The results
    of these experiments conducted under the United States’ dBi limit establish with
    concrete numbers. If a LoRaWAN network is installed in an environment where network
    devices corresponding to the 900 MHz are already deployed, jamming can occur even
    in unintentional normal communication situations. In addition, it is highly vulnerable
    to intentional jamming attacks because network devices such as Canopy are easy
    to obtain and can be used without networking expertise. In order to substantiate
    the potential occurrence of this issue in real-world scenarios where LoRaWAN is
    commonly used, we designed our experimental environment which is similar to the
    medical and agricultural industries. In addition, the metrics are suggested for
    more accurate performance evaluation, which indicates the effect of jamming under
    wireless networks that diverge packets through RF signals without a destination.
    Experiment results show high JE, which suggests that the security vulnerability
    of LoRaWAN needs to be reconsidered. Therefore, this research demonstrates the
    security vulnerability in LoRaWAN on the physical layer and the countermeasures
    should arise for the LoRaWAN. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research was supported by the

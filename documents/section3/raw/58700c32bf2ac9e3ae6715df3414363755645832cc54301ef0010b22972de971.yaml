    \ \nGROWTH \nSummary \nSensors and sensor networks have an important impact in\
    \ meeting environmental challenges. Sensor \napplications in multiple fields such\
    \ as smart power grids, smart buildings and smart industrial process \ncontrol\
    \ significantly contribute to more efficient use of resources and thus a reduction\
    \ of greenhouse gas \nemissions and other sources of pollution.  \nThis report\
    \ gives an overview of sensor technology and fields of application of sensors\
    \ and sensor \nnetworks. It discusses in detail selected fields of application\
    \ that have high potential to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions and reviews studies\
    \ quantifying the environmental impact. \nThe review of the studies assessing\
    \ the impact of sensor technology in reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions reveals\
    \ that the technology has a high potential to contribute to a reduction of emissions\
    \ across \nvarious fields of application. Whereas studies clearly estimate an\
    \ overall strong positive effect in smart \ngrids, smart buildings, smart industrial\
    \ applications as well as precision agriculture and farming, results for \nthe\
    \ field of smart transportation are mixed due to rebound effects. In particular\
    \ intelligent transport systems \nrender transport more efficient, faster and\
    \ cheaper. As a consequence, demand for transportation and thus \nthe consumption\
    \ of resources both increase which can lead to an overall negative effect.  \n\
    This illustrates the crucial role governments have to enhance positive environmental\
    \ effects. Increased \nefficiency should be paralleled with demand-side management\
    \ to internalise environmental costs. Further, \nminimum standards in the fields\
    \ of smart buildings and smart grids in regard to energy efficiency can \nsignificantly\
    \ reduce electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, this report\
    \ also \nhighlights that applications of sensor technology are still at an early\
    \ stage of development. Government \nprogrammes demonstrating and promoting the\
    \ use of sensor technology as well as the development of open \nstandards could\
    \ contribute to fully tap the potential of the technology to mitigate climate\
    \ change.  \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN\
    \ GROWTH – 7 \n \n7 \nSensor technology for green growth \nEnvironmental degradation\
    \ and global warming are among the major global challenges facing us. \nThese\
    \ challenges include improving the efficient use of energy as well as climate\
    \ change. ICTs and the \nInternet play a vital role in both, being part of the\
    \ problem (they consume energy and are a source of \npollution) and have the potential\
    \ to provide important solutions to it (ICT applications in other sectors have\
    \ \nmajor potential to improve environmental performance). \nVarious examples\
    \ illustrate the role of ICTs as a provider of solutions to environmental challenges:\
    \ \nSmart grids and smart power systems in the energy sector can have major impacts\
    \ on improving energy \ndistribution and optimising energy usage (Adam and Wintersteller,\
    \ 2008). Smart housing can contribute to \nmajor reductions of energy use in hundreds\
    \ of millions of buildings. Smart transportation systems are a \npowerful way\
    \ of organising traffic more efficiently and reducing CO2 emissions.  \nAll these\
    \ applications have one important attribute in common: They all rely on sensor\
    \ technology \nand often on sensor networks. Because of the important impact of\
    \ applications of sensors and sensor \nnetworks in meeting environmental challenges,\
    \ this analysis has been developed in the context of OECD’s \nwork \non \nICTs\
    \ \nand \nenvironmental \nchallenges \n[see \nalso \nDSTI/ICCP/IE(2008)3/FINAL\
    \ \nand \nDSTI/ICCP/IE(2008)4/FINAL, and DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)2/FINAL for broadband\
    \ investments in smart \ngrids] and the WPIE’s Programme of Work 2009–2010. It\
    \ is also a direct follow-up to the Seoul \nDeclaration for the Future of the\
    \ Internet Economy, issued at the close of the OECD Ministerial Meeting \nin June\
    \ 2008, which invited the OECD and stakeholders to explore the role of information\
    \ and \ncommunication technologies (ICTs) and the Internet in addressing environmental\
    \ challenges.  \nThe report opens with some technological fundamentals in describing\
    \ sensor technology and sensor \nnetworks. This is followed by an overview of\
    \ different fields of application. Selected sensor and sensor \nnetwork applications\
    \ are discussed as well as their environmental impact.  \nSensors, actuators and\
    \ sensor networks – a technology overview \nSensors measure multiple physical\
    \ properties and include electronic sensors, biosensors, and chemical \nsensors.\
    \ This paper deals mainly with sensor devices which convert a signal detected\
    \ by these devices into \nan electrical signal, although other kinds of sensors\
    \ exist. These sensors can thus be regarded as “the \ninterface between the physical\
    \ world and the world of electrical devices, such as computers” (Wilson, \n2008).\
    \ The counterpart is represented by actuators that function the other way round,\
    \ i.e. whose tasks \nconsist in converting the electrical signal into a physical\
    \ phenomenon (e.g. displays for quantities measures \nby sensors (e.g. speedometers,\
    \ temperature reading for thermostats).  \nTable 1 provides examples of the main\
    \ sensor types and their outputs. Further sensors include \nchemical sensors and\
    \ biosensors but these are not dealt with in this report. Outputs are mainly voltages,\
    \ \nresistance changes or currents. Table 1 shows that sensors which measure different\
    \ properties can have the \nsame form of electrical output (Wilson, 2008).  \n\

    \ based on Wilson, 2008. \nWireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) are networks\
    \ of nodes that sense and potentially also \ncontrol their environment. They communicate\
    \ the information through wireless links “enabling interaction \nbetween people\
    \ or computers and the surrounding environment” (Verdone et al., 2008). The data\
    \ gathered \nby the different nodes is sent to a sink which either uses the data\
    \ locally, through for example actuators, or \nwhich “is connected to other networks\
    \ (e.g. the Internet) through a gateway (Verdone et al., 2008). \nFigure 1 illustrates\
    \ a typical WSAN1. \nSensor nodes are the simplest devices in the network. As\
    \ their number is usually larger than the \nnumber of actuators or sinks, they\
    \ have to be cheap. The other devices are more complex because of the \nfunctionalities\
    \ they have to provide (Verdone et al., 2008). \nA sensor node typically consists\
    \ of five main parts: one or more sensors gather data from the \nenvironment.\
    \ The central unit in the form of a microprocessor manages the tasks. A transceiver\
    \ (included \nin the communication module in Figure 2) communicates with the environment\
    \ and a memory is used to \nstore temporary data or data generated during processing.\
    \ The battery supplies all parts with energy (see \nFigure 2). To assure a sufficiently\
    \ long network lifetime, energy efficiency in all parts of the network is \ncrucial.\
    \ Due to this need, data processing tasks are often spread over the network, i.e.\
    \ nodes co-operate in \ntransmitting data to the sinks (Verdone et al., 2008).\
    \ Although most sensors have a traditional battery there \nis some early stage\
    \ research on the production of sensors without batteries, using similar technologies\
    \ to \npassive RFID chips without batteries. \n \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES\

    \ can be \ndetected by sensor networks so that they can be fought at an early\
    \ stage. Sensor networks can be used to \nmonitor the structural integrity of\
    \ civil structures by localising damage for example in bridges. Further, \n10\

    \ fields of application. The upper part of Figure 3 shows fields of \napplication\
    \ discussed in more detail in this study as they have a high potential to tackle\
    \ environmental \nchallenges and reduce CO2 emissions. The fields of application\
    \ in the lower part of the figure are briefly \ndiscussed in Appendix A1 to give\
    \ an overview of further interesting fields of application.  \nSelected applications\
    \ and their environmental impact \nSmart grids and energy control systems  \n\
    Introduction, definition and main components \nCoal power plants are responsible\
    \ for “nearly 40% of electricity production worldwide”, and \nelectricity generation\
    \ is thus responsible for a significant share of CO2 emissions (Atkinson, Castro,\
    \ 2008). \nTo decrease emissions from the energy supply side, alternative clean\
    \ technologies can be used to generate \nelectricity or energy can be distributed\
    \ in a more efficient way. In both cases, sensor networks contribute to \nbetter\
    \ and more efficient processes.  \nOn the generation side, sensor networks enable\
    \ solar energy to be generated more efficiently. \nStandalone panels “do not always\
    \ capture the sun’s power in the most efficient manner” (Atkinson, Castro, \n\
    2008). Automated panels managed by sensors track sun rays to ensure that the sun’s\
    \ power is gathered in a \nmore efficient manner. Such systems can also turn on\
    \ and off automatically (Atkinson, Castro, 2008).  \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS:\
    \ TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH – 11 \n \n11 \nOn the distribution\
    \ side, energy is distributed in an often inefficient way in traditional grids.\
    \ At the \ntime when present girds were planned and extended, they had one single\
    \ mission, namely “to keep the \nlights on” (DOE, 2008). As a consequence, these\
    \ grids have several shortcomings: many systems are \ncentralised and rely on\
    \ important central power stations making it difficult to integrate distributed\
    \ energy \nresources and microgrids (EU, 2006). They most often only support one-way\
    \ power flow and \ncommunication from the utility to consumers. Further, utilities\
    \ can barely track how energy is consumed \nacross the grid (Atkinson and Castro,\
    \ 2008) and, as a consequence, have no possibility to provide any \npricing incentive\
    \ to balance power consumption over time. As utilities can only accommodate increases\
    \ in \ndemand up to a certain level, they are forced to rely on additional peak\
    \ load power plants to cope with \nunexpected demand increases (Climate Group,\
    \ 2008). This is highly expensive and potentially polluting, \nparticularly if\
    \ plants use fossil fuels (Atkinson and Castro, 2008).  \nAs demand rises and\
    \ additional power from distributed resources is fed into the grid, important\
    \ \nchanges must be made. The smart grid is an innovation that has the potential\
    \ to revolutionise the \ntransmission, distribution and conservation of energy.\
    \ It employs digital technology to improve \ntransparency and to increase reliability\
    \ as well as efficiency. ICTs and especially sensors and sensor \nnetworks play\
    \ a major role in turning traditional grids into smart grids. However, they are\
    \ only one group \nof key components of the smart grid. The following section\
    \ gives an extensive overview of the concept of \nthe smart grid and its key components\
    \ beyond a pure discussion of sensors and sensor networks as major \nbenefits\
    \ only arise from the interaction between these components.  \nDefining the smart\
    \ grid in a concise way is not an easy task as the concept is relatively new and\
    \ as \nvarious alternative components build up a smart grid. Some authors even\
    \ argue that it is “too hard” to \ndefine the concept (Miller, 2008). Looking\
    \ at different definitions reveals that the smart grid has been \ndefined in different\
    \ ways by different organisations and authors. Table 2 gives an overview of selected\
    \ \ndefinitions. It shows two different approaches to define the smart grid: it\
    \ is either defined from a solution \nperspective (“What are the main advantages\
    \ of the grid?”) or from a components’ perspective (“Which \ncomponents constitute\
    \ the grid?”). \n12 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR\

    \ \nA “smart grid” is a set of software and hardware tools that enable generators\
    \ \nto route power more efficiently, reducing the need for excess capacity and\
    \ \nallowing two-way, real time information exchange with their customers for\
    \ \nreal time demand side management (DSM). It improves efficiency, energy \n\
    monitoring and data capture across the power generation and T&D network.  \nAdam\

    \ and automated control systems, enables real-time market \ntransactions and seamless\
    \ interfaces among people, buildings, industrial \nplants, generation facilities,\
    \ and the electric networks. \n \nFrom a solution perspective, the smart grid\
    \ is characterised by: \n \nMore efficient energy routing and thus an optimised\

    \ generated close to the customer to be served which improves \nreliability, can\
    \ reduce greenhouse gas emissions and at the same time expand efficient energy\
    \ delivery \n(DOE, 2008). Furthermore, most of these alternative energy generation\
    \ technologies close to customers \nsuch as solar panels and wind power stations\
    \ are renewable energy sources. These technologies, e.g. solar \npanels, small\
    \ hydro-electric and small hydro-thermals can be operated by consumers, or small\
    \ providers. \nSmart devices and smart metering \nSmart devices and smart metering\
    \ include sensors and sensor networks. Sensors are used at multiple \nplaces along\
    \ the grid, e.g. at transformers and substations or at customers’ homes (Shargal\
    \ and Houseman, \n2009b). They play an outstanding role in the area of remote\
    \ monitoring and they enable demand-side \nmanagement and thus new business processes\
    \ such as real-time pricing.  \n14 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS\
    \ FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n \n14 \nSpread over the grid, sensors and sensor networks\
    \ monitor the functioning and the health of grid \ndevices, monitor temperature,\
    \ provide outage detection and detect power quality disturbances. Control \ncentres\
    \ can thus immediately receive accurate information about the actual condition\
    \ of the grid. \nConsequently, maintenance staff can maintain the grid just-in-time\
    \ in the case of disruptions rather than \nrely on interval-based inspections.\
    \  \nSmart meters at customers’ homes play a crucial role. They allow for real-time\
    \ determination and \ninformation storage of energy consumption and provide “the\
    \ possibility to read consumption both locally \nand remotely” (Siderius and Dijkstra,\
    \ 2005). Further, they also provide the means to detect fluctuations and \npower\
    \ outages, permit remote limitations on consumption by customers and permit the\
    \ meters to be \nswitched off. This results in important cost savings and enables\
    \ utilities to prevent electricity theft.2  \nFigure 5: Smart meter  \n \nSource:\
    \ Siemens, 2008. \nElectricity providers get a better picture of customers’ energy\
    \ consumption and obtain a precise \nunderstanding of energy consumption at different\
    \ points in time. As a consequence, utilities are able to \nestablish demand-side\
    \ management (DSM) and to develop new pricing mechanisms. Energy can be priced\
    \ \naccording to real-time costs taking peak power loads into account and price\
    \ signals can be transmitted to \nhome controllers or customers’ devices which\
    \ may then evaluate the information and power accordingly \n(DOE, 2003). Customers\
    \ thus become more interactive with suppliers and “benefit from an increased \n\
    visibility into their energy consumption habits” (IBM, 2007). They are aware of\
    \ actual power costs rather \nthan only obtaining a monthly or even yearly electricity\
    \ bill. To date, a number of OECD countries (Italy, \nNorway, Spain, Sweden and\
    \ the Netherlands) have mandated the use of smart meters.  \nIntegrated communication\
    \ technologies \nInformation provided by smart sensors and smart meters needs\
    \ to be transmitted via a communication \nbackbone. This backbone is characterized\
    \ by a high-speed and two-way flow of information. Different \ncommunication applications\
    \ and technologies form the communication backbone. These can be classified \n\
    into communication services groups (EPRI, 2006). Figure 6 provides an overview\
    \ of these groups as well \nas brief descriptions and examples.  \n \nSMART SENSOR\

    \ \n Utilities have the choice between multiple and diverse technologies in the\
    \ area of communication \nnetwork technologies. Usually, several network technologies\
    \ are deployed within a smart grid. The \nfollowing paragraphs provide an overview\
    \ of different wide-area networks (WAN) and local-area networks \n(LAN). The distinction\
    \ between WAN and LAN technologies is made in this context to differentiate \n\
    between networks used to reach the customer and those at customer sites (EPRI,\
    \ 2006). \nWide-area network technologies provide a means for a two-way information\
    \ flow in the smart grid. \nMultiple technologies are available which provide\
    \ both broadband and narrowband solutions for the smart \ngrid, resulting in a\
    \ highly fragmented market. Table 3 presents the main WAN technologies as well\
    \ as their \nstrengths and weaknesses for their deployment in the smart grid.\
    \  \nThe choice of WAN technologies will depend on factors such as reliability,\
    \ low-cost, security and the \nnetwork infrastructure that is already available.\
    \ It is likely that utilities will rely on several network \ntechnologies when\
    \ they build smart grids as they have to cope with differences in geography, population\
    \ \ndensities as well as availability and competition of different network technologies\
    \ in their services areas. \nSome of these will require broadband, some will not.\

    \ \npower line communications (EPRI, 2006).  \nWireless IEEE standards include\

    \ (IEEE 802.15.1). Based on EPRI (2006), Table 4 shows how these standards can\

    \ vulnerabilities \nSource: Based on EPRI, 2006. \nWired Ethernet is the prevalent\
    \ LAN technology today. Customers’ sites can be connected via \nEthernet with\
    \ WAN or other networks. Due to its wide use, it has important market support,\
    \ multiple \ndifferent products are available and costs are relatively low (EPRI,\
    \ 2006). However, it is a local area \nnetwork technology only. \nIn-building\
    \ power line communications: The two most common technologies in this area are\
    \ Home \nPlug and X10 (EPRI, 2006). Home Plug is a broadband over power line (BPL)\
    \ system that provides a bit \nrate of approximately 14 Mbps (The Power Alliance,\
    \ 2009b). It is suited for applications requiring Quality \nof Service (QoS) with\
    \ four different levels of priority. Further, encryption mechanisms are available.\
    \ It can \nbe deployed to connect equipment at customers’ site. Newer versions\
    \ also support advanced portal \napplications such as entertainment delivery (EPRI,\
    \ 2006). Strengths of the Home Plug network include \nconnectivity to home wiring\
    \ and QoS features (EPRI, 2006). The main shortcoming is the lack of standards\
    \ \nboth at the national and international level. Currently, the Home Plug Alliance\
    \ that promotes Home Plug \nworks together with the ZigBee Alliance and EPRI define\
    \ a Smart Energy Standard for consumer \napplications (The Home Plug Alliance,\
    \ 2009a). \nX10 “is the earliest, and probably the most popular, power-line carrier\
    \ system for home automation” \nand a “convenient mechanism for a portal to control\
    \ load equipment (e.g. thermostats, pool pumps)” \n(EPRI, 2006). Strengths include\
    \ the common use implying that multiple equipments are compatible with \nX10 and\
    \ low implementation costs if devices already use power lines (EPRI, 2006). However,\
    \ it cannot be \nused as a general purpose LAN. Further, it is a de facto standard\
    \ only and there is no open access to the \nprotocol (EPRI, 2006).  \nOverall,\
    \ defining a smart grid’s communication backbone at the early stage including\
    \ different \nnetwork technologies is paramount for the interoperability of different\
    \ devices. If not done properly at an \nearly stage, sub-projects “may have to\
    \ be retrofitted later to accommodate the eventual communication \n18 - SMART\
    \ SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n \n18\
    \ \nstandards, adding greatly to time and expense” (Shargal and Houseman, 2009a).\
    \ At this stage of \ndevelopment, a compilation of information regarding the success\
    \ or failure of electricity service providers \nin their choices for the communication\
    \ backbone to their smart grid will be invaluable. This will, for \nexample, help\
    \ telecommunications regulators to work out what kind of investment in national\
    \ broadband \ninfrastructures will help to achieve the aims of building smart\
    \ infrastructures.6  \nProgrammes for decision support and human interfaces \n\
    Another key component area of the smart grids comprises programmes for decision\
    \ support and \nhuman interfaces. The data volume in smart grids will increase\
    \ tremendously compared to traditional grids. \nAs Houseman and Shargal (2009)\
    \ suggest, “a utility with five million customers […] will have more data \nfrom\
    \ their distribution grid than Wal-Mart gets from all of its stores, and Wal-Mart\
    \ manages the world’s \nlargest data warehouse”. One of the main challenges of\
    \ utilities is thus on the one hand the integration and \nmanagement of the generated\
    \ data and on the other hand making the data available to grid operators and \n\
    managers in a user-friendly manner to support their decisions.  \nTools and applications\
    \ include systems based on artificial intelligence and semi-autonomous agent \n\
    software, visualisation technologies, alerting tools, advanced control and performance\
    \ review applications \n(SAIC, 2006) as well as data and simulation applications\
    \ and geospatial information systems (GIS). \nArtificial intelligence methods\
    \ as well as semi-autonomous agent software, for example, contribute to \nminimise\
    \ data volume “and to create a format most effective for user comprehension” whereby\
    \ the \nsoftware has features that learn from input and adapts (SAIC, 2006). New\
    \ methods of visualisation enable \nintegration of data from different sources,\
    \ providing information on the status of the grid and power quality \nand rapid\
    \ information on instabilities and outages. Finally, geographic information systems\
    \ provide \ngeographic, spatial and location information and tailor this information\
    \ to the specific requirements for \ndecision support systems along the smart\
    \ grid. \nAdvanced control systems \nAdvanced control systems constitute the last\
    \ group of the smart grids’ key components. They monitor \nand control essential\
    \ elements of the smart grid. Computer-based algorithms allow efficient data collection\
    \ \nand analysis, provide solutions to human operators and are also able to act\
    \ autonomously (SAIC, 2006). \nFor example, new substation automation systems\
    \ have been developed that provide local information and \nthat can also be monitored\
    \ remotely. Whereas the substation information is only available locally in \n\
    traditional smart grids, new developed subsystems are capable of making this information\
    \ available in the \nwhole grid and thus provide better power management. Faults\
    \ can be detected much faster than in \ntraditional grids and outage times can\
    \ be reduced.  \nThe environmental impact of smart grids \nStudies which aim at\
    \ quantifying the environmental impacts of smart grids typically only quantify\
    \ \npositive impacts. Currently there is a lack of data which quantifies the negative\
    \ footprint of ICT \ninfrastructure involved in smart grids. In the following\
    \ section three studies that examine the CO2e (CO2 \nequivalent)7 abatement potential\
    \ of smart grids are discussed (see Table 5).  \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES\

    \ study (2008) evaluates the opportunity of smart grids by both presenting a case\
    \ study for \nIndia and by quantifying global positive impacts. According to the\
    \ study, power losses in India accounted \nfor 32% of total power production in\
    \ 2007. Currently, utilities are not able to detect where the losses occur \n\
    in the traditional grids. ICT platforms with remote control systems, energy accounting\
    \ and smart meters \ncould have tremendous effects as they would allow utilities\
    \ to track the sources of losses. Further, India \nmainly relies on coal-based\
    \ energy supply to meet increasing demand. Decentralised energy generated by \n\
    renewable energy sources could be integrated in a smart grid. Smart grids would\
    \ thus help to address two \nmajor needs of Indian energy providers: stemming\
    \ losses and reducing carbon intensity.  \nFor the quantification of the positive\
    \ impact, the study assesses four levers that have the potential to \nreduce CO2e\
    \ emissions: i) reduced transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, ii) integration\
    \ of renewable \nenergy sources, iii) reduced consumption through user information,\
    \ and iv) demand side management \n(DSM). The study identifies total emission\
    \ savings of 2.03 GtCO2e in 2020 in a “Business as Usual” \n(BAU)8 scenario. Figure\
    \ 7 shows the contribution of each lever as well as the assumptions behind the\
    \ \ncalculations. Assumptions are based on expert interviews. It should be noted\
    \ that the GeSI estimates of the \noverall CO2e emissions for the year 2020 are\
    \ based on the global CO2e emission data published by the \nIPCC (Intergovernmental\
    \ Panel on Climate Change)9 which are higher than IEA estimates, for example.\
    \  \nWhereas the GeSI Smart Grid study assesses the positive environmental impact\
    \ on a global level in \n2020, EPRI (2008) focuses on the positive environmental\
    \ impacts on a national level in the United States \nfor the year 2030. Another\
    \ difference is the extended view on levers leading to a positive impact: overall,\
    \ \nthe study evaluates seven levers: i) continuous commissioning for commercial\
    \ buildings, ii) reduced line \nlosses, iii) enhanced demand response and (peak)\
    \ load control, iv) direct feedback on energy usage, v) \nenhanced measurement\
    \ and verification capabilities, vi) facilitation of integration of renewable\
    \ resources, \nand vii) facilitation of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)\
    \ market penetration. PHEV are “hybrid \nelectric vehicles that can be plugged\
    \ into electrical outlets for recharging” (EPRI, 2008). As PHEV allow \nfor CO2\
    \ emission savings,10 the study attributes 10-20% of these savings to the smart\
    \ grid as the smart \ngrids allow charging of vehicles over night. However, R&D\
    \ on PHEV is still at an early stage. As the study \nevaluates CO2e emission savings\
    \ for a longer time horizon than the GeSI study, the inclusion of PHEV can \n\
    be regarded as useful. However, the percentage of emission savings from PHEV attributed\
    \ to smart grids \nseems potentially overstated. \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES\

    \ is between the low-end value of 60 million tons and the high-end value of \n\
    211 million tons. CO2e emission savings vary considerably. This is due to different\
    \ shares of market \npenetration. Furthermore, estimations are partially based\
    \ on simple assumptions as well as on data from \nsingle cases.  \nThe third study\
    \ discussed in this section assesses both positive and negative impacts of ICTs\
    \ on \nenvironmental sustainability (IPTS, 2004). As opposed to the above studies,\
    \ it studies one important lever: \nthe contribution of renewable energy sources\
    \ to a reduction of CO2 emissions and especially the impact of \nICTs on the share\
    \ of renewable energy sources. ICTs facilitate the integration of energy which\
    \ was \ngenerated by renewable energy sources. According to the authors, the use\
    \ of ICTs in the smart grid \nincreases the total share of renewable energy sources\
    \ in the range of 2-7% in 2020. The range is due to best \nand worst-case values\
    \ for three different scenarios as shown in Table 6. A total reduction in GHG\
    \ \nemissions (measured in CO2e) due to the use of ICTs in energy supply ranges\
    \ from 1.5% in the worst case \nand 3.1% in the best case. \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS:\

    \ the electricity mix changes which directly affects overall CO2e emissions. The\
    \ \nauthors also argue that ICTs enhance combined heat and power generation which\
    \ further leads to a \ndecreased use of fossil fuel. According to the study, the\
    \ impact of smart grid ICTs will be 1.5-3.1% of total \nCO2e reductions in 2020.\
    \ Rebound effects which arise from a higher efficiency in energy supply are \n\
    included in the IPTS study, which is not the case for the GeSI and EPRI studies.\
    \ In terms of scenario \nbuilding, validation measures and the integration of\
    \ positive and negative effects, the IPTS study is the \nmost sophisticated presented\
    \ in this section. It is also the only study which integrates rebound effects.\
    \  \nComparing actual CO2e emission values is a difficult task as the conception\
    \ of these studies differs \nsignificantly. They assess different smart grid levels\
    \ on different continents for differing time horizons. \nOverall, all studies\
    \ emphasise that fully and properly deployed smart grids could have an important\
    \ and \nstrong potential to reduce future CO2e emissions. The GeSI study, for\
    \ example, which assesses the \nenvironmental impacts of several smart (sensor)\
    \ applications, attributes the highest potential to smart grids \nto reduce CO2e\
    \ emissions.  \nHowever, it may be also necessary to investigate the potential\
    \ negative environmental impact \nassociated with the deployment of smart grids,\
    \ for example, the amounts of additional hardware needed to \nsupport and improve\
    \ the electric transmission grid. These new activities may also require new rights\
    \ of \nway and distribution systems with possible negative impacts on wildlife\
    \ and ecosystems. \nBecause of the potential positive impacts of smart grids,\
    \ many OECD countries have emphasised the \ntransformation of actual grids into\
    \ smart grids. For example, the provisions of the U.S. stimulus bill signed \n\
    in February 2009 include USD 11 billion for “smart grid” investments. Furthermore,\
    \ some OECD \ncountries (Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands) have\
    \ already issued mandates for smart \nmetering, and the EU Communication on ICTs\
    \ and the environment (13 March 2009) emphasises the role \nof smart metering.\
    \ \n24 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH\
    \  \n \n \n24 \nOne of the main questions for successful implementation of smart\
    \ grids will be whether energy \nsuppliers can agree on working together to adopt\
    \ industry-wide solutions and developing and adopting \nopen standards (Adam,\
    \ Wintersteller, 2008). \nSmart buildings \nIntroduction, definition and main\
    \ components \nSmart buildings are a field closely linked to smart grids. Smart\
    \ buildings rely on a set of technologies \nthat enhance energy-efficiency and\
    \ user comfort as well as the monitoring and safety of the buildings. \nTechnologies\
    \ include new, efficient building materials as well as information and communication\
    \ \ntechnologies (ICTs). An example of newly integrated materials is a second\
    \ façade for glass sky scrapers. \nThe headquarters of the New York Times Company\
    \ has advanced ICT applications as well as a ceramic \nsunscreen consisting of\
    \ ceramic tubes which reflect daylight and thus prevent the skyscraper from \n\
    collecting heat (see Box 1).  \n ICTs are used in: i) building management systems\
    \ which monitor heating, lighting and ventilation, ii) \nsoftware packages which\
    \ automatically switch off devices such as computers and monitors when offices\
    \ \nare empty (SMART, 2020) and iii) security and access systems. These ICT systems\
    \ can be both found at \nhousehold and office level. Furthermore, according to\
    \ Sharpels et al., (1999), first-, second- and third-\ngeneration smart building\
    \ systems can be distinguished.11 First-generation smart buildings are composed\
    \ of \nmany stand-alone self-regulating devices which operate independently from\
    \ each other. Examples include \nsecurity and HVAC systems. In second-generation\
    \ smart buildings, systems are connected via specialised \nnetworks which allow\
    \ them to be controlled remotely and “to facilitate some central scheduling or\
    \ \nsequencing” (Sharpels et al., 1999), e.g. switching off systems when rooms\
    \ and offices are not occupied. \nThird-generation smart building systems are\
    \ capable of learning from the building and adapting their \nmonitoring and controlling\
    \ functions. This last generation is at an early stage. \nSensors and sensor networks\
    \ are used in multiple smart building applications. These include:  \n \nHeating,\
    \ ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC) \n \nLightning  \n \nShading\
    \ \n \nAir quality and window control \n \nSystems switching off devices \n\
     \nMetering (covered in the section on smart grids) \n \nStandard household\
    \ applications (e.g. televisions, washing machines) \n \nSecurity and safety\
    \ (access control). \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS\
    \ FOR GREEN GROWTH – 25 \n \n25 \nCeramic rods (Source: VorapatInkarojrit)\n \n\
    \ \nBox 1: The New York Times Building - a Smart Building \nThe headquarters of\
    \ the New York Times is an example of how different smart building technologies\
    \ can be \ncombined to reduce energy consumption and to increase user comfort.\
    \ Overall, the building consumes 30% less \nenergy than traditional office skyscrapers.\
    \  \nOpened in November 2007 and designed by Renzo \nPiano, the building has a\
    \ curtain wall which serves as a \nsunscreen and changes colour during the day.\
    \ This wall \nconsists of ceramic rods, “a supporting structure for the \nscreen\
    \ and an insulated window unit” (Hart, 2008).  \nThe building is further equipped\
    \ with lighting and \nshading control systems based on ICT technologies. The \n\
    lighting system ensures that electrical light is only used when \nrequired. Further\
    \ daylighting measures include a garden in the \ncentre of the ground floor which\
    \ is open to the sky as well as a \nlarge area skylight. The electrical ballasts\
    \ in the lighting system are equipped with chips that allow each ballast to be\
    \ \ncontrolled separately. The shading system tracks the position of the sun and\
    \ relies on a sensor network to \nautomatically actuate the raising and lowering\
    \ of the shades. Experience had shown that if it were up to employees \nsitting\
    \ next to the windows to control the shades, “the shades would likely be down\
    \ most of the time since occupants” \nwere “often too busy to manage the shades”\
    \ (LBNL, 2009).  \nThe high-tech HVAC system is equipped with sensors that measure\
    \ the temperature. It is further able to rely on \nfree air cooling, i.e. fresh\
    \ air on cool mornings is brought into the HVAC system. An automated building\
    \ system \nmonitors in parallel “the air conditioning, water cooling, heating,\
    \ fire alarm, and generation systems” (Siemens, 2008). \nThe system relies on\
    \ a large-scale sensor network composed of different kinds of sensors which deliver\
    \ real-time \ninformation. Consequently, energy can be saved as only as few systems\
    \ are turned on as needed.  \nSources: Hart (2008), Siemens (2008), The New York\
    \ Times Building (2009), LBNL (2009). \nSensors embedded in HVAC systems, for\
    \ example, monitor the temperature and the status of parts of \nthe buildings\
    \ such as open or closed windows. In the field of air quality, new gas sensors,\
    \ micro electrical-\nmechanical systems (MEMS), measure the content of CO2 in\
    \ rooms. These relatively new types of sensors \nare made of “silicon chips and\
    \ an oxidizing layer” (Siemens, 2008c). Overall, different types of sensors for\
    \ \nsmart buildings include: \n \nTemperature sensors and heat detectors \n\
    \ \nLight level detectors \n \nMovement and occupancy sensors  \n \nSmoke and\

    \ air quality \nand occupancy sensors at 30% compared to buildings with traditional\
    \ automation technology. The \nfollowing section provide an overview of different\
    \ impact studies focusing on total smart building and \nfacility management systems\
    \ and their energy consumption and emissions. \nThe environmental impact of smart\
    \ buildings \nOnly a few studies on the environmental impact of smart buildings\
    \ cover more than single \napplications and more than one country. In the following\
    \ studies, GeSI (2008) focuses on positive impacts, \nwhereas the IPTS study (2004)\
    \ covers both positive and negative impacts (see Table 5). \nAccording to GeSI\
    \ estimations (2008), buildings will emit 11.7 GtCO2e worldwide in 2020 which\
    \ \nequals 22.5% of total emissions. This includes private households, public\
    \ buildings and offices. The study \nidentifies an ICT-enabled abatement potential\
    \ of 1.68 GtCO2e in a BAU scenario. This abatement potential \nresults both from\
    \ levers that can be attributed to sensors and sensor networks and further levers.\
    \ Figure 9 \nprovides an overview of impacts. Levers which include a positive\
    \ impact of sensors and sensor technology \nare highlighted in blue solid shading.\
    \ These levers account for 59.5% of total CO2e savings. Most \nimportant impact\
    \ levers include savings due to efficient building management systems and savings\
    \ \nresulting from voltage optimisation as well as HVAC systems. Other impacts\
    \ which cannot directly be \nattributed to sensors have diagonal lines.  \n \n\

    \ (2004) covers the environmental impact of smart buildings in the field of facility\
    \ \nmanagement where ICT contributes to energy savings. Facility management “targets\
    \ space heating, water \nheating, cooling, lighting, cooking and electrical appliances”\
    \ (IPTS, 2004).  \nResults of the IPTS study are illustrated in Table 9. With\
    \ the projected development of ICT, \nreductions in energy consumption range from\
    \ 3.5% in the worst case to 7.1% in the best case in 2020. \nConsequently, ICT\
    \ in facility management contributes to CO2e emissions savings ranging from 3.5%\
    \ in the \nworst case to 6.5% in the best case. Overall, an important reduction\
    \ of energy consumption as well as CO2e \nemissions is observed in all scenarios\
    \ with scenario B having the highest energy and emission savings. \n \nSMART SENSOR\

    \ the pivotal role of governments in attaining significant reductions in both\
    \ \nenergy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. They recommend different\
    \ measures to promote the \nuse of ICTs in smart buildings. These measures include\
    \ demonstration projects with best practice \nexamples, minimum standards of energy\
    \ efficiency for existing and new buildings, economic incentives, \ninvestments\
    \ in R&D as well as providing a setting where governments and other stakeholders\
    \ exchange \nresults on different energy-efficiency measures.  \nTo date, several\
    \ programmes have already been set up to promote increased energy efficiency in\
    \ \nbuildings such as CASBEE (Japan) or LEED in the United States. Furthermore,\
    \ the IEA aims at \nconstructing “the world’s leading database on efficiency codes\
    \ and standards for buildings” for comparison \npurposes (IEA G8 Gleneagles programme,\
    \ 2008). \nTransport and logistics \nIntroduction and overview of applications\
    \ \nInformation and communication technologies (ICTs) and sensor networks in particular\
    \ have the \npotential to contribute to increased efficiency in both freight and\
    \ passenger transport as well as a potential \nreduction of overall transportation.\
    \ On the one hand, increased use of ICTs can avoid freight and passenger \ntransport\
    \ through a higher degree of virtualisation, digitisation and teleworking. Digital\
    \ content is delivered \nelectronically and virtual conferences and teleworking\
    \ reduce passenger transport. On the other hand, \nincreased use of ICTs can contribute\
    \ to better management of transport routes and traffic, higher safety, \ntime\
    \ and cost savings as well as reductions of CO2 emissions.  \nSensors and sensor\
    \ networks play a vital role in the increase of transport efficiency. For example,\
    \ \nsensor technology contributes to better tracking of goods and vehicles which\
    \ might result in lower level of \ninventories and thus energy savings from less\
    \ inventory infrastructure as well as a reduced need for \n30 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS:\
    \ TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n \n30 \ntransportation\
    \ (Atkinson, Castro, 2008). Furthermore, sensors and sensor networks are pivotal\
    \ parts of \nmany intelligent transportation systems (ITS).  \nAn intelligent\
    \ transportation system (ITS) can be defined as “the application of advanced and\
    \ \nemerging technologies (computers, sensors, control, communications, and electronic\
    \ devices) in \ntransportation to save lives, time, money, energy and the environment”\
    \ (ITS Canada, 2009). The ITS can \nbe categorised into intelligent infrastructure\
    \ and intelligent vehicles (RITA, 2009). Figure 10 gives an \noverview of different\
    \ ITS applications for both intelligent infrastructure and intelligent vehicles\
    \ as well as \nsome examples for each application.  \nMany of these applications\
    \ are based on sensors and sensor networks. In the field of intelligent \ninfrastructure\
    \ sensors in pavements are used for road traffic monitoring systems to measure\
    \ the intensity \nand fluidity of traffic (vehicle count sensors) and to provide\
    \ information for traffic lights which are then \ncontrolled. These sensors are\
    \ further able to detect whether, for example, public buses are approaching so\
    \ \nthat the green phase of traffic lights can be extended, allowing buses to\
    \ keep their schedules (Veloso, \nBento, Câmara Pereira, 2009). They also transmit\
    \ information to update public transport panels. New \nsensor applications include\
    \ intermittent bus lanes (see Box 3). In addition, sensors are used for motorway\
    \ \ntolling purposes where they detect vehicle RFID tags and retrieve the required\
    \ information (Veloso, Bento, \nCâmara Pereira, 2009). Sensors also monitor the\
    \ state of physical infrastructures such as bridges by \ndetecting “vibrations\
    \ and displacements” (Veloso, Bento, Câmara Pereira, 2009). \nFigure 10: Overview\

    \ Sensors\nIntelligent Vehicles\n \nSource: OECD based on RITA, 2009 and Alberta\
    \ Transportation, 2009. \nIntelligent vehicles are equipped with sensors for multiple\
    \ purposes. Examples for different kinds of \nvehicles include: i) Trains in metros,\
    \ especially driverless systems, use sensors to control the velocity and \nlocation\
    \ of trains as well as stops at metro stations (Veloso, Bento, Câmara Pereira,\
    \ 2009). ii) Buses rely on \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS\
    \ FOR GREEN GROWTH – 31 \n \n31 \ndoor sensors to detect whether doors are open\
    \ to better locate them. Further applications include \nenvironmental sensors\
    \ on buses and tramways that detect weather conditions, analyse traffic conditions\
    \ \nand give alerts via on-board mini-computers (MORYNE FP6 Project, 2008); for\
    \ applications in cars iii), \ncurrent research projects focus on vehicle-to-vehicle\
    \ communication based on data gathered by sensors \n(see for example EU projects\
    \ such as Coopers and PReVent). These (environmental) sensors collect \ninformation,\
    \ for instance, on the location of the car, the speed and road and weather conditions.\
    \ As cars \npass each other, they are able to exchange the summarised information.\
    \ Based on a detailed description of \nthe environment, cars obtain traffic information\
    \ and drivers are able to plan their routes more efficiently. In \naddition, trajectories\
    \ of vehicles can be predicted resulting in a sophisticated risk assessment and\
    \ thus \nincreased traffic safety as drivers can be warned of dangerous driving\
    \ conditions. A further example of car \nsensors is a tyre pressure monitoring\
    \ system which delivers real time tyre pressure information to the \ndriver (Intelligent\
    \ Car Initiative, 2008). Besides improving safety, the system helps to “reduce\
    \ the amount \nof emissions released into the atmosphere” (Intelligent Car Initiative,\
    \ 2008). \n \nBox 3: Intermittent bus lanes \nTo allow a better flow and speed\
    \ of public transport, many cities rely on special lanes for buses, taxis and\
    \ \nemergency vehicles. However, this system can be further optimised as, at times,\
    \ the lane is empty and could \ninstead be used for general traffic, especially\
    \ in heavy traffic situations. The idea of the optimised solution is to \nnormally\
    \ open the bus lane for general traffic and to reserve it only when public transport\
    \ is approaching and when \nthe general traffic is slower than the normal speed\
    \ of public transport.  \nResearchers in Portugal have developed a wireless sensor\
    \ network system which has been tested in Lisbon. \nInstalled lights in the tarmac\
    \ separate the bus lane from other lanes and are only turned on when a bus is\
    \ \napproaching. The presence of public transport in the bus lane is detected\
    \ by sensors in the ground and can be \nsupported by additional information such\
    \ as data from public transport fleet management systems. This information \n\
    is processed by a control station installed near traffic lights. In recent systems,\
    \ the in-pavement components are \nwirelessly connected to each other and to the\
    \ control station to reduce installation costs. Each module is battery \npowered\
    \ and the batteries are charged by pavement-embedded solar panels (see Silva Girão\
    \ et al. (2006)). \nCommunication is assured via RF transmitters and receivers.\
    \ Overall, the results of trials in Lisbon are encouraging \nas the bus speed\
    \ could be increased and the negative impact on the general traffic flow was low.\
    \ The researchers \nhave recently also worked on upgrades of the system such as\
    \ the detection of intrusion of private transport in the \nbus lane when the lane\
    \ is reserved for public transport, and the incorporation of cameras for law enforcement.\
    \  \nSources: Viegas, Lu, 2005, Silva Girão et al., 2006. \nOverall, ITS systems\
    \ make public and private transport more efficient, and potentially cheaper which\
    \ \nmay increase transport volumes (rebound effect) and the environmental impact\
    \ might thus be negative. \nResults of studies analysing the environmental impact\
    \ of smart transportation are mixed due to this effect, \nin contrast to other\
    \ fields of application. The following paragraphs discuss different results from\
    \ the GeSI \n(2008) and IPTS study (2004) as well as their underlying assumptions.\
    \ As for smart buildings, the GeSI \nstudy (2008) concentrates on the positive\
    \ impacts whereas the IPTS study (2004) covers positive and \nnegative effects,\
    \ including rebound effects (see Table 5 for a description of the studies).12\
    \ \nThe environmental impact of smart transportation \nThe GeSI study (2008) estimates\
    \ an abatement potential of 1.52 GtCO2e worldwide in the field of \nsmart transport\
    \ (see Figure 11). As for the field of smart buildings, levers that can be attributed\
    \ to sensors \nand sensor networks and further levers constitute the overall abatement\
    \ potential. Levers that can include a \npositive impact of sensors and sensor\
    \ networks are marked in blue solid shading in Figure 11, other levers \nhave\
    \ diagonal lines. According to GeSi (2008), the most important levers include\
    \ the optimisation of \nlogistic networks and optimised collection and delivery\

    \ and flexible and, as a consequence, cheaper, “leading to a \nfull rebound effect”\
    \ (IPTS 2004). The demand for transportation increases and creates more transport\
    \ \nleading to higher consumption of energy and to growing greenhouse gas emissions.\
    \ According to the \nauthors “higher transport efficiency is the key ICT effect\
    \ increasing freight transport in 2020. This increase \nis in the range of 12%\
    \ to 28%” (IPTS, 2004) for freight transport and of 5-7% for passenger transport.\
    \ \nAlthough the increasing impact of ITS with the projected development of ICTs\
    \ is significantly higher for \nscenario B, the absolute freight transport volume\
    \ is the lowest one in this scenario as environmental costs \nare already internalised\
    \ (see the fourth IPTS interim report (Hilty et al., 2004)). \nIn the field of\
    \ passenger transport, the increased time efficiency of passenger transport implies\
    \ that a \nhigher passenger transport volume can be attained in the same time\
    \ which raises traffic performance. \nHowever, “ICT can slow the growth of private\
    \ car passenger transport, avoiding 10-19% of future car \ntraffic, despite the\
    \ fact that it stimulates the growth of total passenger transport” (IPTS, 2004)\
    \ due to better \ntime utilisation. This time utilisation effect is supposed to\
    \ increase the use of public transport in the modal \nsplit as ICTs can contribute\
    \ to a more effective use of travel time to work. The attractiveness of public\
    \ \ntransport can thus be increased and promote a shift from private cars to public\
    \ transport. However, this \neffect also “relaxes the time budget and therefore\
    \ enables more traffic” (IPTS, 2004).  \nIn the field of freight transport, the\
    \ full rebound effect which results from cheaper transport shows that \nfreight\
    \ transport is “highly sensitive to fuel prices”. Raising fuel prices and thus\
    \ internalising \nenvironmental costs could thus reduce demand significantly.\
    \  \nOverall, this overview of the GeSI and the IPTS studies shows mixed results\
    \ of the impact of \nintelligent transport systems due to rebound effects. These\
    \ effects also highlight that governments can have \na crucial role in the field\
    \ of smart transportation. As the IPTS study shows, increased efficiency of \n\
    transportation should be paralleled with demand-side management. Internalisation\
    \ of environmental effects \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS\
    \ FOR GREEN GROWTH – 35 \n \n35 \nby raising energy and fuel prices or the inclusion\
    \ of transportation in emission trading could reduce \ndemand for transport and\
    \ thus reduce CO2e emissions (IPTS, 2004). Furthermore, governments can make \n\
    use of ITS in public transport to render it more attractive and promote a modal\
    \ shift from private cars to \npublic transport. Measures not only include promoting\
    \ a better working environment during travel through \nICTs but also better services\
    \ such as real-time time-table information and optimised route planning.  \nIndustrial\
    \ applications  \nIntroduction and application examples \nThe industry sector\
    \ is an important emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. According to GeSi (2008),\
    \ it \nwas responsible for 23% of total emissions in 2002 and used nearly half\
    \ of all global electricity. Sensors \nand especially sensor networks are used\
    \ in multiple ways in industrial applications. They enable real-time \ndata sharing\
    \ on industrial processes, on the “health state” of equipment and the control\
    \ of operating \nresources to increase industrial efficiency, productivity and\
    \ reduce energy usage and emissions.  \nAs the variety of different sensor applications\
    \ is immense across industry sectors,16 this section \ndescribes three examples\
    \ of industrial fields of application of sensors for: i) process control, ii)\
    \ control of \n(physical) properties during the production process, and iii) equipment\
    \ management and control.  \nIn the field of process control, sensor and sensor\
    \ networks deliver real-time data on the production \nprocess and are able to\
    \ detect in situ variations in the process. Control can thus be moved from the\
    \ finished \nproduct after the completed production run to the production process\
    \ itself (DOE, 2007). Faults can be \nminimised reducing the percentage of deficient\
    \ and reprocessed goods. Furthermore, a continuous \nmonitoring of processes allows\
    \ for efficient use of energy during production processes. An application \nexample\
    \ in the field of process control is an on line laser-ultrasonic thickness gauge\
    \ which measures the \nthickness of steel tube walls under harsh conditions in\
    \ mills. During production, it ensures that “tube walls \nare uniform and reduces\
    \ the need to remove excess material from the walls of the tubes”. As a \nconsequence,\
    \ product consistency can be improved and material saved while “reducing the time\
    \ and \nenergy used during production” (DOE, 2004).  \nIn the field of the control\
    \ of physical properties during production processes, sensors and sensor \nnetworks\
    \ measure different properties as well as the amount of available resources during\
    \ production. This \nallows them to be employed in an efficient and thus precise\
    \ manner resulting in energy savings and the \nreduction of pollutants. Examples\
    \ are sensors measuring the temperature and composition of combustion \ngases\
    \ and sensors measuring the concentration of hydrogen gas (DOE, 2007).  \nIn the\
    \ third field, equipment management and control, sensors monitor the “health of\
    \ machines” as \nwell as their usage. Sensors installed on different machines\
    \ measure physical properties such as \ntemperature, pressure, humidity or vibrations\
    \ (Verdone, 2008). The sensor nodes are able to communicate \nbetween each other\
    \ and send data to the network where the data is processed. When critical values\
    \ are \nachieved, the system immediately sends signals making predictive maintenance\
    \ possible. This intelligent \nmaintenance monitors the functionality of parts\
    \ and ensures that they are replaced based on a degradation \nassessment rather\
    \ than on replacement rules. Besides health monitoring, sensors also control motors\
    \ during \nusage. Motors running at full capacity regardless of load can be inefficient\
    \ and waste energy (GeSi, 2008). \nSensors allow the motor to adjust the power\
    \ usage according to the required output. Wireless networks that \nlink different\
    \ sensors make machine-to-machine communication possible and have the potential\
    \ to increase \nenergy efficiency in whole factories (GeSi, 2008).  \nAs the examples\
    \ have shown, many specific and niche sensor applications are used in factories.\
    \ \nConsequently, interoperability of different systems becomes a crucial issue\
    \ to connect different sensor \n36 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS\
    \ FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n \n36 \nsystems and to maximise efficiency and energy\
    \ savings. Some standards have already been launched such \nas the interface IEEE\
    \ 1451 group of standards which aims at enabling plug-and-play of different sensors\
    \ \nand sensor networks (Chong, Kumar, 2003).  \nAn example of the environmental\
    \ impact of smart industrial applications  \nThere is so far little information\
    \ on the overall environmental impact of sensors and sensor networks \nacross\
    \ different fields of industrial applications. GeSi (2008) assessed the impact\
    \ of one major industrial \nfield of application: smart motor systems. The study\
    \ focuses on positive impacts (for a description of the \nstudy, see Table 5).\
    \ In the following, the results of this analysis are discussed to give an example\
    \ of the \nenvironmental impact of smart industrial applications.  \nAccording\
    \ to GeSi (2008) motor systems account for 65% of total energy use by industry.\
    \ Smart \nmotors which adjust power consumption to outputs can have an important\
    \ role in reducing this demand. \nThe authors of the study estimate a worldwide\
    \ abatement potential of 970 MtCO2e in a BAU scenario (see \nFigure 12). This\
    \ is, on the one hand, due to an optimisation of motors’ speed (abatement potential\
    \ of 680 \nMtCO2e) and, on the other hand, to ICT-driven automation (abatement\
    \ potential of 290 MtCO2e). \nFigure 12: Positive environmental impact of smart\

    \ technology has an important impact on energy and \ngreenhouse gas emission savings\
    \ for industrial automation and control. These savings can be especially \nhigh\
    \ when different sensors and sensor networks communicate with each other. Besides\
    \ the use of sensor \ntechnology, sound process planning, for example with process\
    \ optimisation tools, also play an important \nrole. Various initiatives have\
    \ been created such as Motor Decision Matters,17 and Work Energy Smart18 \nwhich\
    \ not only focus on technology but also on process planning and improvement. \
    \ \nPrecision agriculture and animal tracking \nSensors and sensor networks are\
    \ important components of precision agriculture which aims at \n“maximum production\
    \ efficiency with minimum environmental impact” (Taylor and Whelan, 2005). Land\
    \ \nover-exploitation, one of the major concerns of intensive agriculture, leads\
    \ to problems such as soil \ncompaction, erosion, salinity and declining water\
    \ quality (Wark et al., 2007). Sensors and sensor networks \nplay a critical role\
    \ in measuring and monitoring the health of the soil and water quality at various\
    \ stages, \nfrom pre- to post-production. In the field of animal tracking, the\
    \ movement of herds, the health of animals \nand the state of the pasture can\
    \ be controlled via sensor networks. So far a number of sensor network \nsystems\
    \ have been developed and trials and field experiments are under way. However,\
    \ concrete \napplications are at an early stage. This section briefly describes\
    \ applications of sensor networks in \nprecision agriculture and animal production.\
    \ Subsequently, environmental impacts are presented \nqualitatively rather than\
    \ quantitatively due to the early application stage. \nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ sensor networks can be used for: i) plant/crop monitoring, ii) soil monitoring,\
    \ \niii) climate monitoring and iv) insect-disease-weed monitoring.  \nIn the\
    \ field of plant/crop monitoring, wireless sensors have been developed to gather,\
    \ for example, \ndata on leaf temperature, chlorophyll content and plant water\
    \ status. Based on these data, farmers are able \nto detect problems at an early\
    \ stage and implement real-time solutions. The health and moisture of soil is\
    \ a \nbasic prerequisite for efficient plant and crop cultivation. Sensors contribute\
    \ to real-time monitoring of \nvariables such as soil fertility, soil water availability\
    \ and soil compaction. Further, sensor nodes which \ncommunicate with radio or\
    \ mobile network weather stations provide climate and micro-climate data. \nSensors\
    \ registering the temperature and relative humidity can contribute to detect conditions\
    \ under which \ndisease infestation is likely to occur (see Box 2). \n \n38 -\
    \ SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n\
    \ \n38 \n \n \nBox 2: Monitoring micro-climates in a crop field \nThe LOFAR (Low\
    \ Frequency Array) Agro Project has measured the micro-climate in a potato field\
    \ to provide \ninformation on how a fungal disease, phytophtora, can be combated.\
    \ Its development highly depends on the \nclimatological conditions within the\
    \ field.  \n150 sensor nodes have been deployed in the field for the experiment.\
    \ These nodes are equipped with sensors which \nmeasure both temperature and relative\
    \ humidity (see Figure). Additional sensors are deployed in the soil to monitor\
    \ \nsoil humidity. A weather station “registering the luminosity, air pressure,\
    \ precipitation, wind strength and direction” \n(Baggio, 2005) complements the\
    \ setting.  \n \nSensor nodes send the gathered data via a wireless connection\
    \ every 10 minutes to field gateways which send it to an \nordinary PC for data\
    \ logging (the Lofar gateway in the figure). The data is further transmitted to\
    \ other servers for data \nanalysis via a wired Internet connection. A decision\
    \ support system maps the temperature distribution together with \nother information.\
    \ Based on this information, farmers can take different actions and vary the amount\
    \ of fertilizer and \npesticide used.  \nSource: Baggio (2005). Note that most\
    \ such projects have not yet been scaled-up. \nThe health of pastures can also\
    \ be evaluated through high-resolution remote sensing tools. Healthy \npastures\
    \ usually “have a consistent cover of evenly dispersed perennial vegetation” (Ludwig\
    \ et al., 2008). \nRemotely sensed satellite maps depict the location of persistent\
    \ vegetation cover. Based on this \ninformation and information on the three dimensional\
    \ shape of the landscape, Australian scientists \ncalculate leakiness values and\
    \ their changes over time. As a result, conditions of pastures can be measured\
    \ \nand problematic areas detected (Ludwig et al., 2008). \nWireless sensors are\
    \ further used for precision irrigation, and systems developed for remotely \n\
    controlled, automatic irrigation. Sensors assume, for example, the tasks of irrigation\
    \ control and irrigation \nscheduling using sensed data together with additional\
    \ information, e.g. weather data (Evans and Bergman, \n2003). Finally, sensors\
    \ are used to assist in precision fertilisation. Based on sensor data, decision\
    \ support \nsystems calculate the “optimal quantity and spread pattern for a fertilizer”\
    \ (Wang et al., 2006).  \nWireless sensor networks also contribute to a better\
    \ understanding of the behaviour of cattle, such as \ntheir grazing habits, herd\
    \ behaviour and the interaction with the surrounding environment (Wark et al.,\
    \ \n2007). The information provided by these sensors helps famers to understand\
    \ the state of the pasture and to \nfind optimal ways to use these resources.\
    \ To test sensor applications for cattle management, Wark et al,. \n(2007) attached\
    \ sensor nodes to cattle collars. Sensors communicated in a peer-to-peer fashion.\
    \ Cattle \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH\
    \ – 39 \n \n39 \ncollars pinged each other “with each ping containing an animal’s\
    \ GPS position and time of each ping \ntransmission” (Wark et al., 2007). Based\
    \ on the positioning data of each node and inertial information, the \ncattle’s\
    \ individual and herd behaviour could be modelled and more general models could\
    \ be developed. As \na result, farmers are able to optimally manage environmental\
    \ resources and plan grazing areas to prevent \nenvironmental problems such as\
    \ overgrazing and land erosion. Current work focuses on the integration of \n\
    sensor networks and radio frequency technology (RFID) as a significant number\
    \ of cattle are equipped \nwith RFID tags to record their ID as well as information\
    \ such as cattle characteristics and food \ninformation.  \nThe environmental\
    \ impact of precision agriculture and animal tracking \nThrough the monitoring\
    \ of the soil, climate and plants, a precise irrigation rate can be determined\
    \ \nwhich may lead to a reduced consumption of water. Usually, fields are irrigated\
    \ with uniform amounts of \nwater. However, the variability in a field requires\
    \ different amounts for different areas due to the \ncombination of different\
    \ crops and soil types (USDA, 2007). Various projects have been conducted to \n\
    measure the extent of water savings. Damas et al., (2001), for example, tested\
    \ an automated irrigation \nsystem for a 1500 ha area in Spain, with water savings\
    \ of 30-60%. According to the USDA, another study \nfound water savings of 5.7\
    \ million gallons on 279 acres in 2002 (USDA, 2007). One study by King et al.\
    \ \n(2006) showed no significant water savings for a variable rate irrigation\
    \ system. However, the spatial \nvariability in available water holding capacity\
    \ (AWHC) of the soil was considered the main determinant \ninfluencing crop yield\
    \ and the basis for a site-specific irrigation management (SSIM) system. The authors\
    \ \nacknowledge that the “results from this study and others collectively suggest\
    \ that AWHC may not be the \nbest or only parameter to consider in delineating\
    \ irrigation management zones. A systems approach to \nSSIM will likely be required\
    \ that takes into account all known factors affecting yield [...]” (King et al.,\
    \ \n2006). Overall, the majority of studies showed a reduced consumption of water,\
    \ but that deployment \nshould be based on a thorough analysis of the area being\
    \ irrigated and a comprehensive consideration of \ndifferent factors which affect\
    \ site-specific irrigation. Sensors and sensor networks can significantly \ncontribute\
    \ to this analysis by providing the required data.  \nFurther important benefits\
    \ of precision agriculture are reductions of fertilisers and pesticides. Both\
    \ \nfertiliser and pesticide applications affect surface and groundwater quality,\
    \ the quality of crops, soil \nproperties and non-target species. Through monitoring\
    \ the soil, the micro-climate and crops, it is possible \nto apply only the fertilisers\
    \ and the pesticides crops need. Rates can be varied in real-time within fields\
    \ \nbased on different field and plant properties. Additionally, applications\
    \ can be more precisely controlled in \nenvironmentally sensitive areas (USDA,\
    \ 2007). Finally, a more targeted application of pesticides can \nreduce problems\
    \ of pesticides resistances.  \nIn the field of animal tracking, farmers are able\
    \ to manage grazing areas based on information on herd \nbehaviour. As a consequence,\
    \ overgrazing of pastures as well as land erosion can be avoided. Limited \npasture\
    \ resources can thus be effectively managed. \nOverall, sensors and sensor networks\
    \ significantly contribute to a more sustainable use of natural \nresources. However,\
    \ development of sensors and sensor networks for precision agriculture is in an\
    \ early \nstage and sensor applications tend to be expensive. To date, farmers\
    \ only take economic benefits into \nconsideration when deciding on whether they\
    \ should rely on precision agriculture (USDA, 2007). \nGovernments can help farmers\
    \ to recognise the environmental dimension by pointing out the economic \nbenefits\
    \ of improved soil and pasture quality as well as reduced applications of fertilisers\
    \ and pesticides. \nFurther, precision agriculture can be encouraged through technical\
    \ assistance and conservation \nprogrammes. \n40 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES\
    \ AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n \n40 \nConclusion  \nThis report gives\
    \ an overview of sensor and sensor networks applications and their impact on the\
    \ \nenvironment. It discusses selected fields of application which have a high\
    \ potential to tackle environmental \nchallenges and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\
    \  \nA review of different studies assessing the environmental impact of ICTs\
    \ and especially sensor and \nsensor networks reveals that these technologies\
    \ can contribute significantly to more efficient use of \nresources and an important\
    \ reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Government policies and initiatives are\
    \ \ncrucial in fostering the positive environmental effects of the use of sensors\
    \ and sensor networks in different \nfields and are an essential part of strategies\
    \ to radically improve environmental performance (see also \nDSTI/ICCP/IE(2008)3/FINAL).\
    \ However, rebound effects have to be taken into account, and increased \nefficiency\
    \ due to the use of sensor technology should be paralleled with demand-side management\
    \ which \ninternalises environmental costs, for example by raising CO2 –intensive\
    \ energy and fuel prices. In the field \nof smart buildings, minimum standards\
    \ of energy efficiency can be a major factor in reducing electricity \nuse and\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions.  \nIn general many applications in promising fields\
    \ are still at an early stage of development. Joint R&D \nprogrammes and implementation\
    \ projects can promote the use of sensor technology and contribute to \nindustry-wide\
    \ solutions and the development of open standards. Finally, the use of ICTs and\
    \ especially \nsensor technology is sometimes relatively expensive, for example\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sector in \nterms of farmers’ economic considerations.\
    \ Governments can encourage the use of ICTs and sensor \ntechnology through conservation\
    \ programmes and by accentuating the environmental dimension of ICTs in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming. \n \nSMART SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN\
    \ GROWTH – 41 \n \n41 \n \nNOTES\n \n1  \nWireless networks have several advantages\
    \ over wired networks: for instance, installation and maintenance \ncosts tend\
    \ to be lower, replacement and upgrading is easier for wireless networks, the\
    \ flexibility of wireless \nsystems is higher and (more recently developed) wireless\
    \ networks have the capability to simply organise \nand configure themselves into\
    \ effective communication networks (see also DOE, 2002). \n2  \nNote that customer\
    \ power inputs into the power system require a separate inverter module and input\
    \ meter. \n3  \nCosts are dependent on the technical infrastructure: e.g. the\
    \ signal must bypass the final transformer from \nthe utility to costumers’ site.\
    \ In the United States, bypassing the final transformer is, for example, much\
    \ \nmore expensive than in Europe as only a small number of customers are connected\
    \ to one final transformer \n(EPRI, 2006).  \n4  \nCosts are dependent on the\
    \ technical infrastructure: e.g. the signal must bypass the final transformer\
    \ from \nthe utility to costumers’ site. In the United States, bypassing the final\
    \ transformer is, for example, much \nmore expensive than in Europe as only a\
    \ small number of customers are connected to one final transformer \n(EPRI, 2006).\
    \ \n5  \nWiMAX can be both grouped to LAN and WAN technologies. It is further\
    \ discussed in the paragraphs on \nwide area networks. \n6  \nSee also DSTI/ICCP/CISP(2009)2/FINAL\
    \ for broadband investments in smart grids.  \n7  \nA measure often used in quantifying\
    \ emissions is the measure carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) \nemissions. Different\
    \ emissions vary in their warming influence, the radiative forcing, on the climate.\
    \ The \ncommon metric which is used in many studies is the radiative forcing of\
    \ CO2. “The equivalent CO2 \nemission is obtained by multiplying the emission\
    \ of a GHG by its Global Warming Potential (GWP) for the \ngiven time horizon.”\
    \ (IPCC) \n8  \nBusiness as usual (BAU) scenario: a baseline scenario that examines\
    \ the “consequences of continuing \ncurrent trends in population, economy, technology\
    \ and human behaviour” (European Environment Agency, \n2009). \n9  \nIPCC(2007)\
    \ \n10  \nThe extent of the savings depends on the carbon-intensity of overall\
    \ generated electricity. \n11  \nThe authors use the term “intelligent buildings”.\
    \ For this report, smart buildings and intelligent buildings \nare treated as\
    \ synonyms. \n12  \nThe section on the impact of smart logistics does not cover\
    \ the impacts of dematerialisation and \nvirtualisation as sensor and sensor networks\
    \ play a minor role in these fields. \n13  \nThe IPTS study also analyses the\
    \ impact of teleshopping, telework, virtual meeting and virtual goods on \npassenger\
    \ and freight transport. This is not discussed in this study as sensor and sensor\
    \ networks have a \nminor impact in these fields.  \n42 - SMART SENSOR NETWORKS:\

    \ transport volume is measured in tons x kilometres.  \n15  \nThe passenger transport\

    \ FOR GREEN GROWTH – 47 \n \n47 \nANNEX A1. \nOTHER FIELDS OF SENSOR AND SENSOR\
    \ NETWORK APPLICATIONS \nEnvironmental monitoring \n \nAs multiple different applications\
    \ exist, the following section will present some examples of \nenvironmental monitoring\
    \ in the following areas: water pollution, air pollution, analysis of global \n\
    warming, as well as facilitated recycling (Atkinson, Castro, 2008).  \nSensor\
    \ networks are deployed in waters to monitor the level of pollution as well as\
    \ the state of marine \nlife. Along the entire Hudson River in New York, scientists\
    \ are installing sensors nodes which will \npartially be suspended from buoys.\
    \ Data is transmitted wirelessly and provides information about current \npollution\
    \ levels.  \nFor air pollution monitoring, sensor networks are deployed within\
    \ cities in order to detect specific \ntimes and locations when pollution peaks.\
    \ Engineers from Harvard University deployed 100 general \npurpose nodes onto\
    \ streetlights to cover the city of Cambridge, L. A. aiming at measuring the amount\
    \ of \nparticles in the air and collecting weather data. The sensors are directly\
    \ powered by the city streetlights and \ncommunicate via Wi-Fi radios (Greene,\
    \ 2007). \nThe analysis and assessment of global warming requires sophisticated\
    \ IT technology to understand to \nwhich extent and why the climate has changed.\
    \ Some applications involve sensor networks. For instance, a \nplane which is\
    \ deployed in the arctic by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\
    \ researchers \nis equipped with 30 airborne sensors and collects “data that can\
    \ be used to produce a detailed simulation of \nthe chain of chemical reactions\
    \ that arctic pollution cause and that increase ice melting” (Atkinson, Castro,\
    \ \n2008). Furthermore, a worldwide sensor network, the Global Earth Observation\
    \ System of Systems \n(GEOSS) is currently being developed with the aim to collect\
    \ data relating to climate change and more \ngenerally air pollution. Currently,\
    \ 76 countries and the European Union participate in the project (GEO, \n2008).\
    \ \nThe final application presented here in the section of environmental monitoring\
    \ is dealing with the \ncollection and recycling of waste. Automatic sorting machines\
    \ are not only equipped with magnets to sort \nout metal objects but also with\
    \ optical sensors. These sensors identify different kinds of plastics and paper\
    \ \nallowing them to be put in different bins. Furthermore, RFID tags with integrated\
    \ sensors on private \nhouseholds’ bins measure the weight of the waste. Costs\
    \ are then allocated according to the weight of the \nwaste during the year. \
    \ \nUrban terrain tracking and civil structure monitoring \n \nThis field of application\
    \ covers the structural health monitoring of large civil or urban structures.\
    \ One \nprominent example is the Ben Franklin Bridge. A network of ten sensors\
    \ monitors the strain of the bridge \nstructure when trains are crossing the bridge.\
    \ Two different operation modes reduce the required power: a \nlow-power sampling\
    \ mode checks if any trains are passing. If this is the case, the strain increases\
    \ and leads \nthe system to switch to a second mode in which samples are collected\
    \ at a higher pace to monitor precisely \nchanges in the strain.  \n48 - SMART\
    \ SENSOR NETWORKS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS FOR GREEN GROWTH  \n \n \n48\
    \ \nEntertainment \n \nMultiple different and heterogeneous applications are conceivable\
    \ in the entertainment area. \nAccording to Verdone et al. (2008), there are application\
    \ scenarios in which live TV shows react to user \n(emotional) feedback. This\
    \ enables viewers to get more involved in the shows and the provider to adapt\
    \ the \nshows more to the viewers’ needs. Further examples include applications\
    \ in the games area: Via sensor \nnetworks, game players are able to project their\
    \ moods and gestures in the virtual world (Verdone et al. \n2008). \nSecurity\
    \ and surveillance \n \nSecurity and surveillance sensor networks are used in\
    \ the military and defence area, for example for \nthe surveillance of borders.\
    \ In this case, different kinds of sensors are used, ranging from sensors \nmonitoring\
    \ temperature to sensors monitoring light to acoustic sensors. Further, they are\
    \ also employed for \ncivil structure, for instance for fire detection systems\
    \ in buildings. \nHealth care \n \nSensor networks can be and are currently used\
    \ in multiple ways in the healthcare sector. Applications \ncover telemonitoring\
    \ of patients’ state of health, tracking and monitoring the movements of patients\
    \ and \ndoctors, drug administration and diagnostic applications (Heppner, 2007,\
    \ Verdone, 2008). In the field of \npatients’ state of health, sensor networks\
    \ are particularly useful for patients under medical observation. \nSensors communicate\
    \ gathered data to a telecommunication device such as a mobile phone, which further\
    \ \ntransmits the data to nurses’ or doctors’ rooms in case of dangerous changes\
    \ of the state of health. It is also \npossible to carry out medication control\
    \ via these sensors (Heppner, 2007). Sensor networks and location-\nbased services\
    \ allow doctors to be quickly tracked in hospitals in case of emergency. The same\
    \ principle is \napplicable to their patients. Furthermore, wireless sensors are\
    \ developed for implants such as glaucoma \nsensors or intra-cranial pressure\
    \ sensor systems (Healthy Aims, 2008). \n"

    \ Introduction\nRegional water use patterns result from the combination of individual\
    \ water user\nbehaviors. Knowledge of water use behavior at the household level\
    \ is required to un-\nderstand and manage these regional patterns through a combination\
    \ of supply-side and\ndemand management strategies. Availability of widespread\
    \ high temporal resolution water\nuse data can help achieve urban water management\
    \ sustainability goals and expand our\nknowledge about residential water use [1,2].\
    \ High temporal resolution data (i.e., obser-\nvations recorded with a time interval\
    \ <1 min) enables detection, characterization, and\nclassiﬁcation of water end\
    \ uses. An end-use event represents a water using occurrence\n(e.g., a toilet\
    \ ﬂush). Most residential water meters in operation today are not capable of\n\
    collecting this type of data. Additional dataloggers are commonly used to collect\
    \ high\ntemporal resolution data on top of magnetically driven meters [3–5]. These\
    \ dataloggers\ncount magnetic pulses (rotations of a magnet within the meter’s\
    \ measuring element), with\neach pulse representing a ﬁxed volume of water passing\
    \ through the meter. High resolution\ndata are typically recorded by aggregating\
    \ the number of pulses that occur within each\ntime step of a selected temporal\
    \ resolution. The pulse data are then processed and analyzed\nto generate end-use\
    \ information.\nWater use events are usually identiﬁed in recorded data as periods\
    \ of non-zero ﬂow,\nand several event features are calculated for use in classifying\
    \ events into a corresponding\nend-use category (e.g., a toilet, shower, faucet).\
    \ Average, mode, and maximum ﬂow rate;\nduration; time of occurrence; volume;\
    \ and the number of vertices within the shape of an\nevent’s trace (vertices are\
    \ deﬁned at the change points where ﬂowrate transitions from one\nWater 2022,\

    Water 2022, 14, 2457\n2 of 18\nﬂowrate to another) are the most commonly used\
    \ features for event classiﬁcation [6–9].\nMost of these features are inﬂuenced\
    \ by the temporal resolution at which data are recorded\nand by the volumetric\
    \ pulse resolution of the meter (i.e., the volume of water that each\npulse represents).\
    \ The volumetric resolution of the pulses is constant across meters of the\nsame\
    \ size and brand, while its magnitude can vary signiﬁcantly across different meter\
    \ sizes\nand brands [3]. For example, the volumetric pulse resolution of a 5/8-inch\
    \ (in) Neptune\nT-10 m is approximately 0.03 liters (L) [3], whereas the pulse\
    \ resolution for a 1 in Master\nMeter Bottom Load meter is approximately 0.16\
    \ L [3]. Datalogger devices used for high\ntemporal resolution water use data\
    \ collection have no control over this parameter (except\nfor counting multiple\
    \ rotations as a single pulse), which leads to inconsistency in collected\ndata,\
    \ even when a consistent temporal resolution is used.\nConsistency in the temporal\
    \ resolution of data collection for residential end-use stud-\nies has not been\
    \ the case, with different studies having collected data at different temporal\n\
    resolutions (aggregating all water use within a ﬁxed time interval): 10 s temporal\
    \ resolu-\ntion [10–13], 5 s [14,15], and more recently at 4 s [3,5,16,17]. Cominola\
    \ et al. [2] assessed\nthe impact of temporal resolution on end-use disaggregation\
    \ and classiﬁcation accuracy\nusing a stochastic model and found that accuracy\
    \ increases for data at higher temporal\nresolutions. However, the highest temporal\
    \ resolution simulated was 10 s [2] as the model\nrelied on a dataset collected\
    \ at this resolution [10]. Despite the number of end-use studies\nreported in\
    \ the literature, no recommended temporal resolution has emerged as a standard.\n\
    Accurately identifying simultaneous events (i.e., two different water use events\
    \ occur-\nring at the same time) and differentiating events that occur at similar\
    \ ﬂow rates are highly\ndependent on the temporal resolution of the data. Data\
    \ temporal resolution also affects\nthe accuracy of calculated event features.\
    \ For example, the estimated duration of an event\ndepends on data temporal resolution\
    \ because the start and end of an event can occur at any\nmoment within a data\
    \ recording interval, leading to uncertainty at the beginning and end\nof an event,\
    \ especially with longer recording intervals. The duration of an event, usually\n\
    calculated as the number of recorded time intervals for which there is non-zero\
    \ ﬂow, has an\nimpact on the average ﬂow rate, which is often calculated by dividing\
    \ an event’s volume by\nits duration. The accuracy with which event features can\
    \ be estimated, in turn, impacts the\nmethods that can be used for event classiﬁcation\
    \ and the accuracy of classiﬁcation results.\nWater use events can be mechanical\
    \ (those where the resident has no direct control\nover the ﬂow rate, the duration,\
    \ or both (i.e., toilets, clothes washer, dish washer, automated\nirrigation events)\
    \ or user-regulated (where the resident has control over the ﬂow rate and\nor\
    \ duration—i.e., showers, faucet, bathtub, manual hose irrigation). Mechanical\
    \ events\nare typically classiﬁed using their features, including duration, volume,\
    \ ﬂow rate, or cycle\ninformation [7–9]. However, different approaches have been\
    \ used to classify user regulated\nevents. For example, after identifying and\
    \ classifying mechanical events at a residence,\nNguyen et al. [9] used a rules-based\
    \ procedure to label all user regulated events with a\nvolume less than 15 L as\
    \ faucet events. They then identiﬁed events using more than 15 L\nas either shower\
    \ or irrigation events. In contrast, Attallah et al. [7] classiﬁed all types\n\
    of events using a procedure that relies on training a classiﬁcation model based\
    \ on the\nfeatures of a set of events manually labeled by a water user, indicating\
    \ that it is possible\nto classify all types of events based on their features.\
    \ However, the ability to accurately\ndiscriminate between events of different\
    \ types based on their features clearly requires\naccurate estimates of event\
    \ feature values. Furthermore, the temporal resolution of recorded\ndata and subsequent\
    \ processing of time aggregated data using ﬁltering techniques can\nremove distinct\
    \ event features (resulting from ﬂow rate ﬂuctuations) that could otherwise\n\
    facilitate the classiﬁcation process.\nThere are currently no general methods\
    \ for ﬁltering raw pulse data, disaggregating\noverlapping events, and classifying\
    \ events that have been tested and proven to work\nacross the different temporal\
    \ resolutions that have been used for data collection in past\nresidential end-use\
    \ studies. While a generalized approach would be incredibly useful, it\nremains\
    \ impractical given the data collection capabilities of current smart water meters\n\
    Water 2022, 14, 2457\n3 of 18\nand dataloggers (i.e., in many cases, data collection\
    \ is constrained by available metering\nand/or data logging technology). Furthermore,\
    \ a comprehensive characterization of how\nthe temporal resolution at which data\
    \ are recorded affects the values of event features, and\nhence our ability to\
    \ classify them has not been possible until now given the lack of data at a\n\
    sufﬁcient temporal resolution to enable this analysis.\nIn this study, we sought\
    \ to evaluate how the temporal resolution of residential water\nuse data affects\
    \ our ability to identify end-use events, calculate features of individual\nevents,\
    \ and classify events by end use. While we tested some of the same data aggregation\n\
    intervals tested by Cominola et al. [2], we also explored multiple data recording\
    \ intervals\nwith temporal resolutions higher than the ﬁnest resolution they used\
    \ (10 s) to explore data\nresolutions used in more recent end-use studies [14,17].\
    \ We employed a datalogger device\ndesigned speciﬁcally to collect water use data\
    \ on a residential water meter by recording\nall magnetic pulses generated by\
    \ the meter as they happen, producing what we term\n“full pulse resolution data”.\
    \ These data record water use at the highest possible temporal\nresolution (i.e.,\
    \ the full pulse resolution of the meter) and represent data not previously\n\
    collected or analyzed. We then used these data to address the following research\
    \ questions:\n(a) How does the temporal aggregation interval of recorded data\
    \ affect the ability to identify,\nclassify, and calculate attributes of individual\
    \ events and the data volumes generated?, and\n(b) What unique features can be\
    \ extracted for events derived from full pulse resolution data\nthat can be used\
    \ to identify and classify end-use events, including cases when simultaneous\n\
    events occur? We analyzed full pulse resolution data using an innovative data\
    \ collection\nmethod and then aggregated the data to simulate different temporal\
    \ resolutions to generate\ninsights into event features that answer these questions.\
    \ This paper shows that collecting\nfull pulse resolution data has several advantages\
    \ versus temporally aggregated data, a key\ncontribution to the ﬁeld of water\
    \ demand management and water end-use studies.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1.\
    \ Study Sites\nFull pulse resolution water use data were collected at two homes\

    \ Data Collection\nFull pulse resolution water use data were collected using the\
    \ Pulse-Datalogger [18],\nwhich is a device designed speciﬁcally for this application.\
    \ The Pulse-Datalogger builds\non hardware previously developed by the authors\
    \ [3,5] and measures the magnetic ﬁeld\noutside of a magnetically driven water\
    \ meter’s register, similar to devices used in past\nstudies. In addition to a\

    \ (ATMEGA328P chip), a Micro SD card, and a real-time clock\n(RTC). Figure 1 shows\
    \ the Pulse-Datalogger deployed and the datalogging board. Most\nWater 2022, 14,\

    events were generated in two ways. First, occupants of the two homes were asked\
    \ to\nlabel a subset of individual water use events by recording the event type\
    \ and start time\nWater 2022, 14, 2457\n6 of 18\nusing a cellphone application.\
    \ Table 2 shows the total number and type of user labelled\nevents. Second, we\
    \ conducted a controlled experiment at Site 1. In this experiment, a set of\n\
    individual faucet, toilet, shower, and bathtub events were recorded without any\
    \ other end\nuse occurring simultaneously. Each individual event type was repeated\
    \ sequentially at least\nten times for each ﬁxture in the home, waiting at least\
    \ 30 s between event repetitions and\ntwo minutes when switching ﬁxtures. Showers,\
    \ bathtubs, and faucets were kept running\nfor at least 30 s, and toilets were\
    \ ﬂushed normally. Repetitions were performed to provide\ninformation about the\
    \ variability in event feature values. To ensure the quality of the full\npulse\
    \ resolution data collected during the controlled experiment, we manually read\
    \ the\nwater meter’s register at Site 1 at the beginning and end of the experiment,\
    \ calculated the\nvolume of water used, and compared it with the volume read by\

    \ of the temporal resolution on event features and our ability to\nidentify end\
    \ uses of water, we aggregated the full pulse resolution data collected into the\n\
    following temporal resolutions (selected from past studies): 1 s, 4 s, 5 s, 10\
    \ s, 15 s, 30 s, and\n1 min. Data for all temporal aggregations evaluated have\
    \ a start date/time of midnight on\nthe ﬁrst day of data available for each site,\
    \ and subsequent timestamps were generated by\nadding the temporal resolution\
    \ to this date and time. Given that water use events begin and\nend at random\
    \ times, the exact date/time at which temporal aggregation intervals begin\nmay\
    \ affect the features calculated for some individual events. However, for consistency\
    \ of\nour analyses, we began all time aggregated data at midnight.\nTable 3 lists\
    \ the features and data temporal resolutions used in several past studies\nthat\
    \ developed methods for end-use disaggregation and classiﬁcation based on single\
    \ point\nwater use measurements. Some features (number of vertices, mode ﬂow rate,\
    \ shape) are\ncommonly computed after ﬁltering the data to remove oscillations\
    \ from the ﬂow trace data.\nThe ﬁltering technique may vary depending on the temporal\
    \ resolution of the data and\nthe event features to be calculated. The main function\
    \ of these features is the identiﬁcation\nof single and overlapping events, disaggregation\
    \ of overlapping events into single events,\nand classiﬁcation of single events\
    \ into end-use categories.\nTable 3. Temporal resolution, event features, and\

    \ of data temporal resolution on the number of events detected\nfor each site\
    \ and the main features obtained for the same events across the selected temporal\n\
    resolutions. Additionally, we inspected user-labeled events to illustrate how\
    \ the temporal\nresolution impacts event features beyond those tabulated and to\
    \ investigate additional\nevent features that can only be extracted from full\
    \ pulse resolution data. We observed the\nimpact of the temporal resolution on\
    \ parameters included in Table 3 that can be computed\nwithout ﬁltering data or\
    \ disaggregating overlapping events.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Separation\
    \ of Events\nAnalyses of the controlled experiment pulse data indicated there\
    \ are delayed or trailing\npulses happening at the end of each event that need\
    \ to be counted as part of the event\n(Figure 3). After examining 132 events from\
    \ the controlled experiment, we observed\nthat only in three cases did these pulses\
    \ happen more than 9 s after the previous pulse.\nTherefore, we adopted 9 s as\
    \ the threshold to separate events in the pulse data (i.e., if a\npulse happens\
    \ more than 9 s after the previous pulse, a new event is initiated). For time\n\
    aggregated data derived from the pulse data with temporal resolutions that were\
    \ larger\nthan 9 s, an event was ended when a value of 0 pulses was recorded.\
    \ For 1 s, 4 s, and 5 s time\naggregated data, we used 9, 8, and 10 s as the threshold\
    \ to separate events, respectively. In\npast studies [3,5,16,17], event deﬁnition\
    \ did not include these trailing pulses as events were\nterminated at the ﬁrst\
    \ time-step for which there were no recorded pulses. For example, we\nlabeled\
    \ single-pulse events as unclassiﬁed in our past studies and identiﬁed a large\
    \ number\nof them (79% of all indoor events [17]) across all participant sites.\
    \ It is unclear whether\nsuch events have been labeled as leaks by other authors;\
    \ however, the pulse data shows\nthat trailing pulses are part of the preceding\
    \ event and have been misrepresented in the\npast. Single pulse events can also\
    \ result from brief end uses or leaks.\nWater 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n8\

    \ showed that if we separate events from 4 s data when a value of\n0 pulses is\
    \ observed as we did in our past studies [3,7,16,17], the total number of events\n\
    recorded for Site 1 and 2 is 1928 and 3377, and the number of single-pulse events\
    \ increases\nto 489 and 1266, respectively (as compared to the numbers in Table\
    \ 4). A similar result is\nobserved by conducting the same analysis on 5 s data,\
    \ also used in past studies [14]. When\ncollecting 10 s data and separating events\
    \ [10,11], the aggregation interval is long enough\nthat trailing pulses are included\
    \ within the last time interval of the event. However, with\n10 s data, we observed\
    \ only approximately 90% and 77% of the events detected with the\npulse data,\
    \ at Sites 1 and 2 respectively, which will also affect frequency estimates and\n\
    calculation of event features. Collecting data at coarser temporal resolutions\
    \ (30 s or 1 min)\nfurther reduces ability to detect individual events. At these\
    \ coarser temporal resolutions,\nwe observed more consecutive events being aggregated\
    \ into single events as water use\nnever returns to zero (the criteria used to\
    \ separate events).\n3.2. Analysis of Event Features\nFigure 4 shows the percent\
    \ change in the duration of events and the average ﬂow\nrate for each event derived\
    \ from pulse data versus the four smallest temporal resolutions\nanalyzed (1,\
    \ 4, 5, and 10 s). Data at temporal resolutions larger than 10 s were not further\n\
    analyzed as the number of events detected already indicates these data are not\
    \ suitable for\nend-use analyses without more advanced event separation and identiﬁcation\
    \ techniques.\nSingle-pulse events were not included in these analyses. Events\
    \ were matched based on\ntheir start date and time (pairing an event identiﬁed\
    \ from time aggregated data with the\nclosest event from the pulse data). Events\
    \ with start time differences larger than 1.5 times\nthe temporal resolution of\
    \ the data were removed from the analysis. By doing this, we\nensure we are comparing\
    \ the same event across all temporal resolutions and removing the\neffect of aggregated\
    \ consecutive events. Comparing an aggregated event with multiple\nsingle components\
    \ would result in larger differences than those observed in Figure 4. The\nvolume\
    \ of the events analyzed will not change in most cases as our constraints are\
    \ aimed\nat identifying the same event across all temporal resolutions, and the\
    \ number of pulses\nfor each event does not change, regardless of the temporal\
    \ resolution at which pulses\nare recorded.\nWater 2022, 14, 2457\n9 of 18\n \n\
    this, we ensure we are comparing the same event across all temporal resolutions\
    \ and re\nmoving the effect of aggregated consecutive events. Comparing an aggregated\
    \ event with \nmultiple single components would result in larger differences than\
    \ those observed in Fig-\nure 4. The volume of the events analyzed will not change\
    \ in most cases as our constraints \nare aimed at identifying the same event across\
    \ all temporal resolutions, and the number \nof pulses for each event does not\
    \ change, regardless of the temporal resolution at which \npulses are recorded.\
    \ \n \nFigure 4. Percent change in the duration of events (top row) and average\
    \ flow rate (bottom row) \nfor all events at different temporal resolutions compared\
    \ with events identified from pulse data. \nFigure 4. Percent change in the duration\
    \ of events (top row) and average ﬂow rate (bottom row) for\nall events at different\
    \ temporal resolutions compared with events identiﬁed from pulse data.\nThe calculated\
    \ duration of events increases as the temporal resolution decreases. The\nmedian\
    \ percent change in duration when collecting 10 s data is larger than 30%, while\n\
    the same value for events identiﬁed from 1 s resolution data is approximately\
    \ 3% for\nboth sites analyzed. The average ﬂow rate of events decreases as the\
    \ temporal resolution\ndecreases. This has important implications when assessing\
    \ the performance of individual\nﬁxtures using the average ﬂow rate (as is commonly\
    \ done for faucets or showerheads).\nDurations calculated from lower resolution\
    \ data will be biased high and will not accurately\nreﬂect behavior. Flow rates\
    \ will be biased low and will not be representative of the true\nperformance of\
    \ ﬁxtures.\nFurthermore, there are differences in the number of data points collected\
    \ for each\nevent (e.g., an event that lasts 11 s will have 11 data points at\
    \ 1 s resolution and 2 data\npoints at 10 s resolution). This disparity will impact\
    \ estimates of event features such as\nthe mode ﬂow rate, median ﬂow rate, number\
    \ of vertices in the shape of the event, and\nany other features depending on\
    \ frequency or shape of an event. A smaller number of\ndata points will produce\
    \ less information that can be used to identify single or overlapping\nevents,\
    \ split overlapping events into single components, and calculate unique features\
    \ that\ncan be extracted for classiﬁcation purposes. The number of data values\
    \ recorded for each\nevent is also inﬂuenced by the volumetric pulse resolution\
    \ of the meter. A larger value for\nvolumetric resolution (L/pulse) will result\
    \ in fewer pulses.\nWater 2022, 14, 2457\n10 of 18\nFigure 5 presents the distributions\
    \ of average ﬂow rate values calculated from the\ncontrolled experiment events.\
    \ Our prior analyses of water use event data indicate that the\nmost distinctive\
    \ features used for event classiﬁcation are duration and average ﬂow rate.\nMode\
    \ and maximum ﬂow rate are highly correlated (between 0.9 and 1) with the average\n\
    ﬂow rate. Event volume, which is a multiple of duration and average ﬂow rate,\
    \ is highly\ncorrelated with duration. Figure 5 indicates that, at Site 1, it\
    \ is possible to differentiate end\nuses based on the average ﬂow rate of events\
    \ alone at most temporal resolutions given that\nthe distributions of average\
    \ ﬂow rate values for different event types largely do not overlap\n(distributions\
    \ of average event ﬂow rates do overlap for 10 s data). Additionally, mechanical\n\
    events of the same type (e.g., toilets, clothes washer, dish washer) will have\
    \ similar duration.\nFor showers and faucets, duration will exhibit larger variability.\
    \ The median average ﬂow\nrate for the upstairs bathroom shower at Site 1 estimated\
    \ from pulse data is 8.38 LPM\nversus 6.62 LPM when estimated from 10 s data.\

    Section 3.3 demonstrates how pulse data can facilitate individual event classiﬁcation.\n\
    However, overlapping events typically require additional processing as the ﬂow\
    \ trace must\nbe disaggregated into single components that can later be classiﬁed.\
    \ The frequency with\nwhich overlapping events occur is determined by the number\
    \ of occupants of a site, their\nschedule, and water use preferences. In our analysis\
    \ of 4 s data collected at 31 residential\nproperties [21], we found that approximately\
    \ 10% of all the events identiﬁed were overlap-\nping events, and they represented\
    \ approximately 40% of the volume recorded. However,\ndata were collected during\
    \ summer and winter months and include irrigation events that\nare long in duration\
    \ with high probability for overlapping [17]. On average, after applying\na splitting\
    \ procedure that we designed to disaggregate overlapping events, each identiﬁed\n\
    overlapping event produced 4.4 single events. Again, the large number of single\
    \ events per\noverlapping event largely resulted from long duration irrigation\
    \ events. The large volume\ncomprised of overlapping events makes their disaggregation\
    \ and classiﬁcation essential in\norder to provide an accurate picture of residential\

    \ events increases during these\nmonths. The pulse data shown in Figure 10 are\

    \ \nSection 3.3 demonstrates how pulse data can facilitate individual event classification.\
    \ \nHowever, overlapping events typically require additional processing as the\

    \ In our analysis of 4 s data collected at 31 resi-\ndential properties [21],\
    \ we found that approximately 10% of all the events identified were \noverlapping\
    \ events, and they represented approximately 40% of the volume recorded. \nHowever,\
    \ data were collected during summer and winter months and include irrigation \n\
    events that are long in duration with high probability for overlapping [17]. On\
    \ average, \nafter applying a splitting procedure that we designed to disaggregate\
    \ overlapping events, \neach identified overlapping event produced 4.4 single\
    \ events. Again, the large number of \nsingle events per overlapping event largely\
    \ resulted from long duration irrigation events. \nThe large volume comprised\
    \ of overlapping events makes their disaggregation and clas-\nsification essential\

    \ (1 to 10) shows a different event.\n3.5. Data Volumes\nCollecting data at higher\
    \ temporal resolutions has several data management implica-\ntions related to\
    \ the data volume generated [7]. These result from general needs to record\n(e.g.,\
    \ locally on a datalogger), transmit (e.g., over a telemetry network), store and\
    \ organize\n(e.g., in a database), manage, and analyze the data for potentially\
    \ many sites. Commonly,\nhigh temporal resolution data consist of two recorded\
    \ variables, a date/time stamp identi-\nfying the data aggregation interval and\
    \ the number of pulses and/or volume of water that\nhas passed through the meter\
    \ during that interval. Given the high temporal resolution of\nthe data, the volume\
    \ of generated data can grow quickly. One strategy for reducing the\nvolume of\
    \ data generated is to record only non-zero values. Another strategy is to record\
    \ a\nWater 2022, 14, 2457\n15 of 18\nbeginning date/time and then record only\
    \ water usage without time stamps (assuming\nthat the data are regularly spaced).\
    \ The pulse data we collected consist only of numeric\nvalues for the time since\
    \ the last pulse, which is similar to the second option. The pulse\ndata are dense\
    \ during times when water use is occurring, but no values are recorded when\n\
    ﬂow through the meter is zero.\n \nFigure 10 shows the flow rate of an overlapping\
    \ event composed of multiple single \nevents observed at Site 2 The oscillations\
    \ in flow rate observed at all temporal resolutions \nother than the pulse data\
    \ reinforce the need for applying filtering techniques to smooth \nthe flow trace\
    \ for time aggregated data prior to calculating event features. These oscilla-\n\
    tions are a result of the volumetric pulse resolution of the meter (i.e., only\
    \ a discrete num-\nber of pulses can be counted in any time interval) and the\
    \ data recording interval (i.e., \npulses are not always evenly spaced in time\
    \ at a factor of the temporal resolution). The \noscillations are largest for\
    \ 1 s data and decrease for 10 s data by sacrificing flow trace \ndetails. Filtering\
    \ can be used to address these oscillations but may remove the ability to \nobserve\
    \ low flow rate events overlapping other end uses and may also mask features re-\n\
    lated to the original shape of the event that are important for fixture level\
    \ classification. \n \nFigure 10. Pulse data and time aggregated data converted\

    \ 1) will be larger during summer\nmonths (or times of higher water use), as ﬁle\
    \ sizes will increase as water use does. Pulse\ndata preserves more detail about\
    \ events and generates equal or lesser volumes of data when\ncompared with temporal\
    \ resolutions that would allow end-use classiﬁcation. Recording\ndata with full\
    \ pulse resolution does not increase the data volume generated when compared\n\
    with time-aggregated data up to a 10 s temporal resolution.\n4. Conclusions\n\
    In this paper, we presented analyses and comparison of residential water use data\n\
    at different temporal resolutions in comparison to full pulse resolution data\
    \ collected\nusing a specialized datalogger. To answer our ﬁrst research question\
    \ about how the\ntemporal aggregation interval of recorded data affects ability\
    \ to identify, classify, and\ncalculate attributes or features of individual events,\
    \ we demonstrated that as data temporal\nresolution decreases, the number of detected\
    \ end-use events decreases. We also showed\nhow estimates of event features and\
    \ the shape of overlapping events were impacted with\ndecreasing temporal resolution\
    \ (e.g., as data temporal resolution decreases, estimated event\nduration increases\
    \ and average ﬂowrate decreases). Our results show that temporally\naggregating\
    \ pulse data reduces ability to accurately estimate event features and generates\n\
    oscillations in the data that require ﬁltering techniques to remedy. However,\
    \ those same\nﬁltering techniques can remove or mask important event features\
    \ that could be used for\nevent classiﬁcation.\nRegarding the volume of data generated,\
    \ the ﬁnal component of our ﬁrst research\nquestion, pulse data captured a larger,\
    \ and more accurate, number of events at each of the\nsites without negatively\
    \ impacting the volume of data generated when compared to time\naggregated data\
    \ collected at temporal resolutions most suitable for end-use identiﬁcation,\n\
    disaggregation, and classiﬁcation (i.e., up to 10 s resolution). Additionally,\
    \ when over-\nlapping events occur, time aggregation of the data can mask the\
    \ features of such events,\nwhereas pulse data provide a much cleaner trace that\
    \ would better facilitate disaggregating\noverlapping events.\nWe observed that\
    \ the values of features calculated for events changed as the tem-\nporal resolution\
    \ decreased, which will negatively impact any classiﬁcation algorithm or\nmethodology\
    \ that uses those features. Key event features, such as the mode ﬂow rate, the\n\
    average ﬂow rate, and the duration vary as the temporal resolution decreases leading\
    \ to\nmore overlap in the distributions of these values and less power in using\
    \ these features\nto discriminate event types (e.g., for classiﬁcation). These\
    \ variations in the number of\nidentiﬁed events and their features have implications\
    \ on the accuracy of any analyses based\non frequency or event features. For example,\
    \ estimates of the technical performance of\nWater 2022, 14, 2457\n17 of 18\n\
    water using ﬁxtures are impacted by data temporal resolution and would best be\
    \ done\nusing pulse data.\nRegarding our second research question, the pulse spacing\
    \ values within events\nprovide unique features that could be used to more accurately\
    \ identify and classify end-use\nevents. In our controlled experiment, events\
    \ of different types exhibited unique behavior\nat the beginning and end of events,\
    \ and the median pulse spacing for events of different\ntypes shows great promise\
    \ as a discriminating feature for classiﬁcation purposes. These\nresults also\
    \ argue for using meters with higher pulse resolution (i.e., smaller volume per\n\
    pulse), which would provide greater detail in the trace of individual events and\
    \ reduce\nthe likelihood of “zero-pulse” events (i.e., events having volume smaller\
    \ than the pulse\nresolution of the meter) that are registered as part of the\
    \ subsequent event. While it may not\nbe practical to replace existing meters\
    \ for this reason, and in some cases may be impossible\ngiven requirements for\
    \ safe and accurate meter operation at higher ﬂowrates (e.g., those\nseen at homes\
    \ with automated irrigation systems), the pulse resolution of the meter may be\n\
    an important consideration when installing new or in retroﬁtting existing meter\
    \ networks.\nWhile we evaluated data from only two single family residential properties,\
    \ the\ndata were similar for both newer, single-lever-type ﬁxtures and older dual-knob-type\n\
    ﬁxtures, indicating that the uniqueness of event features from different water\
    \ use ﬁxtures\nwe observed in the pulse data (e.g., ﬂow rate, pulse spacing, event\
    \ shape, and unique\nbehavior at the beginning and ending of events) will exist\
    \ across water using ﬁxtures at\nany property. Thus, collecting pulse data could\
    \ provide generalized capability to not only\nprovide temporally aggregated data\
    \ for any existing operational purposes (e.g., regular\nbilling) but can also\
    \ provide more detailed information and discriminating event features\nfor use\
    \ in end-use studies. More discriminating features could, in turn, make end-use\n\
    disaggregation and classiﬁcation algorithms simpler and more computationally efﬁcient.\n\
    This could change smart metering technology by enabling more efﬁcient computation\n\
    of end-use information directly on the meter using edge computing techniques such\
    \ as\nthose demonstrated by Attallah et al. [5]. This would open the door for\
    \ more real-time\napplications of the data, including customer feedback portals,\
    \ in-home displays, and leak\ndetection and alerting.\nThe beneﬁts of pulse data\
    \ are clearly illustrated here and warrant consideration in\nfuture data collection\
    \ efforts. While differences in the volumetric pulse resolutions of\ndifferent\
    \ meter brands, models, and sizes will still exist, collecting full pulse resolution\n\
    data would eliminate differences among data collected with different temporal\
    \ resolutions,\nleading to greater standardization of data collection and analysis\
    \ methods. Full pulse\nresolution data were superior in clearly identifying a\
    \ larger number of end-use events, they\ncontributed to more accurate and less\
    \ ambiguous calculation of event features, they reduce\nor eliminate the need\
    \ for data ﬁltering prior to calculating event features, they more clearly\ncapture\
    \ the complexity of overlapping events, and they provide new event features that\
    \ are\nhighly discriminatory among events of different types—all without increasing\
    \ the volume\nof data that have to be recorded, transmitted, stored, and analyzed.\
    \ These beneﬁts bring\nopportunities for smart-metering manufacturers to adopt\
    \ similar data collection strategies\nwhich can lead to better information about\
    \ water use, faster analytics, and more accurate\nuser feedback.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Abstract

    Over the past few decades, research on the Internet of Things (IoT) has advanced
    quickly thanks to recent

    advancements in wireless communication technologies. IoT is evolving into a large-scale,
    all-

    encompassing network that will be extensively used in environmental monitoring,
    agriculture, and other

    ¦elds. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) serve as the IoT systems'' primary monitoring
    infrastructure.

    WSNs could be used to monitor the conditions in an agricultural ¦eld, including
    temperature, humidity,

    light, carbon dioxide, soil moisture, and acidity. These factors have a crucial
    role in the development,

    excellence, and yield of crops. In order to gather crucial data, numerous sensor
    devices are placed in

    agricultural land. The ability of sensor nodes to conserve energy is thought to
    be crucial for extending the

    lifespan of WSNs. Innovative, effective, and cost-effective solutions should be
    devised to provide

    reasonable energy consumption and maximize the lifespan of WSNs for agricultural.
    In routing

    operations, clustering is recognized as a well-known strategy. In this paper,
    a novel energy-e¨cient

    approach based on genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic is suggested to increase
    network lifetime. The

    proposed technique use an integrated clustering structure to reduce the distances
    between sensor nodes

    where data must be transmitted. The results of OPNET''s simulations showed that
    the suggested system

    performs better than the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in terms of energy usage and WSN
    lifetime.

    1. Introduction

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that has been creatively combining
    sensing,

    communication, and the Internet in recent years [1]. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    has started to play a

    signi¦cant role in daily life, expanding our perceptions and enabling us to change
    our surroundings.

    Agriculture, environmental monitoring, home automation, industrial automation,
    and transportation

    systems are just a few of the many applications that IoT is still being used for
    [2]. IoTs are especially

    used in the agro-industrial and environmental industries for both control and
    diagnostic purposes.

    Additionally, it can inform the consumer about the product''s history and characteristics
    [3]. The IoT''s

    primary physical monitoring infrastructure is comprised on wireless sensor networks
    (WSN). WSN is a

    popular choice and is utilized in precision agriculture for farmland monitoring
    in the new IoT era. WSNs

    hold great promise for application programs that need the collection of data from
    sensor nodes in far-

    §ung, inhospitable areas.

    In order to gather crucial data including temperature, humidity, light, carbon
    dioxide, soil moisture, and

    acidity, a variety of sensor devices are placed in agricultural land. The agriculture
    farm house contains

    these sensor nodes, which are placed manually or at random. They gather meteorological
    data and

    transmit it to the gateway node. The user or agriculture professional will then
    receive this data over the

    public channel from the gateway node. The farmer makes a decision and takes the
    necessary action with

    regard to the agricultural farmhouse based on the environmental information they
    have obtained [4].

    New di¨culties have arisen as a result of the data volume, resource constraints,
    and scattered nature of

    wireless receiving networks. The paradigm of data transfers in application programs
    should guarantee

    Page 3/32

    energy e¨ciency because communicating with a sensor node is frequently expensive.
    Clustering sensor

    nodes is a noteworthy energy-saving method [5, 6]. As part of the clustering process,
    sensor nodes are

    grouped together into various clusters, each of which has a coordinator known
    as the cluster head and

    other nodes known as the cluster members. There should only be one cluster for
    each sensor node. Data

    is sent from sensor nodes to the relevant cluster heads. The data are then gathered
    by the cluster heads

    and sent through one-hop or multiple-hop communications to a base station, or
    sink. The cluster-based

    data routing to the base station is depicted in Fig. 1. Every cluster has a single
    node designated as CH.

    CH is in charge of gathering information from the cluster''s nodes. After that,
    it compiles all of the data

    into a single data packet and sends it to the base station or sink.

    IoTs were used in farming to increase crop yields, enhance crop quality, and cut
    expenses. WSNs are the

    primary monitoring infrastructure for IoT installations. Energy consumption and
    network lifetime, which

    are common concerns for almost any WSN application, are the main constraints of
    WSNs in IoT

    networks. Node placement, network overage, clustering, data aggregation, and routing
    are typically

    included in the operational stages of WSNs [7]. Energy saving is regarded as a
    major feature of sensor

    nodes for enhancing the lifetime of WSNs. To resolve this issue, clustering models
    are used to provide

    reasonable energy consumption and optimizing the lifetime of WSNs [8].

    In this research, we concentrated on one of these IoT applications, precision
    agriculture, and suggested a

    brand-new clustering-based energy-aware routing algorithm for WSNs. All of the
    sensor nodes have been

    grouped into distinct clusters using this technique. All sensor nodes are taken
    into account for choosing

    cluster heads based on the energy level and workload they can handle using genetic
    algorithms and

    fuzzy logic. Nodes join the cluster head using their distances from the cluster
    head in order to create

    clusters. All of the cluster heads have created a sink as the root of the directed
    virtual backbone (DVB),

    which helps with routing. By navigating and directing data packets to the next
    cluster head hop, each

    cluster head balances its own energy consumption throughout data routing.

    2. Related works

    Installing a WSN in the ¦eld has increased the effectiveness and e¨ciency of the
    farmers in optimizing

    agriculture [9]. It can be used to assess ¦eld variables like soil quality, weather,
    and plant biomass.

    Additionally, it can be used to monitor and manage factors like temperature, humidity,
    vibrations, and

    shocks while a product is being transported [10]. It is impractical to replace
    sensor node batteries after

    they have totally discharged in a large-scale WSN. Therefore, lowering these nodes''
    energy consumption

    is essential to lengthening network lifetime [11]. An approach that is frequently
    used to help sensor nodes

    save energy is clustering. Numerous clustering algorithms exist to reduce energy
    consumption in WSNs.

    [12] presented a clustering structure based on cellular topology. Additionally,
    a framework called a time

    gap was used to specify how plans should be carried out so that nodes within a
    cluster can transmit data

    to one another without any issues. There were numerous dynamic factors at work,
    not just energy. Each

    cluster''s cluster head is a dynamic factor, it''s true. This cluster head is
    aware of the energy of all the

    nodes within its cluster. A node enters the off state when there is no data to
    be broadcast. Because

    Page 4/32

    mobile factors are expensive, cellular technology was used, and each mobile factor
    probes multiple

    clusters.

    In [13], a routing technique with dynamic structure and static clustering was
    suggested. The proper

    method of cluster formation, which aids in the most e¨cient use of energy, was
    discussed in this study.

    Each node in this method provides the sink with information about its location
    via a low-cost GPS device;

    as a result, the sink assumes that node to be a member of one of the assumed clusters
    based on the

    position and location of the virtual point. The message containing the coordinates
    and remaining energy

    of the source node is sent to other cluster heads during the route identi¦cation
    phase. Each cluster head

    checks its distance from the transmitting cluster head as soon as it receives
    the message to determine

    whether it is closer to the sending cluster head or the transmitting cluster head
    is closer to the sink. The

    routing is done in this manner, and the relay node is chosen. In order to study
    the communication among

    sensor nodes on a §at level, a new protocol called VIBE was proposed in [14].
    A work session will start

    once a sensor node has data to send to the sink. To cut down on hop counts and
    routing time for data

    transmission, clustering was incorporated into this algorithm. As a result, a
    two-level communication was

    established where the nodes can choose to join a cluster or remain as a single
    member. In [15], a tree-

    based method was presented that was created speci¦cally for sensor networks. Each
    sensor node in this

    algorithm has some knowledge of the sink and the other sensor nodes. Information
    is communicated

    between all nodes after the tree has been formed. The nearest node receives information
    on the sink''s

    position and movement, which is also shared by the other nodes. The goal of this
    technique was to build

    all the spanning trees necessary to identify the ideal solution space. Within
    each cluster, an effective

    method for choosing the cluster head was put forth in [16]. Cluster heads are
    chosen at random in order

    for this strategy to operate. Normal nodes send a join message to request membership.
    They also send

    the cluster head how much energy they still have. The temporary cluster head then
    acquires the network''s

    remaining energy based on the nodes'' remaining energy. The node with the most
    energy is chosen as the

    cluster head if the network''s remaining energy is more than x%. Otherwise, the
    new cluster head will be

    chosen from among the nodes with the most neighbours. The new cluster head then
    noti¦es the nodes

    that it is the cluster head through an ack message. In [17], an unbalanced clustering
    protocol based on

    ant colony optimisation and fuzzy logic, as well as routing and interlayer combined
    ANC, were presented

    for WSNs. Multiple nodes of this algorithm, known as FAMACROW, transmit the sensed
    data from the

    environment to the base station. For choosing the cluster head, it makes use of
    fuzzy logic and variables

    like the amount of energy left, the number of nearby nodes, and the calibre of
    the communication link.

    This approach uses unbalanced clustering, in which clusters closer to the base
    station are smaller than

    clusters farther away, to avoid the hot spot issue. ASLPR, a routing protocol
    that optimised energy usage

    and was created for certain applications, was proposed in [18]. This method considers
    the following

    factors for choosing the best cluster head: the distance from the base station,
    the remaining energy, and

    the distance between the cluster heads. Although complex, this routing protocol
    has some variables that

    can be changed. For the purpose of resolving the aforementioned problems, a unique
    lightweight energy-

    aware clustering method for WSNs was developed in [19]. They concentrated on clustering
    sensor nodes

    as a means for extending the lifetime of WSNs. We also reduced energy consumption
    by grouping sensor

    Page 5/32

    nodes into clusters using the LPO algorithm. This algorithm chooses the best nodes
    as the cluster heads

    based on two factors: battery power level and distance from the sink. The suggested
    approach improved

    network longevity while reducing average delay, input packet, and power usage.

    In [20], a TOPSIS-based energy-e¨cient clustering technique for WSNs that may
    group network nodes

    according to their energy levels was presented. Using the factors of energy level,
    neighbourhood, distance

    to the washbasin, and conducted workload, this protocol creates clusters with
    balanced energy. An

    energy-e¨cient approach based on fuzzy logic and reinforcement learning for increasing
    network lifetime

    in IoT was described in [21]. Based on the remaining energies of the nodes on
    the routes, the available

    bandwidth, and the distance to the sink, fuzzy logic and reinforcement learning
    are developed. In terms of

    network lifetime, the simulations of this method conducted by OPNET showed that
    it outperformed fuzzy

    logic and IEEE802.15.4. A plan based on the partnership of an integrated system
    for automated irrigation

    management in agriculture and the advantageous novel routing protocol for Wireless
    Sensor Networks

    (WSNs), called ECHERP, was introduced in [22]. The suggested system''s primary
    goal is the automated,

    effective management of water delivery in planted ¦elds. The technology uses previous
    data and

    changes in climate parameters to determine how much water is required for irrigation.
    More frequent data

    collection is suggested to reduce the requirement for water in situations where
    the change in the values

    gathered has exceeded a threshold. In contrast, the time interval for data collection
    can be extended to

    preserve sensor energy and extend sensor lifetime when the change in readings
    is below a predetermined

    threshold. The algorithm''s simulations demonstrate how ECHERP increased network
    longevity. A low-cost

    WSN-based server system for monitoring the agricultural environment was released
    in [23]. In this study, a

    UAV is used to quickly travel great distances while retrieving data from ground
    nodes. The UAV can also

    be utilised to carry out tasks and gather extra data. Its lofty elevation enables
    ¦eld observation from a

    vantage point that is important for seeing changes that may impact crops, such
    as pests, diseases,

    substantial changes in soil moisture, droughts, or §oods. According to the energy
    level of the network

    nodes and their distance from the sink, a mobile sink and bacterial foraging algorithm-based
    clustering

    method for wireless sensor networks was suggested in [24]. To communicate with
    the sink, nodes use a

    multi-step routing method within the network. The mobile sink is also utilised
    to balance the load and

    contribute to network-wide energy consumption that is consistent. The proposed
    solution outperforms

    AFSRP (Arti¦cial Fish Swarm Routing Protocol) according to simulation results.

    In order to maximise network longevity and scalability by taking into consideration
    effective parameters

    for picking the cluster head and parent node, the leaping frog method is utilised
    in the study [25] in WSN

    networks. Based on the fuzzy output, energy threshold (i.e., a control parameter),
    the overlap rate of

    nearby CHs, and the candidate nodes, the CH is selected from the list of nodes.
    The number of CHs in the

    network is determined before the parent selection step of the proposed protocol
    begins. Based on the

    application''s maximum fuzzy output, the parents of each CH are identi¦ed at the
    end of this step. In a

    stable phase, the CHs'' information is ¦nally forwarded to the BS by their parents.
    The outcomes of the

    simulation demonstrate the energy e¨ciency of the suggested approach, which controls
    node energy

    consumption utilising frog jump, the Fuzzy Inference System rule table, and ¦ve
    control parameters. A

    drawback of this approach is the high processing cost of the leaping frog algorithm
    and fuzzy logic. For

    Page 6/32

    data transfer in a heterogeneous sensor environment, a dependable routing strategy
    based on new delay

    energy is suggested in the work [26]. The suggested technique achieves a good
    balance between energy

    consumption and end-to-end latency by picking the next node with the least amount
    of energy during the

    long-distance data transfer phase and supplying a proper load balance in the network.
    This approach

    decreases end-to-end delivery delays, addresses the hotspot issue in mobile hierarchical
    routing

    protocols, and minimises grid energy usage. Additionally, by choosing multiple
    agent nodes and

    gathering data during the data transfer phase, it increases the percentage of
    data packets that are

    successfully received in the sink.

    In the paper [27], which addresses the issue of energy e¨ciency in wireless sensor
    networks, the arti¦cial

    ¦sh swarm optimisation technique (AFSA) for clustering WSNs is proposed. This
    approach, which is

    based on the social behaviour of ¦sh, solves optimisation issues because of its
    rapid convergence, lack

    of sensitivity to arti¦cial ¦sh beginning values, adaptability, and mistake tolerance.
    The suggested

    protocol was examined using the OPNET 11.5 simulator and contrasted with the ERA
    protocol. The

    outcomes of the simulation demonstrated that the proposed protocol performed better
    than the ERA

    protocol and might lengthen network lifetime. In order to slow the degradation
    of IoT device reliability and

    increase network Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), paper [28] suggested an adaptive
    and distributed

    reliability-aware routing protocol based on reinforcement learning. This approach
    uses a communication

    line to cut down on tra¨c and high-quality, stable links to cut down on retransmissions.
    Metrics for

    predicted transmission count and reliability are included in the reinforcement
    learning formulation. The

    routing policy gains knowledge from earlier routing choices at runtime. The suggested
    approach can

    make IoT networks last longer and offers a routing strategy that speci¦cally solves
    the reliability

    degradation issue. When compared to AODV, AODV-ETX, and Q-AODV methods in this
    paper, the authors

    showed improved network MTTF by extending the AODV protocol with a Q-learning
    algorithm. The

    ¦ndings indicate improved dependability for different transmission data rates.

    The research [29] makes the suggestion of an enhanced multi attribute-based attack
    resistance (EMBTR)

    algorithm to carry out the routing process safely based on the trusted values
    of nodes. A node''s

    trustworthiness is assessed using the suggested model based on the reliable value
    obtained for each

    node in the network. The suggested approach maintains a speci¦c threshold value
    at each node to

    protect the network environment. By using QoS factors like stability rate, dependability
    rate, and elapsed

    duration, this technique creates secure routing. The stability rate of each node
    is assessed to identify

    which nodes will participate in the routing process in order to achieve secure
    routing. Each

    communication node''s reliability rate is examined to assess its dependability,
    and the best path is

    selected from among all feasible short cuts based on the amount of time that has
    passed. The

    simulation results demonstrate that the suggested strategy achieves a high detection
    rate for malicious

    nodes in the network while also enhancing network performance in terms of energy,
    computing time, and

    throughput.

    In this research, we suggested a fuzzy logic- and genetic-based clustering technique.
    The following

    discussion will cover this approach, which was designed to cluster in sensor networks.
    The IEEE 802.15.4

    Page 7/32

    scenario, which has recently been utilised as a communication standard for low-power,
    inexpensive, and

    low-rate WSNs, was simulated and used to test the suggested technique. IEEE 802.15.4
    is widely

    applicable for a variety of applications. It is quite adaptable, and its parameters
    can be changed. This

    protocol can allow real-time applications by utilising Guaranteed Time Slot (GTS).
    In fact, this capability

    is suitable for time-sensitive WSN applications.

    3. The proposed method

    3.1. Cluster formation phase

    It should be mentioned that integrated algorithms in WSNs help the network use
    optimisation techniques,

    and the parameters of these algorithms can be changed adaptively while they are
    running. As a result, it

    was considered that the base station is where the cluster head determination activities
    take place in this

    study. As a powerful processor with limitless energy, the base station or sink
    can classify and arrange the

    network nodes within balanced clusters in terms of the total energy consumed and
    the volume of

    performed workload using genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic after receiving information
    about the

    position and energy of the network nodes. The goal is to spread the network''s
    structure, which is made up

    of a number of nodes and cluster heads, in a way that reduces overall energy usage.

    3.2. Permanent-state phase

    TDMA scheduling is used by the nodes to identify the cluster heads and send data
    to associated cluster

    heads when clusters have formed. The cluster heads produce this scheduling plan,
    which is then sent to

    the nodes. A round is one execution of the cluster formation phase and the permanent
    state. Clustering

    activities are repeated at the conclusion of each round, and fresh nodes are chosen
    to serve as the cluster

    head. The proposed algorithm''s speci¦cs are shown below.

    As previously noted, it was presumpted that the base station or the washbasin
    would house all clustering

    processes. The network as a whole is then informed of its outcome. The programme
    at the base station

    is given an advance count of the necessary cluster heads. In other words, the
    length of the chromosome

    is calculated. Each gene on this chromosome serves as the identi¦cation number
    for a number of

    network nodes whose energies are higher than the network''s average and who have
    also only sent sparse

    amounts of data. The base station is aware of the energy level of every network
    node, which is

    signi¦cant. The amount of data transmitted and the network''s average energy can
    thus be measured

    using fuzzy logic. Eq. (1) de¦nes the chromosome''s structure as follows:

    Chrom = {gi│ i = 1,2,...,L} (1)

    where L denotes the length of chromosome and gi refers to the ith gene of the
    chromosome. For each

    chromosome in this study, actual and continuous coding was applied. As a result,
    Eq. (2) can be used to

    de¦ne the space of genes:

    Page 8/32

    Gi = RE*D*ID; ID = 1,2,… ,30 (2)

    Where ID stands for the identity of the sensor node, RE for the node''s remaining
    energy, and D for the

    volume of data that the node has processed. The algorithm runs through the following
    stages:

    Where ID stands for the identity of the sensor node, RE for the node''s remaining
    energy, and D for the

    volume of data that the node has processed. The algorithm runs through the following
    stages:

    1. Random generation of the initial population: In this phase, a population of
    N chromosomes with the

    same number of genes as cluster heads is generated at random. Figure (2) shows
    a chromosomal

    image that includes genes with the ID of sensor nodes. The cluster head is chosen
    at random by this

    chromosome from among network nodes with the IDs of 2, 5, 15, 19, and 26, as seen
    in the image.

    Five of the chromosome''s nodes are randomly chosen to serve as the genes since
    we wish to have

    ¦ve cluster heads.

    2. Setting fuzzy membership function: Fuzzy logic, as it is described below, was
    utilised to de¦ne the

    ¦tness value of genes.

    Cluster heads were chosen based on the two parameters of the battery''s remaining
    capacity and the

    workload. These two standards serve as the fuzzy input for the fuzzy system. The
    degree of ¦tness of

    genes is assessed using the fuzzy logic process to choose cluster heads in the
    sensor network. As seen in

    ¦gure (3), this mechanism functions as an adaptive fuzzy controller.

    There are three primary steps in applying fuzzy control to this system, as indicated
    in ¦gure (3). Real

    inputs were transformed into the proper fuzzy sets for use by the inference engine
    during the fuzzi¦cation

    stage. The amount of workload being completed and the battery power of the node
    are two

    characteristics that the suggested model considers to be the fuzzy system input.
    Three fuzzy sets are

    de¦ned for each of the input variables (H stands for the high limit, M for the
    medium limit, and L for the

    low limit), and these are shown in ¦gures (4) and (5). Because trapezoidal membership
    functions are

    precise and accurate, we use them. Five fuzzy sets with triangular membership
    functions were employed

    to determine the output, or the degree of the node''s ¦tness (where VH stands
    for very high limit, H for high

    limit, M for middle limit, L for low limit, and VL for very low limit).

    The load density and battery energy level of the node''s battery are the characteristics
    that are taken into

    consideration at the fuzzy inference engine stage, where fuzzy rules are utilised
    to measure the ¦tness

    value of genes. Each fuzzy rule includes two parts: an introduction that begins
    with the statement "if load

    density is low and the energy level of the node''s battery is high" and a conclusion
    that states "then, the

    degree of ¦tness allocated to the gene will be very high." The fuzzy inference
    engine was regarded as

    Mamdani minimum in the suggested approach. 

    Three fuzzy sets are de¦ned for each of the two input parameters, yielding the
    9 fuzzy rules shown in

    table (1):

    The defuzzi¦cation stage is used to convert fuzzy output into a numerical value
    once the mean of the

    centres has been defuzzed. Equation (3) is used to quantify this. 

    The parameters of this equation are the following: I indicates the index of the
    route; m denotes the

    number of fuzzy rules (here, it is 9); and n refers to the number of membership
    functions of the input

    variables (here, it is 2).  indicates the fuzzy value of membership functions
    and refers to the output

    centers. 

    4. Using the ¦tness function to assess the quality of responses: Equation (3)
    is used to assess the

    ¦tness of each gene present on a chromosome in the genetic population. 

    5. Choosing parents based on their traits: 40% of the chromosomes with the highest
    ¦tness are chosen

    to generate a new population (a chromosome''s ¦tness is equal to the average ¦tness
    of its

    accessible genes). Then, the subsequent actions are taken to ¦nish the new population.

    ½. Crossover operation: The parent chromosome pair is chopped in a crisscross
    pattern from the

    created point using a random number that falls within the range of the chromosome
    length (0 to 5).

    The ¦rst portion of the cut point is chosen from the ¦rst parent, and the second
    portion is chosen

    from the second parent, as shown in ¦gure (7). The kids are born in this manner.
     

    Page 10/32

    7. Mutation operation: With a 0.8 chance, the mutation operation is completed;
    thus, a random value

    between [0] and [1] is generated. The mutation operation will be executed if the
    resulting value is

    more than or equal to 0.8, otherwise it won''t. If not, the mutation is not carried
    out. Two random

    integers between 0 and 5 chromosomal lengths are generated and used as the array
    index to the

    chromosome in order to perform the mutation procedure. The two generated random
    values are used

    to replace the placements of the two cells. The third and ¦fth cells'' values
    are changed, as seen in

    ¦gure (8).

    ¾. Replacing a new generation with  the old generation: in this stage, the new
    children are placed in a

    new population. 

    9. Investigating the termination condition of the algorithm: The algorithm will
    end and return the best

    solution in the current population if the ¦nal condition is satis¦ed, or if it
    is the 100th round of

    execution (the 100th round of algorithm execution was treated as the termination
    condition). If the

    termination condition is not satis¦ed, it will proceed to the stage measuring
    the quality of the reply

    using the ¦tness function, and the stages above will be repeated. 

    Once the cluster heads have been identi¦ed, they send an advertisement message
    to anyone nearby. Each

    normal node chooses the closest cluster head based on its proximity to the cluster
    heads as soon as it

    receives this message. It then sends the cluster head the join message and the
    amount of energy it has

    left. Clusters are created in this manner by choosing cluster members.

    4.3. Simulation environment 

    We used the simulation programme OpnetModeler version 11.5 [30] in this paper
    to model the suggested

    technique and compare it to IEEE 802.15.4. In table (2), the simulation parameters
    are listed. The

    suggested method took into account two scenarios and a network topology of 50
    nodes, as shown in

    ¦gure (10). The IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, a common and highly §exible protocol with
    a low data rate, low

    energy consumption, and cheap construction cost, was used in the ¦rst scenario
    to distribute sensor

    nodes in a WSN at random. Applications requiring real-time performance can use
    this protocol [31]. The

    proposed technology (a genetic algorithm and fuzzy logic) is applied to cluster
    the environment in the

    second scenario''s randomly distributed sensor nodes. For both instances, it was
    assumed that the

    topology was the same. Later in the study, the simulation results pertaining to
    these scenarios are

    discussed. A view of the node editor for the suggested scenarios is shown in Figure
    (11). The building

    blocks of a sensor node are depicted in this picture from a hardware standpoint.
    Additionally, ¦gure (12)

    displays the simulated model''s processing model for the MAC layer.

    Figure (13), which contrasts the network''s average energy usage for the scenarios
    using the proposed

    technique and the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, shows the results. In this diagram,
    the horizontal axis

    represents simulation time and the vertical axis represents energy consumption.
    Due to the fact that

    network sub-nodes do not operate intentionally and knowingly, it is anticipated
    that the IEEE 802.15.4

    protocol will consume the most energy. In other words, regardless of the nodes''
    energy state, they transfer

    the data they have collected to the sink node. However, the proposed method uses
    those nodes for data

    transmission that has high energy and low workload thanks to clustering through
    fuzzy logic and the

    genetic algorithm. Additionally, since member nodes join the cluster head based
    on how far away they are

    from it, data transmission from member nodes to the cluster head will consume
    very little energy.

    Additionally, ¦gure (14) compares the end-to-end delay scenarios for the proposed
    algorithm and those

    for IEEE 802.15.4. Because some network nodes may transmit some data but be unable
    to send the

    remaining data due to a lack of energy, we saw that end-to-end delay increased
    in the IEEE 802.15.4

    protocol scenario. Consequently, it might be unable to ¦nish data transmission.
    The end-to-end delay is

    reduced in the proposed protocol because cluster heads are chosen from nodes with
    greater energy and

    cluster members join the cluster head based on their distances.

    Moreover, the scenario comparison between the proposed algorithm and IEEE 802.15.4
    for the media-

    access delay is shown in the following ¦gure. It was observed that in the IEEE
    802.15.4 protocol scenario,

    the delay of multimedia ¦les grows; speci¦cally, in video transmission, congestion
    grows due to high data

    generation rate and the explosive characteristic in IEEE 802.15.4. However, the
    end-to-end delay is

    reduced in the proposed protocol because the cluster heads are chosen from the
    nodes with more energy.

    Additionally, the data packet error rate for the scenarios of the suggested algorithm
    and the scenarios of

    the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol are compared in the following ¦gure. The IEEE 802.15.4
    protocol was found to

    have a greater packet error rate than the suggested protocol; this is explained
    by the fact that the IEEE

    Page 12/32

    802.15.4 protocol''s information signal is noisy as a result of congestion. It
    is therefore received

    incorrectly. In contrast, the proposed protocol has a low packet error rate because
    it chooses secure and

    safe paths, including high-energy nodes. As a result, there is a higher chance
    that the data will reach the

    sink successfully.

    The throughput rate is shown in the following graph. The vertical axis represents
    the quantity of delivered

    packets over time (throughput), and the horizontal axis represents the simulation
    time.

    The number of successfully delivered packets to the sink in IEEE 802.15.4 is lower
    than those in the

    proposed protocol, as seen in this ¦gure because of congestion and the possible
    shutdown of nodes.

    However, the proposed protocol forms clusters by choosing high-energy nodes, and
    sustainable routes

    are found. As a result, it is ensured that the route will be viable at least until
    the end of the data

    transmission phase and that the nodes'' energies won''t run out quickly. As a
    result, the suggested protocol

    maintains a viable path throughout the data transmission phase. Therefore, compared
    to IEEE 802.15.4,

    more data packets are delivered to the sink node using the proposed method.

    The rate of packet loss is seen in the following graph. The vertical axis represents
    the packet loss rate,

    and the horizontal axis represents the simulation time. It should be mentioned
    that IEEE 802.15.4 uses

    low-energy nodes for sending energy; these nodes shut down when their energies
    are used up during data

    transmission. As a result, the proposed protocol has a lower packet loss rate
    than IEEE 802.15.4. Or, to

    put it another way, IEEE 802.15.4 is unable to send all of the data packets to
    the sink because it loses

    more of them.

    In addition, the signal to noise ratios for the IEEE 802.15.4 and the suggested
    protocol scenarios were

    contrasted, as shown in the accompanying image.

    The horizontal axis in this graph represents simulation time, and the vertical
    axis represents the signal to

    noise ratio. Importantly, IEEE 802.15.4 transmits data via unreliable routes,
    and the percentage of bits

    with errors increases over time. The signal to noise ratio falls as a result.
    The signal of data transmitted

    by IEEE 802.15.4 may also vanish as a result of tra¨c and confusion, which increases
    the likelihood of

    noise. The quality of transmitted data (text, data, or multimedia) suffers as
    a result.

    Comparing and contrasting the proposed method with IEEE 802.15.4 is shown in Table 3:

    5. Conclusion

    For extending the lifespan of WSNs, supplying suitable energy consumption, and
    optimising WSN lifetime

    for agriculture, energy saving is recognised as a crucial characteristic of sensor
    nodes. In order to cluster

    sensor networks, this research suggests a novel approach that combines fuzzy logic
    and genetic

    algorithms. The uniqueness of this research is the use of a revolutionary genetic
    algorithm-based

    method, along with fuzzy logic approaches, to choose a cluster head in the Internet
    of Things

    dynamically. As a result, choosing the cluster head and identifying the node with
    the highest energy are

    faster and more precise processes. However, we are able to achieve balanced clustering
    and thus

    lengthen network lifetime by employing a two-phase CH selection method with a
    fuzzy system identifying

    the best candidates and GA further selecting the best among them. The suggested
    approach distributes

    the expended energy among balanced clusters after being divided into them. The
    primary population

    gathers input data at random for the genetic algorithm, which is nature-inspired.
    Additionally, the genetic

    algorithm is a nonlinear optimisation technique that, because of its effectiveness
    in large-scale

    Page 14/32

    applications, is a relatively better choice. The ¦nal formula can also be changed
    by the operators. The

    ¦nal product, which is produced once the generating process is complete, provides
    the best ¦x for the

    primary issue. Crossover, scoring, selection, and mutation functions are generally
    included in all the

    advances brought about by the generation process. The process by which two distinct
    chromosomes

    marry to create a new generation is referred to as crossover. This function is
    productive and occurs at a

    certain rate. Here, one aspect of the many crossover techniques is emphasised.
    However, a genetic

    algorithm''s most crucial component is scoring or assigning ¦tness, which makes
    use of fuzzy logic. The

    literature has concentrated on developing an intelligent ¦tness function that
    uses fuzzy logic to

    distinguish amongst quali¦ed individuals. Using a mutation strategy that permits
    particular

    chromosomes to enter the new generation, the selection process adopts superior
    chromosomes in order

    to produce a new population. Due to the stochastic nature of the genetic algorithm,
    numerous solutions

    with differing performances are discovered in various iterations of the algorithm
    [26].

    The suggested method for WSNs was supplied and explored in great detail. In this
    study, the suggested

    protocol and IEEE 802.15.4 were simulated using OPNET software. We also looked
    into important service

    quality metrics for these two protocols, including throughput rate, energy consumption,
    delay, signal to

    noise ratio, and packet loss rate.

    The idea of "data transmission between nodes by clustering" is used in this research
    to choose the best

    nodes for transmitting data ¦les. As was mentioned above, the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol
    can be optimised

    for e¨ciency by applying genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic for clustering and
    choosing cluster heads.

    Due to a genetic algorithm used in the suggested protocol, which performs parallel
    processing and has a

    quick convergence rate, the learning rate is increased. The suggested protocol
    is also more likely to reach

    the global optimal point because of the rivalry for responses and the selection
    of the best nodes from the

    population. Fuzzy logic can also be used in imprecise environments due to its
    accuracy and precision,

    which enhances the performance precision of the ¦tness function of the genetic
    algorithm in choosing

    the best cluster heads based on the workload and remaining energy of the sensor
    nodes. In order to

    compare the e¨ciency of the proposed protocol and IEEE 802.15.4, the following
    parameters were

    simulated in OPNET11.5 and compared: multimedia delay, end-to-end delay, link
    reliability, signal-to-noise

    ratio, throughput rate, packet loss rate, packet error rate, and energy consumption.
    In general, it is possible

    to maintain that the proposed protocol performed better than IEEE 802.15.4. When
    compared to IEEE

    802.15.4, the proposed protocol could more effectively increase the e¨ciency of
    the entire network,

    packet delivery reliability, and network throughput rate because it chooses more
    energy-e¨cient routes.

    Fuzzy logic''s high processing costs and grouping based on genetic algorithms
    are two drawbacks of this

    approach. The reduction in processing costs for the fuzzy approach-based model
    depends on how many

    fuzzy rules are utilised in the resolution. A longer execution time is implied
    by an increase in this quantity

    since it broadens the scope of the solution exploration. Furthermore, careful
    selection of the GA

    parameters, which differ between systems, is required when using a genetic algorithm
    to reduce

    processing costs. As a result, it is challenging to decrease the processing time
    and execution time for the

    approaches given.
